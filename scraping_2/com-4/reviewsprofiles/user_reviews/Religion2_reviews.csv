Review
So far I have only read two days worth but I do think this is a book that is worth the buy. I have a not so great relationship with god and this is the happy medium to get me back on track.
Whether your single or engaged this is a great book. We should be preparing before we celebrate! This is a good lesson in keeping God first! Choose a spouse with the same goal!
"Although I have been married for many years this book aimed me straight to the heart of the foundations of any good relationship. Author Tamara Chamberlain writes in a common sense manner focusing first on the reader's personal relationship with Christ, and then leading them to the seek the personal growth that comes with a deepening Christian walk. This isn't a how-to make myself more desirable for the opposite sex pre-marital book, nor is it 90 ways to change oneself to prepare for marriage. It is a handbook of growth in Christ that leads to loving God and others in such a way that the daily life and interpersonal relationships of the reader  will be transformed. I found myself using the daily prayers as a guide to heartfelt conversation with God, as well as loving prayer for my spouse and others. I highly recommend this book for women of all ages who are  seeking relationships that reflect Christ."
"This 90 day devotional is very practical. Each day takes only a few minutes and can be easily fit into your morning or night time routine. The messages are strong, straight to the point and God centered. This book is highly recommended for any adult looking or continuing their journey with God. I was given an advanced review copy and cannot wait for the positive impact this will have on those who also get an opportunity to read it. üôÇ"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this devotional and would purchase it for those in a season of wanting to be married, engaged, or even recently married to their husbands. I found the format really accessible & helpful, lots of good questions for reflecting upon. There was scripture on every page, which is a must for me in a devotional! The topics do vary in content, which was refreshing because I‚Äôve stopped reading other devotionals over the years because the content starts to all sound too similar. This was a very edifying book and think others would benefit from it :)"
"As a wife of 33 years now I can attest to every word written in Prayers For Your Future Husband. Tamara has given each daily devotion biblical scripture with personal insight for you to reflect upon. You will find  Prayers For Your Future Husband to be a crisp, clear thought provoking daily devotional. I have no doubt that you will be blessed with a greater wisdom regarding husbands, marriage and Gods plan for them in your life after reading Prayers For Your Future Husband."
"Recently, some said that doing daily devotionals and prayers feeds your soul and is what God wants for us - to know His word.  My husband (we've been together for almost 30 years) and I really wanted to have God be a stronger presence in our crazy lives (we have 3 kids!).  This book is perfect for what little time we have and helps strengthen our marriage and love bonds even more, if it was even possible!  So grateful for these couple devotional books to help us."
"Tamara does a lovely job highlighting important Christian values to seek both in yourself and in a future spouse. Biblical and thoughtful, each devotion will help you center yourself on what is truly important while being prayerful about what may come in the future!"
"Whether you‚Äôre single or engaged, dating or married this book is for YOU. This devotional not only improved my walk with Christ but also my walk with my significant other. I would highly recommend buying this and if you have a husband/boyfriend buy the male‚Äôs version of it. My boyfriend and I did this devotional together and what we gained from it was so beautifully unexpected. I‚Äôm obsessed with this & so happy that I was able to grow from it"
"My favorite scholar is the American Jesuit Renaissance specialist and cultural historian Walter J. Ong (1912-2003; Ph.D. in English, Harvard University, 1955) of Saint Louis University (SLU), the Jesuit university in St. Louis, Missouri (USA).Over the years, I took five courses from Father Ong at SLU. Over the years, I have published extensively about his thought.Now, because Father Ong was a Jesuit priest, we may wonder what he might have thought of his younger charismatic Jesuit confrere Jorge Mario Bergoglio (born in 1936 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, of Italian immigrant parents). Approximately a decade after Father Ong‚Äôs death in 2003, Cardinal Bergoglio was elected the first Jesuit pope in the Roman Catholic Church, even though he had never completed the Ph.D. in theology that he had started years earlier.The most thorough account of the Italo-Argentine Father Bergoglio‚Äôs uncompleted doctoral dissertation on the Italo-German priest and Roman Catholic theologian Romano Guardini (1885-1968) can be found in Masimo Borghesi‚Äôs book The Mind of Pope Francis: Jorge Mario Bergoglio‚Äôs Intellectual Journey, translated by Barry Hudock (Liturgical Press Academic, 2018, esp. pages 101-141; orig. Italian ed., 2017).Now, in Father Ong‚Äôs first book Frontiers in American Catholicism: Essays on Ideology and Culture (Macmillan, 1957, page 9), he briefly discusses the German edition of Father Guardini‚Äôs 1950 book Das Ende der Neuzeit: ‚ÄúAt the surface of the American Catholic consciousness is a tremendously vital know-how, an ability to keep alive the message of Christ, to keep Christ present in the face of changes which are so far along the trajectory of history that we are assured by Romano Guardini in Das Ende der Neuzeit that the word ‚Äòmodern‚Äô no longer describes them. In so far as it is vital, American Catholicism is essentially adaptability, an adaptability keeping alive the spiritual, interior message of the Gospel in the present-day industrial world of mass culture, and possible only where the Church is face-to-face with this world in its concentrated American form.‚ÄùFor the record, Guardini‚Äôs 1950 book in German is available in English translation in the book The End of the Modern World, revised 1998 edition, translated by Joseph Theman and Herbert Burke; and Elinor C. Briefs (ISI Books, 1998).Now, Ong takes Guardini‚Äôs assurance that the end of the modern world that certain popes had railed against was so far advanced that the term modern no longer describes those historical terms. As a result, Ong does not rail against modernity, as certain popes and other Roman Catholics had.For an account of how American Catholic rallied around the railing of certain popes against modernity, see the lay American Catholic historian Philip Gleason‚Äôs book Contending with Modernity: [American] Catholic Higher Education in the Twentieth Century (Oxford University Press, 1995).Now, Pope Francis likes to have his cake and eat it too. Like certain popes before him, he likes to rail against modernity. However, in his new 2020 book Let Us Dream: The Path to a Better Future, in conversation with the English Catholic journalist Dr. Austen Ivereigh (Simon & Schuster), he, in effect, takes Guardini‚Äôs assurance that the end of the modern world is nigh, as he (Pope Francis) declares, ‚ÄúCoronavirus has accelerated a change of era that was already under way. By ‚Äòchange of ear‚Äô I mean not just that this is a time of change [at least from about 1950 onward], but that the categories and assumptions that we used before [1950?] to navigate our world are no longer effective‚Äù (page 54; also see 59). I call that having your cake and eating it too.Now, the English Catholic journalist Dr. Austen Ivereigh (born in 1966) is the author of two biographies of Pope Francis, both published in New York by Henry Holt:(1) The Great Reformer: Francis and the Making of a Radical Pope (2014);(2) Wounded Shepherd: Pope Francis and His Struggle to Convert the Catholic Church (2019).Now, Pope Francis‚Äô new 2020 book Let Us Dream: The Path to a Better Future is a remarkably lucid presentation of the pope‚Äôs thought in a readable English prose. Dr. Ivereigh deserves our thanks for his role in prompting the pope to discuss the matters of personal conversion that he addresses throughout the book: in the ‚ÄúPrologue‚Äù (pages 1-7), ‚ÄúPart One: A Time to See‚Äù (pages 9-43), ‚ÄúPart Two: A Time to Choose‚Äù (pages 49-94), ‚ÄúPart Three: A Time to Act‚Äù (pages 95-133), and the ‚ÄúEpilogue‚Äù (pages 135-140). We hear from Dr. Ivereigh in the ‚ÄúPostscript by Austen Ivereigh‚Äù (pages 141-144), and Dr. Ivereigh supplied the ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù (pages 145-149).The invitation to join Pope Francis in the main title of the book is based on his understanding of Isaiah 1:18-20, as he explains (page 4). Here is the American biblical translator Robert Alter‚Äôs translation of the passage:‚ÄúCome, pray, let us come to terms,the Lord said.‚ÄúIf your offenses be like scarlet,like snow shall they turn white.If they be red as dyed cloth,they shall become like pure wool.If you assent and listen,the land‚Äôs bounty shall you eat.But if you refuse and rebel,by the sword you shall be eaten,for the Lord‚Äôs mouth has spoken.‚ÄùIn my estimate, it is a bit of a stretch to go from ‚Äúlet us come to term‚Äù to Let Us Dream. But I guess we need to dream up some good ways to stop our manifold sinful ways, eh?The word ‚ÄúPath‚Äù in the subtitle of the book is singular because it refers to the threefold path of the discernment process for interested individual persons to undertake that Pope Francis discusses in the book‚Äôs three central parts: (1) A Time to See; (2) A Time to Choose; and (3) A Time to Act.Briefly, this threefold path of the discernment process is based on Jesuit spirituality, as Pope Francis understands it.Ong‚Äôs most relevant publication is his article ‚Äú‚ÄòA.M.D.G.‚Äô: Dedication or Directive?‚Äù in the now-defunct Jesuit-sponsored journal Review for Religious, volume 11, number 5 (September 15, 1952): pages 257-264 ‚Äì and also reprinted in volume 50, number 1 (1991): pages 35-42. The back issues of this journal are now available online.Also see Ong‚Äôs discussion of the Jesuit motto Ad majorem Dei gloriam (For the greater glory of god) in his book Hopkins, the Self, and God (University of Toronto Press, 1986, pages 78-81 and 87), the published version of Ong‚Äôs 1981 Alexander Lectures at the University of Toronto.Now, Pope Francis says, ‚ÄúWe are living a time of trial‚Äù (page 1) ‚Äì we are being put to the test by the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic. In the United States today, we are living with new records of Americans hospitalized with Covid-19 and of Americans who have died in a single day from Covid-19.Pope Francis also says, ‚ÄúIn the trials of life, you reveal your own heart: how solid it is, how merciful, how big or small. . . . When people‚Äôs hearts are tested, they become aware of what has held them down. They also feel the presence of the Lord, who is faithful, and responds to His people. The encounter that follows allows a new future to open up‚Äù (pages 1 and 2).Now, Pope Francis says, ‚ÄúWe are born, beloved creatures of our Creator, God of love, into a world that has lived long before us. We belong to God and to one another; we are part of creation. And from this understanding, grasped by the heart, must flow our love for each other, a love not earned or bought because all we are and have is unearned gift [i.e., from God]‚Äù (pages 13-14).But Pope Francis also says, ‚ÄúIndifference blocks the Spirit by closing us to the possibilities that God is waiting to offer us, possibilities that overflow our mental schemes and categories. Indifference doesn‚Äôt let you feel the motions of the spirit that this crisis [of Covid-19] must provoke in our hearts. It blocks the chance of discernment. The indifferent person is closed to the new things that God is offering us‚Äù (page 20).In addition, Pope Francis says, ‚ÄúWe can start to discern, to see new possibilities, at least in little things that surround us, or that we do each day. And then, as we commit to those little things, we start to imagine another way of living together, of serving our fellow beloved creatures. We can begin to dream of real change, change that is possible‚Äù (page 20).Now, Pope Francis characterizes three challenging experiences in his life as his three ‚ÄúCovids‚Äù (his quotation marks; pages 39-44). During one of those ‚ÄúCovids,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúit occurred to me to read all thirty-seven volumes of Ludwig Paster‚Äôs History of the Popes‚Äù (page 42) ‚Äì which undoubtedly helped prepare him for his future role as the pope.Now, Pope Francis also says, ‚ÄúWe must not let the current clarifying moment pass us by. Let it not be said in years to come, that in response to the coronavirus crisis we failed to act to restore the dignity of our peoples, to recover our memory and to remember our roots‚Äù (pages 99-100). Amen to that.In addition, Pope Francis says, ‚ÄúThe disruption of Covid has turned the tables, inviting us to stop, alter our routines and priorities, and to ask: What if the economic, the social, and the ecological challenges we face are really different faces of the same crisis? What if they have a common solution? Couldn‚Äôt it be that replacing the objective of [endless economic] growth with that of new ways of relating will allow for a different kind of economy [to emerge], one that meets the needs of all within the means of our planet?‚Äù (page 60).Pope Francis also says, ‚ÄúIf we are to come out of this crisis, we have to recover the knowledge that as a people [i.e., as children of God] we have a shared destination. The pandemic has reminded us that no one is saved alone. What ties us to each other is what we commonly call solidarity. Solidarity is more than acts of generosity, important as these are; it is the call to embrace the reality that we are bound by bonds of reciprocity. On this solid foundation we can build a better, different human future‚Äù (page 107).Indeed, the founding of the United Nations in 1945 and the 1948 Declaration of Human Rights are notable landmarks of the gradually emerging new political era that Pope Francis refers to as heralding what Guardini refers to as the end of the modern political world.Indeed, the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) in the Roman Catholic Church was also a landmark watershed for ‚Äúthe earlier ‚Äúcategories and assumptions that we [in the Church] used before.‚ÄùBefore Vatican II, Thomism had been ascendant in Roman Catholic philosophy and theology. But Vatican II downgraded the brilliant thought of St. Thomas Aquinas (c.1225-1274) a wee bit, thereby opening the way for Roman Catholics and others to rediscover Aquinas‚Äô creation spirituality.See, for example, the Episcopal priest Matthew Fox‚Äôs book Sheer Joy: [Four] Conversations with Thomas Aquinas on Creation Spirituality, 2nd ed. (Ixia Press/ Dover Publications, 2020).As part of Ong‚Äôs Jesuit formation, he studied Thomistic philosophy (in Latin) and Thomistic theology (in Latin), as did all Jesuits of his generation ‚Äì and as did Guardini and other Roman Catholic priests. But Ong described his mature thought from the early 1950s onward as phenomenological and personalist in cast.Now, in Ong‚Äôs mature thought from the early 1950s onward, he positively glories in working with what Pope Francis in his new 2020 book refers to as contradistinctions (e.g., pages 78-79). Ong most famously works with the contradistinction of orality and literacy ‚Äì for example, in his most widely translated book Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word (Methuen, 1982).But Pope Francis also says that he learned from Guardini to see contradistinctions as ‚Äúliving polarities,‚Äù ‚Äúalive and dynamic,‚Äù rather than necessarily contradictions.However, Pope Francis also says parenthetically, ‚Äú(Good and evil can never be a contraposition, because evil is not the counterpart of good but its negation.)‚Äù (page 79). But I have no idea why he enclosed this important statement in parentheses. In my estimate, he should have started a new paragraph with it and made it a one-sentence paragraph.To his credit, Pope Francis also explains how ‚Äúcompetition for dominance‚Äù can turn ‚Äúcontrapositions into contradictions‚Äù (page 98). To avoid falling into this trap, we need to learn how to live with various contrapositions ‚Äì which may, at times, admittedly seem like living with contradictions.But make no mistake about it, Pope Francis himself is striving to the best of his ability for dominance in the Roman Catholic thought-world ‚Äì and as a public intellectual on the world stage with people of good will.But Pope Francis‚Äô goal is to free himself from seeing his opponents as his enemies (page 76). He says, ‚ÄúOur main task, however, is not to disengage from polarization but to engage with conflict and disagreement in ways that prevent us from descending into polarization‚Äù (page 77).Not surprisingly, the pope calls out ‚Äúcancel‚Äù culture (pages 28, 29, and 76).But for further reading about how we might emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic from another public intellectual on the world stage, see the late Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks‚Äô second new 2020 book Morality: Restoring the Common Good in Divided Times (Basic books)."
"Regardless of your political or spiritual views, and although you may not agree with everything, this is such an important book to read today.  For such a short read, (about 3 hours) it is so content heavy. It is a book about truths, challenges and solutions. Touching on everything from politics to racism, immigration and the environment, he calls us to come together but allows the space for disagreement ‚ÄúSometimes walking together means continuing to endure the disagreements‚Äù. It gives hope...something we all need more of these days."
He‚Äôs a communist!
"This is a book of hope.  Pope Francis describes a better world that could emerge after the Pandemic.  He concentrates on the core Catholic Social Teaching principles of solidarity, the preferential option for the poor, and the right (and duty) of all to contribute to the common good.  To these core principles, the Holy Father adds his own emphases on the importance of dialogue and the necessity to get beyond the incendiary rhetoric of populist politics.  The Holy Father points to recent synods as a very helpful example of dialogue that can lead to consensus on controversial issues.  Pope Francis emphasizes that we need to focus on the example of Jesus in our politics and economics.  We must start by standing in solidarity with those at the periphery of society.  Indeed, the Holy Father states that the health of a society can be measured by how it treats those on the margins.  I want to emphasize--this is very important--that this book is not a compilation of impossible goals that humans can never achieve.  On the contrary, Pope Francis' blueprint for a just society and sane politics is well within our power to achieve; in fact, we have no choice but to embrace the Holy Father's vision of the future.  If we refuse to embrace the compassionate vision that Pope Francis offers us, we will emerge from the pandemic no wiser.  We need to learn from the current crisis, and Pope Francis has shown us the way.  Let's take it."
"Different backgrounds and events form people differently.  Thus Pope Francis is different from Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI.  His unique perspective is formed by the environment of an unstable Argentina of his previous years, the poverty of the people he served, and by the recent experience of the Coronavirus, which is a major background of this book.  John Paul and Benedict also have unique backgrounds that formed them through the fires of Nazism and Communism.I like popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI.  And I like Francis.  (In these contentious times, it is helpful to remember St. Ambrose's words:  ""Where Peter is, there is the Church."")  JP II was a world-class philosopher and Benedict a world-class theologian.  My sense is that Francis is a bit more ""mystical"" than his predecessors, likely stemming from his Ignatian formation and spirituality.  All three have their strengths and beauties. All three require that we ask the Holy Spirit to help us understand their words and writings.One reviewer of this book has stated simply, ""He's a communist.""  I really didn't find any indication in this work that Pope Francis is a communist!  I find his thought helpful, such as this:""The laissez-faire market-centered approach confuses ends and means.  Rather than being seen as a source of dignity, work becomes merely a means of production; profit turns into a goal rather than a means to achieving greater goods. From here we can end up subscribing to the tragically mistaken belief that whatever is good for the market is good for society"" (p. 109).  Pope Francis challenges these perspectives as he considers (for example) the common good which Catholic Social Teaching sees as an end of the economy.I had a solid minor in economics in college, trained in the spirit of Adam Smith and  and the neoclassical economics of Alfred Marshall.  As far as I recall, there was little or nothing about the common good in these economists, but much about profits, comparative advantage, etc.  Thus, we were left perplexed as we saw how free trade was undermining manufacturing in the United States and shipping jobs to places where wages were lower, leaving devastated industries and unemployed workers in the U.S.  We dismissed the impact on the worker, local economies, families, resting comfortably in the belief of classical economics that free trade and comparative advantage was the great equalizer and that all would be well in the end.  It wasn't.Pope Francis, in this book, helps the reader to see that there is a different way of understanding economics and workers, that looks to the benefit of all, not just the owners and shareholders.  To me, this is an important contribution of this book--among many other contributions.  This is a book, like so many others of the popes, which we need to read asking the Holy Spirit to guide us!Update 10/9/21:  We discussed this in our parish book club last night.  Members span rom one end of the spectrum to the other.  Despite that, there was great appreciation for the book and for Pope Francis' efforts to encourage us in dreaming and working for a better future for us and for the Church.  Participants did not agree with all the particulars of what Francis wrote, but we found many parts we embraced and which gave us joy and hope."
"I think Francis cares about people. I don‚Äôt think he abuses power. Power can corrupt. ‚ÄúWe are all children of God‚Äù. I believe we are on this planet to help one another rather than hurt one another, put one another down or look down on one another. My two main daily prayers are ‚ÄúGod help me help other people‚Äù, and ‚ÄúGod help people help other people‚Äù. I believe in the Trinity and using the Trinity to help people be better kinder people."
"One of the most important books you will read in your life!  Pope Francis has a most critical  view of mankind, regardless of your faith.  God speaks through him in this writing."
"What were the main principles of French Revolution?Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.This is what the pope says we must now move ahead to create.The Catholic faith is supposed to be universal and unchanging. Truth is true, yesterday, today and tomorrow. The Catholic Church was founded on the Apostle Peter when Jesus said, ""You are the Rock, and upon this Rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.""Pope Francis is motivated by a combination of the French Revolution principles and today's globalism. He wants the great Reset. He calls the creation of weapons evil, yet he and others in the Vatican are protected by guards with weapons. He wants open borders, but has not invited the homeless refuges to live in the Vatican."
"Historian Austen Ivereigh has written a brief exposition of Pope Francis's understanding of what Christians in today's world must prioritize.  The book is divided into three major parts: To See, To Choose, and To Act.  It will come as no surprise to those who follow Francis's papacy that to promote life and to respect creation that Christians must look beyond personal salvation alone and work for a social transformation that brings the Kingdom of God closer to fulfillment on earth.  If readers have struggled to read through Francis's encyclicals, they will be delighted with the accessible presentation by Ivereigh, which is based on his conversations with the pope.  This book is highly recommended and I have gifted copies to friends and family who used the book for their Lenten spiritual reading."
"Very thought provoking and inspiring, as one would expect. It paves the way for conversations about a better future with a perspective of the past."
Reads like Francis wrote this personally to me personally.  I bought eight for Christmas gifts but am giving them early because the spiritual help is so needed during COVID winter
"Pope Francis has clearly explained his concern for all of us and this earth with examples based on his diligent desire for clear dialogue and concensus about things we all should care about. I found it easy to read and very interesting.  He is not telling you what to do but logically encouraging  all of to have a thoughtful dialogue about important issues.  I think that is why he titled it ""Let us Dream"" of a world where we can get along. You know?"
"In this short book of reflections which came out of that rainy night when Pope Francis appeared in St Peters Square and blessed the world in March of 2020 in response to the pandemic, the Pope discusses how we need to change in response to this  worldwide disaster. Fundamentally this is a book of hope asking us to look at this moment as an opportunity for a kind of pilgrimage to a  better world in which we walk in solidarity in the face of challenge and division. Well worth the read."
"An invitation to spend some time dreaming.What do we want?  How can we go about it?Staying in the here and now is a real challenge these days (Jan 2021).  Pope Francis's words are like a hug from heaven.  Much needed and leaves me grateful.Many years ago, with a 30 year marriage failing, I stopped dreaming.  I stopped thinking I had a future.Today, my focus IS on my future.  It's on being a faithful servant.  It's on being laser focused on heaven.Thank you Papa for the challenge."
Such tough times...great to hear the perspective.
"Pope Francis wants us to see in the coronavirus, and the suffering it has inflicted on all of us, an opportunity from God to turn away from all that divides us and to turn toward a new era of humanity. With deep insight, profound faith, and delightful humor, Pope Francis invites us to dream together so we can, like Saint Joseph, rise, take the child and his mother, and journey into a better future."
I was apprehensive when our book group decided on reading this book.  Within the first three pages I was hooked.  Imagine realizing you are thinking the same as the Pope.
"My husband bought this for me for Christmas and we're both enjoying how it opens our eyes to things we hadn't noticed.  Yes, there is a pandemic but is that all that's wrong with the world?  Many times I feel that God is speaking to me through the Pope as I read this."
"This is a well-written and very readable book about our need to respond and shape our spirituality around the current state of the world, especially in this time of pandemic. It is sobering and compelling. I am reading it with a group of women on Zoom."
Pope Francis has developed a unique formula to help the world recover from not only the  effects  of this pandemic but how we my improve the state of the world.If these steps were to be embraced the world would be  with God's help a better place.
"Casi todos los lederes de gobiernos y industria llegan a su puesto sin conexi√≥n a los que sufren. Tal vez queda disconocido la mayor oportunidad del puesto de ledere. No hay falta de wiseo, aqu√≠ esta dedponible a todos en este libro."
Contains what may be the last hope for human society. How do we get away from the pillaging of the past.
"Great book bringing our current Pope Francis into a nearer focus with so many insights he offers. His perceptions and insights reveal a real depth of intellectual awareness of today's society. I appreciate his respectful, easy to read, and reflective presentations that have helped increase my awareness and motivations to practice my faith."
A true humanitarian. It's more than just faith in this book - it's a roadmap to giving back and lending a hand in crisis  for all time!
"I purchase this book to read later this Spring.  It didn't make it.  After previewing the first chapter, I could not put it down.  I finished it a day or two later.  It's salient points are the same ones that I have been struggling to articulate for years.  It's message is both familiar and fresh.  It's worth your time to read it."
"Offering much to ponder, this book provides direction for change by being open to possibilities and the people of all kinds that cross our paths. In Jesuit style many great sources are sited to deepen understanding and broaden insight."
"Challenging to get into, the translation seemed choppy.  Once past the first chapter the read was easy, encouraging and hopeful."
Quick read but some great quotes that make you think.  This was very much worth it for me.
Reading Francis encounters the pain of the competitive isolation in this world and the hope and vision of other possible ways to live and work and play together.  What indeed might happen when dominance gives way to care and competition to cooperation and the violence in the world would vanish?  The vision in invites.
"This is a great book that feeds my desire to be a better person, neighbor and steward of our earth."
PURCHASED AS A GIFT. Individual loves the book
"I loved this book so much that I bought two hard copies. One as a present for my son-in-law the psychologist, and the second to share with others."
A good direction and inspiration
Wonderfully inspirational reading!
inspiring
I am enjoying this book very much! It is making me feel better at a time when the world is crazy! The pope is a BEAUTIFUL PERSON and I am NOT an extreme Catholic by any means! Good read.
Catholic
Bought it used and it arrived in great condition! Excited for this read!
The best book I‚Äôve read in years!
"A beautiful, inspirational book of hope."
Exactly what every single person on the face of this planet needs to read and embrace. I cannot say enough good about this book. Please read this and share it with everyone you know.
"No cover, less than acceptable condition"
Makes me proud to be a catholic
This book calls us to a complete transformation.  It offers not only a path to a shared future but also the necessity to do so.
This is the perfect Christmas gift! Give the tift of vision and hope to somebody!
"Pope Francis is able to capture the current situation and put it into a context that is relevant, clear and concise."
A good read
I purchased for copies of these books as gifts and the book jackets on all of them are dirty.
great information on what is happening in the world and the church today.
Very informative
excellent
And arrived promptly.
Thank you! Let's pray.üåπwhy do I need to add 16 more words.. I just need to say thank you and let pray.
Incredibly timely and approachable.  The pope delivers a message of hope to a weary world in need.
A real life novel with a sense of hope
Logically incoherent and lacking an understanding of economics and psychology. Almost heretical. Full of post-modernist feel good ideology that had time and time again led to authoritarianism. The ignorance is shocking.
"This book is clearly Pope Francis ""Great Reset Agenda"". For along time now the Catholoc church has been under condemnation from all angles for the inner sinful actions that were taking play. This past Oct. 2019, Pope Francos was invited to Event 201, where only certain ""top world leaders"" were invited, no notes, no questions. Soon after covid-19 emerged. It is high time to wake up to all of the lies Catholics. This is coming from your eastern brother, Orthodox. I know the Catholic church in & out. Read Klaus Schawb: ""The Great Reset"" which can be had for free as a PDF file, then read Pope Francis book. God have mercy on us all."
Pure garbage. Don‚Äôt waste your time.
For the man that criticizes capitalism he doesn‚Äôt mind when it makes him money
Shortsighted political commentary
"Do not blindly fall into this. I respect the office of the pope. But this man is so far off track. You really need to look historically of how he has been planning this ‚Äúone world religion‚Äù all along. He is so overly involved in politics and he wants a one world government and one world religion. He also says the ‚Äúspirit‚Äù has to,d him new things are to come. It is very soooky. God has not changed our faith. He isn‚Äôt going to change the commandments to allow for other Gods. What are we going to do? Will we worship the pachemama on the altar of St Peter, have a party with some bread and wine, and blow sunshine at each other? He has also stated that we should not evangelize! What? This is not in the book that I am aware.Read page 93 very carefully. Do not fall into this. Read your Bible and find a good priest who you can trust.  This man is as fallible as the next guy so don‚Äôt put him on a pedestal. Thankfully he not spoken infallibly so we don‚Äôt have to worry about that! I jus don‚Äôt understand all these rave reviews. The people giving these 5 star reviews must not understand the Catholic faith well. I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt think anyone should be buying this book. But a good devotional instead of the Magnificat or something or than this. And pray that a one world government and one world religion never happen. God help us all. Get out there and evangelize. This is what Jesus taught. I follow Jesus not the pope."
"What is this, co-creators, three pillars, my faith is shaken to the core, we do not change doctrine and I see little of the true teachings here, I will turn to my Lord and pray for guidance because I cannot turn to worldly leaders anymore."
A political book. Anti-American. Anti-Catholic.  Zero stars.
"It‚Äôs very welcome that a major religious leader enters the fray and addresses real political, social, ecological, and economic issues. This is incarnate Christianity. Pope Francis lifts hope for a post-Covid radical re-think of our shared way of life, following Heidegger in quoting Friedrich H√∂lderlin ‚Äòwhere the danger is, also grows the saving power‚Äô, (p6). He targets poverty and oppression, inequality, climate change, discrimination and exclusion.His argument suffers from some inconsistencies. He welcomes dialogue, but often denounces others‚Äô positions. He advocates women‚Äôs roles as economists and administrators, but not as priests (p62ff). He opposes abortion (p115), but doesn‚Äôt address the church‚Äôs own ruling against contraception, which condemns women in Latin America to multiple childbirth and poverty. He presents a dualism of oppressor and oppressed, where a closer truth is that everyone shows better and worse characteristics. He doesn‚Äôt consider whether the church‚Äôs ruling on celibacy contributes to sexual abuse. If the church won‚Äôt re-consider its own moral position, its call for others to do so is diminished.Francis critiques neoliberal economic policy, assumes industry and commerce are totally profit oriented (p108ff), paints a very negative picture of care homes (p58), etc. He assumes technology can be controlled without considering the extent to which, philosophically, it might be objective beyond human agency. These positions need deeper consideration. Industry and commerce also include worthy motivations and outcomes.He rightly says that ‚Äòit is time to recover values‚Äô (p52). But he doesn‚Äôt acknowledge the challenge in defining a value like justice (see Amartya Sen ‚ÄòThe Idea of Justice‚Äô), and doesn‚Äôt expand on this core theme of virtue (see Andr√© Comte-Sponville ‚ÄòA Short Treatise on the Great Virtues‚Äô). Herein lies a major failure in the church‚Äôs contribution to social thinking. By focussing on creed and doctrine, charismatic experience, power structures, and ritual, the church has failed to prioritise virtue, and failed to make virtue accessible to non-believers. If contemporary post-modern society needs one focus, it is on widespread acknowledgement and embracing of virtue. The church could well lead the way.Francis‚Äôs main policy recommendation is for basic income (UBI) (p132). This is a hugely welcome endorsement. For more see ‚ÄòThe Case for Basic Income‚Äô at the ubi site, with an org suffix."
"Most people are only exposed to the thoughts and teachings of a Pope through formal encyclicals of the Catholic Church. The book ""Let Us Dream: The Path to a Better Future"" presents the Pontiff's thinking about contemporary issues, including racial injustice, poverty, and populist politicians.  Co-written by Pope Francis and his biographer, Austen Ivereigh, the book is not heavily weighted by the Church's theology. Instead, it includes stories of the Pope's own life experiences in light of the challenges of the past year.The book came about because of the coronavirus, which Ivereigh says left the Pope feeling isolated from the people and with a desire to share his observations widely.Even though the book does not mention Donald Trump by name, it calls out politicians for down-playing the coronavirus. ""Some media have used this crisis to persuade people that foreigners are to blame, that coronavirus is little more than a little bout of flu, that everything will soon return to what it was before, and that restrictions necessary for people's protections amount to an unjust demand of an interfering state,"" he writes. ""There are politicians who peddle these narratives for their own gain."" About those who refuse to wear masks, the Pope writes, ""Some of the protests during the coronavirus have brought to the fore an angry spirit of victimhood, but this time among people who are victims only in their own imagination: those who claim, for example, that being forced to wear a mask is an unwarranted imposition by the state, yet who forget or do not care about those who cannot rely, for example, on social security or who have lost their jobs.""He writes about the police killing of George Floyd and supports the protestors, yet criticizing those who call for removing statues that honor people of the past for their racist views. ""What worried me was the desire to purify the past. Some wanted to project onto the past the history they would like to have now, which requires them to cancel what came before. But it should be the other way around. For there to be true history, there must be a memory, which demands that we acknowledge the paths already trod, even if they are shameful.""While he doesn't reverse the Church's stance on women as priests, he speaks highly of how women are more successful in dealing with the pandemic crisis. ""The countries with women as presidents or prime ministers have on the whole reacted better and more quickly than others,"" he writes, ""making decisions swiftly and communicating them with empathy.""Pope Francis is seen as a person who is not afraid to speak out. ""Let Us Dream: The Path to a Better Future"" is like no other book I know written by the leader of the Church.MEMORABLE QUOTES:Too often we have thought of society as a subset of the economy and democracy as a function of the market. It is time to restore their proper order, to find the means to guarantee a life for all worthy of being called human. We need to set goals for our business sector that‚Äîwithout denying its importance‚Äîlook beyond shareholder value to other kinds of values that save us all: community, nature, and meaningful work. Profits are a sign of a business‚Äôs health, but we need broader measures of profit that take into account social and environmental goals.We need politicians who burn with the mission to secure for their people the three Ls of land, lodging, and labor, as well as education and health care. That means politicians with broader horizons who can open new ways for the people to organize and express itself. It means politicians who serve the people rather than who make use of them, who walk with those they represent, who carry with them the smell of the neighborhoods they serve. This kind of politics will be the best antidote to corruption in all its forms.But a third step is necessary if we are not to fall into mere welfarism: to reflect on the first two steps and open ourselves to the necessary structural reforms. An authentic politics designs those changes alongside, with, and by means of all those affected, respecting their culture and their dignity. The only time it is right to look down at someone is when we are offering our hand to help them get up. As I once put it in a talk to some religious men and women: ‚ÄúThe problem is not feeding the poor, or clothing the naked, or visiting the sick, but rather recognizing that the poor, the naked, the sick, prisoners, and the homeless have the dignity to sit at our table, to feel ‚Äòat home‚Äô among us, to feel part of a family. This is the sign that the Kingdom of Heaven is in our midst.‚ÄùWhen shares of major corporations fall a few percent, the news makes headlines. Experts endlessly discuss what it might mean. But when a homeless person is found frozen in the streets behind empty hotels, or a whole population goes hungry, few notice; and if it makes the news at all, we just shake our heads sadly and carry on, believing there is no solution.Today, listening to some of the populist leaders we now have, I am reminded of the 1930s, when some democracies collapsed into dictatorships seemingly overnight. By turning the people into a category of exclusion‚Äîthreatened on all sides by enemies, internal and external‚Äîthe term was emptied of meaning. We see it happening again now in rallies where populist leaders excite and harangue crowds, channeling their resentments and hatreds against imagined enemies to distract from the real problems. In the name of the people, populism denies the proper participation of those who belong to the people, allowing a particular group to appoint itself the true interpreter of popular feeling. A people ceases to be a people and becomes an inert mass manipulated by a party or a demagogue. Dictatorships almost always begin this way: sowing fear in the hearts of the people, then offering to defend them from the object of their fear in exchange for denying them the power to determine their own future.By focusing on land, lodging, and labor we can regain a healthy relationship with the world and grow by serving others. In this way, we transcend the narrow individualist framework of the liberal paradigm without falling into the trap of populism. Democracy is then reinvigorated by the concerns and wisdom of the people who are involved in it. Politics can once again be an expression of love through service. By making the restoration of our peoples‚Äô dignity the central objective of the post-Covid world, we make everyone‚Äôs dignity the key to our actions. To guarantee a world where dignity is valued and respected through concrete actions is not just a dream but a path to a better future."
"Can you people not see that this is Anti Christ book?  I am Catholic and this is about the great reset, written in language that can trick and lure people into believing?  ..remember the prophecy....A FALSE PROPHET will proceed the Antichrist.  Open you eyes !  Sounds beautiful but it is evil.  We must not become co creators of a new reality....  ask Blessed Mother for descernment."
"To review a book by our Pope should make any person tremble! The trembling for me is a sense of joy in the content of the book. It is a book that you want to remember every word. Page after page gives us the insights and wisdom to lead a good/holy life. On the front cover the reviewer states:‚ÄùIn the Covid crisis, the beloved shepherd of over one billion Catholics has seen the cruelty and inequality of our society more vividly exposed than ever before. He has also seen in the resilience, generosity and creativity of so many people, the means to rescue our society, our economy and our planet.‚Äù He exhorts us not to let the pain be in vain.Beginning with the prologue the Pope calls us to be our best. ‚ÄúIn moments of crisis you get both good and bad: People reveal themselves as they are.  Some spend themselves in the service of those in need, and some get rich off other people‚Äôs need.  Some move out to meet others- in new and creative ways, without leaving their houses‚Äîwhile some retreat behind defensive armor. The state of our hearts is exposed.‚Äù Pope Francis points out to us the problem of retreating from the crisis and the need to change our roles for the good of all. He states that to act like the Samaritan in a crisis means to let myself be struck by what I see, ‚ÄúKnowing that the suffering will change me.‚Äù We embrace the Cross as we know it will change us by giving us the courage to stop lamenting by moving out and serving others ‚Äúby enabling change which will come only from compassion and service.‚Äù  He exhorts us to protect ourselves from the pandemics we can‚Äôt see ‚ÄúHow will we deal with the hidden pandemics of this world, the pandemics of hunger and violence and climate change?‚ÄùWith courage the Pope tells us: ‚Äú I see an overflow of mercy spilling out in our midst, Hearts have been tested.  The crisis has called forth in some a sense of courage and compassion. Some have been sifted and have responded with the desire to reimagine our world others have come to the aid of those in need in concrete ways that can transform our neighbor‚Äôs suffering.‚Äù This fills the Pope with hope that we might come out of this crisis better.  ‚ÄúBut we have to see clearly, choose well, and act right.‚ÄùThe Pope presents the how of dealing with the pandemics.  He states: ‚ÄúThis crisis has called forth the sense that we need each other, that the people still exists. Now is the time for a new Nehemiah project, a new humanism that can harness this eruption of fraternity, to put an end to the globalization of indifference and the hyperinflation of the individual. We need to feel again that we need each other, that we have a responsibility for others, including for those not yet born and for those not yet deemed to be citizens. We can reorganize the way we live together in order better to choose what matters.‚ÄùIn the section on a time to act, he again calls us to think differently. He states: It is striking how neoliberal currents of thought have sought to exclude from the political arena any substantive debate about the common good and the universal destination of goods. What they promote instead is essentially the efficient management of a marker and minimal government control.  But the problem is that when the economy‚Äôs primary purpose centers on profit, it is easy to forget that the earth‚Äôs resources are for all, not the few.‚ÄùIn the postscript by Austen Ivereigh, he notes that ‚ÄúIn response to the crisis, Francis wasn‚Äôt simply serving up diagnoses and prescriptions, what concerned him was the process of transformation itself: how historic change happens, how we resist or embrace that process: the dynamic of conversion.  As I know decades of spiritual leadership from researching his life, this was ‚Äìamong his many gifts‚Äîhis particular charism, forged in his native Argentina that now as Pope he was drawing on to walk with humanity.  He sought to communicate the urgency of opening the people to the grace that was always on offer in times of tribulation, and so let God shape our story.The Pope‚Äôs book is filled with encouragement and hope with the tenderness of being all our spiritual director. It is a book that I will read again and again and encourage you to read it with the purpose of transforming our world."
Francis solution to our troubles is a replay of the French Revolution!Wow! That‚Äôs a lot easier then all that god stuff!
"In this book, Pope Francis is modeling to the world the Ignatian Discernment of Spirits of finding the Will of God in all things, in the Spiritual Exercises, St. Ignatius of Loyola recommends 14 rules to help in this process of discernment. Although, the Pope is not spelling out these rules, it is evident that he has internalized them. Austen Ivereigh explains that the book is divided in three parts which correspond to three stages in the process of discernment as a dynamic of conversion. ‚ÄúFirst, look at reality, however uncomfortable, above all the truth of the suffering in the margins of society. Second, discern the different forces at work, distinguishing what builds up from what destroys, what humanizes from what dehumanizes, and thus choose what is of God, rejecting the opposite. Finally, propose fresh thinking and concrete steps that stem from the diagnosis of what ails us and how we might act differently. This is the basic structure of ‚ÄúLet Us Dream,‚Äù divided into three ‚Äútimes‚Äù: to see, to choose, and to act.‚Äù We have to become true brothers and sisters of all, we have to ‚Äúdecenter and transcend,‚Äù we have to take a vaccine for the pandemic of indifference and become Good Samaritans for others. The coved crisis has taught us that: ‚Äúthis is the time to restore an ethics of fraternity and solidarity, regenerating the bonds of trust and belonging. For what saves us is not an idea but an encounter. Only the face of another is capable of awakening the best of ourselves. In serving the people, we save ourselves.‚Äù Another reviewer complains that Pope Francis is promoting the French Revolution principles (liberty, equality, fraternity) instead of the principles of Jesus. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to point out that liberty, equality and fraternity are Christian ideas that were separated from their roots. Let‚Äôs read what St. John Paul II said about this in his homily at the French airport, June 1st, 1980: ‚Äú...Everyone knows how important the ideas of liberty, equality, and fraternity are in your culture and history. At bottom, those are Christian ideas. I am well aware that those who put them forward did not have in mind man‚Äôs covenant with Eternal Wisdom. Yet they wanted to do something for man.‚Äù We should not forget that we were created with the freedom to love or reject God (liberty), in the ‚Äúimage and likeness of God‚Äù (equality), and sons and daughters of God the Father and brothers and sisters of Jesus Christ (fraternity). Hence, liberty, equality and fraternity only adquiere their true sense sense in light of the incarnation of God in Christ. In conclusion, since conversion is the work of the Holy Spirit, it is implied, that we are being invited to go through our own process of discernment of spirits, and in docility to the Holy Spirit, practice, from our personal circumstances, true fraternity and become Good Samaritans to all."
"Title:  Let Us DreamAuthor: Pope FrancisRead by:  Arthur MoreyPublisher: Simon AudioLength: Approximately 4 hours and 5 minutesSource: Review Copy from Simon Audio.  Thank-you!Let Us Dream was the perfect book to listen to during Holy Week and is a perfect read for our troubled times.  Pope Francis has a call to Catholics to apply their faith to help out with modern problems including COVID, racism, and the environment.The book is divided into three parts; a time to see, to choose, and to act.  Pope Francis talks through what was currently happening last year including COVID, George Floyd, the destruction of statues, populism, etc. and puts them into a faith perspective.  He overall talked about his experiences and Biblical passages to put everything into perspective.  His overall message was that we need to put aside our differences and start caring for people as individuals.I found this audiobook to be uplifting and thoughtful.  Arthur Morey was a great narrator, and I enjoyed the afterword where it was discussed how conversations with the Pope were the driving force on putting this book together.Favorite Quote:‚ÄúWe need a movement of people who know we need each other, who have a sense of responsibility to others and to the world. We need to proclaim that being kind, having faith, and working for the common good are great life goals that need courage and vigor, while glib superficiality and the mockery of ethics have done us no good. The modern era, which has developed equality and liberty with such determination, now needs to focus on fraternity with the same drive and tenacity to confront the challenges ahead. Fraternity will enable freedom and equality to take its rightful place in the symphony.‚ÄùOverall, Let Us Dream is an inspirational book perfect for today.  I highly recommend it."
"Sophomoric. Sweeping inaccurate generalizations.He writes of the Argentine villa miseria, slums and shanty towns, on page 17. ""Think of them"", he says.  That's all. Does he explore why they exist (in socialist, corrupt Argentina) or propose ways to lift them out of poverty? Not a word. Does he give credit to capitalism and free enterprise for lifting huge numbers of people out of poverty worldwide? No. Does he give credit to the USA for the $billions/trillions in foreign aid given to countries all over the world? No. Where does he think in this world that the wealth will come from to help the poor? We know it comes from the surplus (profit) produced by free enterprise and enlightened self interest. Will he work with that to change the circumstances of those in need? No. He wants to fundamentally change society in vague, impossible ways and kill the golden goose along the way. I couldn't finish the book. With world leaders like him we are in real trouble. Where oh where is Pope John Paul II?"
As a Catholic I was appalled by this secular work trying to pass a a Christian work.  Read the introduction and count the time me mentioned God.
"Sadly, Pope Francis continues to glaze over the controversial issues within the Catholic Church. I find  his opinion of women condescending, very high on form and transparently low on substance.‚ÄúLet Us Dream‚Äù ~ reads  like a well scripted political campaign speech, pandering and stumping to an ignorant constituency."
"I usually wait until the end of a book before reviewing it, but Pope Francis' message is urgent. We must use what has been exposed with the Covid crisis to see and understand what it means to be on the margins, and we must change. This is an important book for everyone, not just Catholics. His message reaches across religions and races, urging us all to open our eyes to the suffering created by injustice, and to find a way for all beings to have the dignity and justice that is our birthright. Please read this book!"
"This is a beautiful, inspiring book. Most religious people I know (including family members) are seemingly filled with hate and hypocrisy to the degree that they are toxic and cultish. I received this book as a gift and it has been a gift in the truest sense of the word. It has touched my heart and soul. Pope Francis is the light in a dark time. What he says about discernment and truth should be studied by all."
"I have spent many hours pondering this year as to what is my path forward after the pandemic. Pope Francis, thank you for this beautiful guide to help frame my thoughts."
I have the audio.  What an inspiration.  I know non Catholics and even some Catholics do not like our Pope.  I know evangelicals believe our Pope to be the antichrist. Yet they have great love for a President who is a troubled soul.
"If you want the world to be different as the pandemic ends, read this book to get some clues for how we can BE better. Thought provoking and worth pondering, the author tells stories to awaken and challenge us."
"This is an amazing book of hope. Clear-eyed about the way the world works, yet having faith that it is possible to be better. Well written and inspiring."
Very insightful and thought provoking read.  Provides a lot of hope during unsettling times.
"One does not need to read this to know that it is trash. However, I encourage anyone who reads this to compare the roman church, throughout history, with the little horn of Daniel 7, Daniel 8 and Daniel 12, with the man of sin in 2 Thessalonians 2, and with the beast in Revelation 13 and the great harlot in Revelation 17. Also compare what's happening in the present with what happened in the tower of Babel (Genesis 11). I pray that the Lord God, the ONLY Supreme Ruler of all, gives wisdom, enlightenment and discernment to whoever reads this."
"It‚Äôs very welcome that a major religious leader enters the fray and addresses real political, social, ecological, and economic issues. This is incarnate Christianity.

"This is a book for our time.  Simple and wise.Pope Francis encourages us not to resent the disruption brought about by COVID19 but to recognise it as a time of sifting and purification. Life brings to us all these necessary periods of ‚Äústoppage‚Äù (indeed the Pope shares three examples of his own) from which we should aspire to emerge improved after a period of reflection and discernment.Presented in three easy sections ‚Äì A Time to See, A Time to Choose & A Time to Act ‚Äì the book starts with a review of the pressing issues facing our world (climate change, pandemics, inequality, discrimination), continues with a discussion of the process of discernment the pandemic has allowed and finishes with some suggestions from the Pope about areas where the world might next choose to act.The simplicity and brevity (160 pages) of this book belies the wisdom of the author. It is a quick, refreshing and uplifting read. Pope Francis reminds us ‚ÄúWhere the danger is, also grows the saving power‚Äù (Holderling)The Pope is obviously widely read and experienced. He uses passages of scripture and quotes from eminent philosophers and poets throughout the book and yet, his message has great humility. He walks alongside the reader sharing the experiences of our age, making sense of them and encouraging us to embrace the challenges that they present.If we had one criticism of the book it would be the naivety of a Pope Francis whose roots lie with the urban poor of Argentina. His confidence in man‚Äôs ultimate humanity might be more sorely tested in the West where apathy and complacency are much more deeply embedded. However, maybe it is we who should heed his message of hope!"
"A wonderful book, that would be valuable at any time but especially in the current pandemic.  The Pope's ideas are conveyed with typical humility and insight, perception and wisdom.  Very readable, and deceptively profound thanks to the clarity of the writing (one sometimes stops and realises what a deep insight has been shared).  Credit, too, to Austen Ivereigh whose contribution as the Pope's biographer and English translate could be given more prominence.  Highly recommended, for people of faith and those who are open to challenge."
5 star rating as it's an easy read and an honest account about  humanity and challenges each and every one of us to be more  caring and selfless for  the good of all.  Everyone should read it .
"If ever a book could trigger a real, grassroots social revolution to set the world to rights, this is it. Pope Francis dares to see the world as it is. He then proposes to choose a path that is consistent with the message of the biblical Prophets and the Gospel. And finally he offers a way to act, with a view to turning on its head the indifferent, materialistic attitude to life that many of us in the West have hitherto nurtured. He dares to dream of a better future.Pope Francis is not only a learned and wise prelate with a huge following. In this book, he also emerges as a humble, broad-minded, canny observer of both current events and prevailing attitudes. His message is clear and relevant for all people who are concerned about social issues.Some quotes from the book bring out the message:Rich and powerful elites currently run our so-called democracies. Francis opens the possibility of true change by emphasizing the worth and power of marginalized people. They form caring social groups, not motivated by personal profit or luxury but concerned for each other and the environment. As such, they have the potential to introduce a vibrant new social order.Francis compares the current Covid crisis with the ongoing ‚Äòpandemics of hunger, violence and climate change‚Äô. He claims the recent lockdowns can teach us that ‚Äòwe need to slow down, take stock, and design better ways of living together on this earth.‚Äô‚ÄòThe modern era, which has developed equality and liberty with such determination, now needs to focus on fraternity with the same drive and tenacity to confront the challenges ahead. Fraternity will enable freedom and equality to take its rightful place in the symphony.‚ÄôFrancis emphasizes the concept of a ‚Äòpeople‚Äô, which ‚Äògathers itself in assemblies, ‚Ä¶ shares experiences and hopes, and hears the call of a common destiny.‚Äô Such ‚ÄòPopular Movements‚Äò, which spring up around the world on the margins of society, campaigning for land, lodging, and labour for their families. An elaboration of these needs forms the climax of the book, illustrated from his own experiences while Archbishop in Buenos Aires as well as meetings he hosted as Pope.This is a controversial but daring book and not what one would initially expect from the leader of a traditional, hierarchical religious institution. Conservatives will dismiss it as socialist propaganda. Evangelical Christians may find it too man-centred and not spiritual enough. But it deserves to be taken very seriously by all who see the need to revolutionize today‚Äôs self-centred, materialistic society, which is both cruel to deprived people and destructive of the environment."
Pope Francis understands the deep problems faced by the modern world post Covid and sets out to address them.  His concern about the inequalities in our societies and the ecological damage being done to the planet are clear to see. I would make this book compulsory reading for all politicians. Very easy to read and written with great conviction.
"I loved the clear simple exposition of ideas. I loved how Pope Francis includes Amon at the heart of his ideas. I love how he blows open the debate from male cleric hierarchy to include everyone in this vital debate. He dismisses ‚Äúclericalism‚Äù as a vice I.e. make only voices. He recognises and extols the value of female evangelism and education within their communities. How everyone has a voice to add to the debate. I love the idea of finding the best in polar opposite and synthesising better than either, rather than bludgeoning it out till one side wins. Should be compulsory reading for all policy makers of every political shade"
"What the world should be like if only the rich would help the poor - Let Us Dream is the right title.So many wise and straightforward words coming from Pope Francis in all his publications He doesn't speak ""in code"" which is why he has acquired so many powerful enemies - proof that he upsetting them and getting it right."
"A great book to read, its about every person united not only in Environmental Issues, but meeting your fellow person with the same love we have for our family and friends. We are all one under one heaven. It is time for all of us to be the person we would really want to be, with our home free from harmful additives. I would highly recommend this book, ""Let Us Dream"", and accomplish for a better future for all."
"So clean and well taken care of, had no problems like other reviewers have left. Really good size for a hard back. Not at all heavy in the hand to read, so anyone can be confident that it not clumpy of hard on your wrist. Loved the price too. Thinking of others who would like it and will be recommending it."
Thoughtful and challenging book on the direction of the world post pandemic!
This is a wonderful insight into Pope Francis. It has been really good to read about how he sees the world at the moment and what can be done to improve things. What a humble man. Who is leading by example.
Good advice to get through the current pandemic period
"It is good to have a church leader speak out and challenge so many of the current attitudes and outlooks in the world of politics, economics and inter personal relationships.  A 'Big' vision for he future that does not simply revert to past attitudes is much needed and Pope Francis spells it out clearly especially in the first apt of the book."
A must read for all Christian and all people!
"Very nice little book, and a useful book to read to get a perspective from a very Holy Man. Am glad I bought this."
This is a very good interesting book.  It is about now.  It is about our attitudes during this pandemic.
"Wonderful, positive outlook on our society and the current state of the world as a whole. Pope Francis has a vast knowledge of historical writings and draws comparisonto his views with those of Saints and scholars. A very enlightening read but not easy going as deeply philosophical."
"A well presented statement of hope and aspiration. A challenging summary of many views the Pope articulates, brought together in a style that brings out the coherence of his message. The ideas advocated are for all to consider and certainly not just for Catholics."
Bought this book for my husband he is enjoying reading it.he rates is it 5 star.
Really easy to read- quite a conversational tone : it just skips off the pages
"Great read , very moving and thoughtful book"
This book presents a heartfelt plea to people of all cultures and religion to care and nurture all of creation and build relationships of peace and harmony.
Superb. Inspirational. Wonderful read
Easy present like most books purchases
Great to read the pope's analysis of the modern world and some insights into a way forward.
Cover of book was torn on arrival.  Was 'new' so am disappointed as was meant for a present.  Would prefer a refund to having to package up and take to Post Office and wait for a replacement.
Wonderful read
Excellent service from A Great Read. Much appreciated.
"A lot to take in. Would suit a bible study group, provokes discussion"
Pope Francis the head of the Roman Catholic Church is one of the best popes.
Really uplifting book. Simply written for every one and each page is inspirational! A book I keep going back into.
"Bought as a gift and great value from Amazon, the reader enjoyed it, though I think she just likes everything about this pope"
Excellent very good Book
"Excellent book, good for quoting."
A very up-to-date read.
"A book of values, social critique and hope. It tells us about how crises, like the pandemic, can reveal issues in society and ways to go about improving our future as one people, not just a mass of individuals.Not always an easy read, but revealing, informative and contemporary. A must-read for politicians, especially those who show populist tendencies."
"The wisdom, experience and authority of Pope Francis are evident throughout the book. He sums up the present situation as ""the globalization of indifference and the hyperinflation of the individual"". Definitely worth reading carefully and thoughtfully."
"I wasn‚Äôt sure about spending the time to read this, and now I am glad I did. The book is profoundly challenging. COVID-19 has been a tragedy for much of the world, but it challenges us to creat a better world than that of 2019. Pope. Francis has helped me to ask questions about the economic and environmental choices the world faces, and the desperate need to look at how MY choices, and those there in the prosperous world, will affect all our brothers and sisters, and ur grandchildren. Thank you for this."
"A very well-considered perspective on what our nations and communities could focus on now (economic, social, environmental) and how we might do it differently to build and sustain.  A very clear exposition, and crikey, wouldn't it be great if more listened!"
Austen does it again - summing the key challenges and opportunities that this time in our history presents - and then providing the various paths we can walk to make a difference and be better than we were before we felt the twitch on the thread
I found this book to be an insight into Pope Francis' vision for a more synodal Church. It is written in an easy to read style which engages the reader in his own reflections.
This book arrived on time and in good condition. It is a gift and I‚Äôm sure the recipient will enjoy reading it.
I wanted to read this book.  It was readily available and delivered ahead of the predicted date.  Thank you
Great background to so many of the issues facing the Catholic Church at this time- always good to have context
"The visIon, clarity. Rapport. Genuine pastoral concern. This  is an outstanding piece of plain English or Spanish writing."
Great Plan for the future! Easy read and filled with the Hand and Spirit of God. May the Dream come True!
"A vision for a better, fairer, peaceful and equitable world."
Great book by great author
"The Pope speaks (as always) in simple, understandable language about the common values of our humanity. An inspiring book. A must for all people of goodwill."

"Where to start....I think this is my first book review. I just finished reading this book. I am an atheist, I am a man who has wronged his marriage and his wife. I am trying to gain an understanding about myself so I can better myself and better my marriage. I have been searching for many answers from various philosophies of life. I found Christianity to be the most forgiving, compassionate and hopeful (if you are willing and able to be honest with yourself) . This book in contrast to the Lundy Bancroft book was more encouraging for me. Bancroft, in my opinion, portrays the worst and offers little hope for men who have been abusive. Maybe it was meant to shock and awe women who suffer from abusive men to rightfully act, if so, then the Bancroft book is great for that.In fact I gave the Bancroft book to a friend of mine who is tormented daily by a man who checks off ""all the boxes"" in the Bancroft book. Hope for redemption of myself and potentially my marriage came from the Vernick book. Bancroft reminded me of Dante entering Hell and reading the sign ""abandon all hope, you who enter here.""  Vernick gave me hope, if I was willing to see my truths and listen.Vernick's book provides some useful ""self checklists"" (CORE in the book) for both men and women to employ. It also gives guidance on how to continue to provide constructive feedback to your spouse. There is forgiveness and redemption in truth. The book is written for the women who are or have suffered from abuse, but it still helped me understand myself and to understand what my wife has been going through.Before any of these books can help, you need to let honesty and truth in. If you cannot examine yourself, the good and the bad, then none of these books will ever help. Of course this book was written for believers of Christianity, but I think the message within this book transcends that and can be applied by all people.Overall, a book of hope, truth and forgiveness for those that want to better themselves and potentially their marriage."
"I bought and read this book nearly two years ago now. And here I am again reading the reviews to make sure it's a good fit for another woman who may need the gift of these insightful and biblical teachings. I myself was lost, an empty shell of the woman I once was, after 9 years of marriage to a very broken but covertly destructive man. To everyone else, he was a model citizen/husband/father. The biggest ""ah-ha"" moment reading this book was learning the truth about God's love for me, which comes BEFORE his love for the marriage covenant. I closely followed this book's advice to the very end. I exhausted every empowered option. A necessary journey. But ultimately I saved my life by leaving. And I never regretted that choice. The author is very honest about the sacrifices you will make should you choose that route. I personally lost my beautiful home and financial security, some friends and more. But I gained my life, my freedom to be joyful again, a deep respect for my own well-being and a future full of God's promises. I can not recommend this book enough. Thank you, Leslie."
"I found this book literally after crying out to God one day to just lead me to the truth about my marriage.  I was so emotionally torn after receiving advice from Christian friends to just hang in there, keep forgiving and keep trying to be the wife my husband wants, vs. a Christian therapist telling me I needed to make my husband face consequences for his abuse.  I thought for 14 years God wanted me to turn the other cheek, submit, and love without conditions.  This not only enabled my husband to continue with his abusive behavior, but it also made me start to turn away from God.  I felt like God loved my husband and his needs far more than He loved me, to the point that He expected me to put up with disrespect, berating, name calling, being ignored all the time, being treated like nothing more than an object, some physical abuse, the list goes on.So I found this book after doing just one Google search and I read what I could of what was inside of it through Amazon's Look Inside feature.  I literally wept the hardest I have in my life when I read the first two chapters stating that God loves me and didn't want this kind of marriage for me or any other woman.  That what I was dealing with was not what a marriage should be and God didn't expect me to put up with it.  It was the first time I had ever heard this and it was like being freed from a prison cell.I bought this book and had it overnighted.  Once I got it I could not put it down.  I had no idea what the extent was of the abuse I was dealing with until I read this book.  I felt so understood-- for once! -- and received much more love and encouragement from Leslie's words than I ever received from the church's many teachings that women must love and forgive their husbands no matter what.Leslie not only helps you identify what is going on in your marriage, but she helps you to figure out how to deal with it in a Godly way. She tells you that allowing someone to hurt you over and over without being accountable is not loving them, that it's living by fear instead of faith, and that it keeps the abuser from becoming the person God created them to be.  If you will not speak the truth to them about their behavior, you are not loving them well.  She shows you how to apply consequences in a healthy way, and what to do if setting boundaries with your abusive spouse do not work.  If his heart won't change, what you can do next.This book saved my life.  I think if I had no found it I would have continued putting up with abuse until the day I died, and thinking God didn't give a rip about me.  I would have lost the one love I did have in my life, Jesus, because of the wrong picture the church paints of Him and how He views married women.If you are in an abusive marriage, please read this book, and draw closer to Jesus as you find out how He really feels about you and what you've been going through.  Seek Godly counsel to help you apply what Leslie teaches you, which is totally in line with the Bible.  She does not twist scripture around.  She cites verses in their true context.If you are a Christian counselor, pastor or friend, please do not tell women who are with husbands who consistently talk down to them, break their hearts, disrespect them and treat them like an object that all they have to do is try harder and he'll come around.  Read this book and become educated about something that is very misunderstood in the Church, and has been hurting Christian wives for far too long.I thank God for answering my prayer, for leading me to the truth found in this book, and for loving me enough to do so."
"I was told by countless Christian friends and even a biblical counselor that I had to stay under the pressure of my marriage. That I had no biblical grounds for divorce, that marriage is a special covenant you can't break, very much like how god made a covenant with us. Somehow it was my fault for not praying hard enough or reading the Bible enough...After praying to god for answers, it's was by his sovereign grace that led me to this book. God hated what my husband was doing to me!I was crippled by my husband, the years of abuse led me to develop panic attacks. I couldn't eat, sleep, drive or function in or outside my home. The hairs on my back would stand up when he would come near me and my body physically was trying to repell him away.This book helped me realize that by trying harder to make this marriage work, I was feeding my husbands selfishness and sense of entitlement. this is due to my peacekeeping and people pleasing tendency which I need to fix.What I love about this book is it ties in scripture beautifully and gives biblical examples of what marriage, headship, and submission looks like. She also has surveys you can take at the beginning. towards the end, she offers great advice on how to hold difficult conversations with your husband. Also, This book has many practical applications that can apply to any marriage.This book saved my life!"
"I have lived with a husband who has been indifferent to my needs and emotions for over twenty years. It's the kind of abuse no one notices, even yourself. One day you realize the anger, and sadness you have felt is not because you are a unhappy individual, or because you are aging, you realize it's because you have been ignored far too long. This book gave me validation, insight and hope. Even though, we are far from reconciliation at this point since he has yet to accept his responsibility, I can separate myself and love myself, knowing I am a beloved Child of God, and He, the Almighty, will always take care of me a love me, even if my husband chooses not to, even though my circumstances may change. Thank you Leslie for your God given insight and discernment on marital issues."
"This book does four important things:1. Wakes a woman up to the reality of her marriage (it's not healthy vs. her dream of what it could/should be) - an important first step in getting help.2. Validates what she is going through (she isn't making it up in her head) and offers compassionate understanding and assessment.3. Shows her what she is doing to enable the toxic cycles of abuse to continue.4. Exposes the lies she is believing that keep her in the cycle.5. Gives her the essential and practical tools to break out of the cycles.The test at the beginning of the book helps you discern whether or not you are living in an emotionally destructive marriage - and what TYPE of ED marriage it is. (There are several.)I also love the teaching about building your CORE. (Get the book and find out what that acronym stands for!!) Having a strong CORE is what will enable you to break free by the Grace of God at the Center of who you are.I read this book within 24 hours and am coming back to buy a bunch to give away.If you or someone you know lives with a passive-aggressive type person, I highly recommend this book along with¬†

  
Who's Pushing Your Buttons?: Handling the Difficult People in Your Life









  
  
    
  ¬†by Dr. John Townsend. Both are eye-opening, hope-drenched, and VERY practical."
I‚Äôve been reading it since this morning. I cannot put it down. It‚Äôs incredible. I‚Äôve lived apart from my husband for 6 months. Back and forth and desperate for change.... thank you LESLIE!!!! I feel like I know what to do.. not run back and not fight him... but to use wisdom... this book is amazing.
"Leslie has good information here that adds to your quest for surviving or leaving a bad marriage. Leslie comes from a Christian perspective, addressing aspects of divorce/separation that are specific to that community. There is very good information here for the woman (or man) that wishes to stay in the marriage regardless of whether or not the toxic other makes effort to change their behavior. It also helps for those that wish to leave the relationship to be able to leave whole and healthy.I took away one star, because of the author's extensive focus on examination of the non-disordered spouse's role in the abuse. Believe me, the Non carries enough self-doubt and guilt already, and has done years and years of introspection. When, oh when, will the helpers in this community allow the non-disordered spouse to claim that the bad marriage is SOLELY the result of the actions and attitudes of the toxic spouse? The injured spouse's self-preserving behaviors need to be examined, yes, but are not their burden.I highly recommend reading Bancroft's books first for deep understanding of the dynamic of an emotionally destructive relationship, then read this one."
"I found Leslie Vernick online when searching for guidance about a troubled marriage of a close family member. This book clearly explains what Christian marriage is meant to be: HEALTHY. A healthy marriage builds up both partners. Her book uses various examples to explain the differences between a difficult, disappointing and a destructive marriage (she also has a series of videos on You Tube).  There are several sets of questions you can complete to see where the issues are in your marriage. The advice is given in a compassionate manner that reminds the reader how much they are loved and valued by God. In contrast to some Christian marriage books, she encourages you to take action to make your marriage better, not just suffer in silence as though you have no options. My favorite line from this book is in the Introduction, ""God does not value men more than women, or the institution of marriage more than the people who are in it""."
"My biggest take away from this book was that churches today are missing something very important about difficult marriages.  Too many churches have bought into the Love & Respect ideology - believing that if a women submits to her husband and a man loves his wife, then everything works out.  So many churches teach that a wife should submit more, respect her husband more, meet his needs more, and serve him more.... in order to fix a marriage.  But what happens if a women gets abused by that process and all that submission just makes the marriage worse?  The truth is - when a relationship is broken by underlying mental health issues, selfishness, abuse, manipulation, control, emotional and psychological abuse, etc. - submitting more, respecting more, serving more, just will not solve the issue - it makes everything WORSE.  Thank you that at least ONE person out there is willing to write this truth down in a book so that women going through this can put into words what they experience.IN my opinion, if Christian pastors are going to do marriage counseling WITHOUT taking all the courses clinical psychologists do and earning the appropriate degrees... then at least have the decency to read this book first just so you understand what can be going on in a marriage behind the scenes, things that a wife may have a hard time explaining or putting words to, and how one-size-fits all solutions might just make things WORSE instead of better."
"Amazing!  This book touches on everything that it should, regarding this subject.  So many books leave crucial details out.  This has the most BIBLICALLY BALANCED counsel I've seen, to date, (So thankful for that!), and I've read many, many books , both men's & women's, desperately seeking help, as several churches did not know how to deal with this.I wished I'd had this book many years ago, when I was so confused as to what was right or wrong....what my options were, Biblically.I'm happy to have this book now though, to continue learning, growing, and getting the help that I also need.Also, EVERY CHURCH NEEDS A COPY OF THIS BOOK!  I've repeatedly seen, firsthand, the terrible damage church leadership can cause an already devastated marriage, family, home.....by not handling this situation properly, Biblically.Buy yourself, and/or family members, a copy, but definitely buy your church a copy!"
"She has obviously had a lot of experience dealing with emotional abuse because it's like she's been a fly on the wall of my house. This book acts somewhat like a workbook, in that it asks questions which require reflection and time to think through to process adequately. I am a very fast reader but I took my time over a period of a few weeks to read this book so that I could work through some of these questions. And I had already gone through two years grieving the loss of the relationship I wanted and thought I'd married into. This is an excellent book that helps sort out where you are in the relationship and then offers solid, very specific.steps toward getting into a healthier position. This book stands out from other books dealing with emotional abuse, including those specifically addressing narcissistic personality disorder, in two ways. The first is that she offers an approach of Biblical counseling which differs from regular Christian marriage counseling, and secondly, she encourages the.health of the relationship and the health of both individuals in light of God's Word without precluding separation and/or divorce. In the process, she debunks.the common fallacies of counseling often heard within the modern church and this is refreshing and encouraging."
"On the receiving end of abuse. I've been told to be more submissive, which encouraged physical attacks. Had one counselor tell us to just be nicer to each other, that we were lucky to have each other. Each time this translated into my husband being right. It was all my fault our marriage wasn't good. I just needed to put on a pretty dress and have more sex and it would all be good.Finally a voice of common sense! I had a hard time not crying while reading this book because it was like she knew my story. I have begun to make changes and they haven't been easy. The validation I received from this book was a relief."
"As challenging as it was from page to page,  I thoroughly enjoyed reading 'The Emotionally Destructive Marriage'. This book was God sent! Leslie gave us real life examples of clients with whom she worked whereby we are able to relate.  I did/do however find it very disheartening in reading this book and through several conversations that so many married women who sincerely love God and are the daughters of God have lost their voices and are suffering ever so silently and shamefully in the church and under the guises of the Christianity and the Holy Ghost. Where's the accountability?!  I think this book should be gifted to EVERY Christian counselor, marriage counselor, pastor and church leader. Please,  please, please stop telling us/these women that if they tried harder, spoke softer,  prayed longer, loved deeper etc that things would be better in their relationship/marriages and heaven forbid if not,  'that's their lot in life.' The devil is a liar! This book helps us to recognize co-dependency (even in the church) and abuse at its core. Reading this book gave me such an understanding of the physical, emotional, mental,  sexual, financial, spiritual etc abuses present and the prisons in which they hold their captives. This book would also be a good read for the young ladis who are considering marriage.Additionally, while there were just a few items I disagreed with, overall Leslie dispelled the negative connotations, ideologies and lies passed from generation to generation of the role andresponsibility of the woman in the home. In this book, she absolutely, positively does not leave you helpless nor alone in your processes. You can gain the strength you need to do endure so that you may do what is good, right and true in the sight of the Lord.P.S. I highly recommended this book to my sister who is a licensed clinical psychologist. She's ordered the workbook and several books to make this a part of her martial counseling sessions!"
"This book has been a real eye opener. It felt like someone heard my thoughts, read my journal, and listened in on my therapy sessions. The full biblical references are used instead of the usual skewed approach that women just need to submit even more which is to often preached.This book will hit you hard. The biggest thing I realized was that I wasn't alone. It also helped me to realize how my husband has felt all these years because in many ways I was the terrible husband in these stories. There is support info for males at the front of the book but the book is written geared towards women. Men can definitely learn a lot from this book and I highly recommend it."
"I have read a few other books (ones by Patricia Rvans which are also very good) but this one is my favorite. I say that because it is pragmatic and offer reassurance that God doesn‚Äôt want us to be miserable or accept treatment of inferiority.  The book provides strategies for having a dialogue with your husband and what to do when he becomes combative, defensive, etc. After I finished this book, I had a clear sense of my situation, what steps needed to be taken and what I wanted to ask of my husband if there was a chance that we could repair our marriage.  Excellent read."
I learned from this book. Was disappointed by the fact that means of reconciliation is little spoken of.Kind of cut and dry in approach with an attitude of no hope. My take away anyway.
"Vernick clearly exposes the sinful nature of my marriage. I stayed because I thought I didn't have biblical reasons for leaving. I didn't know he was having affairs with two women I knew well for 20 of our first 38 years of marriage.  Marriage is not supposed to be like I lived for 40 years. I finally was able to see that and do what it took to get him to get help.  I'm staying for now bc he is getting help, but I would not be here if I hadn't gotten the help I needed from this book and others. Companion books to my recovery are ""inside the mind of angry men"" and ""should I stay or should I go"" by Lundy and Patrissi. Praise Lundy, Patrissi and Vernick. They are doing the work that the majority of therapists (we are on #4 now in our two year recovery from his 20 years of affairs) will not do. Men need to read this instead of Sunday school books bc this teaches them what a godly man does not do to his wife."
"I prefer her books over ‚ÄúIs It Me??‚Äù quite a bit!Leslie helped me gain my sanity back, wake up to a healthy and thriving lifestyle of awareness of my own weaknesses ‚Ä¶ how to strengthen my C.O.R.E. and finally make a decision. I chose to stay, acknowledging that it had to become full - time ministry. Taking a temporary break here and there is healthy and we are continuing to work through things."
"I'm a Christian and married to a man who is narcissistic AND passive-aggressive.  Non-christian friends tell me I should leave, Christian friends say I have to stay.  This book explains that I do have a choice.  Right now, I'm praying and my husband is doing much better.  But, the book explains that God loves me and doesn't want me to be unhappy or be treated badly.  I've realized through this book that leaving your husband is not to be taken lightly, but staying in an abusive relationship is also not mandatory."
"Saw Leslie Vernick on a Christian television program and was fascinated to hear someone give an expression to what I had been experiencing in my marriage that has made me so unhappy for many years.  Others like Cloud and Townsend have come close but never called it what it is:  ABUSE.  So many women are not taken seriously unless they are physically beaten, but until you have lived with a verbal, emotional,  and/or financial abuser you have NO IDEA the slow death of a thousand cuts experienced by so many women AND MEN.  This gives the abuse a name and forces it to the light.  Leslie offers ways to have the difficult conversations needed in these relationships, and support.  I have referred a friend."
"This book won't apply to every single person's problems; but it 100% applied to my situation. The writer has a depth and insight into the mindset of many Christian families that surpasses anything I've ever read before. I have read other marriage books, talked to people, and I've never been fully able to understand or put into words my feelings until I found this book. I couldn't understand how my marriage could have become so destructive to my spirit and my relationship with God. The explanation of the difference in a ""Disappointing"" marriage vs a ""Destructive"" one was eye opening, and helped take away some of my guilt for being unhappy. This book was written for me, and I thank God that he's allowed me to find it. I finally feel some hope to turn my life and marriage around. I wish I could give this book to everyone I know!"
This book is absolutely amazing. I bought a copy for myself and my friend and we both recommend it (I've been married 8 years and she's been married 9). Leslie articulates the differences between being a godly wife and creating a biblical marriage (mind-blowing!) and then guides you toward establishing both for yourself.
"What a fantastic resource for Christian women. It deals so thoughtfully and honestly with a very difficult topic. I appreciate how practical it is. I wish I knew about it as soon as it was published. It shed so much light on my dysfunctional relationship, what I need to own, and what I could not change. More than that, it is enabling me to grow as a person during a very challenging time. Check out the author's resources online, they are extremely valuable!"
"I rated this book a 5! Leslie is not a man hater, a holier than thou Christian and will not pander to hurt women, something I feel is enabling at times. She validates the hurt individual, but also clearly outlines EVERYONE'S responsibilities in tough situations. It's important to be validated when you've been deeply hurt and even more important to know how to deal with that hurt in the most Christ like fashion possible for us humans. I've never read anything in my life, out of hundreds of books, that exampled the compassion, wisdom and understanding of hurting couples in marriage or otherwise. Thank you!!! This is certainly evidence that Leslie is a God appointed minister and worth consulting in times of hurt, grief and confusion. Don't think another minute about buying this book...BUY IT!"
"Very well written, covers a great deal of information about living with or separating from a controller abuser spouse. I really liked the chapter at the end ""what to do if there is no change"". Some people never change, as we know, and it is so hard for the victim of the abuse to give up hope for change.This is written with some Christian and Biblical perspective, but definitely not ""preachy"". The author has counseled people in abusive marriages for 30 years, and speaks with much wisdom and truth. It is a very helpful and empowering book. Highly recommended if you are married to an emotional abuser/controller. Many good resources are included at the end. Well worth reading!!!"
"This was recommended to me by someone at my local Calvary Chapel. Such a great book on how to navigate a broken marriage with lots of biblical backup. Contrary to the usual bits of pastoral advice to love them more or be righteous and they will follow suit. How I wished I'd been given this information at the beginning of my marriage, it's a wife's duty to love their husband but also stand up against destructive behaviors - what I love most is this book gives you a plan to do so. This will definitely be at the top of my list of recommendations."
I can't say enough about this book. It's the first piece of Christian material that is honest and doesn't make any promises except for a way out of abuse. That doesn't always end in being together forever but it does end in what God would truly want for us. It covers EVERYTHING. It's a tough read if you're in a hard spot because you have to face the truth whether you're enabling abuse or not but it's real. Definitely the best book I've read on this
I cannot even express how well written and informational this book is. It has helped me tremendously in ministry to women and for my own knowledge. One woman I gave it to has not stopped thanking me for introducing her to this book and the insight that it has given her in her marriage. Truly a God-given gift. Share it with others -- it is so worth it.
"Wow. As it go through the book, she has hit almost every point or issue I have dealt with. Not every case applies to me, but usually the very next one is a direct description. It brings me comfort to know I am not alone.  That is amazing in itself, but the most important is that she does not depart from scripture. She also is writing to the woman who been frustrated by the simplified answers many in conservative Christian churches give. It is hard to gather the courage to take a stand against a spouse who you know is biblically wrong but supposedly in headship over you. I have gone to pastors and a few counselors, but no one has been able to walk me through how to do this.  This book is practical and encouraging and is helping me to keep my heart attitude right with God."
"Without a doubt the best Christian resource on how to set boundaries and stop enabling behavior. Finally, someone is addressing the huge problem of perverting God‚Äôs word into saying we should ignore, tolerate and pray away sin."
"If you can't figure out if you are in an abusive relationship from this book, you just never will get it!  Better than that though, it tells you how to get better from your inside out.  No superficial remedies, it's the real deal if you want to finally grow up and smell the coffee. Mrs. Vernick is a most excellent, wise and reassuring counselor, even with her no-nonsense approach.  In case you are in an abusive marriage, she does empower you and she does give you hope.  If you are not in a bad relationship, it is a good read anyway.  Will make you wonder why some women put up with such bullies, and make you grateful you are not one of them.  The advice she gives you on developing your CORE is useful to everyone & anyone. She is not shy about her Christian roots, but if you are not interested in that part of it, you won't even notice it because she IS NOT the usual senseless, condescending, patronizing, dehumanizing voice you so often hear from 'Christian' corners. A necessary book."
"This book is wonderful.  I loved it just as much as her other book on the Emotionally Destructive Relationship.  This one was good because the author not only showed you how to see if you were in an emotionally destructive marriage, but also gave strategies to deal with the situation and very good safety tips.  I also liked that the author told you how to recognize whether you were in a truly emotionally destructive marriage or whether you were in a marriage that was difficult but not emotionally destructive.  I think that is an important distinction.  I would recommend this book to anybody who is seeking help in their marriage."
"This book gave me the ability to identify what was going on in my marriage, determine whether staying safe and sane was possible, and even resources on safely getting out."
"I would wholeheartedly recommend this book to everyone.  if you are not in a destructive marriage, then you may know someone who is, now or in the future.  Knowing how to help someone and point her in the right direction will make a huge difference.  My pastor's wife read Leslie's book and knew how to council me.  She didn't tell me to try harder or read another book on submission (I'd already read them all anyway).  She listened to me and began to help me build my CORE (explained in the book...basically finding my strength and identity in Christ and doing what is right)."
Living in emotionally and mentally abusive relationship I was looking forward to get this book to find some hope and encouragement. Reading first few chapters added insult to injury.
"The general public thinks of marital abuse as ""physical"" abuse; however there are many different types. Emotional abuse can be just as devisating or even worse than physical abuse; the hateful, hurtful words just keep playing in your mind. The author makes it very clear the difference between a marriage where issues may exist and be worked out and a ""destructive"" marriage. She clarfies the meaning of emtional abuser;  they do not achknowledged what they are doing or feel they don't have to change their abuser behavior. The book give concrete verbage on how to speak to the abuser without using harsh words.If you decide to leave your marriage; the author helps with making a plan. These are the same ""plans"" that are in most books and webpages. She is very sensative to a woman's financial; social and economic situations; and this includes those with small children."
"Only halfway through this book and love it, can't put it down. Wish I had this book years ago. Enduring 20 years of verbal and emotional abuse had clouded my relationship with God. This book helped me see God's heart in all this. I felt so far from it from poor advice given in the past, submit more, pray harder and no change happening can get disheartening. Not sure my marriage is salvageable yet at this point but I feel I am starting to heal, something I could not do before Thank you Leslie!"
"This is a great book. I highly recommend it, whether you are in a destructive marriage, helping someone in a destructive marriage, or trying to prevent your marriage (or future marriage) from becoming destructive. Leslie's advice sound, as is the theology it's based on."
So nice to hear God loves women as his children more than marriage. He wants us to be safe and taken care of if we are married. He wants us to be partners and treasure each other. Just because he doesn‚Äôt hit you doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt suffer from abuse. Learn to take care of YOU in Christ and then see if your marriage can change for the better! It‚Äôs hard to change those patterns we have done for years.... but great help to change yourself and then you can see if this marriage is not healthy for you.
"This book came to me at a time I had been separated from my husband of 30 years because of emotional abuse.Physical abuse is easier to explain and mostly heals but emotional abuse is subtle and much harder to explain and deal with. This book confirmed what the Lord had been telling me, No one deserves to be treated with disrespect or dismissed repeatedly.  My husband read this book at the same time and after 7 months of seperation he moved back in last week and things are good. We have a lot of work to do but I would highly recommend this book to PASTORS OR ANYONE WHO DOES COUNSELLING. BEING A CHRISTIAN WIFE I HAD A HARD TIME BELIEVING THE LORD WOULD WANT US TO SEPERATE BUT GOD SHOWED ME HIS DAUGHTER DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE TREATED THIS WAY. . ."
I loved this book. I read it about 5 years ago. I learned how to think critically in regards how to navigate difficult behaviors. I learned to take responsibility for my thoughts and behaviors. My favorite part of the book was the built in self reflecting questions and prayers. I like this author and have no problem recommending this book to anyone struggling in their marriage.
"Great, Great book on getting yourself ""well"" FIRST! Before dealing with a dysfunctional relationship or marriage. It caused ME, a healthcare professional with a master degree, come to the ""TRUTH"", that I needed to seek professional counseling, to find out WHY I had tolerated my spouse's emotional and mental abuse for 30 plus years!! It is very difficult, if not impossible for two dysfunctional individuals to have a healthy marriage. Two sick people cannot get each other healthy, ONE of them has to be ""well"". After 60 years of life, I am on the way to ""self discovery"". I also like that Leslie's FIRST suggestion is not divorce. Like she states in her book; ""if you are going to stay, stay well, if you are going to leave the marriage, leave well."""
"""The Emotionally Destructive Marriage"" really nails what often goes on behind closed doors in marriage as well as where counsel is often misguided. This resource affirmed the destructive behaviors of both my spouse and I, as well as encouraged me to work to become stronger and emotionally healthier for me, regardless of what my spouses actions are.Thank you, Leslie Vernick- you may have just saved my sanity through this text."
"This book is amazing.  I lived through one very emotiionally destructive marriage for 29 years, and now find myself in another one.  Not quite as destructive as the first, but this book has been instrumental in understanding my part in this dynamic and what steps can be taken to try to save this one.  Ms. Vernick is a talented writer and makes her points so succinctly.  Everything is backed with solid Biblical principals, reasoning, and specific verses.  She tackles the subject from every angle and gives practical, step by step direction that can be used to deal with an emotional abuser.  I thank God for this book and its author, as it's giving me hope for the first time in years.  Since I purchased it for myself, I've given two copies away to friends who are facing similar situations."
"This is a WONDERFUL book...! Leslie does such a great job going step by step to help you diagnose your marriage and help you to take appropriate, Godly steps to recognize and make positive changes. I love the fact that she does not claim that to be Godly woman must be stepped on.  She does a great job using scripture to help women prove their worth and make a positive difference in their relationships.  She is so full of wisdom and ""real"" advice to help.. wonderful, wonderful... I only wish there was a workbook with it..."
"Having been separated for 3 months after having endured 29 years of infidelity, deceit,lies and absolute heartache, this book came as a heaven sent.The structured flow of the book with many and varied study cases as well as helpful guides, makes this book a distinct source in helping to guide you through probably the toughest life decision - to stay or to leave your destructive marriage.What I've found most comforting through reading this book, is that there is hope for your situation; whether you stay or go."
Even if your marriage is happy and not emotionally destructive; this books contains wonderful and life changing advice on communication. If you are in an emotionally destructive or abusive relationship or know someone who is; then this book is a must have!
"Love this book! If you‚Äôre going through a rough patch in your marriage and you‚Äôre not sure whether to stay or go, this book will help you along the way! It doesn‚Äôt give you the answers, but it‚Äôs filled with scripture and what God says about divorce and about what a Godly marriage should look like. The author lets you decide and doesn‚Äôt make you feel like one way is better than the other. Don‚Äôt hesitate and pick one up ASAP! (And pay for the extra quick shipping, it‚Äôs totally worth it!)"
"I wish I had it before I got married 13 years ago.and will never got married to him. Or know the how to survive better. ..  And hope this book get in the hands of all counselors, Pastors, friends of loves ones going trough this.  Going through a Divorce for over a year now with a law enforcement man and let me tell you has not been pretty, I did everything I could and nothing that I did was good enough, he's like a camellia got people from Church friends etc. In his side and talk against me. Maybe because I gave him much info. So he turned around now I'm the bad person etc...but praise God people that knows me they know is not true, so I got lots of support and now I'm healing mentally for all this abuse, and physically,  I need to be strong for my 3 kiddos : ))))  Get this book is such a Blessing and strongly recommend it to you. You are not crazy, worry about your self, taking care first well after God first. And don't stop praying for this person that his or her world is so much different then yours.Where the: me, my self and I is their priority numero 1 in their lives. Thanks Leslie for caring and taking the time to Bless us : )))))"
Excellent book that uses scripture to discuss what God says about marriage!  Debunks myths and sets the record straight using biblical verses to guide great learning and discussion!
This really helped me to understand although there are problems going on in a marriage that infidelity was not my fault. He chose to do that because he was hurting from old wounds as a child. We are in the process of counseling and I believe this is a book that has helped feel stronger and not a victim.
"Love this book.  The first Christian book that I have personally read that doesn't say ""if the woman changes A,B and C, then her husband will come around"".  Unfortunately, that is not always the case.  This book talks about physical abuse, emotional abuse, financial, and just emotional indifference.  It does give some guidance on what to do to try and make the marriage better BUT it also admits that not all people change and not all marriages can safely be saved."
This book is amazing!  I would highly recommend this book to anyone is struggling in there marriage.  It helps to give voice and validate so many of the feelings I had.  She also gives practical ways to implement change in your marriage.  This book is a God Sent!
A friend of mine told me about this book. I had gone to the local Christian bookstore to purchase it but the was sold out of the book. I purchased it on Amazon while walking through the store and the book arrived 2 days later! Amazon Prime is the best! This book is an easy and enjoyable read about a very difficult subject.  This is a very serious subject and she addresses these issues in an organized and smoothly written manner. She is knowledgeable and gives lots of illustrations throughout the book. I highly recommend this book.
"Leslie must have been a fly on the wall of my 20-year destructive marriage. I've seen my marriage for what it was and recognized my part in allowing it to be so unhealthy for so long. I appreciated that Leslie didn't preach black and white in a gray area, but rather used Scripture and probing questions to help  draw my own conclusions. My biggest takeaway is that God loves me as a person more than he loves the institution of  marriage. God wants me to be treated with respect!! I wish every church leader would read this enlightening book."
If you are in a marriage that is causing you pain because it has become abusive in any way this is a must read. This book is enlightening and informative. It‚Äôs self-discovery as well as Godly guidance on how to navigate through a broken marriage. It is a book that sets a good foundation biblically on how to deal with an abusive spouse. If you are ready to find answers this book will confirm them to.
"I haven't read many of these kinds of books, so I decided to start with a few highly rated, very inexpensive books. While this book went into a lot of  areas that don't apply to my marriage, It was very instructional in helping to specify the areas That do need attention.For me, the first questionnaire was by far the most useful, important part of the book. I am not religious, so the many Bible references meant little to me. However, regardless of any religious basis, the advice for what is needed to improve a marriage in trouble was very good throughout.Last, for the price, what do you have to lose? If your marraige is having difficulty, but you thing ""Emotionally Destructive? No way."" Then give the book a chance. Read through to the 16-question section. It should give you some good talking points with your spouse.[Note: although I am a guy and this is written to talk directly to women, this is made clear up front which made it easy for me to turn things around as I read.]"
Seems accurate (coming from this mans perspective). Does not address the other side of the coin - when the wife is emotionally abusive as well. I feel that would make this a more complete book.  Posted by the husband.
"Is your marriage destructive or just disappointing? This book takes you through the difference between both and then biblical walks you through the process of responding well in the disappointments pointing out where responsibility must be taken and what can only be given over to the Lord. For women in destructive marriages, you are challenged to stay well or leave well and shown what that looks like and why women do one over the other. Great counseling book!"
I couldn't put this book down. This book was an answered prayer. It completely described my husband and his  defective thinking. It gave me validation and a voice.Both of which disappeared as far as my husband was concerned.. I was not following God's marital arrangement as my husband understood it and to hell what I understood... Thank you Leslie Vernick.
"I wish I had this book years ago. The younger me would have really benefited from it. Today I am using it to help other women.I wanted advise that was align with the Word of God, Leslie did this. Quoting Scriptures in every chapter."
There are many books out there about abusive relationships but finally here is one that addresses the inner bruises women carry and endure in marriage due to fear and miscommunication for their belief. I believe every Christian s Tina woman who is struggling and hurting from the emotional pain of a relationship needs this book.
"""Healthy relationships are at the heart of the biblical message because God created us to live connected to one another,"" writes Leslie Vernick in her book, The Emotionally Destructive Relationship (2007). ""We Christians do not always know how to recognize destructive relationships or validate the deep emotional pain they inflict, nor do we necessarily know how to fix things.""  In her newest book, The Emotionally Destructive Marriage, Leslie narrows the focus, taking the 'seeing it, stopping it and surviving it' of her initial book deeper into the marriage relationship, exposing one of the most unrecognized problems in the church today.  'We become who we are in the context of our relationships,' she writes.  If you find yourself disappearing from your own life, you might be involved-- not simply in a difficult or disappointing marriage, but a destructive one.  This book clearly defines the difference, reveals ways women unknowingly enable what is happening, and provides strategies to learn to tell the truth to themselves, wake up their partners and invite them into godly change.  ‚ÄúSacrificing yourself by allowing someone to sin against you to keep peace in your marriage is never a wise choice‚Äînot for you, not for your husband, not for your marriage. God calls us to be biblical peacemakers, not peace keepers or peace fakers...""  In an era when so many families are influenced by the home school/home church movements and a whole new generation of men & women are growing up with a new understanding of how headship and submission play out; in an age when counselors and church leadership unknowingly become part of the problem when they do not recognize or acknowledge what is happening-- The Emotionally Destructive Marriage becomes a 'must read'.  Click on <FocusontheFamily.com> to listen to Leslie's interviews concerning The Emotionally Destructive Relationship: Finding Freedom from Destructive Relationships Part 1 and Part 2, and this, her newest book, The Emotionally Destructive Marriage: Reclaiming Hope and Safety in a Destructive Marriage Part 1 and 2."
"Very good book. Living in a destructive marriage can leave you feeling like you are going crazy. This book will help give you some clarity and understanding to some very difficult circumstances. The author writes in a very clear and understandable way and helps you start on your journey to find help, understanding, and ultimately your path to healing. I highly recommend!"
"Wow, what a comprehensive manual on this much misunderstood yet needed subject.  It was so refreshing to read and see in manuscript what I've believed and taught based on biblical principles and the function of the Holy Ghost.  Every church, ministry, single and married couple should read this book, absolutely exceptional.  Well balanced teaching on regarding a growing issue in the church.  God never intended for anyone to suffer in a manner that is detrimental to the Spirit, Soul or Body.  I highly recommend this book.  Thank you Leslie for bring Truth to the Body of Christ."
I practically could not put down this book! I have been looking for years for a book that helps me understand why?! Why I stay? Why I allow my spouse to talk to me that way?! This book is an excellent tool to help you prepare for decisions you need to make. Thank you Leslie for your wonderful vision and words!!
"This book needs to be read by every counsellor every where, but especially Christian ones. Too much ignorance about emotionally destructive marriages has prevailed for far too long, doing such ungodly damage to so many. This author offers easy-to-read descriptions of different forms of emotional abuse and a very balanced and Scriptural approach for the abused partner. Oh, that every pastor, every counselor and every woman who finds herself in this trap would read this excellent book!"
"I so appreciated this book. Not only does it provide a quiz in the beginning to truly rate the issues in your marriage: as unhappy, unhealthy or destructive but it also comes from a Christian perspective on this silent problem. It helped me understand what was really going on in my marriage, helped me heal personally, gave me peace that Christ cares for me when this is happening, and how to move forward."
"I so appreciate Leslie's approach to a very difficult and controversial subject. Too many in the church have misunderstood and / or misapplied the teachings of Scripture, counseling women to tolerate, enable, or endure abuse -- as if that's what God requires of them -- when offering these women help, support, encouragement, and protection is what Scripture requires of us! Leslie's advice is thoroughly Biblical and thoroughly practical. This is an invaluable resource for abused women, their friends and family, and anyone who counsels, works with or ministers to women."
I pass this book out to every woman in an emotionally destructive marriage! I escaped one myself and Leslie Vernick is a warrior woman! So thankful for her truth in this book!
"The Leslie Vernick books are wonderful for those looking to educate themselves on emotional abuse, unhealthy patterns, and it's destructiveness in relationships. To know the signs and symptoms is so helpful and to learn what next steps you should take to stay or leave, keeping your sanity through it all. She has a wonderful approach based biblical principles. No guilt, shame, or condemnation."
"Leslie's voice of insight and wisdom rings out in a secular world that does not understand the deep effects of emotional abuse and, more importantly, in and to a Christian world that has long-since (erroneously) deemed women as second class citizens. Read this to receive affirmation, confirmation, conviction, information, and inspiration to be the fullest you possible, healthy and covered in grace whether you ""stay or go."""
"Great resource for those who are struggling in an emotionally destructive marriage, or who think their marriage might be but aren't sure."
Highly recommend for anyone interested in the topic of domestic violence combined with a Christian perspective. She offers great insights and wisdom to women who are in an abusive marriage. Incredibly helpful for my professional career as a therapist but is written for anyone to read. Great read!
I must have highlighted more than 100 passages. I will be contacting the author for appropriate use of their work - edifying and undoes all the gaslighting and brainwashing that keeps us bound.
"Gives hope that you're not alone in this; that you're not crazy to feel so hurt when there may not be physical marks. There are questions to determine if there are areas for concern and, if so, in what ways.  Then the author provides explanation, advice, and hope for life with or without your spouse.  The book is Christian and that isn't the primary focus so it will be applicable to folks of all or religions."
"This book was able to speak the truth clearly, validating what I thought I saw in our marriage and putting names to it so that I could recognize what was happening and begin to process it. As I understood what was occurring, that gave me the ability to make choices within it. It enabled me to respond appropriately to destructive behavior around me and to stop making threats and being angry about it all. She understood what was happening, gave good clear examples of others going through it and told me clearly what my choices were. I'd recommend it to any wives that are beyond frustrated with their husbands and their words and behaviors toward them."
I whish I would have had this book years a go! Exactly what I was looking for! Great advice!
Completely enjoying this book. Not only am I using it in my counseling sessions but did a live stream making references to the information here
Leslie has a good way with words that makes even a difficult subject easier to understand.
"Really a great book!  Well-structured, easy to read, perfect for the ""lay person.""  As you read this, if you're in this situation, you're likely to feel like the author had a spy-cam into your private life as a source for some of her examples and descriptions.  The approach of the book is great in that it doesn't assume to make any decision about your marriage for you, because really no one should do that but you, but it does provide you with a different perspective, one that validates that what you're going through in your marriage is not ""normal"" or ""okay.""  Then it gives you some tools and direction for how to proceed depending upon what you decide.  I think it's also a great reference tool to use with individual or marital counseling, to give voice to your personal feelings. For me, it gave me the peace of mind to be able to go forward, regardless of whether that ultimately ends in a healthy marriage or divorce, knowing that at least I'm not crazy for feeling like I do."
"This book changed my life. As a Christian women, it was hard for me to let go and let God without shame. My life is dramatically changed thanks to this book and Leslie!"
"I think Leslie's insight is profound and powerful. Like so many women, I felt that working harder, loving deeper and having more faith and trust in God was all I needed to help the difficulties in my marriage. I now have a clear understanding  that while that is virtuous in most circumstances it was not appropriate for my situation. Tools are given to guide you realistically through the process of restoration, either as a couple or a single.Please allow yourself to embrace God's truth about your situation, it is not your fault and if you are abused, he hates what has and is happening to you."
Read this book! It will give you the strength to stand up for yourself and not allow your spouse to mistreat you.
"I have just finished reading this book and am left with much food for thought.  Leslie Vernick has supported all comments with scriptural references, rather than leaving the reader thinking she is just another secular counselor.  As a Christian, I found this helpful and uplifting, giving me a clearer picture of a Christian marriage.  Everyone should read this book to avoid pitfalls and affirm what's right in the relationship."
"This is a wonderful book! I was at a loss about my marriage in 2014 when this book was recommended to me after I called the Focus on the Family helpline. Before even starting counseling for myself, reading this book was my first step in admitting the terrible state my marriage was in - 8 years after we said ""I do"". Fast forward two years, and after a 1.5 year separation, lots of individual counseling for both of us, and reaching a point of reconciliation, things are much improved. The verbal abuse is gone, and my husband is constantly working on managing his temper and behavior. I have owned my part of the marriage and adjusted my expectations of my husband. This process also made us realize that my husband has a personality disorder that needs attention and treatment from here on out. Each person must come to his or her own conclusion of what to do, and this book really helped me to take a honest look at my situation. Thank you Leslie for your honest and empowering words!"
wonderful book that helped me to see how much my marriage was damaging me and how manipulative my husband was being.
I'm not done with this book but so far it has helped me learn alot about what I'm going through. My husband says things exactly like it says in the book. It is good for a lot of different reasons to help relationships out if only you could get the other person to read it.
"Best book ever! It sure opened my eyes! There's a lot of people who need to read this. It really helped me understand my situation and gave me clear steps to be free from the turmoil of our emotionally destructive relationship. Leslie clearly points out what can be done to turn it around, or what you need to do to get away from the destruction if nothing is changing. Thank you!"
"The Lord brought this book to me just in time; living away from home as a result of a destructive relationship, I needed this to help me understand the process. It has been invaluable, tough and healing. Thank u."
I strongly suggest any woman going through a destructive marriage to read this book!
"This book was recommended to me by my counselor.  It was agonizing to see my life in print, but at the same time come face to face with truths that set me free!  Sadly, this issue gets shoved under the carpet too often or not dealt with biblically.  This book was helpful as I start this journey and think it would be a great book for others in a difficult marriage situation."
Really liked this one. Good information on identifying abuses but good advice for managing it in a healthy way and stay in your marriage if you want to.
"Emotional destruction in a marriage is often unseen because it is only practiced in private.  This book diagnosis the illness and the process for healing.  Leslie Vernick never leads to a quick move that is foolish.  She directs us to a strong walk with the Lord and to be led by the Holy Spirit first in each day we live and each decision we make.  She never allows you to wallow in your self pity, but to get your heart right and to follow the Lord's leading."
Great book
Must read for those in or working with those in controlling relationships.
Bought because of author and product summary I read.  Happy with purchase.
"This is a very well organized, easy to understand book that clearly defines and identifies destructive behaviors in any relationship but particularly in marriage. Though written primarily to women/wives it is also very helpful for men as well. Varnick helps readers understand a healthy, biblical perspective for dealing with abusive relationships."
Awesome!
"I wish I had read this book sooner.After 15 years of an emotionally abusive marriage, and years of thinking, ""if I could just be a better wife, I could make our marriage better,"" or ""why can't I just 'do the right thing' like he is says I fail to do?"" Leslie's book provided clarity, direction, and council based in Biblical truth.If you are struggling in your marriage and are seeking God's will, please read this book!"
"Excellent book, very helpful information."
"Purchased this to follow along with a friend of mine who was reading it and is in counselling for a toxic marriage.  Eye opening, inspirational, scripturally based, with a refreshing bent on the truth of the gospel (which is our God-given dignity).  Highly recommend it for Christians and non-Christians alike because of the principals of truth that are universal."
A wonderful book....so helpful when dealing with a tough situation in our family!!
"This was eye opening to me. Wish I'd had it years ago. Maybe my marriage to an emotionally destructive man would have been saved. I knew couples counseling was a bad fit for us, but didn't know what else to do. Neither did our church. I come from a pastor father and marriage counselor mother and it should be mandatory for them to hear this, because it is hidden, misdiagnosed, and people are unprepared to help. I hope to use it as a basis for a support group in the grief ministry I'm helping to launch in my church. Love Leslie's books and view!"
This book saved me from losing myself in my failing marriage. I‚Äôm still married but not co dependent like I was.
"One of the best self help books I've ever read. Even though there are many Biblical references, you don't have to be a Christian to read it. It's very comprehensive and easy to follow!"
"This book has inspired me, as a Christian, that putting up with abusal behavior from my husband is not what God designed as a marriage under His roof.  It has taught me to not put so much importance to how bad my husband treats me and to turn to Him. If in danger leave.  If husband is treating me badly, he is not holding up his end of the covenant in matrimony.  Thank you so much for this book!!!!!"
This is an amazing resource for hurting marriages. I wish every pastor would read this book as part of their training.
"Very sound Biblical advice on how to recognize, admit, and begin to work through the healing on destructive marriages. A must read for alll pastors, elders, and women's leaders in Christian churches."
"Really helps to understand some of the things going on in your house, and some actions you can take to start to repair them."
"This is SUCH an important book for anyone who is in an emotionally destructive marriage or walking alongside someone who is.  For anyone who is looking for a biblical perspective on abuse this one is the one to read.  Full of truth, and also full of hope."
"This book has helped point me to a far more loving and caring Jesus than what I believed about Him growing up. Turns out God does care for those suffering and feeling stuck in destructive relationship patterns. This book helped me start to find my voice, place healthy boundaries in my life and learn how to love an abusive spouse."
Great book. really helped me. Great tips and support for women in tough situations.
"Please keep looking at this book and evaluate it for your self.  Very good information about abuse especially in Christian families.  Abuse is second nature to some husbands.  The feel pressure to conform to the world and abuse their wives. It is carnal, it is sin, and it is not excusable in a man of God to abuse his wife whom he must love ""as himself""!!"
Good
Great practical advice very useful when you are overwhelmed and do not what to do but know you need to do something. Helps define emotions in difficult situations and does not blame it all on one side of the coin. Would highly recommend to all struggling wives
"So accurate, it is scary.  I'm so grateful this is now available to those that need to see it in print, in order to grasp it as truth."
"For the first time, I felt like someone understood my situation. Very helpful advice and all from a biblical perspective. I highly recommend. Her support group is good as well."
The ugly truth of emotional abuse is discussed in this book. Some ways of how to make the abuser aware of his/her abuse is suggested and I think it is very helpful. I bought extra for friends in abusive relationships who will always downplay the abuse.
Helpful.  Good resource.
This book truly was what I needed to help me get out of my emotionally destructive marriage. I never wanted to believe I was severely depressed by my husband's constant verbal abuse. It helped me realize this is not how a marriage is suppose to be and it was time to get out. Not just for myself but also remove my children from witnessing the destruction before it was too late.
Learning to underst6tge brokenness in my marriage and how a lot of this can only be repaired if two people in the relationship works on themselves! Separately! This book can help anyone but it is women's read.
Solid Christian advice -  so practical and helpful
This book was instrumental in my decision to get out of my destructive marriage. There was Scripture that supported the freedom to leave with a clear conscience because God isn‚Äôt okay with the abuse either. I‚Äôm free!!!
This book was extremely helpful in understanding how to navigate this season of my marriage. It stimulated ideas of what I could focus on at a time when I feel unheard and stuck.
"This book is an excellent tool to help those caught in an unhealthy relationship to see it as such and articulate and develop an action plan for the healing of their relationships.  Practical and more importantly it lends itself to the author‚Äôs website with many resources.  Pastors, friends of those in caught in a destructive relationship should take advantage of this material"
"Very insightful and well-written.  I highly recommend this to understand others' relationships as well as to evaluate your own and redirect your own actions and thoughts to have the best relationship possible, or to leave one that is destructive.  I appreciate the Christian principles and sound reasoning."
Wow what a wake up call.  Finally somebody helped me understand what was going on and it was OK for me to feel the way I felt. finally I had some confirmation on my difficult  marriage of 25 years.  The book Gave me strength to stand firm and now I feel like there might be hope for my marriage.  Thank you Leslie  And God bless you!
"Leslie gives good practical steps to address the emotional abuser as well as reminding the reader to keep their own emotions in check.  Lots of good Biblical backup and verses.  Helps the one being abused to understand and sort through their own feelings, attitudes and emotions without condemnation.  This book is helpful to anyone in an emotionally destructive  marriage, especially for a Christian man or woman who has been told God hates divorce, just try harder, stick it out, etc. etc."
"After 49 years of being married to an emotional destructive man I divorced him last year.  I kept thinking I could save this marriage, I must try harder, I'm doing something wrong.  All lies.  I read this book last month and saw myself in every page , this is my story.  After struggling all those yearsand still feeling unsure that I did the right thing, this book was the confirmation that brought me peace because  It put the spotlight on the real problem in my marriage  , him.I bought 3 books and plan to give one to my pastor and have the others handy to pass on to who ever the Lord has cross my path. Praise God and thank you Ms. Vernick"
"God cares about one's sanity and safety. The reader will either learn to stay well or to leave well. Thank you Leslie Vernick for an amazingly helpful book! By the way, it could save lots of Christian marriages!"
Great read! Every couple should read this book
This book was a great resource for anyone going through a rough journey in their marriage.
Excellent author. All her material is good!
Good book
Well thought thru and communicated ideas
Interesting and enlightening
"Incredible insight and truth!  Leslie tactfully, diplomatically, and discerningly approaches some really tough stuff.  I HIGHLY recommend this book for anyone who is married.  If you aren't in an emotionally destructive marriage, it's good to have this in your back pocket for a friend who might be.  It's an excellent resource."
I have enjoyed reading this book. It has been a great help to me personally and as a resource as I talk with women and abuse. I have already recommended this book to many of my friends. I think this book takes a healthy approach to emotional abuse and deals with both individuals. The author also has videos that are a wonderful resource for struggling relationships.
Lots of good information
"Love Leslie, she truly cares about people and puts abuse in perspective with what the Bible says"
"This author does a very good job of helping diagnose unhealthy marriage, while offering clear insights and counsel on how to deal with that marriage and become a whole person.  I highly recommend this book to those who are in a destructive marriage, as well as for those who want to understand and help those who are in such relationships."
"Leslie brings a plan forward for you to recognize what happened, what you need to do to help yourself and your family when you don't know where to turn. She helps husbands recognize how to love heir wives in a biblical way, marriage the way God intends for couples to live together."
"I read this because a relative was in an emotionally destructive marriage.  It was difficult to realize what they were going through but the book allowed me to gain empathy for her, and better ways to encourage and support her."
I am still reading this book and so far so good. I got divorced after 28 years of marriage and an unhealthy emotional marriage.
"After reading this, I feel like I‚Äôm not alone anymore. Someone understands me, what I‚Äôve been living in, and that I‚Äôm not crazy! Very informative and helpful book, don‚Äôt hesitate to buy and read!"
"Leslie has really opened  my eyes  to how emotionally  destructive  my marriage  is. She includes excellent  examples.  Praying  that  my husband  will  open his heart enough  to  realize  and admit that his behavior is unacceptable, and respond well to my request  to  work  on  our marriage."
Excellent product and service.  Great
I work with Christian women in difficult marriages and so many of them have been given bad counsel from well meaning but misinformed misinters and friends.  Leslie gets this right.  I would recommend to anyone who can't put a finger on what is wrong in their marriage.  It will provide clarity.
"I have been in an emotionally destructive marriage for 21 years. The Lord showed me truth through this book and by listening to Leslie online. I learned that I am not crazy, my husbands behavior was wrong-not pleasing to the Lord, and that I can do something about it.I asked my husband to find an apartment and go to counseling. He is doing as I asked. I believe God has used this separation to get his attention and as motivation to make changes. I hope for reconciliation but I know that if it doesn't happen, God will not be disappointed in me.I have experienced much healing since reading this book."
"Lifesaver! We have been to counseling and talked with pastors and have received well meaning but erred advice. Leslie gets it, this book helped put a name to what we are going through. Finally answers and tools to stop toxic behaviors!"
"A lot of scripture with explanations, scripts, escape plan help and applicable tools.  No more quilt just truth."
Author has good understanding of toxic relationships; she explains to us what we already know all too well from experience.
Excellent book on DV and solid Biblical solutions.  I especially like the author's reference about unconditional love verses unconditional relationship.  Many of my clients are in DV relationships and are looking for answers.  I will certainly recommend this book when using bibliotherapy.
GOOD
Best book I have ever read about the subject. Therapeutic for women in this situation and perfect for individuals seeking to be a helpful and non-judgemental friend.
Very good book on helping women confront emotional abuse in their marriage and constructive ways to deal with their husbands. Have read through it twice as it is so helpful.
This book contains olutions and constructive spiritually based action plans to heal emotionally destructive marriages. Not only does Leslie Vernick identify what emotional destructiveness is she shows honest ways to deal with it.
Great Read!!This is a great book by Leslie Vernick.  I am going through a rough time in my marriage and this book has validated the way I have been feeling. I have talked to my pastor's etc. about my marriage and what I could do to get my husband to change his ways and was told also to continue to pray and he would eventually change but that has not happened. Thanks for a book that tells it like it is in a Christian Way!!Cathy G.
"THIS. YES, 1000 times yes."
"Everyone should read this book before considering a trip down the aisle. Like all of Vernick's book, it is sharply written, poignant and a must for all who need to survive a destructive marriage. If there was a 10-star rating, this is an 11. I bought multiple copies of this and the companion book on relationships."
"I got this book to better understand where my friend was coming from in her marriage.  I have found Leslie Vernick to be extremely beneficial in handling situations in a godly manner, one that benefits both sides of the issue, not just the victim."
"This book is an answer to prayer!  I had so many questions about what marital abuse looked like,  how to handle marital abuse, and especially what does God think of it.  I received so many answers to those questions after reading this book.  It has given me a new perspective on how God views abuse and how He cares so deeply for me!!"
"I was amazed at how this book seemed to be written, almost verbatim, about my life!  Leslie gives you validation for what you have gone through and steps, real ones, to fix a marriage.  If your marriage is beyond repair, like mine, because of a purposeful refusal from my husband, she tells you how to get out safely and biblically!  I have already sung the praises of this wonderful book to everyone around me!  If you're on the fence about buying this book, don't be...buy it!!!  You won't regret it!"
"It takes a couple or few reads to grasp all and gain strength. So much worth it- no one has had the courage to write in such subject as Leslie. The situation of a destructive marriage is daunting. But Leslie keeps you going and encourages you to find strength to seek help, to find strength in God His Word."
This book has been both enlightening and heart breaking as I realize the true condition of my marriage. I am very hopeful in the solutions she offers. This is an excellent book full of godly wisdom.
"Author takes on some issues in marriages, I have not seen in other marriage books. Differentiates between a disappointing and destructive marriage. Includes indifference (which I see as destructive through the lack of interest, thus neglect) as an aspect of destructive marriages. Also, provides brilliantly detailed, practical information on how to deal with a physically destructive marriage. Really well done!"
Excellent resource for those needed help to understand the impact of a toxic marriage and how to address the topic from a Christian perspective. Very grateful for Leslie's work and wisdom.
Really great read. Solid information. Highly recommend this.
Really liked the honest and upfront approach of the author to something that is too often ignored or hidden especially in Christian circles. Found really helpful her pragmatic approach that gives hope to all people in marriages that are less than perfect.
Easy read. Easy listen. I'm now a huge fan of Leslie Vernick.
Wonderful book for women living in a marriage where it seems like things aren't balanced or healthy. This book really helped me to identify some of my behaviors and has really helped me to realize that what I was going through is NOT normal or healthy.
This book does a great job of describing what God intends the marriage relationship to be like. It gives practical and biblical teaching on how to navigate a tumultuous relationship.  I would recommend it to any couple who desires to grow in a Godly marriage.
"Biblically sound, full of love, truth, and compassion, and very practical - I have recommended this book to every woman I know in an abusive or destructive marriage. My mom has been in this kind of marriage for years and she couldn't stop singing Leslie Vernick's praises.Be aware that the author believes that the Bible allows for abuse as grounds for divorce. Whether you agree or disagree, this book is an invaluable resource and should be on the bookshelf of everyone who is, knows, or counsels someone in an abusive/destructive marriage."
So grateful for this book. It was like my story was put into words on a page....so encouraged that someone could truly understand. There is so much healing when someone finally GETS IT and you learn that you are not alone and that it's not okay. This should be taught on so much more in the church. Praise God for this writing!
"Verbal abuse from God's perspective. Insightful, practical, validating. I'm grateful for this resource."
"Amazing, so empowering"
"I got so much out of this book. I could relate to a lot of the scenarios. It's written in a down to earth, easy to understand way. The author is truly trying to help you realize your value and worth while living in a marriage that is constantly tearing you down.  She knows how to get the truth across to people who are hurting. Amazing book!!!"
"Well written and instructive, I couldn't begin to say enough about this book! So unique; refreshing; HELPFUL!! . I've read just about every marriage book out there and none of them helped me understand the situation I was in and what to do about it better than this book. I believe Chapter 6, When Trying Harder Becomes Destructive, was the most helpful for me. It explained how trying harder; taking more responsibility for my marriage was actually having a REVERSE effect and making things worse. SO glad Leslie wrote this book and find her blog very helpful as well--not just for marriage but all relationships."
Didn‚Äôt get it
Best book every hands down.
"When you are in a place in your life that you don't know where to turn for answers, Leslie's book will help you see through the fog and find the path that God is leading you towards. This book does not tell you what to do, it helps you to see right where you are and what options are in front of you and the consequences of each action. I believe this book should be on every bookshelf in the church."
"Such a paradigm shift, how did we get so far off the mark of God's desire for marriage? This book helps you see the difference between a ""C"" marriage and a ""D"" , and  boy are they different. This book helps you understand how conventional practices can actually be detrimental. A must read if you are not seeing the power of God working in your marriage."
"Read this after having already left my marriage, and it reassured me that my decision was correct. This would have been a great book to discover while still in the marriage for perspective and better ways of coping. Highly recommend."
Amazing book!  Helps heal from pain and teach you what you can do.
Amazing insight that I haven't seen or heard anywhere else.  I like her identification of the problems and step by step approach toward solutions!
Hard book to read because you have to look hard at your relationship but a great book.
great!
Fully appreciate the biblical insights to abuse and how a Christian can move toward God while struggling in abuse. Excellent resource for pastors and church and lay leaders
This book presents an anecdotally accurate and Biblically sound analysis of the dynamic that occurs with an emotionally abusive spouse.  Excellent for the clinician as well as for the individual effected by the situation.
"Read all of her books, her blog, and her newsletter. Her voice will bless, inform, and encourage. The perspective she brings to the Christian counseling table is unique in that she advocates for the destroyed, while teaching how to rebuild."
I highly recommend that this book is read before you decide to get a divorce. It might help save the marriage. If not at least you tried everything.
This book helped me to understand myself why I lived a codependent life and gave me the tools to break the chains of abuse. Thank you for this book and may the Lord continue to bless and keep you
Best book I've read on abuse from a Christian perspective. I have given many of them away.
"This book has brought me sanity in a very sad and hurting time in my life,  as well as, the authors blogs. This is a must for anyone who is experiencing any kind of abuse in their marriage."
What an inspirational and well written book. So many women who need help and don't ever get it. This bookpoints out what needs to be done when destruction occurs.
excellent book
"It was like she was looking directly into my soul, writing my story.  Excellent advice given in order to get through and get on with my life.  I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone in ANY type of abusive marriage."
Great words of wisdom
Godly perspective without demanding that a woman remain in a dangerous situation.
"My Christian counselor highly recommended I look over Leslie Vernick's resources (I started with her website a few weeks ago & have just ordered & received 2 of her books).Biblically based and encouraging, this far. Go to her website for free resources on the topic."
Must read for anybody out there feeling lost &/or trapped in an unhealthy marriage.
This is an EXCELLENT book for everyone.  It talks about specific issues that often come up in difficult marriages and how to deal with these issues in a healthy God honoring way.  This is the ONLY Christian marriage book I have found that actually has been useful.
"Excellent well thought out book.  As a therapist, I found it to be descriptive, and easy to understand.  One I could recommend for the lay person, for a friend, or a counselee."
"As counselors, my husband and I appreciate the honesty and forthrightness of this author to ""tell it like it is.""  No one should have to be abused in any manner, and this guides anyone who is in need of help."
"Yep your not crazy there is emotional abuse out there and Leslie will help you see what is happening, what your options are and how to go about implementing those options. Worth every bit of money you spend. Enlightening and insightful!"
Amazing insight. So helpful as I navigate through an emotionally destructive marriage.  Packed with truth and wisdom.  Thank you!
This is a great book .  Will gladly recommend it to others who help couples whose marriages are in trouble.  Shipment right on time.
This book was amazing! Highly recommended!
I wish I read this book 5 years ago. Maybe then things would have been different. Her love of God & the truth gave me hope for a better tomorrow with or without my husband.
"I've read great books that have been helpful:""Boundaries in Marriage"" ""When godly People do Ungodly Things"" ""Breaking Free"" these books have saved my marriage.  But something was still missing. I must of read over 50 books on marriage trying to figure out how to be a better wife.  Now I know why,few helped!The books I mentioned above are a must read. They were part of my journey. Without them I would not of been prepared to implement the practices in this book.  This book tells what most churches and counselors don't tell you. Because they must not have the training?Yet I see it effect so many women in the church! How sad that the church has failed so many women.Some churches are hyper-grace, or say,""don't worry about getting right with God, just serve. ""  Churches that reward men for serving the church, for giving large amounts of money, allow them to teach Sunday school , hold places of leadership in the church, do mission work,etc.. But don't make them accountable on how they treat their wives. Do not take any action till you read the book through. Doing so maybe unsafe and will just make the damages to repair your marriage harder to overcome. All steps must be taken. Also be warned reading the first part will stir up old hurts and anger in you. Be prepared to get alone with God and not lash out verbally to your husband. Lest you be as guilty or just look crazy to him. This will take a lot of time spent in your prayer closet, putting on the full amour of God and getting Yourself right with God. Facing that you have made your relationship an idol.But then comes the hope. For a future."
So much good information.
amazing book
"I had received an advance copy of this book and have ordered 16 more books to hand out to Pastors, women and others in Emotionally Destructive relationships.I wish I had read this book over 30 years ago.  I have been given bad advice over the years that made things worse not better from secular counselors ,Christian Counselors, Pastors and Women in Bible Studies.  This book and the roadmap she gives is spot on. I wish that mothers would get this book and read it to be able to speak truth into their daughters lives.  I would love for us to be proactive rather than reactive and have to help clean up the mess that ED marriages leave behind.What I like is she teaches women how to build our CORE and that helps because ED Marriages destroys our inter most being.  It cuts the fog and gives them the chance to see clearly for the first time in years if not the first time ever.If I had a suggestion at all for an improvement Leslie mentions on page 99 to not go off guns blazing till you read more (finish the book).  I think that should remain at page 99 for a reminder but should be printed right at the beginning.Take the time also to go to the authors website and check out her short videos they are tremendous as well.I have found practical applications from this book that help for my church and work life as well.This book is by a Christian Author but if you know someone that is not a believer this book is still awesome the practical advice contained in the book is spot on.Because there is so many factors involved in domestic abuse and domestic violence do make sure to read the book fully and heed the cautions throughout the book about safety.  The first thing that she advises before any confrontation is to have a safety plan in place.  The author stresses this multiple times throughout the book.  Her big concerns are safety and sanity."
"This book is a valuable resource for marriages that are in trouble, but it is filled with wisdom and practical advice for any marriage."
"This opened my mind to wisdom. It is so good to get counsel and seek wisdom. The book helped me how to handle and act in my marriage. Helped to accept and believe the truth about what was happening.  Not only did it expose wisdom and truth but it helped me not to react in sin and to show love within good boundaries. God is amazing, the glory goes to God. Many thanks to you Leslie for being a servant of Christ and helping your brothers and sisters."
"Extremely insightful. Very helpful when you are in the middle of a crisis and it is hard to see what to do, and feeling very overwhelmed. Helped me to feel more confident in my decisions"
"Ten years ago I left an emotionally destructive marriage. I did this after spending seven years thinking I could love my man unconditionally. I could not. When I admitted that I was a person, too, I left with a lot of guilt, shame, and confusion over why I couldn't continue to hold my family together. While I worked through these feelings I still felt like I had let God down, despite having biblical reasons for exiting the marriage. Leslie Vernick does a great job of defining the difference between destructive and disappointing marriages. I'm glad that she's giving a voice of reason to those of us who wish to walk in God's light with our heads held high to receive, as well as, give. Reading this book has allowed me that last bit of self-forgiveness."
"Every pastor and marriage counselor needs to read, absorb, and implement the principles here. This volume should be their go-to book for helping women survive and thrive. This is the book you need if you are struggling to keep your sanity in a destructive marriage. Leslie unlocks the doors and opens the windows."
Arrived on time and as described :)
Helps one to deal with truth...recognize what is abusive and evaluate your relationship. Do you want to build a new future? Steps to be taken to build a more solid ground to stand on. To try to look at marriage and evaluate its value. A godly perspective dealing with reality.
"This book was very good at explaining what is ""normal"" behavior compared to ""abnormal"" behavior.  People living in dysfunctional relationships do not know what normal is.  They have become so used to surviving and so familiar with their survival techniques that they become blind to what is healthy.  Their fear of change controls them.  This is a book that can help unwrap graveclothes....."
"Leslie knows her stuff. I've heard her speak at conferences and read her books. Most importantly, I've experienced the long-term effects of an emotionally destructive marriage. Leslie's practical insight and personal stories speak powerfully to help people understand what emotional abuse is and how to stay strong in the midst of it.Kudos to Leslie for another great book!"
I would recommend this book to all hurting women that are truly at their wits end and need Godly advice.
"This is a book about courage and truth. A must read for anyone feeling hopeless and stuck in a distructive, toxic marriage. There is hope. Leslie Vernick gives advice and insights I had never heard anywhere else.  Full of resources for additional help."
Opens the eyes and the heart to reality and gives wide advice to follow in your communications.  A must have for me!
Came highly recommended from a friend.
"This is a must read for hurting women and for counselors, especially Christian Counselors! Great practical and godly advice for situations that few understand. Truly destructive relationships don't operate by the same rules as normal ones and Leslie helps women and men address the difficult realities they face in a loving way.  I especially loved the concrete advice on what to look for to know things are changing.  Loved it!"
Eye opener.  Reminded me not to judge anyone in a divorce situation.  You don't know what goes one behind closed doors.
"Understand your spouses position, grow through the healing experience, and be who God intended a man to be for his Wife."
Very well written and very helpful
"Finally, a Christian counseling perspective on the reality too many women face daily. We have been fed a bill of lies that keeps us trapped in a cycle that we must break free from. Vernick's eloquently identifies the problems and gives most of the tools needed to find hope."
The most well balanced biblical counsel for women in a destructive marriage.  God tells us that the truth will set you free.  The truth of this book is going to be life changing for many women who have not had a voice.  I love that it gives you practical steps to healing.  Matter of fact I am praying for Leslie Vernick because she bring women out of bondage and I am sure the enemy does not like this.
"I can't say enough about the good this book will do for many, who have tried and failed(both on their own and with counselors) to find answers that work for severely troubledmarital situations. Leslie Vernick teaches from the depths of God's word and His Spirit,as a veteran counselor of over 30 years invoking the sure mercies of the Lord."
"Reinforced exactly what I've been suggesting my daughter do to move out so maybe her husband of 24 yrs. might realize just how destructive he has and is being. While he hasn't physically harmed her I needed her to realize that he is capable and when he realizes he can't control the emotions anymore he could very well resort to physically harming her. They've raised 7 children and now that they are grown and no longer underfoot she has the time to complete the degrees for teaching. He has always been controlling and with the children gone she has taken a stand. She isn't bitter, argumentative, or unkind but knows she can't trust him and has moved to a safe place. She is in his presence while working at their business but chooses not to be alone with him. By having read your book she's made healthy choices that keep her emotionally happy, safe and stable. Thanks so much for understanding the needs of emotionally controlled wives."
Leslie Vernick found the words I had been looking for and validation that things needed to change in a positive direction. I recommend this book and other Leslie Vernick resources to my patients.
"Real life marital conflicting situations are responded to with astute questions, examination of all sides of the conflict, and helpful suggestions as answers that are  wowen with God's Word. I highly recommend this book."
A book that really gives hope to married Christian women.
This book was a follow up read for me to the Emotionally Destructive Relationship by the same author.  What an eye opener to my own behavior in living in this kind of relationship.  This book is geared more towards women but will give insight into anyone dealing with this.  Leslie Vernick writes of this topic in an easy understandable way.  NO big words to trip you up.  She gives you guidelines to follow to figure out what you are dealing with and also helps lead you through a footprint of what to expect if the choice is made to work towards reconciliation and/or if you choose to leave.  A highly recommended read.
Excellent book.
Excellent
This is the best Christian based book for someone who is trying to cope with a destructive marriage. Brings hope.
This was an amazing book that helped me sort out my 26 year marriage that ended 10 years ago.  This answered so many questions that I still carried with me and gave me the peace I have been needing for so long.  Thank you Leslie for having the courage to publish this!
"This book offers hope for someone in an abusive marriage. The advice offered is not easy to do, but necessary."
I have recommended this book to many of my friends.  It is excellent.
Very helpful strategies are provided for those who live with a narcissistic spouse
Very pertinent and useful information married women and those in abusive relationship.  Like the biblical perspective given
Amazing!!! Exactly what I was needing and looking for!!!
Everyone needs to educate themselves about the bizarre world of abuse and what Biblical options are open to the abused!  This book is such a help with practical suggestions and eye-opening information.  I've read it several times and wish it had been written 35 years ago.
This book is so helpful. Every woman should read it even if she is not in an emotionally destructive marriage. She may be able to be supportive to someone who does not know the signs.
"I recommend this book to any woman who feels or believes she may have an abusive partner, whether it be physical, emotional, sexual, etc. there are many different types of abuse and none are Ok. You don't have to suffer through it, God doesn't want that for you or your partner. There are steps to take to help and grow. Be patient. Pray. Read the book."
"This is a very good book full of Godly advice. If you're in an emotionally destructive marriage and feel trapped, you must read this book!"
A step by step guide to fixing or finishing a destructive relationship that any denomination can appreciate. Even if you're not a Bible reader. Very helpful!
Tells you what to recognize as abuse.
An excellent book that that I highly recommend. Leslie diagnosis problems and gives a plan for resolving issues.
"I LOVED this book! After 15 years of being in an emotionally destructive and abusive marriage, I finally found Biblical answers for and validation to my struggles. I HIGHLY recommend!"
"Leslie Vernick has some very good information for those that are struggling with destructive patterns in your marriage. She helps you to see what those are and how to bring change in your relationship. She use Gods word to bring to light truth and set boundaries, so that you can have a voice and overcome being controlled or manipulated. This book is easy to read , understand, and put into practice."
Loved the book! Highly recommended it.
A very different view than most of the others books out there.  It brought peace to my soul.
"Wonderful book with much needed information! It is no longer okay to tell wives to submit, because we are not to submit to evil!"
Excellent book!  Wish it could be a book geared to either a woman or a man.
üëç
"Leslie Vernick is not only able to relate scripture in a meaningful and helpful way, she is able to give steps on what to do if you are struggling in a destructive marriage.  She also spells out what is needed to take care of yourself and how to tell if your destructive spouse is really changing.  Wish this information was available 8 counselors ago."
Very informative & encouraging. Helps you face the reality of your situation and make educated changes and choices. Thankful that it is written based on the truth of God's word.
Very informative and helpful
Thank you... Words of wisdom giving strength and freedom to those who feel stuck and hopeless....Straight out of the heart of God.
"This book will help you mentally, physically and spiritual! We all are flawed, we all need help dealing with people on some level. I highly recommend any book by Leslie Vernick!"
Very good book written from a Biblical perspective but with the wisdom and honesty you don't often find in typical Christian marriage books. For those who are suffering in emotionally abusive relationships m
"Well written, easy to read and annointed with Godly wisdom and counsel! Excellent resource !!!! It helped me tremendously.. I highly recommend this book!"
"I've read a ton of books on this subject, but this is one of the best. Terrific insight."
Much needed message for women to educate and empower them during a very real and long struggle and process. A very good and easy read.
"Wow! What a God send! I could not put this book down.Very easy to read, but so profound. Filled with great tools to help make sense of the chaos of a difficult marriage. Very encouraging and uplifting!"
This was so helpful and validating. It is great to know that there are biblically and clinically centered counselors out there able to shepherd christians in need along with the  Church. Great read and very practical! Read this...it is that good.
This book has really help me take a look at my marriage in a different way and has help me to look at myself and find ways to heal.
This was a gift for someone who loves the book and is finding a great deal of help for herself between the covers. She absolutely loves the author Leslie Vernick and follows her blog as well.
"This book, written from a Christian perspective , does not minimize the affect of the abusive marriage, nor does it give the dastardly advice  ""If you change, he'll change."" It is honest, forthcoming, and should be required reading for engaged couples, particularly those who are un at ease with their partner's behavioral traits but prefer to ignore the issue."
Author has a good understanding of why marriages can be painful.  She doesn't discount or minimize the problems.  She offers practical solutions and hope for happiness.  Highly recommend this!
"This book is spot on with issue meentuon for destructive marriages.  If saddens me that people do not take a serious evaluation of their actions to better the marriage,family and themselves."
This is by far the best marriage fix it book I've read. Not only does it help identify the various types of emotional abuse but gives suggestions on how to stop it and still fight for a marriage that has been destroyed in one or many or pretty much every way. I also love how it's not just wives submit to your husband and putting all the blame on the wife like I've read in a whole litany of other books.  I love this and have already recommended it to friends.
"Too many times, those in destructive marriages are made to feel like if they would only change then the abuse would stop.  Leslie's book is compassionate and honest and has a message for those in the situation or for those who would like to help."
I cannot express how grateful I am for this book.  Clear.  Biblical.  Balanced. Encouraging.  And constructive.
"Very informative. An eye opener. This books sheds light onto a topic that has remained taboo for far too long in the church. It is also a lifeline for women who have struggled with their desire to honor God at the expense of their safety, personhood or wellbeing."
I got a lot of ideas for how to survive in what I consider to be a destructive marriage.  I am less stressed because of what I use from this book to apply in my own marriage.  I love the example of 'Abigail' that she gave and I am learning to be Abigail and so far its working!
Finally! This has been long overdue! So comforting and encouraging to be empowered to have a healthy relationship. Highly recommended if you're not getting the most out of your Godly marriage.
Very insightful and worthy reading.  Wished I would have had this to read and apply years ago!  Fine Book.
"A direct but balanced treatment plan for emotionally destructive marriages, and the broken  individuals  affected by them. If you think your marriage needs help, read this!"
Very informative book. Very helpful.
WOW!  Thank you so much for allowing God to use you to write this book!  It has opened eyes to many things that has been happening in my marriage.  Helping me to understand and giving me wisdom to act .  God bless
"SO helpful! It is difficult to sort out what is rational and what is driven by attitude when you are in the middle of a mess. But this book clears the minefield and allows one to pick a path that is restorative (if possible), and growth producing. Highly recommended for those who are considering options, going through the events, or counselling those who are."
awesome.  Most woman should read this.
Awesome for anyone in a marriage not being led by the Holy Spirit. Both spouses need to be led and obey the Holy Spirit in order to have a happy and healthy marriage the way God designed it to be. This book was a great resource and help mate to me. Loved it!
Leslie Vernick is honest and compassionate in her explanation and understanding of wounded marriages.
It helped me understand what was happening and it wasn't my fault want my husband did to me. He always told me that.
Leslie Vernick is truly gifted and divinely inspired. There IS hope for a Christian woman in an emotionally destructive marriage.  You are not trapped.
Outstanding and powerful.
The most helpful book I have read on this subject.
Excellent tool for both victims  and counselers!
"One of the most important books I've ever read!!  A huge, huge help in understanding root issues in difficult marriages.  Very Biblical."
"Highly recommended, very knowledgeable while written, and very helpful. I would suggest reading this book to everyone. I appreciate the authors ability to convey truth from scriptures."
This book is a wonderful tool that has made a huge difference in my life.
"So good!  So real!  Finally a book that acknoledges abuse for what it is and gives permission for abused person to leave for safety, with biblical backing. I purchased 3 copies, i will b back for more."
Best book ever!  I've divorced my narcissistic ex husband and have regained my sanity.
The author has a good handle on emotional/marital abuse. The steps provided were excellent and well thought out. Would highly recommend this book to anyone going through abuse.
"I just bought this book for a friend so I already read it.  This book has helped to save my sanity and maybe even my life.  And if it is not too late, it may give my marriage one more chance.  Leslie Vernick knows what she is talking about - more than most marriage counselors and even MOST ministers do - when it comes to unhealthy/toxic relationships.  The Lord has surely given her a message and wisdom and discernment that most people in the body of Christ do not understand.  I thought the only way I would get any help would be to go OUTSIDE the church, until I found out about Leslie Vernick.  I can not speak highly enough of about the gift God has given her and believe that it should be REQUIRED READING for students of mental health professions and pastors alike!"
Very helpful book. I have suggested this book to several women. It deals with a topic seldom talked about in the church.
Great book to help lay christian counselors or a woman who needs help with how to handle destructive emotional abuse.
___
Very well written and Biblically based.  Really helped me see what it was that I needed to do to take the next steps forward.
Good. Very thought provoking.
"I would recommend all of Leslie's books, God has given her such a clear easy to understand way to help get to our heart issues"
Super book! Great tools and Biblical Truth.
"Very well written, easy to read, and gives great food for thought."
It was very helpful in distinguishing between a disappointing marriage and a destructive marriage. It is so affirming when you have been living in a destructive marriage and being blamed for it by your spouse. It builds strength in knowing that you are not the crazy one!
Read this  when the normal marriage seminars and books don't address what you face in your marriage. Leslie has a lot of wisdom.
This book has helped me a lot
This woman gets it and shares it in such an outstanding manner.  The best I have read on this subject especially if you want a balanced approach.  I bought one for a friend.
"Very informative and insightful book, really helped me"
"Incredibly insightful book. Dr. Vernick has such deep Wisdom to share, especially regarding the often dysfunctional way many of us try to ""do relationships."" These pages offer hard questions, relatable stories, and utterly sound advice -- especially to those walking through shadowy valleys of emotionally destructive marriages.  She really equips the reader to identify accurately the nature of the relationship and then proceed with appropriate steps to help make informed, wise decisions for their own sake and on behalf of their family. Safety, sanity, stability, and security should all be part of a healthy marriage, and Leslie shows us the way to understanding how that is possible and even probable when armed with the right discerning tools and the courage to proceed.  Bless you, Dr. Leslie Vernick, for writing with such clarity on a subject too often unaddressed and certainly misunderstood and sadly mishandled even by well-intended counselors. You have opened my eyes, and I am glad to share my take on this valuable work that certainly assists us all to more clearly define what real Love looks like, what It does, and what it does not do. You are part of God's voice to the many hurting hearts struggling in silence, wondering what to do next...If you know someone whose relationship or marriage is struggling, please share this book with them; it may be exactly what then need! ~"
Excellent book! She is easy to understand and gives a clear plan of action. Her book is the first time I've read such helpful advice.
She is right on track.
Very good book. Practical and helpful in many ways. Helped me to get understanding.
Great book really helpful! !
Very informative
Excellent book. This is a topic many Christians have a hard time knowing how to handle. In this book it was done biblically with integrity.
Just the book I needed
Highly recommend!!!
Great and insightful book with a Christian view point.
Great information for those who have trouble expressing why it so difficult to live with their spouse.
"Best book. Clear, specific action plan and it does a good job of helping both spouses. And the best Christian perspective that I have read. Good website too"
Great is you wa nt to grow
"very practical information, truly eye opening"
thank you! Very Helpful!
This should be required reading for counselors and clergy.
It is much needed information that has been lacking for way too long!  I couldn't give it a name until now!
The best book so far i have read on marriage and other destructive relationships ......
Good book
"This book is very thorough and must be read through slowly or gone back through,  probably  more then once to get full benefit from the advise given. It is spot on that both parties must be willing to change their behaviors to be successfully improve their marriage.It is Biblically based but doesn't give the pat response that a wife must stay in an emotionally abusive relationship if the husband hasn't been physically unfaithful.Her advise is based on over 30 years as a counselor and it shows. Very sound advise!"
A very eye opening and helpful book.
I learned so much about my 50 year old marriage that I never saw before.  This book is spot on.
Amazing
Excellent advise
Great book! Very helpful book
Highly recommend!!
Amazing read!!! This book gives a voice and a validation to the most common (but taboo) topic in Christianity today.
This is a very insightful book but you have to be willing to accept your responsibility as to how the relationship got the point of you  needing to read this book.
"Even if you don't think you have a bad marriage, this book is an eye-opener to the ways in which we participate in destructive behaviors.  It is not a ""scary"" book, you won't read it and bump into anything that will be too frightening to read about.  However, I will caution you, you might not be the same after reading it!  She has done great research and her theology is sound, if that matters to you. This is not a book that will urge you to jump up and act right now, in fact, she does just the opposite and encourages thinking well ahead of action.  Knowing what you are about, listening to yourself, is of utmost importance to the process that she outlines.  There is nothing too hard in this book, everything is possible, and it gave me great hope, even in the midst of great pain."
This book really helped me see how bad my marriage was and how is was effecting my children and me. It caused meTo take action to get help for all of us.
Helpful and insightful
"Thank you for the practical and Godly counsel.  I'm grateful to know I'm not crazy and that there can truly be change.  Apparently not this season, but your path for separating well and for safe restoration have given me a clear direction and confidence to proceed."
Love this book and the service was great. :)
Great Help !! For many that I work with!!!
"First Time I have read a book that is very real about this topic, validating.Very challenging and quite different to the usual teachings about marriages with emotional destruction"
Helped me understand what God feels for me during this time of seperation. I feel peace moving forward and decided to leave well.
Excellent and practical content.
I liked all of the resources and biblical references. I liked how there were real peoples stories in here and the approach.
Super
Refreshingly clear and on target. Well balanced. Strong biblical base.
This book is instructive and compassionate to those who endure ongoing abuse. Very good advice within these pages.  I highly recommend it.
tells you why and how to cope and fix problems within your marriage and about your self.we can change.
takes the confusion out of what God truly tells us how we should be treated in marriage. It is our divine right to be treated with equality kindness and real selfless love!!!!
"Wonderful book full of examples, description, and do/don'ts.  Hard topic, but important for many."
"This is a must read for everyone. Especially those desiring marriage, the soon to be married and those on their way out. Very thought provoking.."
Excellent!!  Great information and extremely helpful.
Great Biblical/practical guide to a tough issue. It treats both sides of the issue encouraging ways for both parties in the relationship to look at healthy ways of interaction.
Very Helpful!
Leslie Vernick puts words on feelings that are hard to even comprehend much less verbalize. There is much comfort in feeling understood!
This book should be read by anyone who wants to get help in there marriage .  Maybe even before you get married.
"This book is amazing!  It confirmed many things for my family.  Absolutely a great book, even though it's discussing a not-so-great subject."
great insight!!!
Life changing.
Excellent! !
Good resource for teaching you to communicate with a spouse who doesn't realize how hard it is for you to express concerns to them.  Also this book can be used to reaffirm why your marriage didn't work out.
So much information and very helpful!!!
"A bit hardcore.  The religious angle is ok, but not as practicle for folks who don't feel like using faith as blind as is suggested in sections of the book.  Some people are mean and difficult while hiding behind religion."
This book will help you to look at your in a whole new light.  I recommend it for anyone who thinks their marriage is less than perfect.
"I love this book - I wish it could have been written 30 years ago!  But I am so glad it is in print now : )  I think it will encourage and help many, many people."
This a very good book
"THis is a truth telling book.  It is painful, but a necessary read.  You will know it you need it."
"Excellent book, extremely helpful, I highly recommend it. It is easy to read, well written. It is eye opening, and challenging."
Excellent book. This book is eye opening.  It has real tools to help struggling women. It addresses the absence of support in the church and gives you a step by step plan for positive change.
Extremely helpful in guiding me through the struggles of my marriage and the steps I should take to move on in a Godly manner.
Opened my eyes to my reality.... Eternally grateful for stumbling onto this book!
I gave this book to a friend who is going through a rough marriage. She is reading it now and says it is very helpful.
"This book has really helped me. I haven't even finished it yet, but I know that I have learned so much about myself and my marriage just by reading this book."
"Excellent , clear description of broken, hurting marriages. Leslie is an excellent counselor, speaker and author."
Great read. Taught me a lot built me up spiritually and helped me to break bown a few walls. Thanks for shaing those experiences I now know I am not alone.
Great book for sorting out your thoughts. And realizing a lot of other people ate experiencing some of the same things that you are
It was very helpful for me to understand what a girlfriend of mine had gone through.
It has been very helpful. I love the fact that Leslie gives steps to make changes. I found wonderful Godly counsel!!!
The information in this book was just what I was looking for. I bought the CD also in order to review information during my commute.
Excellent support for any woman wondering where her voice has gone and why she feels as though she is going crazy.
"I normally don't read ""self help books."" this book is the best book ever. It has really helped me in my marriage. you don't have to feel alone or defeated.The shipping was pretty fast and the book was in new shape"
Excellent book! I also joined her online classes and read her blog.
It really hit home and made me realize what kind of a marriage I was in and that I did the right thing of getting out.
Very helpful and insightful.
Great book.
Thank you Leslie.
Very easy to read! This book helped open my eyes to a lot! I highly recommend! Lot's of scripture references and sound advice.
"Amazing book, it has changed the way I look at things. God is starting to change me and my husband as I do what is suggested and it has only been 1 week!"
This book changed my life. Leslie Vernick understands today's marriages and the work it takes by both parties to make it.
Very helpful and insightful.
Wish I'd read this years ago.
You can see your life on the page and learn h
Very helpful indeed!
It is a wonderful book.
I really enjoyed it and it was very informational.
"Extremely helpful in working out destructive relationships in a respectful, kind and Godly way."
"Well-written and non-judgmental, Leslie sheds light on the true attributes of a biblical wife - a strong, independent partner (not a push-over slave). The book is written from a place of love, not fear and resentment as so many other books on this topic. I highly recommend this book for any woman struggling with abuse, whether physical or emotional. Leslie gives the individual a sense of freedom to make their decision, something refreshing when one feels overwhelmed by the control others attempt to use on them."
Excellent!!!!!!!!!
Eye opening!
"I'm not really sure what the point of this book is.  I admit I haven't read this from cover to cover.  But, as I browse through it...it's abundantly clear that it is written as if there is only one party involved in the emotional abuse.  And, as such, it's written as if the husband alone is being abusive.  There doesn't seem to be any balance in considering that the wife can also be emotionally abusive.  The book offers no inward reflection that makes the reader take into account their own actions.  It presumes the husband is the monster and the wife is exclusively the victim.  But, as we all know.."".it takes two to tango"".  Consider...if you're a wife...and your husband seems angry...YOU might be the cause of that anger!  That doesn't justify an escalation of hurtful words.  But, if you start the day by cutting your husband down...how do you expect he'll feel?  If you insult him and belittle him...YOU are being abusive.  And if YOU can go through weeks, months and years without apologizing for your treatment of him...guess what...your coldness and lack of empathy and refusal to acknowledge your own actions are damaging and abusive.Have you withheld a smile from your husband to ""teach him a lesson""?  Have you refused to offer any (non-sexual) affection as you make demands of him?  Have you disparaged him in front of your children?  Do you make him feel guilty for even the smallest act of kindness you do toward him? Are you only kind toward him when YOU are getting your way?  ""I will act lovingly toward you ONLY if you do things my way"".This book doesn't address any of those reciprocal actions...and as such is miserably unbalanced.  Others are very correct in saying that reading this book is a great way to tear apart your marriage."
"Excellent book especially for those women intimidated to the extreme with husbands who use God's word against them i.e. ""the Bible says that you have to SUBMIT to me"".  That's such BS !"
"This book is phenomenal. I finally read a book that has accurately portrayed and validated my feelings. Before reading this book, I literately thought I might be crazy and that what I am going through is normal. I know its not normal and that there are women out there who can relate to what I am going through. I would recommend this book to anyone who is having difficulty understanding their feelings and is interested in seeking therapy."
5*A+  accurate description~packaged safely in durable mailer~fast shipping~Thank You!
"Excellent resource- well written, very applicable and helpful"
great book!
ok
Informative
"So very informative and helpful! This book has a potential for changing many lives. May God bless you, Leslie Vernick for your insights!"
"I have been in therapy with wonderful therapists, but this book is the best guide if you are going through marital issues!!  Highly recommend!!!  So thankful to have found it!"
Great!
as expected
I don't feel the book gave the much needed direction on how to handle a difficult conversation. The questions to ask in the book were not helpful. I would be laughed at if asking those questions.
"Well written, clearly illustrated with appropriate examples, with practical guidance and steps to take."
"Can be a very helpful book where both husband and wife are willing to do the hard work of repair. However, the language used in certain sections of the book leaves the door for divorce wide open for any wife who just wants out of a difficult, not necessarily destructive marraige."
nothing
The book was very insightful and helpful.
One of my counseling patients was reading this and recommended it. I hadn't heard of the author. But now I am a fan. She's got the blend of compassion and realistic faith that gives women hope and options. It does seem to be slanted towards women. I just wish I had a men's version!
"Vernick personally counseled my wife and the wife of a friend.  Both our marriages went from struggling to hopelessly and impossibly irreconcilable soon after the counseling began, and both of us ended up in divorce court.  Both of us view 2 Timothy 3:2-9 to be stunningly accurate descriptions of Leslie Vernick and the unloving and irreconcilable fruit that characterizes her disciples/victims.  I didn‚Äôt understand what was going on‚Ä¶until I read The Emotionally Destructive Marriage, and then I could see exactly where my wife‚Äôs newfound abusive behavior was coming from.  Vernick commits two very great evils:  first, she steers women away from following Sarah and the clear scriptural commandments given to wives regarding their husbands, and second, she replaces biblical teaching with deceptive self-help doctrines that will destroy marriages and obedience to Christ and His word faster than anything I have ever seen.Hypocrisy and blatant disobedience to scripture (I‚Äôve experienced it first-hand) are the fruit of Leslie Vernick‚Äôs teaching, in spite of it being highly praised and coming to us wrapped in supposed Bible teaching and flowery prayers.  ‚ÄúEarthly, natural, demonic,‚Äù James 3:15, are the most suitable words for it.  Every single time Vernick offers her unique scriptural interpretations or speaks for God (yes, she brazenly speaks for God and does not even qualify it as her own opinion), she undermines, neutralizes, sets aside, replaces, nullifies, turns upside down, cancels, or reverses what God clearly says in His word and a conservative interpretation of it.  Every. Single. Time.  Vernick is much more encouraging of wives separating from and divorcing their husbands than any person I have ever read or heard of, even among unbelievers.  If you want to view yourself as an innocent victim, if you want to accuse, label, judge, and slice your husband to pieces with your tongue, if you want an excuse to leave him if these Vernick-prescribed methods don‚Äôt motivate him to comply with your demands and rise to your oh-so-high standards ‚Äì all the while pretending that this is ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs way‚Äù and deluding yourself that you are actually ‚Äúloving him‚Äù better by doing so ‚Äì then this is the book for you!Despite her confident assertions about what God thinks, despite four pages of endorsements from people who should know better, despite all the 5 start ratings from people tripping over themselves to endorse this woman and her teaching, I assure you from first hand experience that I have never seen any teaching so blatantly contrary to scripture, so hypocritical and self-serving, and so judgmental, divisive, and destructive to marriage as that articulated in this book.  I‚Äôve lived with the devastating consequences, and it is not of God.  You will do far better and be far more biblical by doing the exact opposite of what Vernick says to do in this book.Example:  One of the many false teachings in this book is the idea that if you take Vernick‚Äôs unvalidated, one-sided, highly subjective, and, surprise-surprise, biased-towards-the-conclusion-that-your-husband-is-destructive survey offered in this book, then Abigail is the role model you should follow in your marriage and by implication, not Sarah.  Most if not all of Vernick‚Äôs prescriptions fly in the face of scripture and are contrary to the example and attitude that Sarah exhibited toward her adulterous and abandoning husband Abraham.  But the fact is scripture neither commends Abigail nor holds her up as an example to follow in any way; scripture only says Abigail was intelligent and beautiful, and there are a lot of intelligent and beautiful women who are shrewd and evil-hearted and aren‚Äôt even close to godly or obedient to God‚Äôs word.  Abigail trashed her husband to David and tolerated the servants doing the same behind her husband‚Äôs back.  Abigail refused to warn her husband when his life was in imminent danger and took a highly risky gamble with his life, taking life and death matters (for him, not her) into her own hands, gambling that she alone would save the day.  She flattered her husband‚Äôs enemy while making it very clear she totally disrespected her husband, and she concluded with a clear appeal to David to remember her when he came into his kingdom.  Sounds like 10th century B.C. gold-digging to me, all behind her husband‚Äôs back!  I believe one of the reasons Nabal was so stunned was because of his wife‚Äôs utter disregard of him, not even warning him when his very life was on the line.  Abigail I think despised her husband, and she is the complete opposite of Sarah, who loved and highly regarded her husband in her heart (which is a lot harder to do than with lip service), in spite of his highly destructive behavior towards her.  I think Sarah galls Vernick.  But think, ladies, think!  How would you feel if some self-appointed expert came along and gave your husband a survey that led him to the conclusion that you are a ‚Äúdestructive,‚Äù disrespectful, ‚Äútoxic,‚Äú ‚Äúabusive,‚Äù and contentious wife, and then proceeded to persuade him that because of this he is no longer obligated to follow Jesus as his husbandly role model but instead now Abraham and David are his role models ‚Äì being free to cast you aside or get another wife in addition to you!  Just like Abigail, Vernick trashes your husband repeatedly in this book, with extreme and broad-sweeping generalizations and judgments, without even meeting him or speaking to him.  Simply the incessantly negative and overbearingly dark and hopeless attitude that Vernick uses to describe husbands that don‚Äôt pass the survey is a toxicity and virulent venom that will poison and destroy your marriage if you are unfortunate enough to be deceived by it and embrace it.  Always remember that Satan uses scripture to make his points and get you to do what he wants, and his servants do the same.  Don‚Äôt be deceived by the fact that Vernick is endorsed by a long list of people; only God‚Äôs opinion matters, and He will approve those who faithfully stick to His word (Mt. 5:19).  Don‚Äôt be deceived by Vernick‚Äôs new teaching that throws out God-approved Sarah and replaces her with Vernick-approved Abigail as the role model you should follow.  Don‚Äôt be deceived by Vernick‚Äôs implications that persevering tenderhearted love and following scripture will ‚Äúonly make things worse‚Äù in your marriage or that her teaching is ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs way.‚Äù  I think for the rest of my life, whenever I read Matt. 5:19, 7:1-5, 15-27, 2 Tim. 3:2-9, and James 3:15, I will think of Leslie Vernick."
Excellent.
"The information written in the book is useful but female-centric attitude of the book puts the blame squarely on the husband.  He cheated, he yelled, he abused. For this reason I gave the book 3 stars.  Women can be vicious and mean spirited as any male and maybe more so because they in general are more skilled in the matters of Interpersonal relations. This sometimes can leave a male confused and alone.  This one sidedness left me with a feeling that males are the blame for every wrong in a marriage which is not so.  If a book is to heal a marriage both sides must learn to work together.  One sex cannot be blamed for all wrongs In a marriage.  Women can physically and emotionally abuse men.  Where is the help for us?"
I'm not sure what the author's intention was. It outlines destructive behaviors well and then more or less tells you to accept or leave the situation.I didn't find it helpful.
"My marriage has not been great, but lately, my wife has been acting more cold and indifferent to me than normal and pouring all her time and energy into the children and activities and relationships external to the nuclear family.  I was struggling trying to figure out what had changed. Then I noticed she was reading this book. I picked it up one day when she was gone and scanned through the book.  It was obvious where she was getting her ideas and why she started behaving differently.This book is dangerous and will probably destroy my marriage.  My wife now can justify her belief that all of the marriage problems are my fault and that she has no responsibility for the condition of the marriage.  Case in point: I looked at some of the things she highlighted, one of which is how a controlling husband limits his wife's access to money and only gives her a meager allowance. This is something I have to do as a responsible adult to keep the family financially secure in our case.  I have always been the sole provider for the family even though my wife has worked occasional odd jobs , for money she used how she wanted and which was never used to pay any household/family expenses. Even with only a single provider we have no debt, our house is paid off,  we've raised 5 children, and I've managed to save something (not yet enough though) for retirement.  I learned early in the marriage that if my wife had access to the money that it would be spent on frivolous things and the account would be empty when it came time to pay bills (taxes, car insurance, mortgage payments, utilities, health care costs, school tuition, etc.) . For years I have given her a weekly allowance (one I would not consider meager by any measure) to buy groceries and provide for the children's needs, and she managed to run her account in debt by spending the money on unnecessary things even while failing to purchase adequate groceries for the family.  I finally had to assume responsibility for buying groceries myself, pay off her debt, and reduce her allowance accordingly.My point is this: each situation is unique, as is the case with our financial situation.  I wish she were responsible with  money and even offered to turn over all the finances to her if she could demonstrate the discipline to live on 85% and  save 15%.  Her answer was that she did not want that responsibility. But this book ignores that each situation is unique and that there are two sides to every story and simply reinforces that everything is my fault and then calls my behavior abusive and controlling when in fact it is simply responsible.  And this is just one case in point out of many, all of which will fuel my wife's resentment and unhappiness and externalize the source of it to me.The other major problem with this book and all Christian centered marriage books is that they peddle the idea that a marriage without God as the center will never be fulfilling. As a long time Christian turned atheist, I fear this argument leads to self fulfilling prophesy, establishes artificial limits, and removes responsibility for personal choice and actions on the part of the believer.I'm not sure yet how I'm going to limit the damage this book will do to our marriage, but at least I have the awareness now to do so."
I bought this book for my daughter. She's getting married.
"This book has a few truths in it but I wouldn't recommend to anyone. Most of it is very biased and leads a woman to feel hopeless. If you are in search of help I would highly recommend Emerson and Sarah Eggerichs book and DVD, Love and Respect. Too many marriages simply look abusive because males and females do not understand each other. God has a design and beautiful plan if we take the time to know it!"
"From the reviews and Dr Dobson recommendation I expected this book to have good advice and scriptures to support it.It wasn't what I expected at all, and I felt it was a total waste of my money and time."
"I have read this. I have read her blogs. I have seen her numerous times talking to promote her book and her constant smiling upset me. ~Hmmm?~ Why?I needed to do a bit of background research on Ms Vernick, to see where her experience lies.There it was. She was never in an emotionally abusive marriage.This is why she doesn't identify with the pain, hurt and trauma. It is outside the intimacy of a marital relationship.  So yea, she smiles away on camera.I believe she shares advice to gain$ financially, from never having experienced the pain of spousal abuse~Smiling all the way to the bank!! I knew something was off and my gut was right.I will say, some of her ""identifications of conduct and character"", are correct, b/c these abusers behave in a similar manner.Her experience?It was with a relative, a non spouse AND not in an intimate relationship.I hope you are reading this Leslie. Your advice, was unproductive and never made me feel encouraged~just worse!!"
"The author suggests starting a conversation with your spouse by asking them ""Are you happy?"", ""Can you tell me about some the the things that you are frustrated with right now?"" And then LISTEN without commenting. Just hear the person out and DO NOT criticize or suggest they change in any way. This sounds good on the surface but we need to consider is this the right question?Happiness is being able to get what you want so I would not expect a spouse to be happy through a pandemic, job loss or a myriad of other problems that are common to life.A better question might be asking ""Are you content?"" because the answer to this one depends on being able to say ""I want what I have."" This is more probable than being happy especially if you have been in a marriage 20+ years and have made some larger purchases. This is still not the litmus test question for evaluating your marriage though because our covetousness makes us want an unlimited number of possessions especially if left unchecked by not tithing (I feel God subverts our covetousness when we tithe). I'm referencing Biblical concepts here because the author uses so many Bible quotes.The best question might be do you feel loved (not by your spouse but by God)? You have to approach marriage as a ""complete and whole"" person who already has achieved self-actualization in God, therefore you have something to give/ contribute to the marriage.The author is dangerously naive in setting the bar so high as to imply ""Your spouse has to make me happy."" These kinds of questions are the foundation to sowing seeds of discontent and will start you on the path towards divorce.The second star has been taken off for her poor Biblical exegesis of the story of the man and his concubine travelling through the tribe of Benjamin and being approached by a mob at night. The author is arm-chair quarterbacking the man's decision and who knows if the mob wouldn't have burned down their house if he hadn't taken action and who knows if it wasnt God's purpose to provide the impetus to correct the whole tribe's violence through the ensuing war? She has a very short sighted view of the scriptures where the illustrations are ""cherry picked"" without giving fair treatment to the wholw context of the passage she is referencing.Having said all of that if you are being hit by your spouse, cussed out regularly and getting your stuff destroyed, you probably do need to take some action (unless you started it by doing all of those things yourself, then you need to start with some introspection)."
"I think this book is destructive to the woman, who after years of abuse, control, and manipulation, finally builds up the courage to say ""enough"". I understand how important it is to salvage a marriage, and as wives, stand up to be the catalyst for change in our husbands. But, again, this book minimizes the effort it took to even stand up and admonishes an abused woman to just be that Godly wife. Any woman who is looking for real answers, should instead read Lundy Bancroft's book ""Why Does He Do That"". I couldn't believe how much my husband was like the men that were described and it really explained what I couldn't previously put my finger on. Abuse isn't always so blatant as you would think."
"I believe this is secular feminism disguised as Christian marriage advice. Such books lead to a higher rate of divorce among couples, especially in churches, in my opinion. The ideas advanced in this book are certainly popular in our day and age, but they are not Biblical. The title itself and the target audience (which are women for the most part, not men or both) are sufficient to conclude the writing is biased and diminishes the role and significance of husbands in marriage relationship. In the West, especially in the United States, the majority of emotional abusers in marriage are women. Some studies show as many as 70% of divorce is initiated by WOMEN. It can't be that they're all getting abused... No one is arguing that serious physical or psychological abuse should not be tolerated in any marriage. It's common sense. But from my own experience, the ""abuse"" the women attempt to justify as grounds for divorce is nothing more than striving for more power, more independence, more decision making and more desire to be pampered and become the head of household. Scripturally, this is clearly not what God intended in a relationship between husband and wife. There are clear and concrete roles defined by God and dictated by our nature which we must observe. Men and women are vastly different in many ways with important and distinct qualities and responsibilities, but the worth of each person is always the same, be they single or married. This is very important to note. The wife is weaker (at least physically), that is why she is a HELPER and is under her husband's AUTHORITY at all times. The husband is stronger that's why he is endowed with authority and commanded to show more LOVE for his wife, biblically speaking. I think if more couples understood their specific position and contribution to marriage, there would be less problems and divorce in our society."
"Too little of what Leslie Vernick writes in ‚ÄúThe Emotionally Destructive Marriage‚Äù is accurate, fair or Biblical.  She purports to help struggling marriages.  I fear her advice will only hasten the destruction of families.Christ taught that all are sinful and can only be saved by through his Grace.  Yet in Leslie Vernick‚Äôs world wives have virtue and their husbands have vice.  She concedes in her introduction and on a Focus on the Family radio broadcast that husbands are also victims of spousal abuse yet centered her book on wives anyway.No question, the husbands Leslie describes are truly monsters.  They are bullies, thieves, adulterers and addicted to porn.  I have no sympathy for them.  Indeed, their abuses extend well beyond the emotional dimension suggested by the book‚Äôs title.  Had Leslie simply called this book ‚Äúa Christian wife‚Äôs guide to dealing with an abusive husband‚Äù, I would have little ground for criticizing her.Tragically, there are angry, embittered, self centered wives who face no true abuse, yet will employ to the qualifier ‚Äúemotional‚Äù as a handy means claiming victim status.  Some will elaborate or even invent examples of ‚Äúabuse‚Äù to justify their feelings. Leslie touches on this problem but only tangentially.  The emotional abuse she describes from woman‚Äôs perspective could apply equally well to man‚Äôs.  She even advises women not to use the term ‚Äúemotional abuse‚Äù when approaching church staff about their marital problems.  Instead, she recommends citing specific offenses.  I suspect many claims of ‚Äúemotional abuse‚Äù will unravel under scrutiny.Leslie counsels disgruntled wives to identify the problem their marriage as their husband, seek the inner strength necessary to confront him, and then wrestle control of the marriage from him.  May I humbly suggest there is a different, Christian model, for the resolution of conflict in marriage?  Christ teaches the husband and the wife to turn to Him, accept His love, and then turn to each other with a heavenly love that transcends our self centeredness. Leslie has some good advice for wives in truly abusive marriages. Unfortunately, her words can too easily be misappropriated by unhappy women in low conflict marriages who are more interested in divorce than reconciliation."
"Leslie Vernick is a counselor and coach who specializes in helping people in destructive relationships.  This book comes from over 35 years of counseling experience - her wisdom and compassion will help you come to terms with the truth of your situation and provide steps/guidance on what to do.I came from an emotionally destructive family and then to my utter dismay, realized that I married someone who was also emotionally destructive.  Being a Christian, I struggled to find people who could see the abuse and would help me deal with it in wisdom and love.  Well-meaning pastors and friends told me to submit and trust no matter what it was doing to me.  But I knew that if I did that, I would lose my sanity and probably my safety.I was quick to blame myself and I couldn't put words around what was happening to me.  All I knew was that my spirit was being snuffed out, and no one seemed to understand.  Because I didn't have physical scars, it was very hard to explain.  When I talked to people about it, they seemed to be more interested in preserving the marriage than protecting my dignity, sanity and safety. It was terrifying, isolating, disappointing and confusing.  I felt like I was going crazy.  And, I felt like I had no solid ground to stand on.Leslie's book reaches out to people in these kinds of situations.  She takes you through a set of questions to help you identify what is wrong.  Then she gives you tools to become emotionally stronger so you can keep your sanity and deal with your situation in a healthy way.  And, then she walks you through the difficult steps of confronting while protecting yourself and your children.  Leslie doesn't tell you to stay at all costs.  She gives you steps on how to safely leave or safely stay, depending on what you need to do.  And she helps you prepare for the consequences either way.  I have never seen a Christian counselor so honestly and realistically deal with both outcomes.  And, she doesn't say it is ungodly if you need to leave.  She doesn't heap shame and guilt on your already battered soul.  You can sense when reading this book that Leslie doesn't deal with this topic lightly, but she knows the consequences can be dire if we ignore our own safety and sanity and that of our children.This quote really spoke to me, ""Do you think God is more interested in preserving your marriage than the well-being of you and your children""?  Hopefully both would be preserved, but Leslie recognizes this isn't always possible.  If you have been searching to find realistic and straightforward guidance on how to handle the terrifying reality of being trapped in an emotionally abusive marriage -  don't go another day without reading this book so you can begin to change your situation.  You are not alone - there is help and hope."
"Last weekend I had a Barnes&Noble 20%off coupon + 10%off member discount so I ordered Leslie Vernick's ""THE EMOTIONALLY DeSTRUCTiVe MARRIAGE"" or so I thought!When my copy arrived it was ""The Emotionally DeSTRUCTiVe Relationship"" instead. I was SO EXCITED to start reading it that I didn't even notice until the morning after I had already started reading it! üòâAnd obviously I had not paid attention when the clerk rang up my order and made the order mistake.BUT GOD Knew it wasn't truly a mistake b/c as I realize now I NEEDED to read this book first.‚ô•Ô∏èFor this 'mistake' too, Romans 8:28 is TRUE!""And we Know that God Causes ALL things to Work 2gether for GOOD to those called according to HIS Purpose."" (NASB)""The EMOTiONALLY DeSTRUCTiVe ReLATiONSHiP"" Book is SO INSIGHTFUL AND HELPFUL as I am coming to see that I have had a LiFeTiMe of eMOTiONALLY DeSTRUCTiVe ReLATiONSHiPS in addition to my two eMOTiONALLY DeSTRUCTiVe MARRiGeS and I am realizing that I NEED to Discern WHY.?.  and LEARN What I NEED to Work On personally and How to make CHANGES to BE And DO DiFFeReNT so I doN'T Continue repeating my history of being drawn into, participating in, and contributing to eMOTiONALLY DeSTRUCTiVe ReLATiONSHiPS as a result of my own BROKeNNeSS, my ReLATiONAL Wounds, my UNhealthy Beliefs/Behavior Patterns and even my own SIN sick heart.This weekend Thanks be to God I have a Barnes&Noble 25%off coupon + member's discount sooo. . .I Re-ordered ""THE EMOTIONALLY DeSTRUCTiVe MARRIAGE"". ü§ìPraying I am TRANSFORMED by GOD and the Renewing of my Mind and that I will be made Whole and Holy for His Glorious Praise, for my Mental, Emotional, Spiritual, Relational and Physical WELL Being and the Beneficial Good in ALL aspects of Many Others!!I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND Both of these books by Leslie Vernick to Everybody in Relationships of Any Type no matter how Healthy-Good their relationships may be.I am sure Every Relationship has room for Healthy Growth and Betterment!!And you never know who will need you to come alongside them and help them while they are still IN an Emotionally DESTRUCTIVE Relationship/Marriage or while they get WELL ENOUGH to leave and start their life over again."
"Almost anyone armed with this book would think they are emotionally abused. The narration adds a lot to the dramatic affect, but sounds extremely fake. While this book COULD be useful for those who need help in an abusive relationship, much of it needs to be validated (aligned with real scripture and not taken out of context). The author repeatedly makes herself out to be the ONLY expert in this area, while softly belittling most pastor's knowledge and understanding of abuse, marriage counsel, and the Bible itself. The author also  makes many references to the work of others when needed to back up her opinion - but again, usually taken out of context. And finally, it doesn't take long before a reader/listener would become nauseated with number of times this author refers to her own ""greatness"" as well as her website, other works, etc. 2 Timothy 4:1-4, Romans 16:17-20"
"A terrible guide on how to ruin your marriage. This woman‚Äôs poor husband.  We will all have to answer to God someday. And she‚Äôs going to be up there for a long time discussing the thousands of hearts  in her wake. Mary couples who could‚Äôve worked it out. Their children. Their children‚Äôs children.  Seems like somebody who wanted to pretend to do the Lords work, as a means to do the devils."
"This was referred to me by a Christian pastor counselor and as i was reading it I knew it was meant for me to read, it was like a soothing balm to my heart! It felt like the author wrote it just for me! I shared it with my spouse at the time and it helped him too, helped us both find the language to understand each other's hurts that we were misreading because we were throwing verbal daggers at each other from our anger from a lifetime of earlier offenses which had nothing to do with each other. We still divorced because we are not a good fit but this book helped us get some clarity and stop blaming each other. I bought a read a few other books by this author and she is spot on to the human heart and and what causes us the initial hurts that we drag with us into subsequent relationships. Stick with her, she knows human nature; it's predictable and pretty easy to correct once you recognize and admit what you are doing. She's a pretty smart counselor!"
"I really liked this book.  It is well-written and compassionate for those suffering in abusive marriages.  I appreciate that the author Leslie recognizes that some people want to treat marriage like the Pharisees treated the Sabbath, something to uphold at all cost even to the detriment of people.One nitpicky thing I want to mildly object to is that Abigail is used as an example from the Bible (1 Samuel 25) of staying well in bad marriage.  Staying is a choice people have to make for themselves, but Abigail's situation is very unlike what most modern women (in the US anyway) likely face.  I am not a licensed counselor, not a mental health professional, nor am I a Bible scholar, and what follows is based on my understanding, interpretation, inferences, and speculation:I'm guessing Abigail was essentially doing the role of Joseph in Potiphar's house, except where Joseph was chained by slavery, Abigail was chained by marriage.  Perhaps Nabal was just a party animal and would have soon bankrupt himself, but he was smart enough or lucky enough to marry the brilliant woman Abigail to manage his affairs.  As a wife, she'd be committed to his success in a way that a slave or hired person never would.  Just as Joseph wisely ran everything in Potiphar's household, I'm guessing Abigail wisely ran everything, too.  Abigail was a wealthy woman and possibly could be described as the ancient equivalent of a modern-day CEO.David was the imminent king of Israel, and Nabal dared to be abusive to him, even though David and his men were armed and almost retailiated with force except for Abigail's wise intervention.  The point is, if Nabal would abuse the future king like that, certainly Nabal was abusive to Everyone around him...his servants, Abigail, and since ancient Israel was a polygamous society, probably other wives or concubines.  The brunt of Nabal's cruel attacks were probably spread among many servants, wives, and concubines, so that the actual burden placed on Abigail herself was much smaller than most women living in 21st century America, who are living in close quarters with their abuser (in the same or a nearby room while at home) and also possibly isolated from friends and family by the abuser.  Abigail almost certainly had relatively less dealings with Nabal than most readers have to have with their abusers.  She may well have lived as a single woman for the most part and didn't have to put up too often with dehumanized sex that feels almost like rape.  No wonder Abigail could have stayed well!  She might not have been constantly exposed to someone hovering nearby ready to mock her thoughts, dreams, desires, or actions.  On top of all this, Abigail didn't really have to stay in the marriage because God decided to end Nabal's life!Maybe it is possible to stay well while married to a still immature person who demonstrates true remorse by making the effort to treat you better.  In time, the marriage may go from bad to good.  But I have heard (and have experience to back it up) that an abusive partner is likely to get more abusive as time goes by.  They abuse on purpose, and more time with them means more time to learn everything about you including which buttons to push, and become better abusers.  Maybe the abuse seems tolerable 10 years in, but I can tell you as a man at 21 years of marriage, it is now a nightmare.  I literally cringe at the sound of her footsteps and am afraid to talk to her knowing my words can and will be sharpened into a weapon and used to stab me.If one goes to your church leaders about your bad marriage, they may naively assume (and stubbornly insist) that immaturity or ignorance is the root of the problem...in other words, nothing a little Bible reading, couples counseling, improved communication skills, and prayer can't fix.  Do these things with an abuser and you might be giving them even more ammunition with which to abuse you!These abusers are like Judas.  When Mary put the perfume on Jesus' feet (John 12), Judas was ready with a put-down, cleverly cloaked as care for the poor, but his true motive was greed.  Keep in mind Judas had been walking with Jesus with three years...three years in the company of the best counselor to ever walk the earth.  If Jesus had not seen through his false piety and rebuked Judas, what would have happened to Mary?  She would have been afraid to ever do something like that again.  Now imagine if Mary was married to Judas, and her good impulses were attacked day after day, year after year.  Even if she stayed fairly well by managing to live a decent life and doing some good, when compared to the great life she could have had and the great good she could have done either single or with a loving partner, staying well seems like a pretty hollow victory."
"This book has been such an eye-opener for me and my marriage. I am not sure how I even found this book except I believe God led me to it after much prayer. I am learning so much and I am not even finished with it yet. What an extremely honest and well written book with so much biblical common sense.  It doesn't gloss things over, and also doesn't placate you the reader. I wish I had read this so many years ago. Thank you Leslie. Thank you for giving me hope and I pray I have the courage I need to follow through.  God bless you for being His voice to those of us hurting in destructive marriages."
"This book is probably one of the most FULLY insightful books I have read into an abusive marriage and spouse. The authors advice is applicable and practical. As a therapist myself, I frequently recommend this author and have found her books to be right on target. I don't believe she offered any false hope. Change is possible, but requires hard work on both parts, unfortunately the abuser may not want to work hard or ever change. The book is written for those in this type of relationship.  It offers hope, clarity, and above all truth, which is often distorted in the mind of the person being abused. Anyone in this type of relationship should seek professional help from someone trained in dealing with an emotional abuser. This book is a starting point and tool for those in abusive relationship, not a fix-all which the author never claimed. I have found this book to be one of her best and I appreciate her insightfulness and truth!"
"May the Holy Spirit convict you, and Father God forgive you for the marriages, families, generations, and lives destroyed by this incomplete and dangerous book, therapy, and mindset. Don't buy or read this book please! Ask Jesus Christ for help 1st. Try 'Focus on the Family' resources too.Zero... - 0 negative stars ‚òÜ"
"This is one of the best marriage books I‚Äôve ever read. In a sea of ‚Äúfluffy‚Äù marriage books that don‚Äôt take abuse into account, this book is like a life boat of sound, biblical advice for those living in destructive marriages. These marriages CAN be saved, but the common ‚Äúlove and respect‚Äù advice, etc will barely scratch the surface ordo more damage than good. Vernick‚Äôs book lays out a real plan for healing hurting marriages."
"Author Leslie Vernick, a licensed clinical social worker and relationship coach, has worked for more than 30 years helping individuals, couples and families rebuild and grow their relationships. In her newest text, THE EMOTIONALLY DESTRUCTIVE MARRIAGE, Vernick guides women through the common mistakes and unbiblical thinking that has so many suffering silently. She engages her audience with sound biblical truth and practical means to address even the most problematic areas within their marriage.Though Vernick could be addressing both men and women, she chooses to focus on helping women suffering within the confines of abusive marriages. She has laid out her text in three parts. In ""Part 1: Seeing Your Marriage Clearly,"" readers will better understand if they are in a destructive marriage; learn the three essential ingredients necessary to a thriving relationship; recognize the five patterns that destroy relationships and damage people; and discover where God is in this painful place.""Part 2: Change Begins with You"" will find readers zeroing in on specific principles for making lasting changes within themselves; understanding how trying harder becomes destructive; how to build your core of inner strength; and making wise plans to confront a spouse who is abusive. In ""Part 3: Initiating Changes in Your Marriage,"" women will learn how to speak up in love and stand up against the destruction; determine next steps when there is no obvious change; identify necessary changes for a marriage to heal; and restore the destructive marriage.Each and every chapter is replete with real life stories of women who have faced emotional suffering and abuse within their marriage relationship. Vernick shares the conversations she has had with them and gently leads them to reflect upon their situations from a new and truthful vantage point. Once women see the damage being done against them (and their children) and how they aren't living out their purpose as brave and courageous helpmates to their spouses, Vernick offers the steps to change.Not only does Vernick help women identify abuse as it occurs, she also shows them why it is biblically wrong to allow such abuse to continue. With gentle care and strong biblical admonition, she supplies everything women need to be equipped to take steps to free themselves (and their children) from the clutches of abuse. Even the most dismal relationships can be healed when women first stop the cycle of abuse as outlined throughout this resource and their spouses begin to make change as well.Vernick's commitment to marriage is evident throughout every chapter, and she always encourages women to work on repairing their marriage with wise and prudent steps before giving up. Given the subject matter, Vernick's text could be construed as difficult and dismal reading; it is not. In fact, her skill at turning even the most horrendous situation into something God can transform into something beautiful will encourage and hearten every reader who opens this book and studies its contents.Reviewed by Michele Howe"
"I had received an advance copy of this book in order to review. I wasn't sure if I'd like it or not, especially because my marriage is not ""on the rocks"", but I love reading and was intrigued by the idea behind this book. So many Christians stay married because it's ""the right thing to do"", but abuse is a real and scary thing. I was also skeptical that this would be an easy guilt-free escape guide to let people give up on healthy marriages just because...and I think that already happens too often in and out of church.  After reading this, I only wished it had been written ten years earlier for my mother. She stayed in an (emotionally) abusive marriage and it was terrible for everyone.I think it would be great for all young women to read so. They learn these abusive signs BEFORE they marry. Men as well though! I want my children to know these things. Maybe I'll lend it to them as teenagers to prepare them. The quiz is wonderful and simple to follow. This author truly has a heart for this cause and her hard work shows. Even though the author is Christian, like myself,  I think it would be helpful for non-Christians as well. She says nothing offensive and focuses on fixing marriages, not on trying to save your soul."
"The Emotionally Destructive Marriage by Leslie Vernick is a book devoted to help women in particular deal with marriages that have become destructive. It contains a wealth of advice for women to identify damaging behaviour, how to respond to criticism wisely and options to leave if the situation is not improving or even getting worse.It documents many cases with varying degrees of emotional and verbal abuse and possible solutions as well as pitfalls that make the situation worse rather than better. There are additional resources that can be accessed through the website to assist people as much as possible. That is one of the best aspects of this book, that the author has a great desire to ensure that these sort of troubled marriages are greatly improved and become the marriage relationship intended by the Bible.Personally, being a man, I found parts of this book very disturbing that men could be so cruel to people that confess to love and should be looking after not making their life harder. This is a book that I will hopefully never need but as the world is getting darker there are bound to be women coming into the church in these situations that will need help, which is when this book will be a great resource.The narrator was the author herself, which I think was important for such a troubling issue as marriage abuse because she could convey her message with the love, courage and emotion that was needed for such a sensitive topic. I thought she was quite easy to understand and the speed of the reading wasn't too fast for me to follow.This book is a must for women who are in destructive marriages where their husband is verbally, physically or emotionally abusive towards them. It would also be good for people trying to help these women, so they can give them good advice.This audio book was gifted as a part of the christianaudio Reviewers Program in exchange for my unbiased review of this work. More information can be found about this and other Christian audio books at christianaudio.com."
"Having grown up in the Christian community, I've heard and even given my share of marriage advice based on the Bible.  Looking back, I see that some of it wasn't healthy or even biblical, but based more on a spiritual list of what we'd imagined a Godly wife to be.  The problem with that list was it prioritized an ideal more than realism, and many women suffered needlessly, thinking it was ""for the cause of Christ"".This book put into words many of the thoughts that have been seeping into my mind about such advice lately, pointing out that emotional abuse is real, and that ignoring it or being a good enough wife doesn't make it go away.  Beginning with an explanation of the difference between an disappointing marriage and a destructive one, the author clearly points out how to determine which you are dealing with.She then spells out what is present in a healthy relationship and a destructive one over the next few chapters, before launching into the practicality of dealing with an abusive marriage.  Throughout the book, her explanations and advice are backed up with biblical references and spiritual understanding.  She recognizes the misguided counsel that exists within some Christian circles and explains why this is not consistent with God's Word.  Especially helpful is the information found in Appendix B, ""Five Common Mistakes People Helpers Make"".Not only would this book be a great help to anyone in an abusive marriage, but it should be required reading for every pastor, Christian counselor, or ladies minister.  It is the most practical I've found in dealing with problem marriages, and I wish I'd found it years ago.  Several circumstances come to mind when I've listened to a hurting wife explain what she's going through, distraught and tearful as she told her story.  The practical checklists and explanations found in these pages would have helped define the level of severity of what was happening and outlined action steps for dealing with the problems.The author's website is full of extra resources that correspond to this book and to relationships in general.  Dozens of free articles and videos provide relevant information, as well as her blog dealing with the topics of this book and relationships in general.  She takes time to answer reader questions and deals with tons of sticky situations, such as all those special cases filling in the ""Well, what if...?"" question.I listened to this as an audiobook read by the author.  A few minutes into the introduction I realized there was a lot of information I'd like to be able to reference for later use.  I ended up taking notes throughout the whole book, outlining key points and the action steps for each chapter.  Had I not chosen to do that, I would definitely have wanted to buy this book in print form after listening to it.It was necessary to rewind often, as the author read very quickly through some sections, and I had a bit of a hard time making out what she was saying.  Something that bothered me as well was when she changed her voice to imitate someone speaking through tears or whining.  It may not be an issue to someone else, but it began to grate on me after the first couple of times hearing it.  Apart from that, her passion for helping hurting women caught in destructive cycles shows through in her voice.**This book was provided to me through christianaudio's Reviewer Program in exchange for my honest review."
"When I was married in 1996, I was never going to get divorced.  I'm a Christian, and divorce is simply for people who don't work hard enough.  Right?My husbands charm faded into control and manipulation, and then into criticism and condemnation.  I tried everything.  I asked for counseling, I tried different tactics of speaking or working.  I gave up my hobbies and my friends.  I moved away from my family.  It was never good enough.  I justified to myself the verbal and emotional abuse my children were suffering.  I justified the physical abuse... until I couldn't any more.I listened to Vernick's book on audio.  In my car, really, because if he'd known I was listening to this book, it would have provoked a crazed rage.  At any rate, I found what I needed to be able to leave.The church in general needs to become better educated about abuse and the NEED for divorce in certain circumstances.  Until then, at least we have a handful of books to educate and support women in situations like mine.As for the detractors, this book is not telling women to give up and just leave her husband.  There are several steps defined to define boundaries and use church leadership well before that point.  The church needs to realize that adultery is not the ONLY justification for divorce.  Women like me aren't looking for excuses.  We are dying inside.  Trying to do our very best to honor our vows and God.  We are bullied by the church and others who have loud opinions without insight or real understanding of what women like me have experienced.  And to comment that some women will just use this book as a lukewarm justification for their unjustified want to end a marriage is utterly asinine.  Those sorts of actions are not the responsiblity of the author.  And how dare anyone suggest that it is more important to prevent ""those"" such women from divorcing over the safety of women and children is downright offensive.If you are earnestly seeking a path to a difficult decision (to stay or go), this book will be helpful.  Non-Christians might not find it as helpful as I did, as the ""operating system"" used to make such decisions is not the same.  It helped me.  My decision to divorce was the most difficult thing I ever did, but I'm grateful that I had a resource like this one to walk me through the path to what was right for my family in God's eyes."
"The Author admits she has never been in an abusive marriage and it shows through clearly.  This book advocates for confronting one's abuser and trying to get him to see the moral error of his ways.  With abusers, who typically have multiple Axis II characteristics, this advice to confront any abuser is not only ill-advised, but possibly lethal.  Even an abuser who has never been physically violent in the past may become so if directly confronted.  Additionally, women are given the hope that abusers may change when there is no empirical evidence to support this.  If women continue to hope for change, they put themselves and their children in unnecessary danger.  Not okay.  Skip this book as it is sure to offer ineffective and disappointing advice."
"Received book a week ago and can‚Äôt put it down. I‚Äôm half way through it. It has so much sound advise from a biblical perspective. Before starting to take control emotionally destructive marriage please read this book first. I wish I knew it existed before I started my plan, but with other biblical advise and a few other books I wasn‚Äôt far off on what this book recommends. Thank goodness! This book by far has been the best in all aspects of what a woman goes through that is experiencing emotional abuse. Even if you are not sure if you are in an unhappy marriage, or if it is actually an abusive marriage, this book will hel you know a d figure it out. There is a big difference in the two. Blessings!"
"The Emotionally Destructive Marriage by Leslie Vernick is an important book for women who feel trapped in destructive and dangerous relationships. As a women's ministry leader, I decided to review the book and gather a better perspective on women in these situations. I've read several of her books  and each one has a powerful message. In this book The Emotionally Destructive Marriage author Leslie Vernick begins with a series of questions to help you discern if you're in an emotionally destructive marriage. She writes ""An emotionally destructive marriage is one where one's personhood, dignity, and freedom of choice is regularly denied, criticized, or crushed. This can be done through words, behaviors, economics, attitudes and misusing the Scriptures."" The next step in the process to understanding is journaling your experience as you read the book. The book is a must-read if you think your are in a difficult marriage and feel powerless because of your husband.  As you work through the chapters in the book, you'll learn five patterns that destroy a relationship and damage people. Then Leslie teaches you how to build your core and how to respond in an effective manner. If what you have tried in the past is not working, then this book is certain to help. By the time you finish the book, you will also have the wisdom to decide if its time to stay or time to go. While some marriages heal and come together, others may remain destructive and it's important to have a safety plan in case you need this. I'd recommend this book for ministry leaders, along with the book How To Act Right When Your Spouse Acts Wrong by Leslie Vernick. Though you can't change your husband, you can change your attitude and your approach in communicating with him. Seeing the marriage from a Biblical perspective and through the lens of scripture is a must for any Christian woman. Find out how by reading these books. Even if you are not married, you will still benefit from reading these books. Highly recommend for single women too!I received this book free from the author. I was not required to write a positive review and the opinions I have expressed are my own."
"I am a women's ministry leader and am so heart broken at all the messy marriages the church at large is facing today. I have purchased dozens of Kindle and hard copy versions of this book to give to friends and church members who are hurting and in an abusive home environment. Leslie empowers a woman who is in a hard place with TOOLS for her toolbox, as well as gives practical tips she can do to help lift herself up emotionally and spiritually while she works on trying to survive and figure out her next steps in her unhealthy home environment. I will continue to buy this for any Christian woman I encounter that needs some help finding her voice and knowing that Jesus loves her in the middle of her marital discord. This book used in conjunction with Christian counseling is a power combo!"
"If you are a religious person who reads and believes the bible then this book is for you.  If you are married to a person who regularly dominates, demeans, degrades, deceives or dismisses you and you are a religious person who believes in the bible, then this book is for you.  Since I don't fall into the category of either, it was a waste of time!"
"Leslie Vernick has written an excellent book to help women see if they are in an emotionally destructive marriage. A quiz is given to help women determine exactly where their marriage stands. Tips are provided to help women to change in healthy ways, to gain the skills they need, and to stay safe.  Each chapter offers a prayer and an action step for the women to take. Leslie has been counseling individuals, couples, and families for over 30 years, and this book truly shows women how to set boundaries and break free from emotionally destructive relationships. I recommend this book for anyone in an potentially unhealthy marriage or relationship."
"If you are feeling hopeless and struggling to hold it together because your marriage is taking a toll on you, you may be in a destructive toxic marriage. This book will help you understand what you are likely experiencing and help you to regain your voice,sanity, and safety among other things. This book has helped free me in my thinking and has given practical steps in regaining lost ground. Every church leader and minister needs to read this book to better aid church members who need more than just try harder."
"This book is absolutely amazing and a must have for any person struggling in a marriage. While it's target audience is women, Leslie does a great job in letting men know the subject matter applies to them as well. My only regret is that I didn't find this sooner. I strongly believe that any counselor, christian or not, should have this book. Furthermore, I believe this book is a must have for any person involved in church leadership and counseling. This book will equip the reader with tools necessary to breakthrough and overcome a destructive marriage. Leslie very clearly helps to distinguish a disappointing marriage from a destructive one. She very clearly identifies emotionally destructive behaviors and patterns and provides a clear guideline on how to address a marriage that is suffering from emotional and physically destructive behaviors. I read through it once pretty quickly and realize this is the kind of book one should keep in the back pocket and re-read frequently."
"I am a woman who is a survivor of over 25 years in a abusive destructive marriage and witnessed my children being destroyed. I have also survived a mother who physically and emotionally abused me as a child. I accept the part that I played in this marraige and the decisions I made that contributed to this life path. I hurt my children deeply and wounded myself.During my Healing Journey I have been to a secular counselor, Physicist, Christian Counselor, books, therapy groups, Pastors, Priests. My children went to therapy during this marriage. I had a stay in psychiatric in house hospital given 30 years of medicine and drugs for my so called emotions and disorders.My point is this it truly has been amazing how when I got a hold of Leslie Vernicks first book and now this POWER HOUSE book on Destructive Marriages something happened different. MY Identity changed. The book is so filtered with aspects of the word of God which along with my Biblical Studies did the work I needed in ME .This is not a simple new book about a genre.I have read many books. I have ordered 25 copies for my ministry group.Teaching her principles for 4 years has already freed so many women and I see alot of Fruit in their lives. This new book that I just introduced has given HOPE and is filled with tools which have been already productive within my group and the lives of these woman in a short time span. It is not about the degrees you have or the mighty work you have been doing it is about change in lives. This book helps you understand YOUR identity is not in what happened to you or what people did to you or your children or what anyone condemns you for. Proverbs tells us to get council from many and take from all what is right and good. Well I have seen explosion of changes in woman in bondage freed to be who they are and not fear to speak. Woman who have found there true Identity and Voice. Changes are what these woman desire they do not care about diplomas, degrees or education. The impact on the lives of others that produces change  is enough evidence of this POWER HOUSE BOOK for me. The women could not put it down. Jackie S. Thank you Leslie"
"Apart from the Bible, this has been the single most helpful and practical resources I've read.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who thinks they are in a destructive marriage.  Not only will you be equipped, you will be encouraged and affirmed.  If you are like me you will also have your eyes opened to areas where you are/might be contributing to the destruction.  I will be returning to the pages of this book regularly to be reminded of what my role is and what my actions should be to work towards restoration of my marriage."
"Powerful book and so practical. The author provides scripture, scripts and examples to help the reader use the wisdom offered."
"This book is for Christian people seeking Christian solutions to their problems.  I overlooked the mention of biblical solutions.  My oversight and my regret.  Nice identification of destructive behaviors, though."
"This author is addressing some very critical issues both that the subject matter exists and that the church largely ignores it. Domestic violence is very ""sticky"" business; I have found that the churches I have been in really do not want to deal with such things or they do as the author writes ""tell the woman to go back and submit to that man"" nonsense.  BTW, I saw that first hand in my parents marriage!  I recommend this book--highly."
"In many Christian circles, emotional abuse especially in the marriage context is often minimized or overlooked, yet its impact creates deep wounds that tear down a person's spirit. In the Emotionally Destructive Marriage, a framework is established to guide, educate, and reveal more definitive aspects of emotional abuse. Leslie's exceptional questionnaire provides a measuring tool to assess one's marriage.A comparison of the essentials of a healthy relationship gives the reader a basis to move from their ""normal/familiar"" to one that is God's intention for the marriage relationship. Too often our culture and family of origin have not provided good examples of how relationships should work.There are many choices and decisions that need to be made as one comes to face the reality of the destructive components. Suggestions and examples are given in the book that could be applied as an action step. Too often the Christian community does not place a high priority on the victim's safety and sanity. There is a greater emphasis on saving the marriage at all costs. Leslie biblically addresses issues like these throughout her book.A prayer and action step at the end of each chapter guides the victim into moving forward in the midst of chaos and confusion. God will provide a way where there seems to be no way.For 18 years, I have counseled women who experience abusive relationships. It is so encouraging to me to finally have emotional abuse addressed from a biblical perspective. We will use this book as a resource in FOCUS Ministries, Inc. and recommend it to those we serve.Paula Silva, President/Cofounder of FOCUS Ministries, Inc."
"I wish I had this book about 15 years ago! I've struggled for so long, not knowing what it was I was dealing with. This isn't the kind of information that gets discussed in church or even out among girlfriends (for reasons she discusses in the book).  Words can't say enough about how helpful this book is if this is what you're living!If you're wondering if this book is for you, check her website at [...]. She has videos that are sort of an intro to each chapter. I watched the videos while I was waiting for my paperback copy to arrive, and I found those very helpful. The book goes into much more detail and is extremely helpful.I also recommend this book to counselors and pastors. The ones I met with on this journey definitely didn't understand what Leslie shares here!"
"Before I got this book and took her quiz online, I couldn't make decisions anymore. I could barely drive. My body had broken down and I was very sick from the stress of living in a destructive marriage. I had never been validated that my marriage was destructive despite years of Christian counseling. I honestly thought I was crazy and needed a straight jacket. After reading, I started a journey that helped me take my eyes off of marriage as the goal. I fixed my eyes on Christ alone and have grown into trusting Him through anything and everything. It helped me see the lies that I was believing. One lie was that deep down I really thought I was responsible for his behavior and all of his feelings etc. After reading this book, I'm now experiencing the freedom and love that God wants for me. Highly recommend this book to anyone who thinks they might be in an emotionally destructive relationship."
I am still learning and growing. This book taught me so much about the distraction vs disappointment that was 18 years of marriage..
"I will be recommending this book to women in difficult marriages, for two reasons:  1) Her words are solidly rooted in the bible.  She highlights scripture that is relevant for abusive relationships, which other authors or pastors ignore or overlook.  2) She understands the dynamics of abusive relationships, which enables her to provide practical, relevant, and biblical counsel to women in destructive marriages.  This combination of good theology and practical insight is unparalleled by the other Christian authors that I have read.Leslie recognizes that despite the most sacrificial efforts on the part of one spouse, some marriages, due to the hardness of one spouse, will not change.  She does not sugarcoat this reality, but speaks truth to it.  This book is not about ""fixing"" your marriage, but about identifying it as destructive, strengthening your identity and rootedness in Christ, and giving women the knowledge, tools, and practical wisdom to make strong, intelligent decisions for the good of their family.Leslie will not make decisions for you.  She places the responsibilty for making tough choices on the women who are in destructive marriage.  She points out that while the advice of pastors and counselors is often well intentioned, they do not have to live with the consequences of their counsel.  Some women will defer to their husbands or pastors, and end up regretting these decisions after they have led to continued abuse, destruction, and sin, sometimes even endangering their children.Some of the practical advice Leslie provides is how to set up a safety plan, how to be prepared when talking with your pastor, tips on consulting with a lawyer, and a step by step plan on how to confront your husband.  She also advises women not to do this until they have developed CORE strength, a process that can take months or longer.  She provides an extensive list of additional resources in the back of her book.I highly recommend this book to women in destructive marriage, as well as pastors, counselors, mentors, or friends of those who are in destructive marriages.  I wish every pastor would read this book to gain insight into the painful realities that women face in destructive marriages."
"Leslie was able to speak truth to destructive marriages with not only pragmatism, but through and with the word of God. Excellent work and one that I will share."
"I can't say enough about this book. It's written from a Christian perspective which I highly appreciate. This book will challenge you to take a good hard look at your relationship to analyze if it's worth working at or if you should seek to get out.If you're being mentally, emotionally or physically abused, I highly recommend you getting it. It will help change your situation. I got this book for free from Waterbrook Multnomah's site."
Not helpful. It was just a bunch of stories about abusive relationships. No solutions.
"Such a wonderful book, I am so happy I did a goggle search and this book came up. I thank God my marriage is healing with the help of God, church,  counciling and this book!"
"Hands down great read. This book definitely educated me on what exactly I was experiencing. I highly recommend this book!! Leslie also is on Facebook and posts videos, a lot are live."
"First let me say that Ms. Vernick has certainly put her finger on a very real problem in relationships in our day.  However, what she then offers as a solution I can only describe as a carefully crafted wresting of scriptures out of context mixed with a good bit of modern psychoanalysis.  The overall result is a book which I am certain will do much more harm than good.  I could go into detail and cite numerous examples here, but time won't permit.It's unfortunate that this book is not commendable because so many are unwilling to admit the kinds of destructive behaviors that Ms. Vernick describes and Biblical resources to help seem to be few and far between.  All I can recommend is that you keep looking.  This is just another great example of the mixing of the doctrines of demons with that of the Bible - the seduction of Christianity and ultimately the destruction of marriages."
"simply put all marriages are emotionally destructive unless they are surrendered to the glory of God in Christ. This book is a great excuse for person to validate their anger at the shortcomings of their spouse. This book is descriptive but not prescriptive (all description with no meaningful help). Please read only if you want to give up on your marriage. If you want to grow in the purpose of marriage read This Momentary Marriage by John Piper or Strengthening your Marriage by Wayne Mack, or When Sinners Say ""I Do"""
"How I have waited for this resource to give to those in great pain in their emotionally abusive marriages. Though both genders experience abuse, Leslie has written this resource for women to help them know how to cope or how to separate. A test in the first chapter will help them identify if, indeed, they are in an emotionally abusive marriage. Emotional abuse is serious, for reckless words, Proverbs tells us, pierce like a sword. These women need help just as much as physically abused women need help. I am so thankful for Leslie's expertise, gifting, and compassion. If I could give ten stars, I would.Dee Brestin"
"Excellent eye-opener to the fact that not all marriage issues are the same; therefore should not be counselled the same!!! Thank you, Leslie for identifying this & educating us!!! It can be damage on top of destruction & has happened to so many women who go to their church leaders for support."
"A must read if you have the slightest inclination, that little nagging feeling in the back of your mind that you don't want to listen to, that you are in an emotionally damaging marriage."
Cannot review it as I have not read it yet--just skimmed it. If it helps another person escape an emotionally destructive marriage it is excellent.
"Incredible book which helps to determine if a marriage is destructive or just disappointing, a survey to determine which types of abuse are in the marriage and step by step instructions on how to improve an emotionally destructive marriage. A great tool for counselors and a great read for those in ministry as well."
"I love listening to books in audio format and was thrilled to discover that the author of this book was the narrator... I feel like its more personal when the actual author of the book is the one reading it to you.. In this case I do not feel like Leslie Vernick was the best to read the story.. At times it was hard to keep up with her because she reads really fast.. I found myself having to repeat a few sections just to get the words in..When I first saw this book I was thrilled .. it looked like a nice book that I thought would help my marriage.. I was surprised to discover it was a book that focused on Women who were abused..The author even specifies in the introduction that this book was written for woman only, and not men.. The book seemed to bash men .. and i really didn't enjoy that.  I have a good marriage although not perfect it is certainly not abusive..  .. I didn't really get anything out of this book.. but i believe there is a lot of useful information for woman who are struggling in an abusive marriage..I was given the opportunity to review this book through  christianaudio Reviewers Program (christianaudio) [...] .."
"This book was very good. A friend recommended me to read this. I would recommend this book also. I like how Leslie doesn't just say ""Oh the woman is provoking her to have her man to anger."" I also appreciate that she looks at the whole picture of a relationship and not just here and there type of thing."
This is for men also. If your wife is telling you to change you need to read this book before its to late.
Good
If you like to ruin your marriage this book is a good tool to do so.
"Leslie Vernick's The Emotionally Destructive Marriage is written for the individual or couple that is characterized by emotional dysregulation that is or borders on abuse. Many marriages are, at best passively emotionally abusive. Years often go by seeking and waiting for change. Vernick's book will likely be helpful to many.Vernick's book is balanced in many ways. She stresses care of self, while encouraging personal responsibility. This is an often overlooked aspect when considering change in an emotionally abusive relationship. Vernick is wise to graciously help the reader look at ways he or she can take responsibility for change.My primary concern is that the book seems to point the reader to self more than to God. There are instances when Vernick considers this, though in the midst of suffering, looking to God should be of primary importance. The gospel changes everything, even enabling one to endure such suffering as in an emotionally hurtful marriage."
Stupid.
"See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ. For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily, (Colossians 2:8-9)The Emotionally Destructive MarriageLeslie VernickColorado Springs: Waterbrook Press, 2013978-0-307-73118-0(All Bible quotations are from the English Standard Version, unless otherwise noted. Page numbers from Vernick's book are given in parentheses.)Leslie Vernick has a Masters degree in Clinical Social Work from the University of Illinois, and has received post-graduate training in Biblical Counseling and Cognitive Therapy. She is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker in Pennsylvania.What is Cognitive Therapy?Vernick is a practitioner of Cognitive Therapy (CT).  CT is a type of psychotherapy developed by American psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck. CT is one of the therapeutic approaches within the larger group of cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) and was first expounded by Beck in the 1960s. CT is a type of psychotherapy in which negative patterns of thought about the self and the world are challenged in order to alter unwanted behavior patterns or treat mood disorders such as depression.""CT has its roots in two sources. Wilhelm Wundt, ""the father of experimental psychology"" who founded ""the first formal laboratory for psychological research at the University of Leipzig in 1879""; and Sigmund Freud, the father of psychotherapy.The Naturalism/Atheism/Behaviorism ConnectionPsychoanalysis and Psychotherapy are theories that are derived from the philosophy, or worldview, of Naturalism, ‚Äúthe belief that nature is all that there is.‚Äù  Naturalism in its psychological application is called Behaviorism. CT is a variety of Behaviorism. CT is a philosophy of man, not of Scripture.In his presidential address to the American Philosophic Association in 1954, Ernest Nagel gave this summation of the theory of the Naturalism upon which Behaviorism is founded:The occurrence of events, qualities, and processes, and the characteristic behavior of various individuals, are contingent on the organization of spatio-temporally located bodies, whose internal and external relations determine and limit the appearance and disappearance of everything that happens. That this is so, is one of the best-tested conclusions of experience‚Ä¶.There is no place for the operation of disembodied forces, no place for an immaterial spirit directing the course of events, no place for the survival of personality after the corruption of the body which exhibits it.Nagel's points are clear. There is in Naturalism (and therefore in Behaviorism) no sovereign God who directs all things (and hence no Theology, thereby eliminating a biblical Anthropology, the doctrine of Man in his origin and constitution), and nothing knowable as an afterlife (hence, no Soteriology, the doctrine of salvation).The Bible or Behaviorism?That the Bible teaches differently is accepted by all Christians. Or, it ought to be. The Bible is replete with statements that God is in control of all persons and events, and that all men are destined to live into eternity. These are ideas that are most needed to maintain healthy Christians, and biblically healthy (sound) marriages. Such ideas have a significant impact on our worldview that it cannot be an understatement to say that our views on this things will have an impact on the way we interpret Scripture.The basic anthropology of the Bible is summed up well by John Calvin in his Institutes, Book 1, Chapter 15, Section 2. The section is so germane to the subjects of God's sovereignty, a proper anthropological understanding, and Behaviorism, that the reader would do well to read it in its entirety (not given here).‚Ä¶there can be no question that man consists of a body and a soul; meaning by soul, an immortal though created essence‚Ä¶.Christ, in commending his spirit to the Father, and Stephen his to Christ, simply mean, that when the soul is freed from the prison-house of the body, God becomes its perpetual keeper... It is true, indeed, that men cleaving too much to the earth are dull of apprehension, nay, being alienated from the Father of Lights, are so immersed in darkness as to imagine that they will not survive the grave; still the light is not so completely quenched in darkness that all sense of immortality is lost‚Ä¶.the mere knowledge of a God sufficiently proves that souls which rise higher than the world must be immortal‚Ä¶ while the many noble faculties with which the human mind is endued proclaim that something divine is engraven on it, they are so many evidences of an immortal essence.‚Ä¶when the author of the Epistle to the  Hebrews distinguishes the fathers of our flesh from God, who alone is the Father of our spirits, he could not have asserted the essence of the soul in clearer terms. Moreover, did not the soul, when freed from the fetters of the body, continue to exist, our Saviour would not have represented the soul of Lazarus as enjoying blessedness in Abraham's bosom, while, on the contrary, that of Dives was suffering dreadful torments. Paul assures us of the same thing when he says, that so long as we are present in the body, we are absent from the Lord. Not to dwell on a matter as to which there is little obscurity, I will only add, that Luke mentions among the errors of the Sadducees that they believed neither angel nor spirit.Scripture makes God's sovereignty and Man's eternal destiny essential to understanding Man and his future entrance into eternity. Behaviorism denies these truths. The Atheism inherent to Naturalism and its psychological consequent, Behaviorism, denies the Bible is truth. The Bible has no authority in Atheism, Behaviorism, or any other philosophy constructed by men, and this is at the crux of the warning of Paul in Colossians 2, quoted above.The Christian will remember that Man was created first as a body, which was not animated until God gifted it with life (Genesis 2). A Christian will also remember that 15 centuries had passed with Moses' body in the grave where it decomposed, when he appeared in the Transfiguration (Luke 9), talking with Jesus and Elijah. If these things did not happen in history, the Bible is false. Behaviorism pitches its tent on the denial of the immaterial, while the Gospel is dependent on it.This lengthy introduction to a review of Leslie Vernick's book The Emotionally Destructive Marriage is necessary so that we begin with some right presuppositions. The impact of Behaviorism and Cognitive Therapy on some of Vernick's theology will be noted.Christians who marry Behaviorism with Christianity compromise the Bible. Referring back to the quote from Nagel, we understand that Behaviorism denies the immaterial. God, his glory, sin, redemption, and a plethora of other teachings that cannot be empirically proven are discarded by Behaviorism, which thereby reveals that it is contrary to revealed truth. Therefore, any theory of behavior modification that Behaviorism puts forth'even and especially when married to Scripture'is flawed from the outset.NarrativeIt is necessary to address the literary device of narrative that Vernick and so many others utilize in the thousands of books available in the area of Christian psychology and counseling, because the use of narrative is such a suggestively powerful literary device. One could postulate a biblical presentation of the doctrines and practices of the church based solely on the Bible, or he could choose, as Vernick does, to use narrative, which is based on things she says ""are disguised except for those who have given me their real names. Some stories are composites to illustrate a specific point."" (4)By using narrative as a device, Vernick buttresses her arguments for emotional abuse, countenancing the permissibility of separation, and divorce, based on her subjective interpretation of events, real or imagined (what she calls ""composite""). Proleptically  making appeals to Christian faith (the objective) with (her word) ""disguised"" history (the subjective) may seem to make for a very strong argument, but the fallacy of this method lies in the recognition that history is only descriptive, while the imperatives of Scripture are proscriptive'for marriage and all other areas of life.History tells us what was, not how things ought to be. Only the Bible, the word of God, can tell us what ought to be in the areas of ethics and morality. Behaviorism has no authority in these areas, if in any area at all. The Bible alone is the rule of faith and practice.The Loaded Question, Complex QuestionIt appears to me that Vernick assumes women who want to get free of what they consider bad marriages are reading her book to find justification for doing so. Vernick's presentation aids this, rather than guards against it.Phrasing a question or statement in such as way as to imply another unproven statement is true without evidence or discussion is a logical fallacy known as the Loaded Question, or Complex Question fallacy. This fallacy often overlaps with begging the question (another fallacy), since it also presupposes a definite answer to a previous, unstated question.The usual example of the Loaded question fallacy is, ""Have you stopped beating your wife yet?"" The hidden presupposition is that you have been taking beating your wife. Such a question cannot be answered with a simple ""yes"" or ""no.""  It is not a simple question but consists of several questions rolled into one. In the example the unstated question is, ‚ÄúHave you beaten your wife in the past?‚Äù followed by, ‚ÄúIf you have beaten your wife in the past,  have you stopped beating her now?‚Äù""The intelligent procedure when faced with such a question is to analyze its component parts. If one answers or discusses the prior, implicit question first, the explicit question may dissolve.""When Vernick asks the reader certain questions there is the obvious assumption that the wife has done little or nothing to contribute to the sinful patterns that have developed in the marriage.For example, a husband and wife cannot agree on staying at a certain church. They both have what each believes to be sound and biblical reasons for their position. For both of them, the lack of resolution leads to frustration and the sin of anger. (According to Brian Schwertley, men tend to externalize anger, and women to internalize it.) If the couple has a history of disagreeing on matters of importance to the family, they both may become frustrated if the question of church attendance and affiliation is not resolved agreeably, and begin to express their frustration. The wife may insist on her will, disregarding his (or so he has come to believe). It isn't his wife's responsibility if he doesn't handle it well. Yet, the husband is responsible to answer to God for the spiritual state of his family, so he continues trying to reach a resolution. He as well as she believes that there is not mutual respect, reciprocity, and freedom as guided by Scripture. He becomes angry and expresses it openly, and she becomes angry and internalizes it. Both are sinning.Along comes Vernick who asks her, ""Are you in an emotionally destructive marriage?"" (7) Any contributing factors to a sin-problem that are prior are swept away. They both are in sin, but the wife asks the husband for a separation after working through the following:""6. My spouse uses the Bible to criticize me or get me to do something he wants me to do."" (18)""13. If I don't agree with my husband or do what he wants, I have a price to pay."" (19)""17. My spouse disregards my needs."" (19)""27. My spouse refuses to listen to my point of view."" (21)""32. My spouse has injured me."" (21)""51. I feel crazy in my marriage."" (24)""52. I feel trapped in my marriage."" (24)""53. I don't feel I can be myself in my marriage."" (24)""56. I feel tense around my spouse."" (24)""57. I feel angry around my spouse."" (24)It is clear that Vernick's phrasing lends itself to determining ""the other guy"" is in sin and the reader is not. Vernick encourages self- justification, rather than submission to God's Word, and repentant self-examination. To lovingly confront what we judge to be sin isn't forbidden, but to be in unrepentant sin while admonishing others to repent isn't granted by Scripture. It is hypocritical judging:Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, ‚ÄòLet me take the speck out of your eye,‚Äô when there is the log in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye. (Matthew 7:3-5)What is a right remedy? Perhaps it is a repentant and humble return to understanding the nature of the marriage covenant, wherein we pledge to give all for the sake of another, and risking the possibility that the other will not do the same.Two passages on the subject are Matthew 19:3-9 and 1 Corinthians 7:10-11. First, Matthew 19.And Pharisees came up to him and tested him by asking, ‚ÄúIs it lawful to divorce one's wife for any cause?‚Äù He answered, ‚ÄúHave you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, ‚ÄòTherefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh‚Äô? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.‚Äù They said to him, ‚ÄúWhy then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?‚Äù He said to them, ‚ÄúBecause of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery.‚Äù (Matthew 19:3-9)Jesus is clear: man shall not separate the married, except for infidelity.The other passage is in 1 Corinthians 7.To the married I give this charge (not I, but the Lord): the wife should not separate from her husband (but if she does, she should remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband), and the husband should not divorce his wife. (1 Corinthians 7:10-11)Paul and Jesus agree: separation is unacceptable. The spouses should be reconciled, and that is the only goal they should prepare for. Later in her book, Vernick will erroneously counsel her readers to obtain a lawyer, contrary to Paul's teaching that a Christian should not go to law against a Christian (1 Corinthians 6:1-8).  She encourages other activities in preparation for a separation that are to be kept hidden from the spouse.Thirdly, Matthew 18 contains clear guidelines for reconciliation. The words of Christ should be followed.It was difficult to even begin reading The Emotionally Destructive Marriage. The title itself is loaded with meaning. If Vernick's purpose is, as she states in the Introduction, ""Hanging On by a Thread"", ""to heal and‚Ä¶bring true restoration to your destructive marriage"" (2), why are her presuppositions that some marriages have ""terminal cancer"" (1), and that ""pastors, Christian counselors, friends, and lay leaders"" are ""putting an extraordinarily heavy burden on a wife's shoulders‚Ä¶to maintain a loving and warm relationship with a husband who treats her with cruelty, disrespect, deceit, and gross indifference""? Vernick's says ""It's not feasible, nor is it biblical."" It isn't feasible, or biblical, to ask a spouse to suffer for righteousness sake? (We are not referring to preserving oneself from danger, or the consequences of adultery or desertion.)Writes Vernick, ""Every marriage has the potential to become destructive because we all are naturally selfish and prideful. Every married couple experiences some frustrations, hurts, unfulfilled expectations, unrealized dreams, and unhappiness throughout their relationship. How we respond to those disappointments can mature us and draw us closer to God and to one another, or we can let those disappointments destroy us and our marriage."" (14)Without a doubt the last two sentences are true, Sin, and sinful circumstances, can separate us from God and one another. But, is it true that ""marriage has the potential to become destructive ""? Not at all. Sinners sin, and sin that it is not addressed can destroy, but Vernick's subtlety in the first sentence quoted from page 14 (above) is not accurate.It is inaccurate because God made all things good, including marriage. Sin attacks the good of the marriage institution. When sinners marry (all the married are sinners) they risk damaging one another. The marriage does not damage them, but the sin does. Such a distinction is critical to properly understanding our roles in restoration and forgiveness. Such a distinction cannot be made by Vernick, perhaps, because her ""professional training"" was apparently deficient in its emphasis on the sufficiency of Scripture.What does God say about a wife's relationship to her husband when he is not acting Christianly? When he is sinning against his wife and family because he is not walking in God's ways? (The admonitions can apply to both parties.) More importantly, why doesn't Vernick go to these types of Scriptural passages from the outset instead of waiting until after the reader answers the quiz, ""Are You In An Emotionally Destructive Marriage?"" on pages 18-24?The quiz is bent towards the pre-determination that the marriage is emotionally destructive. Poll questions crafted within an agenda will produce the result desired. As Jay Adams has said ""'In counseling, as in every area of life, you usually find what you are looking for."" (The Big Umbrella [Phillipsburg, NJ: Presbyterian and Reformed, 1979], p. 50). This is one point where the impact of Behaviorism and Cognitive Therapy on Vernick's theology is discernible. In assessing the quiz, we find it is in fact skewed towards Behaviorism in that Vernick uses the words ""describe, indicate, indicators"" and even the ambiguous term ""crazy-making"". This psychological term (not a scriptural term) accords also with her usage of ""abuse, abusive, abusive tactics, controlling abuse, dependency, coercive, coercive control, toxic, etc."" (25, 26)Leading the reader, Vernick then recommends the spouse hide their thoughts from their mate, for causes of fear and worry (anxiety, contrary to Philippians 4:6).In handling her husband's sin, Vernick counsels women to:1. Keep a record of wrongs. ""Write down when and where he berates you, what words he uses to demean you, what actions he does that scare you, or what specifically he's done that has left you feeling abandoned."" In justifying her position Vernick denies that 1 Corinthians 13:5 prohibits this: ""Sometimes women are told, '[Love] keeps no record of wrongs' (1 Corinthians 13:5, NIV). They feel guilty documenting these problems and exposing their spouses' behaviors to get support from others. This verse doesn't tell you to forget about what happens. That could be very dangerous. This verse tells you not to keep score. Not to allow your anger and hurt to harden your heart with resentment and bitterness that make you feel entitled to retaliate.""In the ESV the verse is translated, ""[Love is not] ‚Ä¶rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful"" (1 Corinthians 13:5)Vernick is right in her exegesis at this point. However, the middle part of the verse says love ""does not insist on its own way."" Here is where Vernick makes a telling omission as she continues to encourage wives to engage in four actions'two of which are destructive of reconciliation and create further separation, rather than lend themselves to unity. These actions are1. Consult with a lawyer. (126)2. Get your own bank account and credit card. (127)3. Talk. (127-128)4. Pray. (130)Once again, the juxtaposition of these items is telling us that Vernick's behaviorism is wagging the dog. Why not Pray, Talk, Act?As a husband, I desire my wife to explain to me her actions. I may (and do sometimes) disagree, but if I am only asking for my wife to communicate with me That isn't a sin.It appears that Vernick's justification lies in the assertion, ""He is not in control of this situation; you are."" (156) This explains her omission of the words that say that love ""does not insist on its own way"" when commenting on 1 Corinthians 13:5.Hence, my assertion that Vernick's counsel ends up being unbiblical in advising the first two actions. If a wife reasonably explains what Vernick is advising her to do, one might charitably hope and expect that the husband would say (as I have done) ""I do not think these actions are necessary"", and it might also spur him to the repentance desired. Vernick leaves no room for this until after the fact, after the actions are taken.This may be due to the fact that Vernick's teaches that it is the right of a wife to exact a penalty for sin from her husband. She mentions Jeremiah 4:18, which states, "" ‚ÄúYour own conduct and actions have brought this on you. This is your punishment. How bitter it is! How it pierces to the heart!"" Verkin's denies the treatment is punitive, but she takes away with one hand what she gave with the other.The punishment comes in forms of ""possible consequences"" for the wife to enforce:1. End a conversation. (158)2. Refuse to drive anywhere together. (158)3. Exit a situation when he is escalating. (158)4. Initiate church discipline. (158-159)5. Withdraw sexual privileges. (159)6. Separate.(159)7. Call the police. (160)None of these consequences done with charity and for substantial reason, except the physical separation, are without substance. We reap what we sow.What makes Vernick's suggestions objectionable is in the secrecy she enjoins, and in placing communication with the husband within the context of the wife's control. The very objection used to justify the subjective assessment that the marriage is ""emotionally destructive"", characterized as "" coercive control"" (26), is then given by Vernick's as a right to the wife (again, page 156: ""He is not in control of this situation; you are.""), and what husband would not be emotionally destroyed by this vengeful approach?The Bible teaches that Christians are a people under Christ's reign that have received mercy (1 Peter 2:10). Because we are the recipients of mercy, we are to exercise mercy.Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy. (Matthew 5:7)The ‚Äúmerciful‚Äù are those who understand their own need for God‚Äôs mercy. Because they understand their true position of weakness before God, the ‚Äúmeek‚Äù (Matthew 5:5) have a humility that translates into treating others with kindness, not vengeance. By quoting Jeremiah 4:18 Vernick is teaching her readers to take God's place in judging the sins of his people. In verse 12 of Jeremiah 4, the Lord says ""it is I who speak judgment upon them."" Vernick puts herself in God's place, teaching her readers to put themsleves in the place of God.Writes Dan Hamilton:Vengeance in the Bible is described in detail, hoped for, prayed for, promised. And it is left securely and solely in God's hands. He has reserved it for himself. There are reasons for this. James tells us that ""the anger of man does not work the righteousness of God"" (1:20). When I was young, I helped my father build things in his workshop. I could do some of the work and use some of the tools, but I was reminded, ""Keep your hands off the power tools. They are good tools, and useful in my hands to do what I want done, but they are too powerful and dangerous for you to use.""Revenge is a spiritual power tool fitted to God's hand alone.God is in control of vengeance; when we exact payment for the sins of our spouse, we are failing to exercise forgiveness and striving to control another person by the withholding of it.Remembering that Naturalism in its psychological application is called Behaviorism, and that the former, by virtue of its root, denies implicitly that an immaterial spirit may be in control, Vernick denies'implicitly'that God is in control. Therefore, she assigns that control to the wife.It is irrational when we are told that somehow the illness will now become the cure. This contradiction displays that her integrationist melding of Behaviorism and Christianity lacks cohesion, revealing that it is not friendly to Christianity, which is consistent in all of its tenets.God's consistent instructions for handling sin in marriage are of a different construction and methodology.Likewise, wives, be subject to your own husbands, so that even if some do not obey the word, they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives, when they see your respectful and pure conduct. Do not let your adorning be external‚Äîthe braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry, or the clothing you wear‚Äîbut let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious. For this is how the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, by submitting to their own husbands, as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you are her children, if you do good and do not fear anything that is frightening. Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered. (1 Peter 3:1-7)At earlier points in her book Vernick, as someone trained in Biblical counseling, has the perfect opportunity to address both spouses. Instead, she acts the part of the Clinical Social Worker and focuses on behaviors. Again, this is a capitulation to Behaviorism and Cognitive Therapy. She even goes so far as to put a prayer in the mouths of her readers that focuses on the consequences of sin rather than deliverance from it: ""God‚Ä¶I want to know your wisdom and your ways so that I am not destroyed by the pain I am in."" (27) This, too, is in agreement with her adoption of Cognitive Therapy and Behaviorism. True to the pop-psychology counseling movement, she deals with the symptoms by starting with problem-centeredness, rather than Christ-centeredness. She is man-centered, not God-centered. Her starting point is of the utmost importance because Vernick is (perhaps unintentionally) denying that God is sovereign, and has ordained in his decree the difficulties we experience, which work for our good and his glory (Romans 8:28).While Vernick assumes pastors and others are incompetent when  giving counsel to wives who believe their marriages are emotionally destructive, she fails to apply the proper remedy from God's Word from the outset, and maintains this erroneous approach throughout the book. The incompetence to counsel is actually Vernick's problem.In 1 Peter 3 and other verses we have God's answer to sin in ourselves and our spouses. All Christians are to trust God, and avoid sin.Peter's mention of adorning may easily be applied to both spouses. Superficiality is to be avoided. Women, falsely attacked and allured with the world's ideas of appearance, are admonished to humility in showing respect to their husbands and being pure in their own conduct.In verse 7 of 1 Peter 3, men receive similar counsel, albeit worded differently, when they are admonished to be understanding of their wives. Neither wives nor husbands should ""keep up appearances"" regarding their marriage, pretending it is healthy by God's standards. They are instead to do their God-commanded part regardless of whether their spouse does or not.The gospel works from the inside out, resulting in humility and modesty precisely because of the inner security of a heart captivated by Christ.Of course, the humble submission commanded of wives is complemented by the exhortation to husbands to exercise humble and gentle authority (1 Pet. 3:7). A husband‚Äôs leadership of his wife is meant to be a picture of Christ‚Äôs sacrificial lordship over us, driven by selfless love, full of grace, and aimed squarely at another‚Äôs benefit and joy. Christ himself, the eternal Lord of the universe, is ‚Äúgentle and lowly in heart‚Äù (Matt. 11:29). Christian husbands are called to this same heart. The word used to describe the ‚Äúhonor‚Äù they are to show their wives (1 Pet. 3:7) is from the same root as the word used to describe the ‚Äúhonor‚Äù emperors are to be afforded (cf. 2:17).Vernick's approach from the start sets up a negative atmosphere that is problem-centered and man-centered. God's method is to start with his glory in the face of Jesus Christ, emphasizing his forgiveness and grace. Vernick's approach is to ferret out every weakness of the spouse and confirm her suspicions that the marriage is emotionally destructive. This is especially evident in the wording of her assessments (e.g. 18-24, 36-37,89, 101)."
"What is mentioned over 550 times in the Bible?  Love.  Hmmm...  Boundaries. 41 times, all regarding land boundaries. 0 times to define a human relationship.  The term boundary is defined as ""that which divides.""  If someone crosses your boundary there is a consequence, right.  Or the boundary, law, is of no use.  Let's apply this principle of setting boundaries, or consequences to Jesus.  You sin, he removes you from His presence, pushing you away, stops a relationship, puts up boundaries you are doomed to break.  No.  Sorry.  That was the Old Testament, the Law.  That is why Jesus died to redeem us, it was a underserved gift, while we were yet in sin.  Read Col 2:13-14.  ""When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ.  He forgave us all our sins, having canceled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and that stood opposed to us; he took it way, nailing it to the cross.""  Yeah, I know.  Grace.  Crazy stuff right.  So ok to abuse someone?  No, may it never be.  Get with your pastor, get with other couples in church, get it out in the open!!  Get others involved, get help, sound like the original church?  Or get out until the right people are involved.  Accountability.  I know, not fun.  But darkness hides in the dark, alone.  Get someone who knows the truth of the Grace Gospel in your life.  Get a law abider and you might as well crucify your mate now."
This book will destroy your marriage
"Great book.  Best one I've read so far on the topic.  It was compassionate and used scripture to show where we, as a church, can better support victims of emotional abuse.  It challenged women to see reality as it is and not stay in the deception that their abusers create for them.  It challenged women to not to take lip service as real change, but to require the abuser to change his actions and show that he is willing to make those changes for the long term.  The author requires the abuser to take responsibility for his actions and acknowledge the truth.  It shows women how to step out of the abuse, not as a punishment to the abuser, but as a way to provide themselves and their children with safety.  This could mean leaving the home for a few hours or living separately."
Amazing read! I found a lot of healing in reading this book. Healing I didn‚Äôt know I needed. I‚Äôve been to therapists for years and this book did more for me than any of them!!! I highly recommend it. I feel like a new stronger and healthier me!! I feel it has improved my marriage because I now have a healthy confidence to deal with problems instead of dysfunctional ways that only hurt the marriage. I am more effective now in helping the change that is needed for us to live peacefully with each other.
Like so far
Doing this study now with a group of women.  We meet virtually once a week and are making this 7 week study 14 weeks long for us.  Who ever thought the book of Numbers could be so interesting and mean so much!!!! Lauren does a great job helping you understand what is written and how it relates to us!
Who knew there was so much in the book of Numbers other than numbers. So relevant to us today.
"My book was missing session 4&5, it repeated 2& part of 3.  Session 3 was missing the last 2 pages.  Session 1,2 & 6 were fine.  The study was fine, just hard to do with out proper pages.  I had to have a friend copy her book for my missing pages and that was very disappointing.  I have never had an issue with any book I have ordered before and I have ordered a lot"
"I am using this book to lead a women's Bible study. Our group loves the structure and layout so far. There are thoughtful questions throughout each session that are good conversation starters. There is a special leader's guide at the back of the book as well, which has been very helpful."
"great book, nice for bible studies, highly recommend"
"Very detailed, if you enjoy a study, that requires a lot of time, and research... this is the study for you.  If you enjoy a study with an overview and understanding God, look for something that isn't this time consuming.  This is not a study for beginners, it requires a big investment of time.  You learn interesting facts... time commitment is large.  It isn't for every Ladies Bible Study."
I absolutely love this bible study it made me so much wiser! You will learn so much it‚Äôs unreal. Definitely recommend.
"This review could be summed up in a single sentence ""Read Robert Wright, 'Why Buddhism is True: The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment' instead.""I came to Waking Up a little bit sceptically, having been put off by Sam Harris many times before. But I'd heard good things about Waking Up, and was really interested in hearing what he had to say in terms of a positive vision. I was even willing to give him a pass on the obligatory nasty, self-congratulatory religion bashing I've come to expect from him (to be clear, I'm also an atheist, and I share much of Harris' general world view). So, I was determined not to let the first chapter of anti-Muslim and anti-Christian boilerplate grumbling affect my review. I was also determined not to let the crass cultural oversimplification ""Easterns can't do science but are good at psychology; Westerns can't do psychology but did all the real science"" affect my rating. And if you like that sort of thing, it's there. Whatever.It was the meat of the book that held my interest. And Harris is a good writer, and sailed along just fine for a while. I liked the chapters on meditation. They were a bit long on anecdote, but fun and informative. If two or three of those chapters were taken on their own, I'd have given the book a 5 star review. But then, at the point where he laid all the groundwork on mindfulness, and no-self, and the emotional benefits of meditation, he just kind of stopped.So, I get that meditation can help you feel happier, or blissful, or 'one' with the universe. I get that there is no true 'self', and we can experience that enlightenment first hand. But Harris never gets into the practical or philosophical consequences of these experiences, or enlarges on the ""what next"". It was frustrating, because he led up to this feeling that our spiritual practice of mindfulness and concentration, and even no self should have some bigger implications, than a little bit of self-indulgent woo. Especially after he describes Buddhism as a practical user's manual for the mind.Instead he digresses into a few chapters on mind altering drugs (fun, vaguely interesting stuff) and the difficulty of weeding out predators and kooks from real gurus. Then he bashes Christians and Muslims a bit more, and that's it.Now I'm mostly through Wright's ""Why Buddhism is True"", and it's already covered all the ground Harris covers, in much greater depth, and to much better effect. Not only does Wright focus on the experiential aspects of meditation, but he spends a lot of time exploring the deeper and broader implications of Buddhist practice and belief.  And along the way, Wright explores a few classic sutras of the Buddha, and shows how they might be interpreted as a systematic and rigorous program of self-questioning.This is what I wanted from Harris. Something that explains the problems and contradictions of our Western understanding of the mind and spirituality; that discusses beliefs and practices which can illuminate these problems; and that explores the issues in a way that promises personal growth and intellectual progress. Harris got about half way there, and meanwhile got bogged down in his own narrow conceits."
"What a great book.  I was born and grew up in Theravada Buddhist family. Even as a teenager I saw the value in the 4 Noble truths.  But  I couldn't quite come to grips with the idea of Reincarnation & the Law of Karma.  That sounded like a "" Celestial Accounting System that worked on Auto Pilot"".  To me that seems as nonsensical as the ""Old Man in the Sky"" offered by Abrahamic religions.Especially when as a young Buddhist one of the first things I remember learning is Buddha's admonishment to ""Never believe in Dogma.  But to sift all teachings(including his) through your own experiential filter.  Then if it it still seems valid to try it on"".  When you just take that teaching into heart and try on the concepts Karma & Reincarnation; it makes the 8 fold noble path a moot point.But Sam Harris brings a new perspective.  Damn You Sam Harris! your arguments takes away my excuses for staying away from the meditation cushion.It is a pretty dense subject matter.  With a chapter on Consciousness and another one on Self.  While some of it was new and interesting, other ideas might take 2nd or 3rd reading to get through my thick skull.I think every Buddhist should read and consider what is laid out here.  I highly recommend to anyone who has a intellectual curiosity about spirituality. Yet from my experience I know that only few of the most ardently spiritual would dare to tackle it.  Between Sam Harris and Stephen Batchelor's writing  they extend the Buddhas admonishment for experiential learning by applying 21st century rationality to the inquiry.  These two writers and their writing gives a good intellectual foundation to wade into spirituality with healthy dose of 21st century agnosticism."
"Here's one of the many examples that Sam Harris uses throughout this book regarding consciousness: Suppose you're going to Mars via a teleport machine. Many of your friends have already done this safely and are already on Mars. But what the creator of this teleport machine doesn't tell you is your whole being down to every last atom is copied and reconstructed on Mars. The ""copy"" has all your memories, your appearance, etc, and is essentially you. Then your body on Earth is vaporized painlessly in a split second. To ensure safety, the reconstruction must be finished before vaporization. This poses a few interesting points about consciousness. Because reconstruction must be finished first, does that mean there are two conscious people that are considered you? If you can be reconstructed by a machine, what does this say about consciousness? Is conscious defined by physical continuity or physiological continuity, as with the teleport machine? If you knew how this teleport machine actually worked, would you still do it?All these questions and more are posed to the reader, than Sam Harris explains his views on it via science and logic. I found his arguments sound and in my opinion hard to argue against. Sam Harris is a neurosurgeon and a non-religious spiritual teacher, so he has plenty of experiences to answer these deep questions.I cannot recommend this book enough. I also suggest listening to his podcast ""Waking Up""."
"I'm always suspicious of individuals and institutions who claim to possess truth, especially when they do so in a dogmatic and obnoxious manner.  But that is exactly what the author does in Waking Up.  In the process, Harris finds fault with most (maybe all) of the world's religions which for thousands of years have offered such virtues as love, compassion, and kindness, and contributed to the spiritual and overall well-being of humankind.  In describing his own extensive experiences with meditation, Harris subtly lets his readers know how qualified he thinks he is to stand in judgment of all who have found comfort in their spiritual practices and/or organized religion.  He lets the reader know he is a practitioner of the martial arts, often a tipoff to self-aggrandizement.  Most of the atheists I've known didn't need a deity in which to believe because they were their own gods; the author of Waking Up seems no different.  I hope Dr. Harris will write a sequel to this volume in forty or fifty years when aging has taken a toll on his mind and body--and hubris.  Nothing is quite so humbling as aging.  I suspect, if that time comes, Dr. Harris will have discovered a new perspective."
"I normally am not a person having much interest in things of a spiritual nature, but I decided to read this book on the recommendation of a friend. Actually, as I learned, spirituality does not have to have anything to do with religion. You can have a ‚Äúspiritual experience‚Äù without any religious overtones. In fact, the word spirit comes from a Latin word which is a translation of a Greek word that means ‚Äúbreath.‚Äù It was around the thirteenth century that the term became entangled with beliefs about immaterial souls, the supernatural, and ghosts. We note that Christians, Muslims, Hindus and others can experience something spiritual in regards to their religions. The author indicates that because their beliefs are incompatible with one another, the spiritual component must emanate from a deeper principle.According to the author, this book is ‚Äúan introduction to the brain, a manual of contemplative instruction, and a philosophical unraveling of what most people consider to be the center of their inner lives: the feeling of self we call ‚ÄúI.‚Äù There is a deeper principle at work ‚Äì that the feeling of ‚ÄúI‚Äù or ‚Äúself‚Äù is an illusion. The author uses his personal experience to help readers see the nature of their own minds in a new light. We are shown that a rational approach to spirituality seems to be what‚Äôs missing from secularism and the lives of most people. The author has spent considerable time seeking experiences of the kind that gave rise to the world‚Äôs religions. For example, he notes that he spent two years on a silent retreat in increments of one week to two months practicing different types of meditation for up to eighteen hours per day. That‚Äôs determination!We are introduced to a concept called mindfulness. Facilitating this state may involve a technique called vipassana (meaning insight), or consolation of the Satipatthana Sutta (an empirical guide to freeing the mind from suffering). No worry, we are provided with some instructions from the author on how to meditate properly. In life, we grasp at transitory pleasures, we worry about the future ‚Äì life is stressful. The ‚Äúspiritual life‚Äù promoted by the author is a solution to bringing this stress to an end. He starts by investigating the nature of consciousness and shows us that by transforming its contents through deliberate training we can achieve the basis of spiritual life.We our next introduced to a more detailed discussion of ‚Äúself.‚Äù He tries to convince us that this sense of self is just an illusion and that spirituality consists of realizing this moment to moment. He supports this notion by showing that nothing a Christian, Muslim, or Hindu can experience constitutes evidence in support of their belief whether it be ecstasy, bliss, inner-light, or whatever. It is because their beliefs are logically incompatible with one another. In the book, we see that the illusion of the self can be investigated and dispelled. Harris shows how he reached his conclusion through much meditative practice with various ‚Äúgurus,‚Äù and Dzogchen masters. More support for his views comes from a discussion of near-death experiences and drug use.The author concludes: ‚ÄúUntil we can talk about spirituality in rational terms ‚Äì acknowledging the validity of self-transcendence ‚Äì our world will remain shattered by dogmatism. This book has been my attempt to begin such a conversation.‚Äù"
"First of all, I have meditated for 27 years, and so this comes on the heels of a lifetime of intensive study of all research, theory, and 1000's of hours of practice.Sam Harris presents some research, but avoids the vast realm of research and meditation masters out there. If you think this is meditation, reduce your opinion by about 99% and you will be correct.Yes, we could all become super mindful individuals (of every thing we consume, buy, hate, like, want, don't want, etc.... see how it is being misused yet?), but in a world with collapsing institutions and collapsing ecosystems, we need more than spiritual swill to deal with the madness of the modern human society.This book is extremely basic, can be summed up in about 10% of its volume, and I recommend you stop, read, be mindful of its information, AND KEEP GOING. THE EARTH NEEDS YOU... NOW."
"Harris does make some interesting insights, especially regarding multiple consciousnesses in a single brain. But ultimately his message comes down to: We don't know what consciousness is, enlightment may or may not exist, but you should check out meditation.It would help a lot if Harris would provide even a working definition of consciousness until a scientific one can be determined. At various points he seems to suggest it is:- A function of the brain that is separate from thoughts and feelings (the definition that Buddha gave) which may arise from brain activity- A meta-consciousness of one's thoughts and feelings, such as ""I am aware of feeling sad now"")- An illusion that can be understood by certain perceptions of the world, similar to an optical illusion.It also doesn't help that Harris can't resist taking a few turns into bashing religion and woo-woo thinking along the way. I understand the temptation but it doesn't help the reader to fully understand Harris's core points."
His judgment of others tainted my ability to truly see his ideas.
"Being written by a scientist I was afraid the text would be very dry with lots of unnecessarily difficult wording. So I read the first page before I bought it. The first page was very engaging with a down to earth writing style. That page however, was not representative of the rest of the book. The writing as I feared was very dry. Also this man is an atheist who is just starting to realize there is something more out there. I applaud his awakening. If you are like me and made that revelation a long time ago, the book really holds no further insights."
I have read 20 pages so far. Founding nothing important. The author tries to make one point by giving like 1000 statements. Very boring book so far. The author frequently interchanges secularism and sprituality. Writes 10 pages to drive one point.In some parts it looks like Psycology PhD thesis where some complex scientific terms are used which I had to google.I think Sam Harris wants to show off that he is very good in English vocabulary by using complex works to communicate which is really simple.I bought this book upon recommendation. I am returing it. Waste of money.
"The author‚Äôs discussions of the science of consciousness provide some interesting examples that challenge our idea of the self. Like the research, this section of the book pokes holes in common misconceptions, but stops short of explaining consciousness. The focus of book is get readers to consider the pursuit of self transcendence as an alternative to dogmatic religion. However, the authors description of the tactics of achieving this enlightened state, his own spiritual path and state itself, leaves much to the imagination. It felt more like reading someone describing a dream. It was clear the journey and experience were meaningful to the author, but the recounting failed to stir the same emotional resonance in this reader."
"I really tried to like this book, but the way the author writes constantly leaves me with a feeling of ""ok this is interesting, but what's your point and what are you even saying?""Confusing and disappointing."
"I was hoping to enjoy this book, as I'm merely agnostic. I find this author to obnoxious. A know it all when, in a world like this, it's quite impossible to know it all. It's a hard pass for me. Threw it out. Not worth a minute of my time, and I regret reading through the first twenty pages when instinct told me to put it down and walk away."
"I started to read the book, but after reading 30 pages, I gave up. A lot of readers are happy with this book. I quickly tired of his arrogance and the his method of not getting to the point. If you believe something, say what it is you believe clearly and why. Do not tell me what others believe and why they are wrong. Maybe eventually I will figure out where you are coming from.  I do not have time for the author's approach."
"#Review of Waking Up by Sam HarrisThough I will focus on a point of departure I have with Sam Harris in this review, I want to point out that I think this is an important book and should be read by as many people as possible. And at the outset, I want to point out that I am probably more in agreement with Sam philosophically than with any other current or past thinker. His books on faith and free will are all wonderful and right on the money. I think it's safe to say that most freethinkers agree with him on faith and many, though fewer, agree with him on the concept of free will, that it is conceptually incoherent and a nonsense notion. I'm afraid with this new book he will meet with even less agreement among freethinkers. In current scientific and philosophical circles consciousness is almost universally seen as a product, perhaps emergent, of matter, consistent with materialism. Among those who see the impossibility of explaining consciousness is strictly material terms, the only view that has much traction is some form of dualism, such as that promoted by David Chalmers. Sam Harris, to his credit, isn't buying it. Perhaps because of his deep interest in the nature of experience, he realizes that materialism has neither need nor explanation for subjective consciousness. No amount of structure and function/behavior explains why dynamic structures of any complexity would produce anything other than objective phenomena, nor why material evolution as we understand it would require any form of subjectivity. Materialism is a closed system, an apparently perfectly adequate explanatory construct for objective phenomena. Thus those wedded to materialism, such as Daniel Dennett, have no choice but to call subjective experience an illusion. Dualists who recognize the category error of Cartesian-style interactive dualism must resort to the concept of epiphenominalism, which suggests that consciousness is a real but wholly impotent byproduct of materialism. Sam's response is aligned with that of the New Mysterians, such as Colin McGinn, who believe that the mystery of consciousness is just too far above our ability to understand, at least for the foreseeable future, at least with current modes of thought, perhaps forever. Sam may well be right. But I would like to combine his insight of the explanatory inadequacy of materialism with a disagreement I have with him about the nature of the self, perhaps subtle, perhaps not. Sam argues, persuasively I believe, that not only is subjective consciousness real, but it is the only thing that ultimately matters. If a phenomenon does not now or ever impact the conscious experience of a sentient being, directly or indirectly, it has no importance morally or ethically, nor can it ‚Äúmatter"" in any meaningful sense. I would go further and argue, in direct contradiction to Daniel Dennett, subjective experience is the one and only thing we know to exist without a shred of doubt. Do not mistake this to be saying that the contents of experience are real. That's the point. We are impressed with the apparent existence of the ‚Äúself"", of others, of the material world through the medium of our experience. In contrast, we know of the existence of experience because of experience itself, not its contents. The simple way to say this is this: It is incoherent to deny the reality of experience itself, but perfectly reasonable to question anything and everything that experience suggests about the self and the world. Think of the ‚Äúbrain in the vat‚Äù scenario, or simple illusion as ways we can be led astray. So what about the self? I agree with Sam that the notion of an enduring unchanging self, a self with specific attributes, defined attitudes and character traits, is inconsistent with what we appear to know about reality. However, the realization of the absolute reality of experience, that is, of subjective consciousness, argues for the existence of a self nonetheless. Specifically, it argues for a ‚Äúsubject"" of that experience. And personal, first-person, subjective experience only gives us evidence of one subject, that is our ‚Äúself‚Äù. It is not an enduring self, but rather a momentary self, a self in the ‚Äúnow‚Äù. And in the ‚Äúnow"" there is a unity of consciousness, at any given moment. Sam says consciousness is divisible because of the example of spilt-brain patients. I disagree. These patients give the appearance of a divided brain and the apparent division of consciousness that ostensibly accompanies that division. But Sam has already (sensibly) rejected the idea that objective data can explain subjectivity. And experience is always and only ‚Äúhad‚Äù by one subject, in a specific moment. For Sam to propose a true division of consciousness he must imagine a subject experiencing consciousness, in the first-person, as divided, which is incoherent. Logic and experience both argue for this. Experience is first-person, so the observation of others can never be evidence of experience, split or otherwise. And at any given moment, a subject can have just one ‚Äúexperience‚Äù, however complicated or ‚Äúdivided‚Äù it might seem. Truly divided consciousness would require multiple ‚Äúsubjects‚Äù, and those separate subjects could not speak to reality of each other any more than I can speak to the reality of the consciousness of others. The appearance of split-brain subjects is coherent. The actuality of split-consciousness is not. But the absolute reality of subjective experience has more troubling implications as well. Dennett based his theory of the illusory nature of subjective consciousness on an absolute belief in materialism. But such a belief is unfounded, given the contingent nature of all knowledge gained through experience. But if subjective experience is unequivocally real, and dualism is incoherent, one is left with the troubling notion that perhaps matter is not real. Even more troubling is the implication that ‚Äúothers‚Äù and ""the world"" are not real. Since experience is inherently ‚Äùinput"" and passive, it is impossible (thus far for me anyway) to imagine how separate subjects of experience would actually relate or interact. Subjective experience doesn‚Äôt emit ‚Äúdata‚Äù, it only ‚Äúreceives‚Äù(experiences) the appearance of ‚Äúdata‚Äù."
Worst book I have ever read. Author does not connect the title. Very little on meditation in the book it is  merely an opinion of a man who has no sense of spirituality and is searching in the wrong places.
"As a big admirer of Sam and his work, I value his ideas and thoughts like gold and have been greatly influenced by him. And as a meditator, it is awesome to get a book like this to hear ideas on meditation and spiritual living from a person like Sam. My complaints with this book are two things, hence the 3 start rating.1. There are times in the book where the rational and objective voice suddenly turns rather cynical and derogatory, namely when he writes about the criticism of various religions. I thought this could have been written with far better poise yet still remain effective of its critical standpoint. This threw me off when I encountered it and thought the harshness of the tone contrasted too starkly with the rest of the book in a rather uncomfortable way.2. The prescribed and advocated way of practicing meditation is highly personal, and brushes off or is critical of any alternative forms of meditation which Sam personally did not find useful in his practice in respect to his aims. I do believe people can find techniques better or worse, depending on various personal factors having nothing to do with the technique itself. Therefore, I would have enjoyed to read a more open to discussion idea of how to approach effective practices of meditation rather than expound Zgochen as the seemingly best and most direct way.What I did really get out of this book that have stuck with me is the idea of 'having no head' and the Zgochen technique of looking for the self, along with the beginning chapters describing the rational approach to a spiritual life, consciousness being supreme, etc.All in all, not a favorite book or top book, but I enjoyed it and learned several things from reading it."
"This was a very rich and informative book for me.  Sam Harris has an amazing mind and an unique perspective on things that seem vitally important to me, with his training in philosophy, religions, AND neuroscience.  I was astounded to learn that he is also something of a grown-up 60's ""head""  despite having come of age considerably later than the 60's (my) generation.  His prose is elegant yet straightforward.This book, and Dan Harris' book speak to issues with which i am currently wrestling.  But the subject matter is not all that easy to get your mind around.  While it certainly seems true that we place too much importance on ego gratification--and suffer for doing so-- it is hard to grasp that something as universally retained in human biology and evolution is not real, necessary, and of benefit to the organism driven by that ego.  At times, the zen outlook seems so nihilistic to me that it is barely compatible with life, and perhaps even incompatible with the human experience entirely.In the meantime, I sit and practice as I have been for 3 years and occasionally apprehend a scintilla of this insight he describes.  I found this book helpful in guiding my approach to meditation.  I learned a lot about the brain, eastern religious teachings and logical inquiry, as i have from each of his books.I thought the metaphor of a reflection on a piece of glass was helpful.  It gave me hope that I might really experience whatever ""waking up"" is someday."
"I've been waiting a decade for someone to write such a book. Sam Harris delivered. Maria Popova summarizes it best: ""In Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion (public library), philosopher, neuroscientist, and mindful skeptic Sam Harris offers a contemporary addition to this lineage of human inquiry ‚Äî an extraordinary and ambitious masterwork of such integration between science and spirituality, which Harris himself describes as 'by turns a seeker's memoir, an introduction to the brain, a manual of contemplative instruction, and a philosophical unraveling of what most people consider to be the center of their inner lives.' Or, perhaps most aptly, an effort 'to pluck the diamond from the dunghill of esoteric religion.'"""
"This is the best introduction to a wide secular western audience who are not religious or who are agnostics/atheists of spiritual contemplative waking up traditions in particular Buddhism. Sam Harris is truly brilliant and incisive even if on occasion opinionated.His analysis on the role of obsessive thinking in relation to human discontent and it's ending or dissipation from meditative activity is very clear and incisive. To a large extent Buddhism is about liberating us and ending discontent and opening us to the beauty of our existence through curing us from the disease and misuse of thought. I believe these early pages here are the most important for the reader to take with him. He is aware also of the importance of human compassion and love in spiritual awakening traditions such as Buddhism by examples he brings up but not in any explicit extended manner of discussion. Buddhism is the focus of his spiritual wakening up practices. For Sam Harris it is directly liberative in character without the necessity of metaphysical beliefs in God or an afterlife. Sam Harris is after all a metaphysical naturalist/broadly materialist in character. The more serious practice though of Buddhism is disappointing. Sam Harris likes Dzogchen practice as a direct path to the awakened enlightened mind. Now Dzogchen practitioners who have the outstanding pointing out skills to directly brings their students let alone someone coming to see them who by the way would need much previous serious practice preparation to an enlightenment opening or state of Rigpa are rare in number.The foundational practices of most traditional Dzogchen teachers are complex/esoteric as they say. They would not attract many westerners. Zen practice is certainly more widely accessible to westerners. Sam Harris just I judge unfairly say after many years in zen you do not know if you are practicing correctly. Now correct practice is a difficulty in all Buddhist practices. Good guidance from a teacher is paramount. In light of what Sam Harris has said earlier about thought and human liberation, the silent illumination practice of Sheng Yen in his book The Method  of no Method : silent illumination practice  is highly recommended. Sheng Yen is in the chinese tradition of zen called Chan. The book can be supplemented by weekly lectures from one of his dharma heirs Gilbert Gutierrez on his Riverside Chan website. Here we do working viable practice justice to the best insights of Sam Harris. The weekly lectures or dharma talks serve as substitute -- again there is nothing better than having a living teacher available for serious spiritual awakening practice such as Buddhism that Sam Harris is advocating--for not having available or even wanting a living teacher. The lectures also amplify what silent illumination practice is and how to avoid pitfalls in the practice. My apologies if the review is too long. I felt I needed to say a lot to do this truly brilliant book justice. And even need--hopefully in not too an opinionated manner-- to give an approach such as silent illumination zen practice that brings out the best of what Sam Harris is saying and in a way that is serious practice viable. This is not to say they are not other good approaches in the spiritual awakening traditions whether Buddhist or not. However silent illumination practice is very simple and direct, much in the spirit of Sam Harris's approach to Waking up that can be more secular in character.  Eric Warwick"
"a clearly written, well-thought out approach to another way of living, harris eloquently presents an alternative path to life of blind faith (religion) and secularism (atheism). he basically advocates for meditation as a way to become more present in each moment of our life. he alternates advocating from the position of science (the brain likes it because...) and a position of compassionate human (it's good to be more connected to each other and each moment because...) persuasively. he also spends quite a few pages warning of the pitfalls ahead (false messiahs, egos, snake-oil salesman, etc.) that will no doubt lie ahead for many in search of the ineffable. in short, if you have moved past organized religion and are looking for an entry into another path, i highly recommend this book."
"Whoooo boy. Is this a book to wrap your brain around. I hope the reader will forgive me for writing my twist on the book with only a quarter of it read but is so mind expanding I just hada do it.I only recently learned that what you find out is highly correlated to the questions you ask. This book asks some buttes. I love it that Sam does not make a lot of leaps of faith where a small fact is used to build a whole construct. I'm sorry to disapoint you but he errs on the side off facts and logic.Mentally I""m just a pup compared to his extensive knowledge , that's why it is so much fun. jusst think if I had read the whole thing first, ha ha. Live long and prosper."
"This book was recommended to me by an In-Law after I showed some interest in meditation. Sam Harris writes a good beginner's guide to meditation ('Spirituality') and discusses a number of important red flags associated with the practice (predatory Gurus). As you read the book, you will realize that Sam was incredibly dedicated to achieving a very specific type of meditative experience (multiple trips to India to see gurus, meditation camps, etc.). Essentially, Sam is obsessed with/has a passion for meditation. So, as somebody that is not obsessed with meditation, but willing to spend 30 min a day practicing, you come away wondering what you have in common with the author. In seeing how much time and energy Sam put into trying to achieve that special meditative state, it is much easier for me to understand that the journey is not for me. The question that I come away with is: if you're so obsessed with having a radical experience in consciousness, why experiment with drugs?  It would certainly be cheaper. Sam even acknowledges this shortcut and the similarities in experiential states.That said, Sam has a legitimate base of experience and has a lot to teach novices in meditation. He is a good writer and excellent at making sound rational arguments in favor of practicing meditation: 4 stars."
"I came to reading ""Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion"" with the hopefully intention of finding just what the title describes ""Spirituality Without Religion"" and I have to say that I am very disappointed.Harris is one of my favorite authors. From the moment I heard him speak for the first time I could tell he was of a different breed. Very intelligent, articulate and insightful in a way that few people will ever match. I've read many of his other books and watched many of his speeches. So I thought ""Waking Up"" would be of the same quality as his other work. Boy was I wrong.The book is very all over the place and lacking structure. It kinds feels like Harris just dipped his hand in a hat filled with his writings on spirituality and then randomly tossed together whatever he pulled out. While the writings may have been ok on their own or posted on a blog they feel a bit out of place in a book. Futhermore the books is hard to follow and it's hard to understand exactly where Harris is going and what is he trying to convey. At the end of the book I was left feeling empty and it was like so what now?I suppose a lot of the above issues stem from it not really being for beginners or those with little to no spiruality/mediation experience. I can see how easy it is to get lost when Harris fails to provide you a good starting point or background to build upon in the book.Of course it's not all bad. Like I said individually his writings read well and I learned some new things. I found the neuroscience moments, and the sections on suffering, death and drugs very interesting and enjoyable. And at times Harris can, as he usually is, be a pretty darn amazing in his analysis. But still that's not enough to make up for its short comings.I feel the book is less a ""guide"" and more a ""supplement"" to ones spiritual journey. Like if you were doing a project and had to use newspaper cut outs to convey your message. It's a great ""resource"" to turn to but it's not an effective ""how to"" or ""guide"" as it's supposed to be. For that Harris would need to make it more beginner friendly, include more exercises, improve its structure etc.If the book was coming from a no name author perpahs I would give it 3/5. But I, and many others, hold Harris to a particular high standard so it's hard coming to terms with how much better Harriss could have done. So 2/5. And I can't really recommend this book unless you already have some spirituality/mediation experiences or are a super Harriss fan (like myself) and even then I feel it's hard to justify. Let's just hope he does better next time."
"I misunderstood the nature of this book.I believe in God, but I don‚Äôt subscribe to a particular religion. I was hoping this book would bring me closer to God without relying on the Bible (since I‚Äôm not Christian).The author of the book is an atheist. I wish he would have titled the book ‚ÄúWaking Up a Guide to Spirituality without God‚Äù. That would have saved me from spending money on this book."
"Harris is an informative skeptic who highlights the correlation between human consciousness, spirituality, science, and history.  He also points out deceptive claims from the religious and the scientific community including the latest work of Dr. Eben Alexander, a neuroscientist who experienced a NDE or a load of DMT his body produced while suffering a severe illness.  Harris points out the flaws in these claims.  It is pretty crazy how easily our minds can be tricked by social biases and charismatic and/confident leaders and in his book, Harris explains the difference and how you may try to reach a new level of consciousness.  I really enjoyed his writing and the research is thorough."
"After getting through the first 4 pages of reviews of how ‚Äúawesome‚Äù the book is (which is absurd), I stopped reading after the next few pages. He uses big words that aren‚Äôt necessary and he speaks in a way I can‚Äôt relate to. Felt like I was on the verge of reading Shakespeare. I‚Äôm going to use it as my bed time book when I need to mindlessly read to fall asleep."
"This book is the reason that Sam Harris has always been my favorite of the New Atheists. He recognizes and practices what I always called the essence of religion. Stated simply, if you meditate, pray, fast, ingest certain substances, you can experience self-transcendence. Most of the major religions have a name for this experience... enlightenment, nirvana, satori, samadhi, state of grace. The beauty of Sam's book is that he cuts through the trappings of religious dogma and new age mysticism that tend to cloud the experience. This is especially an important book for those unfamiliar with this phenomenon, and can hopefully lead some to a path of self discovery. As more of us learn to quiet the ego, this will become a much better world."
"In this book, Sam Harris takes the provocative position (given his audience) that modern science has not adequately confronted our subjective truths about the experience of reality. As one of the ""Four Horsemen"" of the New Atheist movement, this deviation from hard-and-fast science into the realm of subjective experience may seem a radical departure, but it is Harris' unique respect for the individual power of religious experience that has differentiated him from other authors in this area.The book is largely an analysis of the scientific findings regarding our personal sense of ""self,"" the locus of consciousness that we all think we experience, but which remains elusive. Traditional explorations of this have formed the basis of tremendous spiritual insights throughout history, often linked to a particular religious or superstitious tradition. Harris proposes that a modern person can explore this spiritual aspect of their life--indeed, can directly confront their own conscious experience--without embracing the superstitions that surround it.Beyond that, however, Harris describes his own personal journey through this terrain, as a general life-long religious skeptic who has also sought profound spiritual teachers and experiences. His description of his harrowing ""bad trip"" on psychodelic drugs, while rowing across a lake, signifies that he is aware of the darker side of the path that he proposes, but his awareness of the experience of universal love under psychodelics also points toward the more sublime and worthwhile truths that we should desire.The book is an engaging and thought-provoking exploration of these topics, but where it falls short is really acting as a ""Guide"" to these experiences. This book, being more of a memoir, gives the reader a reason to think that these experiences are valid and worthy of consideration, but provides little practical guidance on how to proceed with embracing them. It is a starting point, but once you're on the journey, I cannot imagine returning to the book to drive me forward to new steps on the path. This is the one part of the book where I think Harris has somewhat fallen short, but it takes nothing away from the experience of enjoying the book itself. So long as the reader does not have expectations that are too high, they will find this discussion more than worth their time."
"Not sure what I was expecting. The extrapolations and generalizations to the wider public of what are by definition impenetrably private, personal subjective experiences were the source of considerable disappointment. As readable one imagines as a personal testimony of a religious person who then presumes to tell the rest of us that only they or their ""group""  know ""what is really going on"". Difficult to imagine how science can tell one about personal subjective experience. Might have been less offensive if it were simply a personal confession."
"Interesting read. An excellent foundation to start a dialogue about science and spiritual matters (Harris outlines his own definition of ""spiritual"" in the book). Harris attempts to redefine what we consider to be ""consciousness"", and takes from eastern traditions and western mysticism ways to experience it directly.I had a couple of issues with this book. As a fan of Sam Harris, I was disappointed at how much substance it lacked. It's made up of anecdotes, metaphors, analogies, and critiques that we've heard from him before in various youtube videos. In fact this ""guide to spirituality without religion"" reads more like a long introduction to the subject with little guidance at all.Although there is some interesting information here about consciousness, meditation, and a fun section on the spiritual use of psychedelics, I was pretty let down."
"Just four stars because Sam can be a little judgmental and because Waking Up is not the kind of book that will be read 100 years from now. (LOL) He likes to think about things that other people consider sacrosanct and expose the flaws. I like that crash and burn stuff. Humanity needs it to keep its collective blood flowing. Yet, I think he lacks the wisdom that would make his writing more credible, or is the word authentic. Perhaps with more angst, a few divorces, creaky bones and advanced age that will happen. I do like his spunk for taking on religion in the manner in which he did. I didn't like the way he said that Newton wasted so much of his life grappling with his religious faith when he could have been playing with science. Newton was a man of his time and didn't have the advantage of hundreds of years of insight and human spiritual evolution from which to draw. (Back off on Newton!) Maybe he was doing exactly what he needed to do, not frittering his time away as Sam seemed to imply. Life is truly a very personal experience, and some writer from Newton's distant future doesn't have the proper perspective to get on his case. So there!I really like Sam's experiences with meditation. There is no doubt that meditation would benefit anyone and everyone who makes a practice of it, and Sam makes a good case. I was a little disappointed that Sam hadn't had a dramatic spiritual awakening, the kind that gives me goosebumps. He's a science guy. His definition of spirituality differs from mine, yet it's close enough.All in all, I am happy to be making my way through Waking Up (not yet completed). A person doesn't need to agree with everything they read, but to read differing perspectives opens a few inner doors and functions to shake out the cobwebs."
"I have read numerous books and articles that aim to guide one toward a world-view that offers meaning, hope, and peace. This book is the first one I've read that clearly outlines the how-to elements of spirituality so explicitly. Referencing an extensive array of outside sources and drawing from his many spiritual experiences, Harris supplies the reader with practical advice and examples for the seeker who wants the stuff without the fluff. The tone of the book is exceptional because it is focused on helping the reader rather than arguing against religion, as so many other current books purporting to be about spirituality do. I found the book immensely helpful and enjoyable to read, so much so, that after reading the book on a library loan, I purchased it for future reference."
"This book is helping me change the way I think and a pleasure to read. Written with intellect, compassion, clarity and humor this seems to be the type of text I've been looking for very long. I've always wanted to be more spiritual but have trouble just reading books that only attempt to inspire without scientific backing. I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn't feel like they want to commit to a religion persay but also believes there is a way to become a better human being and care for ourselves and our world without it. So very grateful to Harris for his work and am eager to learn more from him."
"Neurologist and philosopher Sam Harris has been pushing the limits of both fields for some time now, and with this book, he may well lose his street cred as one who insists on accepting nothing by faith. But such a persnickety view of Harris will be misguided based on a superficial reading of this, his latest broadside.He has staked his claim to being the U.S.‚Äôs most prominent spokesperson for atheism. Still, in The End of Faith, he left his readers hanging with a paean to meditation and explorations in consciousness. And so with this book, Harris is asking his readers to jump into these waters with him. What does he mean by consciousness? This question must be answered in order to know what it is he‚Äôs asking readers to explore.Here I‚Äôll paraphrase from my own such extrapolations in consciousness, knowing that Harris, upon reading this, would probably snort and ask me for the reasoning behind them. Consciousness, then is the basis of everything, but it‚Äôs unknowable. How does one deal with such a paradox? One must become ego-less, one much renounce ownership of thought. He doesn‚Äôt mean to make moods of these abstractions, mind you; instead one must approach them through the vehicle of mind, which must be transcended itself.Does this seem laughable, a Woodstock Nation morsel of food for thought? Then you may not want to read this one, even if you‚Äôve followed Harris‚Äô work to this point. But if something here rings a bell, no matter how faintly, pick it up."
"Just finished reading this.Not the anti-religion rant that Dr. Harris is known for (except for 6 pages in the Conclusion = and that's real good stuff), but the neuroscientist / philosopher has presented a first-hand view of Twenty-First Century Spirituality.He has experienced many years of serious meditation, studying under famous, and not-so-famous, gurus and spiritual teachers; the effects of several different hallucinogenic drugs; done scientific study of the workings of the brain; has a well-rounded understanding of the history of worship and devotion to various spiritual avenues; and is a kind-hearted and really smart common-sense fellow.Informative of accurate facts, and although I am not going to start meditating 18 hours a day, it made me feel pretty good about being happy with my life and my decisions. I personally have gone along many tracks to get where I am traveling now, and have the ability to be truly satisfied on a moment-by-moment criteria.If you are not feeling satisfied, there is some great solutions here that do not cost a thing (beyond the price of the book). Four stars."
"I have been a student of Tibetan Dzogchen for over 30 years and currently teach Dzogchen in a generic fashion in the style which Sam has presented in this amazingly useful book.  Sam has really captured the essence of the teaching and managed to convey that essence in a way that anyone could find tremendously useful and beneficial. I also have a book at Amazon called the ""The Natural Bliss of Being"" in which I try to convey in greater depth and detail what Sam is pointing at in his ground-breaking book that bridges the gap between the rational mind and our ""spiritual"" inner life; a spirituality without the necessity of belief and faith, but rather one of direct experience and insight. Finally I have a book I can refer others to who are quite turned-off to the current fads of New Age mysticism as well as conventional organized religion.  Thanks so much Sam!  Your contribution to making this Tibetan wisdom tradition broadly known will reap benefits for thousands and hopefully millions, no doubt!Jackson Peterson

  
The Natural Bliss of Being"
"I enjoyed reading this book.  It is the first book of his that I have read.  I am a fellow atheist, also wrote my honors thesis on LSD and Psychotherapy in 1973.  I have a shelf full of books related to the spiritual realm in my living room.I liked his recommendation to look for a self and observe that there is nothing there.  This point was made by many in the past (e.g. Sartre), but his down-to-earth style makes the experience of that ""nothingness"" more accessible.  It is an experience worth returning to.His description of what happens when the corpus callosum is cut was quite interesting.  It is another reminder that one can be unconscious of things that are available to consciousness in some way.  Of course this was a central thesis of Freud's.  It is interesting that Mr Harris does not mention anything about dreams in this book.It appears to me that the author is somewhat troubled by the apparent disconnect between ""enlightenment"" in the spiritual sense that he talks about and its apparent historical failure to result in ethical behavior.  I believe that a spiritual path is one way of strengthening oneself and the stronger one is the less self-serving one can become.  But there are emotional aspects of strengthening oneself and for many people these are more powerful determinants of how they experience and behave in the world.I recommend this thought-provoking book."
"I am only 102 pages in, and this book has given me something I find only rarely in written works:  insight into my own mind.  Harris offered the first chapter free online prior to publishing, and this left me hungry for the second chapter.  In fact, in an interview with another author, Harris already tipped his hand somewhat:  The principal cause of suffering in your life is the personalization of your thought stream.  If this is not a spoiler for you, read the book.  Many books offer self-help, many others offer clear discussion of how the science of the brain's working is changing how we understand personality and well-being.  This is the first book since the Tao Te Ching, the Hua Hu Ching, or the Tibetan Book of Living and Dying that actually offers practical advice for taming your thought stream and immediately improving your life.  I cannot recommend the book strongly enough at this point, and I plan to update my review when I finish reading the book."
"The author argues that neuroscience short of proved that souls do not exist, therefore all religions based on this idea are false. Gargantuan leap, but keep reading...The proof comes via a convoluted explanation that starts with the axiom: right/left brain are the seat(s) of consciousness. Well, what if the brain/mind is actually an INSTRUMENT of perception and interpretation, that conveys information to the consciousness (the seer, the purusa, the soul, it has been given many names). If this is possible, the author's argument doesn't hold."
"Thanks Sam Harris! The importance of his short and straightforward book lies not in any groundbreaking new information but in the power of the simple language and delivery of the ideas. There are many many books out there detailing research into the contemplative practises, as well as books expounding Buddhist and other Eastern ideas full of italicised Sanskrit and Pali terms, and there are manuals of meditation and mindfulness aplenty. What none of them do so well is put the whole thing into the context of our current-day cultures and debates so succinctly and concisely. If you've ever been part of a debate or discussion between a religious person and a non-religious person, you'll find this book refreshing in how quickly it cuts to the chase and presents its case.I cannot recommend this book highly enough, and since it is so quick to read, it's not even asking a lot of someone to give it a try and see if there's something to be learnt in there."
"Take a leap of faith that Sam Harris' experiences with meditation and LSD can make a positive difference in your life, worth dedicating hours of your spare time and/or risking a ""bad trip"" on a currently illegal drug. Sam stays true to his skeptical, rational style of writing, and is not espousing any metaphysical claims, readily acknowledging you can only verify that spiritual experiences of a secular kind, devoid of a sense of self, can be life-changing by experiencing it yourself. There are many studies which he cites of the benefits of meditation, but Sam suggests that there are deeper, more profound, even ""blissful"" benefits to be had through such introspective study. He describes methods of meditation that do not involve chanting, prayer or body contortions. He has spent decades seeking out the best teachers of ""enlightenment,"" and distills what was useful to the reader. Unfortunately, he states one usually must still seek out a legitimate ""guru"" to provide the specific guidance that you require to have such experiences consistently.Overall I felt it was a very useful book, and I am practicing meditation now, at minimum as a way to shut off the constant chatter in my mind at will, particularly when I want to go to sleep, or if I'm constantly replaying a stressful encounter or just have a stupid song stuck in my head. But maybe, if Sam is right, I can have a more profound experience of enlightenment, a true loss of self rather than a mere intellectual understanding that there is no self, and if I can manage to reproduce that experience consistently, become a more spiritual human."
"Sam Harris creates material that is worth reading and listening to. For the sake of transparency, I purchased his book, Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion, narrated by himself, and listened to him on a long road trip from NY to FL. I will certainly listen, again. He acknowledges hard-to-address areas of human thought processes as they measure against traditions of religious beliefs. The most useful components of his thought processes is that he asks good questions, and makes an attempt to answer them. What else can you strive for in this life? Ask good questions, relevant one's, unbiased one's, and then try to answer them. Good job, Sam Harris."
"I really like how this book is organized.  Sam takes you on a journey by relating to the reader on a personal level.  He pulls examples from his own life's journey to enlighten us.  I got a lot out of Waking Up as well as from Sam's excellent podcast, and now meditate from time to time.  Great read."
"I realize some people are drawn to the author and his writings, but, for reasons I don't fully understand, I'm not one of them. It laborious trying to read his works. Based on listening to podcasts and reading some articles on line, I suspected I may not enjoy the book as much as some other people. I was right. Not a criticism of the author or his works. Merely a recognition that context is important."
"Reading this book improved my quality of life for several months. It helped me start a habit of mindfulness and reminded me to be grateful for the richness of consciousness. I appreciated the thought-provoking sections on the nature of self/mind from a scientific perspective, including particularly interesting implications of split-brain phenomena, and the discussions of meditation techniques made me feel like getting into meditation might not be so necessarily daunting after all.Sam Harris‚Äôs style of writing is much like how he speaks: precisely, but not dryly. There was a great depth of information, but I read through it quickly and fairly easily. I would recommend this book to anyone who is searching for a greater sense of purpose or fulfillment in life without feeling like they are lying to themselves about the nature of reality."
"Sam Harris did it again, this book is a very informative and eye opening to all the enthusiasts who want to have a better perspective of their lives and how they can control their thoughts and their intentions to live a more fulfilling life.In my view this is the best Sam Harris book and it's the result of numerous years of meditation and contemplation on the nature of reality and how we perceive it."
"Sam Harris doesn't seem to be as stuck in the Newtonian paradigm as many of his ilk. I like that he can talk about spirituality and still maintain his scientific perspective. I still found, however, that he seems apologetic to his base of followers, seeming to excuse himself for discussing matters of the spirit. But, oddly, he criticizes others for doing the same thing, including Deepak Chopra who is both an intelligent physician and mind-body philosopher. Perhaps one day Harris will see that he and many of those he criticizes are really on the same page."
"I'm a software engineer, so I'm going to give a review from a computer science perspective:The concept of meta-programming is a program learning something about itself to become more effective in some way. Perhaps the most common example is machine learning in artificial intelligence. Another example is a Just-In-Time Compiler (JIT) commonly used with Java programs. The JIT monitors execution patterns of the Java program to determine how to best optimize it.Waking Up explains how to understand and evolve from a series of uncontrolled, jumbled flowing set of thoughts(programs). First, become aware of the thoughts, then develop the tools and meta-layer (JIT) to put thoughts into perspective and adapt, and finally to seamlessly flowing between the JIT and the programs to improve and appreciate each moment."
"I really liked this book.Some parts are harder going and I does in and out of it over several weeks.Very thought provoking and educational, as well as being an interesting read.I bought his next one based on my experience reading this one. Hope it's as good."
I have problems meditating but I want to learn to relax more and change how I tackle life. I was advised to start by reading this book. I found it to be splitting hairs at every turn and somewhat offensive. It was off putting and didn't really teach me anything that will advance me on my difficulties with meditation if anything it puts them farther away.
This is one of my all-time favorite books which I've read at least half a dozen times. Finally decided I should have my own copy since I keep rereading it. I have the Waking Up app also. Highly recommend.
"Sam Harris describes getting to the basic spiritual core of our being without adding the religious and culturally biased interpretations. The experience is real - the stories that humanity has attached to the experience over the centuries have just muddied the waters. Sam does his best to take a scientific approach to this difficult subject (being educated in neuroscience) and adds some of his own (admittedly subjective) experiences. Thought provoking and a challenge to some long held beliefs. Sam attempts to explain the possibility of getting to ""what is"" without the necessity of ""belief"" at all. Although an outspoken atheist, he explains that when others deny spirituality, along with religion, they are throwing out the baby with the bathwater."
"When my Christian faith was challenged and eventually set aside after 40 years, I was searching for help to reconcile my feelings with an objective view of the world.  Sam Harris gives a nice overview of what leads to the feelings we call ""spirituality"", how to interpret and channel them, and hints on how to find peace with your place in the universe in the absence of God.  The very simple headlessness exercise was mind-opening for me, and following up with mindfulness meditation has been a joy."
"I've enjoyed the writing of Sam Harris and the other ""Horsemen"" in the past, but Harris wins five stars from me, not because he's written a little gem of a guide linking mindfulness and spirituality (he has), but because of the manner in which he does so. Not least of the charms in this book are hidden jewels in his end notes. I can't recall being so well informed--and laughing my socks off--while reading footnotes. Kudos.I have only one criticism of the work, perhaps because I'm too dense to follow his argument about consciousness. He awards special status to consciousness, describing it as essentially inexplicable. This seems somewhat overstated to me, since consciousness is a highly adaptive process that one can well imagine would be spawned by natural selection and which can be perturbed by a variety of injuries or pharmacologic interactions--medical and neuroanatomical stuff that get complicated fast, but which has a significant literature. That we haven't worked out the fine pathways in consciousness is a feature of the difficulty in measuring them, perhaps. His stance seems more philosophical than biological in this regard, but that doesn't detract from his overall thesis.He explores a topic that badly needs a critical eye. This work is highly recommended for anyone with an interest in the intersection of mindfulness, spirituality, free thought, atheism, and neuroscience. Who WOULDN'T be interested in this stuff?"
"SAM HARRIS. ¬´Waking up. A guide to spirituality without  religion¬ªSam Harris, the author of  the book ¬´Waking up. A guide to spirituality without  religion¬ª  thinks  that  the spirit of any person is his thoughts. Yes, we can agree with him because the human body is only  a vessel in which  spiritual energy (soul ) of  a person is contained. Each person perceives the world in his own  ways.  A  situation may  be considered as  good  by one man  while  the same context  may be viewed as bad by another. Hence, a  person‚Äôs reaction to  all things , all events  depends only  on  his point of view . Therefore, we must work on ourselves to  achieve happiness. There are some well known basic principles to train good positive mind. Sam Harris writes about them. These are concentration on the internal processes of human  body ,  test of  every thought  and focus on life at the  particular moment.  Sam Harris urges  us to kill all bad thoughts  and follow along positive emotions and memories .  He  writes that happiness is  illusory. In this case, all our world is fiction too. Yet, we live in this world  and want to be satisfied with our  own lives.  Hence, we should meditate and live in environment  of our good thoughts.  We should  overcome the  bad mood and forces of chaos and  try to find  harmony with surrounding world and ourselves.We should love ourselves and believe that we are unique beings and our mind is all what we have. We must care for our mind  by meditating and this process will inevitably lead to changes of  our consciousness. The psychological effect  of this hard work will be obvious. We will be in  this state of happiness for a long time. Scientists have discovered that the structure of the brain can change  when  a person  practices meditation. Sam Harris encourages people to follow his example and begin  to get  pleasure and avoid pain by meditations. These mental practices can learn each of us to become mentally healthy, emotionally satisfied and, hence, happy.Harris‚Äôs arguments may be supplemented by a few ideas  to reach happy mood. One of them is the improvement of  monitoring  progress and getting enjoyment from  any success. It means  that a person should register his little achievements on the path to perfection and store them. Monitoring will help  to concentrate attention  on the evolution of consciousness and increase the capacity for positive thinking. Also, people should have  a record  positive thoughts as memories on demand. If something  affects a person  and provokes  a negative reaction , a person should quickly return his  good mood by switching to the positive memories.  He should dive into a feeling happiness and  try to support this  state of mind. The more a person uses good memories the stronger they get stored and help him to live happily.Furthermore, people should create friendly  atmosphere around themselves. In order to  get spiritual energy from  positive people . It is well known that our subconsciouses begin to communicate without our direct guidance. Moreover, we get most of the information unconsciously, therefore, we can not control this process. Hence, we should live around good people with  interesting  and positive thoughts.It should be noted  that people must spread  positive emotions and thoughts  and not clutter up the space by negative ones. We live in  a common  energy space and spiritual energies of people around us interact among themselves.  Your bad thought may come back to you because it changes space around you and creates future events. To be happy people should escape negative thinking to avoid pollution of environment by negative emotions.In addition, we should  try to get positive  cosmic energy . People  live in open system  because  our universe is infinite and contains energy flows which have different characteristics.  A body, mind , consciousness and subconsciousness possess unique properties and , hence, you should find  a flow of energy that  corresponds with your own. This flow will energize you.  The simple example of this is admiration with the nature. If you enjoy certain natural phenomena you may get positive emotions by immersion in contemplation. At this point you connect to the energy of the universe.In my opinion, it is true that each man may have his own way to be happy, but it is also clear that our happiness is in our hands.Svetlana Stroganova"
"So, I have read and studied (back to back) Hakuin's ""Four Cognitions of the Awakened Person"" and Sam Harris's ""Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality without Religion"". They begin and end in similar places, with exhortations to practice meditation.I believe Harris would agree with Hakuin who says of the Gate of Nirvana: ""Because the preceding way of knowing by differentiation is gained through correct practice, it is in the realm of cultivation: realization is gained by practice.""However, I did not notice that Harris said anything anywhere like this:""After you have reached the nondual realm of equality of reality, it is essential that you then clearly understand the awakened ones' profound principle of differentiation. After this you must master the methods for helping sentient beings. Otherwise, even though you have developed and attained unhindered knowing, you will, nevertheless, remain in the nest of the Hinayana and will be unable to realize total, unobstructed knowing. You will lack freedom to change in any required way to help sentient beings, to awaken yourself and others, and reach the ultimate Great Awakening where awareness and action are completely perfect. This is why one must arouse an attitude of deep compassion and commitment to help all sentient beings everywhere.""While Harris is still terrorizing the Beliefs of Believers, he is at least conceding the beneficial if unintended consequences of mindfulness. Perhaps he's just another climbing onto the Mindfulness bandwagon. But, I believe there is more than this. I trust his accounts of a lifetime of practicing both meditation and inquiry into meditation with many teachers and traditions.But, his infatuation with constructs - albeit by deconstructing them - limits his veracity in any construct free zone.Thus, while I do not believe he is in any way lacking compassion or empathy or hopes for the well-being of beings, his take on Spirituality falls short of rendering these anything more than unintended consequences.Zen practice, however, has established - if not a track record - at least a footpath towards the realization of the first Bodhisattva vow: Beings are numberless, I vow to save them."
"Very good.  I'm working through it a second time to pick out the parts I want to work on.  His attitude toward spirituality is essentially the same as the one I already had, that there are important things science hasn't yet dealt with -- and may never be able to.  But he goes into detail I never considered about how to make the most of those things.  He strongly recommends Buddhist meditation as a way to investigate consciousness.  I'm trying some of his suggestions in my own meditation, and I feel they're worth while whether or not my experience turns out to be as fulfilling as his."
"When I read ""The End of Faith"", I was awed by his intellect and insight, but it was a bit hard to see his point through the cloud of anger at organized religion.  Only in the final chapter did he admit that there were elements of spirituality that are PART of some religions that are undeniably good for people. He has not changed his stance against organized religion.  The disdain is there in the background, but he leads with more of a focus on things that do work, primarily meditation.  He delves into fascinating scientific research about the nature of consciousness that will definitely challenge your perception of the notion of a ""self"" or a ""soul"".  In any case, agree or disagree, this book is a much easier read since the anger factor has been dialed down and you can hear what he is saying."
"Perhaps my reaction says more about me than the book which I found to be rather difficult to read.  I ploughed through to the end and felt rewarded for having done so, but I can't say I feel much more enlightened.  I love the message that we are naturally spiritual creatures, able to experience awe about life and to feel a common bond with all humanity without inventing god, gods, or mythology to stand in the stead of reality as revealed by scientific method.  And I agree that elements of Eastern  philosophy point the direction to strip away the religious cultural nonsense and bias most of us have accumulated throughout our lives.  I feel that Sam Harris' points were all well made and substantiated by careful reflexion and explanation, but I do not feel that there was the kind of revelation of a new path to enlightenment that I was expecting from this brilliant thinker."
"I couldn't put this book down. Harris' intellect and way with words is just awesome. This book resonates with me a lot personally. At times I was reading it as if I was the one who'd written it. There really is a middle path one can take that balances science and rational thought with a sense of self and consciousness within reality almost to the point of supernatural beliefs.I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in consciousness, self-awareness, neuroscience, psychedelics, meditation, and most of all self-transcendence. One who is on a path to become a better person should absolutely put this book on their list."
"I've read Sam Harris before. As an atheist myself, I've admired his work, though he can sometimes be a bit strident in attacking religion. This isn't that. It's mostly a chronicle of his journey through meditation. He's studied all over the world, including the Indian subcontinent and has a lot to offer in the way of spiritual awakening. A wonderful book which allows the reader to come to conclusions without being preached to. I can't recommend this enough for the searcher who wants a spiritual life but without the trappings of organized religion."
"I liked the content and theme of the book, but Sam Harris is not proposing anything new, nor doing any experiment, it is just a summary of other people work, like Nietzche, Buddhism, Libet, and many othersI don't have a problem when people get together a set of ideas to propose something new, but he does not have time for that, and worst he writes in a very arrogant wayAgain, the content is good, but is not his work, he should let the reader know about it"
An insightful look into spirituality and yet another potent argument against the seeming necessity of organized religions. I enjoyed this book and would recommend!
"I consider this book as one of the most important books written on the subject in hand. Sam Harris explains an issue of so called spirituality in his usual clear and very understandable language of a gifted scientist. I am especially grateful to the author for giving explicit definition of meditation (Chapter 4), and its purpose in achieving understanding of the nature of our consciousness. In an eyes opening way he described (Chapter 5) the world of gurus and their disciples, distinguishing the difference between superstitious way the followers often treat their masters, from the truth about human weakness in face of great power over a crowd of vulnerable students.This book may enlighten a spiritual dilettante better and faster then spending long time, effort, and money while ascribing yourself to an ashram and a guru with ego bigger than Himalayas. Harris' scientific knowledge and honesty as human being would make out of him a great guru indeed, which he humbly, and unfortunately for the prospective followers, declined."
"Sam Harris is a joy to listen to or read for his sharp wit, incisive intelligence and eloquence blended with an earnest vulnerability. This was not one of the most revelatory or entertaining books I've read on the subject, but a gratifying read nonetheless, well worth the time invesment."
"Sam Harris has had a huge role in showing me just how often we as humans are lost in thought, and why this is harmful. The fact that we constantly are having a conversation with ourselves in our minds is incredibly strange, and it is mind boggling to me that I (and honestly almost everybody I know and have talked about this with) haven't paid any attention to this. This is book is an excellent guide to spirituality without all the mysticism of religion. I've personally picked up meditation as a practice now, and this book was instrumental in getting me to that point. I'm looking forward to the release of his new meditation app."
"Brave and wise. Sam Harris speaks of those things known in the spiritual community, but without the false assumptions, blind dogmatism and needless pap which only serve to confuse. How many people, following on from their own epiphany have been dashed against the rocks of confusing spiritual nonsense only to have a 20 year distraction added to their getting free by all those who appear to know indulging their own pet fantasies and unfounded beliefs.And finally someone breaking through the fierce social taboos against LSD and Psilocybin. I'm absolutely certain these agents of transformation have become so  demonised in our Western culture precisely because they  completely dismantle the false sense of self leaving only pure witnessing consciousness/awareness untouched - devoid of the 'person'. Our culture, rather than see a place for these profound agents of truth, runs scared of them. Yes, permission granted to watch the most murderous scenes which Hollywood can devise, but don't you dare imbibe those evil etheogens which may well show you to be one with the Universe. And interesting isn't it that some of the fiercest detractors are the advocates of conventional religion. But besides psychedelics making religion redundant, it's clear that people who seek refuge in dogma have a desire for things to remain the same. Psychedelics leave nobody as they were.We could have developed an understanding and helped people who wanted to go on the real quest of self discovery and liberation instead of throwing them in jail. 'True sailing is dead' is how Jim Morrison put it. Instead we have our lives reduced to being part of the herd - dumbed down and with an obsesion for copulating, stuffing our stomachs and hoarding things we think we own.""Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration, that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively, there is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves. Heres Tom with the Weather.""‚Äï Bill HicksWell done Sam Harris. Gutsy stuff ..."
"I put off reading Harris assuming that he was a biopic atheist of the kind I consider a type of fundamentalist.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  HE presents a wholesome perspective that helps me have a sense of purpose.  He also references similarly honest writers, for which I am grateful. The book is both Intellectually satisfying and practically useful"
"I've enjoyed reading Harris, Dawkins, Dennett, and of course Christopher Hitchens for years. No one can ever replace Hitchens, but Harris does a good job making some of the same points regarding faith, moving farther along into the spirit. I found at least 2 things he mentions in particular that happened in my own young life; it gave me great relief to understand that via his discussion. At 62, I've moved very far away from organized religion after searching much since 1995. While the meditation parts of the book are a little drawn out, I get what Harris is trying to say. The reading must be done slowly, taking time to really think about the points he makes. Very good read!"
"Very good introduction to spirituality for the person turned off by old dogmas and religious institutions. Harris spends a huge effort trying to convince the reader that the self is an illusion, a notion taught by Buddhists, based on the rise and fall of thoughts in the form of an internal monologue we all experience. For me, the effort fails, not because the observations are inaccurate but because they are incomplete. Consciousness, according to Harris, is an indisputable given, but he dismisses the self by defining it as ""the conventional self,"" identifying it with the fleeting flow of thought. An excellent effort, somehow too glib. I think I will re-read it."
A little complex and over my head this book nonetheless is eminently enjoyable and enlightening.Sam Harris central thesis is that the self and sense of ‚ÄúI‚Äù is an illusion. Upon close inspection we find that the sense of self is merely the false byproduct of the ego and this fact is a springboard for a secular and atheistic approach to spirituality.
"Sam Harris has provided a refreshing guide of mindfulness and spirituality outside the confines of and without the baggage of religion. Anyone who has read Sam Harris knows how thoroughly researched his work is, but Waking Up also provides a personal look into Sam Harris' spiritual life. Being both researched and personal makes the possibility of spirituality outside religion seem attainable. Sometimes his claims can be a little broad, but this lends itself to accessibility to a wide audience."
"Wow. This one, like his last book Free Will, has again changed my perspective on the mind and consciousness big time. I have for some time realized that consciousness, which is seated in the brain, is ultimately just the collision of atoms. These collisions in different parts of the brain give rise to the many functions of the brain, only a small part of which is consciousness. However I never really fully realized the full implications of this fact, namely, that there is no ""I"" or a thinker of my thoughts. There is no actual part of me that I can say is truly me. I am rather simply a stream of consciousness, and most of the thoughts that inhabit my consciousness arise from my unconsciousness without me really having a say in the matter. This is profoundly transformative and Harris uses examples like the split brain experiments, and mental experiments like the ""teleportation to mars"" experiment to drive the point home. I find myself often contemplating this book now. One of the most important reads in my life along with Free Will."
"Waking Up is a profound and fascinating book, that has affected the way that I understand and perceive my own mind.It is an essential reading for atheists and agnostics who are spiritual seekers.Chapter 2, which discusses the nascent scientific research on consciousness and self is extremely thought provoking, and worth the price of the book.Ultimately, you get the greatest value out of this book by experiencing for yourself the power of meditation and a mindful approach to every day life - and not just reading _about_ those experiences.  This book provides an invaluable guide for that journey.As for the practical matter of how to begin a meditation habit, I have been using (with success) the mobile app called ""Headspace"".  I highly recommend it.  https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app(I am not affiliated with the Headspace app, and don't know anyone who works there.)"
"I loved the level-headed approach and the honesty of this book.  It was easy to listen to while on walks and really helped heal some wounds left from leaving the religion I had always depended on for over 20 years.  Many people mistake what spirituality is and this really brings it into perspective from a non-fanatic view.  I think anyone should listen to this, and I'm about to listen to it again."
"After losing my faith I eschewed spirituality and was surprised to see Sam Harris write this book. But later some health problems left me staring into the existential void and I wondered how to achieve happiness. I felt the futility in trying to constantly search for good moments while minimizing the bad, all while realizing the fleeting happiness that comes from those good moments. This book stepped in at just the right time, and offered an alternative approach to peace that doesn't rely on throwing out critical thinking. I think the science is clear at this point on the benefits of meditation. Sam Harris is uniquely poised to write this book.There were a few moments of disappointment, however. First of all, he offers little in the way of ""how to"" instruction in this book. It is there, it's just not very fleshed out. Secondly, I was quite chagrined when he spoke of the only way to really, REALLY, learn the skill of transcending yourself is through an exceptional spiritual guide, and that the one person who could do this well is dead and maybe, just maybe, his sons in a remote part of Asia can teach it. It seems he harped a little too much on finding that holy grail of learning to completely transcend self as opposed to focusing on the benefits in the here and now that most people can get through meditation.Despite the drawbacks though I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It gave me a hope that I haven't felt in a long time. It gave me the motivation to begin a practice of daily meditation, and a concept of the benefits I might derive from it and what I might work towards. It helped me to see that there might be a way of attaining peace in the face of suffering, which doesn't require religion."
"Mr. Harris is most certainly at his best when he sticks to neuroscience and the virtues of humanism, spiced with vignettes of the vagaries of magical thinking. This book helped me a lot recommitting to CALMING DOWN and keeping things in perspective in 2017. Keep it by the bed and am hoping to re-read parts I need when I get twisted.Mr. Harris specks often and provocatively against all organized religions, especially Christianity and Islam. None of that is in here though."
"Thomas Nagel asks, ""What is it like to be a bat?""  WAKING UP  answers, ""What is it like to be Sam Harris?""  I'd been wondering and now have the account of another who has gone after the source of consciousness and found the positive and negative aspects.  From that knowledge comes a guided tour and analysis of others' visits to Heaven, gurus gone wild, and the social implications of the power of the inner life in bringing some appreciation of those on social and international issues.  Education and rites of passage, their  benefits and risks in the context of objective neuroscience AND subjective impressions benefit the reader who is considering beginning a personal study of consciousness."
First Sam Harris book I've read. Pretty good but some of the philosophical points I found to be a bit intellectually dizzying for me. Overall though some great discussions and insights into exploring one's consciousness.
"Sam Harris' works are my prize possessions. I've read them all with an outcome of admiration for his education, experiences and generosity in sharing his inferences and conclusions with us. From the, End of Faith to Waking Up, Harris' clarity is unmatched in laying out for his readers a science and philosophy more objectively inline with reality than anything I have ever come across in writing. Waking Up, has carried on this tradition. Though I personally come from a dualist (Cartesian) tradition of meditation as an ex-catholic monk in the 70's, of which I whole heartedly rejected 30 years ago, I am still intrigued and profoundly amazed by the levels of consciousness hidden deep in the recesses of the brain. However, I do not see a different value in the ""self"" (the brains constant inner conversation) that Harris' wishes to eliminate and the state of quite observation. The two states have equal value and one should not be eliminated, only sometimes temporarily suppressed as a meditative exercise. Harris' seems to put greater value on overcoming self. But self-conversation is, in my opinion, just as important as quiet observation and Harris has marshaled both to catch and enlighten us."
"During my 72 years, I have been out-behind the religion barn a number of times, sometimes barely surviving to tell the tale.  I can relate to so much of what Sam Harris is (now) saying.  Now, meditation can take many forms, in various social or non-social physical contexts; the social context always has its risks, namely, interactions with other people; however, in the literature, I have been noticing that many people of various dis-organized (i.e. ""liberal"" or non-regimented) religions have been converging on this subject.  Some readers here might find of some interest the Wikipedia article, ""Religious Naturalism"", as in ""Naturalism"" versus ""Supernaturalism"" as a spiritual philosophy."
"A fascinating journey through the concept of consciousness and spirituality as seen from a secular, scientific and intelligent mind. It is clear and eloquently written. I had a hard time putting it down. It dives deep into areas that deserve depth and briefly touches subjects that don't need further expansion. My experience was that not of reding but rather that of having a conversation with an interesting, enlightened intellectual on the subject of meditation, consciousness, the illusion of self and the pitfalls of religion in achieving enlightenment.I'm now interested in reading more of his work and intent on being more diligent and disciplined about practicing meditation."
"I have read all of Sam Harris' books so naturally I had to pre-order this one. This book was not as exiting for me as his other books because I do not consider myself a very spiritual person, but as usual, Sam was able to draw me in with his intoxicating writing style and he opened my mind to an entire list of things that I had never thought of before! I would recommend this book to anybody who is looking for an updated look at meditation and spirituality."
"An empirical journey revealing the truths, benefits, and conversely - misunderstandings of conscious awareness. I questioned spirituality as I know it through Christian circles. I now know why my instincts questioned the so called wisdom of the ages. Waking Up cleared up the common misunderstandings of spirituality and opened a door to seeing one can be spiritual without being religious. Equally as beneficial are practical instruction for meditation and mindful living.  The book is gift that will keep on giving for generations to follow."
"Sam Harris has hit the mark again with his new book, Waking Up.  Although the author is an atheist he has a wonderful interest in the potential of mind/consciousness and he takes his reader on a journey of exploration into this realm.  Being an atheist myself I am naturally skeptical of claims of the supernatural, but like the author I also have a great interest in how consciousness has emerged through the process of evolution.  Many atheist authors steer clear of anything ‚Äúmysterious‚Äù in the natural world, but Sam Harris tackles these subjects head on.  You may not agree with everything that the author suggests in this book, but even so, you will enjoy the journey.  A fascinating and enjoyable read, which I highly recommend."
"This book was something that I've been interested in reading for a while and it did not disappoint. I purchased the kindle version with the narration. I was looking for a book that taught me the basics of meditation and how one could be spiritual and be an atheist. One of the bonuses that i didn't expect was that Sam Harris also discussed the ultimate goal of meditation which was eliminating the self. Most of the articles I read showed many of the reasons to meditate. Increased happiness, compassion, better health etc. I was already sold on meditation based on those reasons but Sam brought a different level to my understanding of the subject. Some topics discussed are below.Eliminating illusion of self-showing body is not self-teleporter thought expirements-dividing mind-showing you are not your thoughts-arguing against existence of soulMeditations-how to meditate-meditating to remove illusion of self-imaginging yourself headless (you have to read to understand)-meditating by staringOther Topics-Being wary of ""spiritual"" gurus-use of drugs-defending spirituality and atheismOne of the negatives of the book was that while Sam does a good job of showing how meditating removes suffering, it didn't seem to explain how/why meditating increases compassion. He did state numerous times that meditation does improve compassion and cites scientific articles but he it doesn't explain the how/why. I guess I fail to see how finding out that thoughts are merely appearances in conscienceness leads to increased compassion. If anyone can point to where he does discuss this let me know.Overall I really enjoyed the book and I am starting to pratice meditation. I'm using the free guided meditation audio files that Sam provides on his webpage. Great book. Definetly one of my favorites."
"I needed to read it 3 times to fully understand this book - it has helped me a lot.  The practice of mindfulness and meditation has reduced my anxiety levels.  Warning: This book is targeted at atheists and agnostics, because he openly criticizes organized religion."
"For a lot of people reading this book, they might not know what Dzogchen is. Consider this beautiful quote on Dzogchen by the author: ""After a few minutes, Tulku Urgyen simply handed me the ability to cut through the illusion of the self directly, even in ordinary states of consciousness. This instruction was, without question, the most important thing I have ever been explicitly taught by another human being. It has given me a way to escape the usual tides of psychological suffering‚Äî fear, anger, shame‚Äî in an instant."" He then describes this method of cutting through the illusion of the self so that people can use it whenever they want. I have not finished the book but Sam's writing fills the reader with a sense of wonder and curiosity about his subject matter. He's the reason why I started meditating (from one of his blog posts on meditation a few years ago).Harris said he wrote Waking Up because he could not think of another book that was a guide to spirituality without religious claims. When he said this, I thought of Alan Watt's lesser known work called¬†

  
Psychotherapy East and West









  
  
    
  . Consider how similar Watt's writing sounds to Harris: ""If the Westerner is to understand and employ the Eastern ways of liberation at all, it is of the utmost importance that he keep his scientific wits about him; otherwise there is the morass of esoteric romanticism which awaits the unwary. -From Psychotherapy East and West"
"This was a fascinating book. I learned a great deal about meditation and the goal of this end-state of awareness selflessness, a concept that has never occurred to me and I don't fully grasp yet, though I understand in theory.I found the general direction of this book a bit out of line with my expectations, however, based on the subtitle ""a guide to spirituality without religion.""While Sam starts and ends the book with a discussion of ""spirituality"" and includes that term in the title of the book (it's actually a GUIDE to spirituality) - I never felt that I understood what he means by spirituality, or how that ties into his conclusions about lack-of-self awareness.In the beginning of the book, he has this fascinating anecdote of when he was younger and had an MDMA experience in which he felt this feeling of unconditional love and connection with his friend (and seemed to hint that this feeling extended to all beings, in that moment, of which he used the pizza delivery guy as an example).This sense of connection with the broader universe, with all beings in it - this is what I TOOK to be his interpretation of spirituality, though he never really explains it as such.The problem with the book is, while he goes in lots of depth into his meditational journey and the ultimate goal of achieving that end-state of ""awareness of lack of self,"" it feels like he never takes that next step and explains WHY this state is a prerequisite to a state of ""spirituality"" akin to the feeling of unconditional love for all things that he hints at in the MDMA anecdote. It's like he either hasn't quite figured that part out yet, or just does a poor job of explaining it.So to me, this book, while fascinating and deeply insightful, falls short. I feel this book goes halfway. It is a guide (somewhat) to how to achieve this state of self-less-ness (or at least a primer on the existence of this state), but he really doesn't do a great job of linking this to ""spirituality"" in any sense of the word.Simply, he draws no clear link between ""understanding how consciousness works"" and ""spirituality"" - leaving that second piece of the puzzle for the reader to figure out for themselves. If he's insinuating that the former is a prerequisite for the latter, I'll buy that argument - but while he hints at this, he doesn't really make an effort to explain what ""spirituality"" actually is or how to get there.As for this feeling of lack of self - other than the ability to not hold on to bad thoughts (which has positive benefits that cannot be overstated) - what is the spiritual component of this state? How does this way of being make you ""spiritual"" in any sense, how does it deepen your connection to the universe or other beings in any way? He hints in the conclusion that this state allows you to be more aware of the feelings of others, but seems to just pay passing lip service to this...Mr. Harris - I want a sequel to this book!"
This book provides practical guidance for having a spiritual life. Spirituality here is defined as self transcendence. Self refers to the rational part of us. This book helps one meet needs that most religions cannot satisfy because most religions actually solidify the illusion of self.
"This book is not an easy read. By that I mean that this is a book that (for me anyway) required a lot of thought. Sometimes I think Mr Harris became to technical especially when explaining the chemical and biological functions of the brain as it relates to our ability to process information. That being said I did give much thought to the philosophies and experiences written about in this book and will try process this information with other like minded people in order to find answers to the many difficult questions about life without resorting to the easy fictional answers provided by ""people of faith""."
"Boring, empty"
"This book is a needed message in the world.  It's not a surprise that many others out there are trying to tarnish his reputation as Sam is shaking the columns of the existing power structures of religion. His teachings that spirituality lies within each of us and is not dependent on any authority of the church (or other institution or self-labeled) would certainly cause enemies.One challenge can be Sam's tone which will be make many who need to receive this message too defensive to receive it (maybe it's not the tone but just his ability to wipe away the religious debris many cling to so quickly).This book has given me more to think about around my own conscious experience and how to improve it. Many of the lessons are simple but not easy and I'm very thankful for the reading.Sam's 'bulls*** detector' does indeed make good reading - which was much of his previous books.  This book is all the better as it not only calls out how ridiculous much of today's behavior is but offers an alternative.  One problem is that this alternative is considerable work (for one year I spent an hour each day practicing mindfulness which is difficult to do).  The velocity of today's distracted society is increasing and moving further away from even the willingness to be silent enough to listen and learn in such a manner.Thanks, Sam!"
"Yet another great book from arguably the clearest thinker and most convincing writer out there.  In remarkably few words, Sam explains what spirituality means for him and how experiences which traditionally are associated with magical thinking and religious dogma can and should be viewed as neurological phenomena, some desireable, and world-view expanding, some not so much.  This is one of the few books I've read by anyone where the footnotes are actually worth reading in their entirety."
Often when we are drawn to explore our inner selves we default to religious explanations of our experiences. There are clear and natural alternatives to the supernatural stories that have dominated human cultures.Beyond just reviewing several aspects of spirituality Sam Harris also gives methods to help seekers glean insights for themselves.I believe this is a unique approach to understanding ourselves. I think it is very needed as we attempt to develop and understand our inner lives.
"Sam Harris has written a book to raise consciousness about spirituality, offer reasons for the importance of meditation, without any attempt to provide instructions on performing meditation or maps to take you to higher spiritual realms.  He is vigorous in suggesting that spirituality is healthier absent religious trappings.  He inspires the pursuit of rational consciousness toward that spiritual reward.  You will have to search out the mechanics of doing meditation elsewhere."
"Because I'm starting my research on Atheism, I foun this book somewhat difficult to understand, especially in matters of science. But the chapters in which he criticizes the power of false gurus, and in which he explains the benefits of meditation are great. He is indeed very well prepared and you feel your are walking in the guidance of an expert"
"This is a profound work. I am a fan of Sam Harris' work.  The last couple of books were disappointments, but this one exceeds expectations in every way. This quote sums it up:""I still considered the world's religions to be mere intellectual ruins ... but I now understood that important psychological truths could be found in the rubble.""We have a longing for contemplation, or transcendence, or something mystical -- let's call it spirituality --- that drives people to religion, while religions drags so much superstition along for the ride. With 90+% of the global population following a religion of some sort, one can not deny that there must be some innate human psychological need. However what is it? Harris promises to look at spirituality with an evidence-based, scientific view. Nothing will be presented that can not be tested in your own experience. If the pursuit of happiness is the goal, spirituality is then a kind of mindfulness to make a path to happiness.Chapter 2 delves into the brain and consciousness. We need to understand who we are. Brain science has advanced tremendously in the past 10 years. He spends a lot of time on split brains, and how there is lot of evidence that there is no single locus of control in the brain. Consciousness emerges the way that the properties of a fluid emerge from the atoms it is made from. And consciousness is divisible: this has serious implications for any religion based on a unified soul.Chapter 3 is an exploration of the illusion of the self. Knowing that consciousness is divisible, there can be no single ""I"" except as an illusion -- a powerful illusion.Chapter 4 covers meditation -- a little about his own journeys (literally and figuratively) that he made, and some about how meditation bring about a ""waking up"" as the book is titled. A summary just doesn't do justice to this core of the book.Chapter 5 then explores the intersection of this with religion. Gurus and cult leaders and the nature of spiritual authority. We strive for spirituality, and we need the help of a guide, but those guides can take advantage of the situation. ""Head for the door at any sign of deception on the part of a teacher."" He has a number of stories to illustrate. He also covers near-death experiences (no evidence that brain function stopped if they retain a memory of the event; Nobody reporting a near death experience was actually dead) as well as the effects of drug may have in helping people understand how profoundly consciousness might be altered.In summary, Harris believes spirituality fills a hole in secularism, humanism, rationalism, and atheism. There are many theists who dislike the silly myths and implausible stories that come with their religion, but stick with the religion for fear of losing that important spiritual feeling. They fear that in honestly following their true belief, they will lose something that only religion can provide. Spirituality after all is a path to happiness, and they believe that without religion they can only be unhappy. Sam Harris may have provided the antidote: you can shed the myths and superstitions, while retaining the important spiritual path to happiness. They are NOT contradictory.  It bridges the gap between theists and atheists.It is a very welcome, and possibly very important, story."
"This short and very personal book establishes the foundation for a secular spirituality.  Thus, it begins to fill a gap in the secular, rational, and scientific world view by providing a path to self transcendence, happiness, and peace that does not rely on pre-scientific cosmologies.  To be more specific, this path leads to a deep realization that there is no ""self"" to transcend and that traditional religions have no monopolistic claim on spiritual insights.  It sets forth a middle way between traditional religions, with all of their pre-scientific flaws, and science, with its third person sterility.  The Buddha Smiles."
"Personally I think Sam Harris is one of the smartest people on the planet and I'm always delighted to see a new book from him.  This one had to be the most difficult to read, because it challenged some foundational beliefs I had about consciousness.  ""Waking Up"" delivers the greatest gift any book ever can: it will cause you to think about things in ways you have never thought about them before.  Brilliant and thought-provoking. -RG"
"This is a gorgeously written book, and worthy of your time and careful consideration, particularly if you are new to seeking a spiritual path that's free of religion.The subtitle is ""A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion"", and as others have stated, I was hoping for more guidance on how to cut through the illusion of self.  Harris explains why he is no guru, and perhaps it is out of respect for his teacher(s) and genuine concern for his audience that he will not, for example, simply tell us what it is that Tulku Urgyen taught him in the span of mere minutes that changed his life forever. As he writes in the chapter on meditation,""But after a few minutes, Tulku Urgyen simply handed me the ability to cut through the illusion of self directly, even in ordinary states of consciousness. This instruction was, without question, the most important thing I have ever been explicitly taught by another human being. It has given me a way to escape the usual tides of psychological suffering--fear, anger, shame--in an instant.""I hope he writes a companion volume that contains more direct instructions, whether it is Dzogchen exercises or the method of self-inquiry that Advaita Vedanta puts forth. (He mentions this method exists but does not explain what it is.)  His book will convince many that these are worthwhile things to learn, but his readers are left to go search for good teachers--even though part of his book is devoted to the topic of just how hard it can be to find trustworthy teachers and just how much precious time one can waste and how much frustration and despair one can accumulate while on the gradual path. Even if you find a good teacher that will cut to the chase like Tulku Urgyen did with Harris, one might find themselves having to sift through a lot of nonsense that's bundled along with the useful teachings. Harris could do us a huge service here.He does share a few exercises, but freely admits they won't click for everyone. They didn't for me. His general instruction to ""turn attention on itself"" similarly isn't doing much for me. I am a Vipassana practitioner who can see the difference between ""the observer"" and ""the observed"" while meditating, but that's where it collapses for me. When I ask myself, ""okay, who is observing the observer?"", the answer seems keep a sense of self intact instead of making it disappear.  Why, I'M observing the observer.  Me.  My self.  The space that I call ""the observer"" doesn't feel personal. It feels like a still, peaceful void. I feel like I'm glimpsing pure consciousness when I locate ""the observer"", but something in my approach, my use of language and labels, or efforts to reason all of this out is keeping me from getting any further than that. I can already appreciate there's no ""conventional self"" through reasoning alone, but my experiences in meditation have me feeling like there's perhaps multiple Selves in these heads of ours, instead of none at all.At the end of the day, my hope for more from him on this topic, and my belief that he can provide much-needed clarity to many as they start to work in the lab of their own mind, speaks to the excellence of  ""Waking Up."""
"I am sure that theists or adherents of religion will reject the very purpose of this book as an impossibility.  How can one even begin to search for the spiritual joy of approaching ultimate truth in an areligious context?By ultimate truth I mean all the truth about ourselves that we can handle.It's difficult, but Sam Harris shows how worthwhile it can be, and how and why to get started."
"I enjoyed his book, but it is unfair for me to have read it after listening to Harris‚Äôs podcast. There was some good information in here, but if you‚Äôre a regular listener, a lot of it he‚Äôs already mentioned in his podcast(s). I‚Äôm just happy to support him in however he chooses to express himself publicly and hope to get it signed someday."
"This book is beyond remarkable, and I am not surprised that so many reviews describe it as important.I've wondered many times what will happen if you took a rigorous scientist and logic driven super skeptic (who is a neuroscientist no less in this case) and have him explore consciousness experientially through meditation and other methods (as well as scientifically through research). This book is basically the result of that and it is amazing.Sam Harris managed to take the baby out of the bath (or the diamond from the dunghill as he says) and save it from being thrown out with the bathwater of eastern spirituality and so eloquently find and describe the discoveries about our own mind and our own conscious experience that people can investigate and experience for themselves. All while maintaining his bulls*** meter active.I cannot recommend this book enough."
"If you are looking for an introduction to mindfulness, this book is a good start. Sam Harris speaks clearly and also introduces you to some of the methods of meditation that have been developed over time. Beginners can easily benefit from reading this book."
"This book provide a good introduction to meditation and to what can be called a spiritual life without religion, or without gods. It goes deeper into the topic of minds, minds dependance on brains, and consciousness. Sam Harris takes a rational approach to spirituality and how as atheists we should not feel like the word is inadequate for use. Sam Harris also talks about the dangers of blindly following a spiritual teacher or guru.All in all, this is a good and interesting book."
"Harris takes the reader on his personal road trip of experience, scepticism and good science to show why spirituality is good thing, albeit repeatedly hijacked by cranks and psychotics to pursue their own ends. The road trip goes down the fast lane of drugs, gurus and mystical retreats, while at the same time exploring the slow lane of meditation to elevate one‚Äôs perceptions above one‚Äôs immediate self. I have found the book revelatory. It is only a starting point, its brevity does not allow much depth into the study of meditation, but Harris is frank about his own challenges and experiments and, most importantly, examines these from a logical and scientific perspective.I am a fan of Harris because he promotes rationality but avoids the atheistic dogmatism that alienates some of his fellow ‚Äòhorsemen of the apocalypse‚Äô.  Harris does not put the boot into religion in this book, but he does objectively examine purveyors of spirituality and their motives. It often isn‚Äôt pretty. Moreover, he says ‚Äúuntil we can talk about spirituality in rational terms ‚Äì acknowledging the validity of self-transcendence ‚Äì our world will remain shattered by dogmatism‚Äù. I would not hesitate to recommend this book to any reader interested in meditation or yoga to improve their lives, and Harris‚Äôs peak into the alternative side of psychedelic drugs is a necessary comparison. It would be unfortunate if this necessary part of the discussion was interpreted to be unhealthy or risky."
"I highly recommend this book, which I found this fascinating on many levels, even though it didn't seem to come together at the end for me.  I found Harris' attacks on various people to be somewhat harsh and without purpose, and suggested that all this ""waking up"" wasn't helping him process his venom towards people.  Although coherent and understandable to a layman, the book does get bogged down at moments in philosophical discussion, and while I appreciated the depth Harris goes into, these discussions didn't help me get his overall point any better."
"Again Dr. Harris eloquently destroys the conflation that always happens when people equate religion with spirituality. Needless to say, these are two entirely different phenomena. Because of this, those people that feel a void in their life after losing there religion, can find solace in this book as they are not mutually exclusive paradigms."
"This is well written, and thought provoking, as everything by Sam Harris is. He spends a bit too much time seeming to promote a method of meditation he has gained over many years studying various Eastern practices, but never really gives any guidance in how to practice it or even begin. His reasoning is spot on, and if this book didn't do anything other than plant the idea that a ""spiritual"" life does not need religion - in fact, can be much better without it - it would be worth the read."
Big fan of Sam's podcast. Glad I finally got around to reading one of his books. Would recommend to anyone interested in meditation/religion (or lack there of).
"Great explanation or an often misunderstood author, cool but to the point bio,  perfect seller, exactly as described,  early deliver!"
"As always, Harris is clear and thoughtful in his discussion.  He does a nice job anchoring his ideas in both science and theory and tells us where the science is lacking.  He presents both mindfulness and meditation in a way that is acceptable to people of science and to people of both science and faith.  I thought that he spent a bit too much time telling us why he rejects that beliefs and rituals of religion; it seemed like a distraction from his main points."
"For anyone tempted to describe themselves as ""spiritual but not religious"", this is a must-read. Sam Harris is to my mind the logical successor to Alan Watts, offering here a deeply personal and rigorous examination of human experience that seemingly defies explanation. In this book, Sam discusses many ""esoteric"" concepts in a clear, secular language that invites even the most rational mind to explore, consider, and translate them into practical, life-improving practices."
"In this powerful and beautifully written book, Sam Harris argues that the self, that sense of an ""I"" is an illusion. This is a point of view that has long been held in certain branches of Buddhism, and is now also largely held by neuroscientists. when we are able to let go of this strong sense of self, even briefly, we get to experience reality in the direct and preferably affecting way.I found this book helpful in reconciling my determinedly Western science view of the world with powerful spiritual experiences that I've had.I recommend this book for people that are interested in this area without reservation."
This book changed my life and I know others that feel the same. Absolute must buy for people trying to be more at peace in their life.
"Considering how smart Sam is, you‚Äôd think this would be a difficult read but it‚Äôs actually quite a page turner.  This might be my favorite book of all-time.  If you have any interest in experimenting with and studying your conscious experience, this is required material.  Sam makes his points really stick and they always make sense."
Sam Harris tacled the subject of consciousness from his personal experience meditating with gurus and his professional experience as a neuroscientist.He dives into the subject and makes his case leaving one with the feeling that no stone was left unturned.
"Seriously - hardcopy first, but then the kindle version later (so I could easily copy out the tons of quotable material for my own writing projects!)"
"Sam Harris delves into the human mind, allowing the reader to join in and experience the beginnings of a personal journey into their own minds.  Just like anything else, meditation, or any mental self-exploration, must be practiced, in order to be developed.  Follow his instructions to get yourself started, and you may be able to open yourself to the possibility that we are more than the sum of our parts.  One need not follow religion in order to understand that."
"I enjoyed how Harris opens up the idea of a deeper sort of atheistic nihilism. He draws upon his experiences around the world, training with yogis and other ""Masters,"" but refreshingly, he presents his learnings in an atheistic, non ""woo""-filled manner.I'd recommend this book to anyone who would like to explore spirituality and alternative states-of-mind without reading an author who has a religious or occult agenda.I gave it 5 stars because I couldn't really think of a reason not to."
"Sam is a bright guy. You'll have to really set aside a bit of time to carefully read (and reread) much of this material. The good news, though, is that each time you revisit this work, it's even more insightful than the last. Give it a thorough read, let it marinate and digest a bit, then give it a second read to really pick up some of the insight you missed the first time around."
"Great start, I recommend to anyone looking for a more reasonable approach to spiritual feelings. Arrived quickly and in excellent condition."
"If you're someone who requires a lot to really get behind -- and experience -- a good idea, know that the following your way come in 'Waking Up':- Neuroscience explaining the impossibility of the ever-present self we think we know so well- Methods, easily explained, for how to see this truth within yourself- A clear explanation of why introspection is necessary in this field, so you don't feel silly doing it- An enjoyable read not out to convince you by power of words aloneThis book is powerful by virtue not of its ability to engage you in its message, but by its lack of obstacles to your engaging in its message for yourself."
"This is a wonderfully matter-of-fact, evidence-based description of mindfulness and how to train it.  The brain science Sam Harris is talking about with theory of mind and consciousness is astounding.  Discussion of the research at the beginning of the book helped to frame spiritual practices like meditation in a less mystical way.I am deeply grateful for this book because of my own spiritual development.  I am also relieved that Harris didn't get preachy about anything.  Good book."
"This is the second book of Sam Harris that I have read and I have to say I'm hooked now. Waking Up is a book I believe everyone should read. I already knew the mind was a wonderful thing and a very powerful tool but to dig this deep into what the mind, consciousness and meditation is all about has been a wonderful experience. Our conventional sense of self is an illusion, wow what a powerful statement. One of the biggest questions that really stuck with me after reading this book was ""Is there a form of happiness beyond the mere repetition of pleasure and avoidance of pain?"", I say hell yes there is and I'm determined to re-wire my mind to do just this. To think that your mind determines your quality of life not your circumstances or surroundings, if we would all find a way to stop and realize this our lives could be so much different.Now the idea of a split brain is mind blowing. The facts pointed out by Sam Harris on the split brain are amazing and was the cause of some great discussions with my peers. To imagine that someone can live with only one hemisphere of their brain is wild, and even more crazy that after dividing the brain it caused no changes in the person's behavior, how is this even possible? I will definitely be reading more into the split brain.Self being an illusion makes sense to me, we all find ourselves talking to this illusory self. I agree that there isn't a region of the brain that holds a seat for a soul known as self for us to talk to when we are lost in thought or just speaking out. To penetrate this illusion you just have to look closely, seems so easy but I find it hard to not reflect back to that illusory self that seems to listen to me.As you can see from above I found this book very interesting and will be reading more into specific topics of this book.Happy Reading"
"This is a very important book for public discourse and personal growth. In WAKING UP, Sam proposes the need for an honest conversation on spirituality. At the core of religion lies a kernel of truth about the nature of mind, which he calls self-transcendence.Sam uses neuroscientific studies as well as his years of personal experience with meditation and his own mind, to articulate a sensible meaning of spirituality.We spend our life lost in thought without even realizing we're thinking. Our happiness is dependent upon a future fulfilment that we never reach. We believe we are the authors of our own thoughts. Sam shows how these illusory beliefs divert us from living a truly fulfilling life.One need not believe in the dogmatic claims of religion to experience spirituality. In a world stricken with war and conflict rooted in religion, it may be crucial for humanity to find some common ground on this subject. With Sam's comedy, wit, and elegant analogies, I know of no writer who can deliver such a premise so clearly.As it turns out we can have our cake and eat it too."
"I think Sam Harris' book opens up new questions to be asked:If we are to accept our consciousness in the present with whatever its contents are, why do we strive to upgrade our future experiences. We all want to drive a nicer car, have granite countertops, and purchase the latest iphone. Surely Sam is making money off of this book and he appears to be well groomed. What is the relationship between the needs the mind wants and consciousness's ability to accept whatever is happening in the present moment?Also, if there is no self, are we just floating consciousness's attached to a mind and body that is part of some natural simulation? This would mean the choices that we make in life are not truly choices at all, but just chemical reactions in the brain that have been developed over time."
"Whereas other methods advise focussing on an objective thing or activity (like the breath) this approach urges seeking to focus on consciousness itself. The compelling analogy is the mirror effect of a window: If you focus on the objects outside the window you're likely to miss your own reflection right in front of you. Some parts are technical and deep, requiring sustained thought, but for the most part this is familar clear Harris prose."
This was a very disappointing book. I had hope to learn meditation practices. Definitely a no! A lot of psychobabble.
"The best part of this book dealt with consciousness.  However, Sam could have pursued the concept of self awareness andemotional intelligence to a greater degree.  Another area which could have been expanded is perception, why are somepeople so much more perceptive?  Are some people more highly evolved and in tune with the the universe?Finally, what Sam is really writing about is metaphysics, the fundamental nature of being."
"I like this book very much! Sometimes to much about the brain and the neuroscience, but great about the illusion of the self, meditation and spirituality. This book will be very helpful in my meditation pratice!"
I liked the book for clarifying the often obscure references to out of body experiences in relation to expanded states . While in our body it is pure fantasy and conjecture that we are experiencing an after death state in a dimension not within our conscious understanding. As a journeyers go forward I hope more people will begin to see the use of substance as sacrament to the inherent magic if being rather than a flight into worlds that are supplementary rather than replacements of our precious life experience on the planet.I recommend it to people interested in examining the powerful aspects of perspective and the importance of equanimity . Those interested in meditation as a continuum to support the beauty experienced in altered states will find Mr. Harris's insights valuable.
"This is a well thought-out book, if your ""not awake"".....a good intro to waking upto the illusion that we live in. However, from my perspective, his approach is stillrather 3D, rather than moving into the higher dimensions or vibrations where we'reall in a reality of Unity. He's definitely on the right track, and his writing is quiteinteresting!"
"Sam  provides a provides a good  foundation based on a understanding not derived from faith.  With out rejecting any insight from religion introspection, though it varies between different ones. He removes spirituality from the sole domain of faith. In doing so showing the limitations of science in not dealing with the sense of being that is always with us.  Growth in a spiritual sense can now  be placed in a more acceptable package with no dogmatic extra baggage.  However I felt I was reading the beginning of a longer  work and expected more.  But this is partly more of my own expectation placed upon one piece of work. It did however provide a stepping stone. Something I could identify with that i can see occurring  on a bigger scale. The older arguments are just that, out dated. 'Waking Up' I hope provides one of many explorations into new territory that is much needed. I hope to  see a follow on."
"Given the creative interpretations of experience that we feel are necessary for our survival we may well become extinct as a species in our efforts to defend, and justify or just ignore their lack of correspondence to reality. Mr. Harris' book presents a rare opportunity to see how this mis-adaptation can be seen through by us (as individuals) if we have the intent and willingness to take it on...."
I find this book uplifting. Sam Harris need to write more books like this one. It is good to see an Atheist with a spiritual side to them. It is a great scientific exploration of spirituality. It went on my bookshelf of reading again.
"A deeply important meditation on the nature of spiritual experience.  Harris brings scientific rigor and philosophical clarity to a field badly in need of both.  The result is an insightful, inspiring and practical guide to solving some of life's most important questions--without recourse to irrationality or dogmatism.  Highly recommended for nearly everyone who cares about living life fully.  Philosophers, neuroscientists, theologians, humanists, spiritual seekers, atheists, and open-minded followers of the world's religions will all find much here that is challenging and worthwhile.  (The audiobook is especially good.)"
"I was not expecting to like this book, because I find Sam Harris' politics a bit reprehensible, but I found that it was (a) a really good explanation of why a non-religious person might nevertheless want to engage in Buddhist practices, and (b) I actually was able to get where Sam is coming from with his scary politics, and while I still don't agree with him, I realized when I read the afterward that he is coming from the same motivation that I do in his diatribes about Islam and other religions: the desire for us to stop making each other miserable.The book provides a really clear explanation of basic and advanced meditation (not enough to develop a practice, but definitely enough to understand why doing it is interesting).  He goes into a lot of detail about the study of consciousness, talks about how psychedelics relate to spiritual practice, and presents a clear and coherent philosophy which, while it is clearly based on the Buddhist teachings, is non-dogmatic and non-religious.  I would recommend it for any atheist or agnostic who wants to search for meaning without getting sucked into a cult, and I would also recommend it for Buddhists.The teachings as they are presented seem to emphasize Theravada concepts more than Mahayana, but I found it insightful and helpful, and there were a couple of occasions where I exclaimed out loud at some insight that popped into my head as a result of what he'd said.  So this is one of the better Buddhist books I've read, despite being written from an entirely irreligious perspective, or perhaps because of that."
"Five stars for fans of Sam Harris. I enjoy fiction and reading as a diversion, but sometimes it's worthwhile to read something to make you think."
"Sam Harris el elocuente. Este libro trata de explicar desde diversos puntos de vista, la manera en que los humanos tratamos de justificar eventos extraordinarios del mundo que solo ocurren en nuestra mente. La diferencia entre mente (consciencia)/cuerpo y ‚Äúalma‚Äù puede ser entendida mejor despu√©s de leer esto."
Once a Christian always a Christian. Being an atheist christian just slows ones development. Sam has a good attitude. I enjoyed the book. Reading is not meant to change your mind. IT empowers you mind.
"Just OK.  His talks are better, and have more ‚Äúah-ha!!‚Äù moments.  It‚Äôs OK, not raving great.  I bought it after listening to a couple of his talks.  Kind of boring book.  Just OK."
"Excellent and brilliant book for those of who are seeking answers outside current religious and their outdated dogmas which no longer make sense in the light of scientific discoveries. Sam Harris is a voice and conscious of our time. His eloquent and highly knowlegable way of history of religions scientific approach to investigation of mind make this book a must read for all who are seekers and interested how to 'transcend the self'', 'not indnify with ones thoughts' and other easily understood concept of mind and consciousness, I read the book in no time and found it very informative and liberating. I keep reading certain chapters over again to make sure I fully understand and absorb its insights and wisdom. The book is great in its content and brilliant intelligent way it's written. Thank you again Sam Harris, I am not a scholar nor educator, just ordinary person, meditator and very interested in transcendent states, conscience and universality of our human destiny."
"Thanks to Dr. Harris for connecting the dots between the science of the mind and the realm of the meditator--showing that these are not really different worlds.  Harris combines personal anecdote, scholarship, and the application of a philosopher's toolkit to examine ""spirituality"" from a rationalist's standpoint.  And while this may not be the first attempt at this reconciliation, certainly no one had done it quite the same way.Terry Boothman"
"I love Sam Harris and this book is very easy to read as he keeps your interest with his writing style.  He explains that even though we can all share and find wisdom in each other's religions, we son't necessarily need the baggage all religions bring to the table insisting they are the one true religion.  Everyone can find common ground for morals and ethics to be shared by all, and it does not need to be rooted in any particular religious dogma.  There really is no one true religion as every religion begins with the basic premise that they are right and all others are wrong.  The world is a big enough place for us to all co-exist."
"I'm conflicted about this book. I'm a big fan of Sam Harris. His previous books are on my shelves, and I'm pleased to have them there. Maybe I need to re-read ""Waking Up,"" but it just didn't grab me. Maybe it's because I read it on a Kindle, and I'm ambivalent about Kindles. Harris's premise (if I'm not wrong) is that spirituality need not be identified with religion to be valid, that an atheistic spirituality, as oxymoronic as that may sound, is possible. He spends a while exploring Buddhism and his years of studies with gurus, but none of this is really new. Buddhism from its inception has never advocated the necessity of believing in a deity, although if you want to go that route, it's OK with Buddhists. For the last 2,500 years, Buddhism has preached an atheistic spirituality. Harris also spends a while expounding the neurological and psychological effects of meditation. Again, studies for years have shown the benefits of it. When the end of the book arrived, which you can't really anticipate with a Kindle, I was caught up short and left wondering what the point was. I didn't really learn anything that I didn't already know, I'm sorry to say, except the biographical bits. Maybe I'll read it again as a real book and see if my opinion changes."
"An intellectually honest, fascinating, and informative introduction to the nature of consciousness and self-transendence. This book does not provide a comprehensive account of any particular contemplative technique or school of thought. Rather, Harris focuses on introducing readers to the ultimate goal of most spiritual traditions. He explains why this enterprise is worth pursuing and the importance of doing so in a way that does not require subscribing to superstition, religious or otherwise."
This really will change your life. There are a handful of meditative techniques in this book. I've tried one only but the success I've had with it suggests to me that the others will work as well.
"Very good!  Another one of Sam Harris' great works.Mr. Harris is one of the best thinkers I have ever heard regarding theology!  He can cut right through all of the religious false beliefs and myth that people so dearly want to hold on to, and he does it in a factual way that is next to impossible to dispute, unless, of course, you are already deeply indoctrinated into your own preferred religion, then it really doesn't matter what anyone says, because you won't allow yourself to hear them."
"This is one of the best books I've read on spirituality and meditation.  Reading this, along with using Sam's Waking Up app, has been a truly transformational experience.If you have even an inkling of interest in meditation, this is the place to start."
"I've always been weary of the ""I'm spiritual but not religious"" claim‚Äîand I still am for the most part. At the same time, there is so much awe and wonder in the universe‚Äîand it touches you in such a visceral way‚Äîthat it's hard to find language for it. Sam does a brilliant job while creating a fantastic guide to mindfulness and why it's so important. Haven't been this inspired by a book since The God Delusion. Really great stuff."
"A bit too surface level for me. I was looking for a more in-depth look, this is not that book. This book would be great for someone questioning their religion or what other options are out there. BUT if you already think religion is dumb but want the benefits of spirituality, this book is a waste of your time (aka you probably know everything he has to say)."
"Just finished reading this book after buying it two days ago, couldn't put it down. While I've admittedly been a fan of Harris for a long time, reading his books and blog, this is really his crowning achievement. I also believe (or hope?) this book will appeal to a wider audience as well. This reads as if it is the book Harris has always wanted to write. At times deeply personal, the book never wavers from its path towards providing practical advice for exploring the mysteries of consciousness while grounding it in clear and concise explanations of relevant neuroscience, psychology and philosophy. The book is filled with thought experiments and instructions for experiments aimed at simply observing and experiencing your consciousness instead of just thinking about it; a lab manual for you to experiment with consciousness in the laboratory of your own mind. One of the most inspirational and thought (or awareness?) provoking books I've ever read."
"nice product, please with delivery and satisfied with my purchase."
"I really enjoyed and highly recommend this clear, well written secular guide to spiritual experiences."
"Purchased as a gift, my son follows Sam Harris podcast and interviews, However, extremely disappointed in shipping.While this book is a soft cover it was placed on top and bustled around causing a warped front section.  It's differnet when your book has that read well read look and when you are purchasing it as a gift."
"This book fundamentally changed my perspective on life. It's not that Harris writes anything previously unknown, but his ability to articulate the reality of consciousness is unparalleled, particularly with reference to brain functioning."
"I thought this was in interesting book to read and a bit unique as it has the rare combination of spirituality along with a lack of religious overtones preconceptions.  For whatever reason, I just didn't find the book a compelling read."
I was interested in the topics this books covers. I listened to a few of Sam Harris's podcast and they were pretty good however I could not get it to this book. I think that his writing style could use some work but the ideas and philosophies in this book are interesting.
"Being non religious and curious about spirituality is permitted in this book. The path is the investigation of consciousness through meditation as a way to create space between ones' thoughts catching the illusory self who thinks she is the thinker of those thoughts. A very courageous and challenging work by Harris. I enjoyed it and found it precious, but his analogies fell short to represent and convey his ideas ultimately leaving me feeling that the writing was pointing to an experience that I won't understand/get until I experience it. I took it as a work in progress and I truly hope he continues to write on this topic."
Takes spirituality out of spiritual practices and allows you to see the benefits of meditation from a scientific level. Harris does a great of letting the reader see meditation from his scientific view.
"Sam Harris is Sam Harris - and I mean that as a high compliment. Insightful, thoughtful ideas presented in a clear, concise way, using simple and easily accessible language. What's not to like? As long as he keeps writing, I'll keep reading him."
"I know Sam Harris is a smart guy who has had numerous profound experiences and read more books than anyone I know, however, his needlessly pretentious use of academic terms and his inability to get to the point coupled with his mono tone delivery made this book difficult to finish."
"Maybe Chapter 2 and 4 seemed too long, or perhaps I expected more ""tips"". It is not a bad book, and I probably will give another try with other book of the same author, given the importance of this subject and the need of exceptic points of view."
"Not a bad book. Entertaining and made me laugh. However, I found it a little too heavy on Eastern meditation and the author's forays into Tibetian meditation as a young man. I liked some of his other books better, such as ""Letter to a Christian Nation."""
"It's been almost twenty years since I have been practicing meditation. The group to which I belong here in Israel organizes sessions and retreats on Mindfulness Meditation in according to the teachings of the Vietnamese Zen Monk Thich Nhat Hanh from the Plum Village. Unfortunately in this group, as I suppose in many other groups around the world, there are many New Age elements with which I am always having some problems. Therefore I was very much looking forward to Sam Harris' book 'Waking Up.' Besides, I'm a huge fan of Sam Harris - I have read all his books more than once and I have been already acquainted, from his articles and his interventions, about his views on Spirituality and Meditation.So I was very happy when it has been finally published and -Thank you Sam!- I have not been disappointed. Already from the first chapters I've found the book fascinating, refreshing and easy to read. As with his other books, his style is simple and rigorous. He knows how to get to the point and he knows how to argue. The book is a must, not only for secular people who are not acquainted with meditation, but also for veterans in this field -religious or secular.Nevertheless, in my opinion, the expectations created by the subtitle 'A Guide to Spirituality without Religion' have been partially fulfilled. The subtitle would have been more appropriate  without 'A Guide to.' As some other readers have pointed out, I was also expecting to find more details on the kind of techniques he uses for meditation or the insights he learned studying Dzogchen.Anyway, I hope he will continue to deliver us more information on the specifics of his technique. I understand that he is giving some lecture series on this topic and I do hope that they will become available also to people living in other continents."
"Sam Harris, usually a strong critic of religion, begins 'Waking Up' with a decidedly new flavor. Maybe all religion isn‚Äôt the ruin of society, but in fact, contains some important psychological truths. Harris isn‚Äôt asking, however, that one accept those truths on his word or that of any religious leader. Perhaps there is a middle path between blindly following religion and avoiding spirituality completely, a path that leads to happiness and fulfillment without engagement in the ceaseless change of our minds and the world. Harris suggests a rational definition of spirituality: deepening the understanding of what we call ‚ÄúI‚Äù , and recognizing what we call ‚Äúself‚Äù as an illusion, in a way that doesn‚Äôt require acceptance of any irrational religious premises.This definition of spirituality presents a fascinating possibility of carving out a functional space between religion and science, geared towards the well-being of humans. This space, Harris points out, already exists, but only in ways that can be categorized as ‚Äúpseudo-science‚Äù or ‚Äúpseudo-religion‚Äù. Harris, for example, dedicated thirteen pages to the cause of debunking the fraudulent claims of Dr. Eben Alexander, a Virginia neurosurgeon who authored a #1 New York Times best-seller on his Near-Death Experience (NDE) in 2012, titled Proof of Heaven. Harris‚Äô comical review of the story leaves one laughing out loud at the resemblance of Alexander‚Äôs experience to that of a DMT user‚Äôs experience. Could it have been that Alexander simply experienced a surge of DMT, a chemical that already exists in the brain as a neurotransmitter? Harris' take on Alexander's story was refreshing.Also valuable in this book is the way Sam Harris examines the science behind consciousness. There is no physical location in the body where consciousness resides, even in the brain. In fact, Harris points out that those who have had their corpus callosum (the connecter between the two halves of the brain) severed in surgery actually experience a duality of mind, because the two hemispheres operate independently. We all have this duality, but are normally fooled by the communication of the corpus callosum into thinking that our consciousness resides in a unified brain. Sam Harris proves that this ‚Äòconsciousness‚Äô can be divided in two. So, is someone who has undergone this surgery, not conscious anymore? Not at all. The concept of a soul ‚Äúarises from the feeling that our subjectivity has a unity, simplicity, and integrity, that must somehow transcend the biochemical wheelworks of the body. But the spilt-brain phenomenon proves that our subjectivity can quite literally be sliced in two‚Äù (page 70). Lack of unity in the brain, suggests the lack of a human soul.As much as we may feel like a self, there is no way to pinpoint the location of this being in our bodies. It‚Äôs not in the right or left hemisphere of our brains, so where can it be? We don‚Äôt know. Sam Harris says peace can be achieved by searching for this through meditation, because one will only find what he calls the intrinsic selflessness of consciousness. Waking Up includes a chapter on meditation, but Harris doesn‚Äôt go on and on about the scientifically proven health and emotional benefits of practice. Those statistics can be read elsewhere. He does explain the benefits of finding good meditation instruction. Harris himself prefers a brand of Zen Buddhism called Dzogchen, and himself studied with Tulku Urgyen. He favors this style of practice because there are direct, empirical instructions aimed at helping one glimpse the true nature of the self. Harris, however, doesn‚Äôt explain what experiencing this true nature feels like. He writes that one must experience it for oneself, and encourages the reader to try it, including interspersed instructional sections titled, ‚ÄúHow to Meditate‚Äù, and ‚ÄúLook for Your Head‚Äù. These sections might seem a cheap addition if not backed up by the great wealth of Harris‚Äô knowledge in neuroscience.Sam Harris repeatedly warns the reader about the danger of taking advice from a ‚Äòfradulent‚Äô spiritual guru, or anyone who asks one to accept irrational premises about the self or the nature of reality. He also encourages one to try meditation practices for oneself before endorsing it as effective. His biggest warning is that some of the worst religious ideas in our society will continue to thrive until we can develop rational spirituality. The human mind is the most complex expression of reality, and Harris invites everyone who has not contemplated this to open their eyes and recognize the ‚Äòsomething‚Äô in them, that, despite all faults, is completely pristine (page 206). If you're at all interested in what Harris has to say about religion, you'll find this book fascinating."
"It is a bit of a departure from the usual books by Sam Harris. I just finished reading it and it took me a long time, mostly because all of the thinking I had to do to understand the meaning of what he writes. At times I wished he was more direct and less metaphors, but I guess it is not easy to describe consciousness and selflessness."
A path to spirituality that makes sense. Harris walks a thin line in a good way to treat a topic that science can not fully embrace in a way that makes sense. Read it if you are embarking in the project of meditation.
"Over the past decade, Sam Harris has educated his audiences about the dangers of religious dogmatism, the necessity of science-based morality, the destructiveness of lying, and the illusion of free will. Now Sam adds one of the most critical blows against religion and new age nonsense by showing his readers how spirituality and meditation can be used to achieve self-transcendance and even inform science about the way the human mind works.I think this book and ""The Moral Landscape"" will be Sam's most lasting legacies to future secular societies. FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY!!!"
"Here Sam does a great job challenging atheists to re-exam what they believe about spirituality.  He's making the case that at least one form of spirituality, the one promoted and practiced by many of the world's greatest sages and mystics, is worth examining given the remarkable results one can realize after seriously practicing meditation/contemplation."
"I had a difficult time rating this book. In truth, I thoroughly enjoyed reading the entire book. I thought that the content was articulated well, and the subject matter was fascinating. Based on that alone, I think it deserves five stars, but there's more...One of the unfortunate problems is that the book is seething with stereotypical arrogant atheism. I believe it's even addressed at the beginning. I like the writing style, but the overboard assertions seem a bit much. While I think he explained his views well, there were several instances where I read almost blatantly pretentious statements in regards to those that have any differing views, and although he clearly states that all religion is practiced by the delusional,  it's obvious that there's a bit of favoritism towards Eastern religions. I am not a religious person, but I am aware that the scientifically proven benefits of meditation have also been proven beneficial in western religions through prayer. It seems then the author is, after all, promoting a dogmatic view of selfless transcendental consciousness using specifically Eastern religious philosophy.Another problem I find is the extensive attempt to ""debunk"" the Eben Alexander book. His ideas as a generality would've been more appropriate.  Even if he felt that systematically reviewing Alexander's book was integral to his message,  then addressing his actual arguments outlined in his book would've been more convincing. It seemed almost hostile, and it's interesting that he finds no intriguing scientific data on that subject. Similarly,  the Reynolds case has been extensively covered, and there are plenty of compelling facts that were left out of his analysis.Finally,  I suppose I agree with some reviewers regarding his love affair for psychedelic drugs. Recommending that acid and ecstasy be on everyone's bucket list doesn't seem like good advice. Although,  I do see the benefits in continuing research into their relationship with the brain.I certainly can see that the ""I"" is still in Sam Harris. The book is full of emotion and, much to his fans disgust, wrapped in a contradicting,  self-deceiving bow.BUT...I honestly still thoroughly enjoyed the book,  and would recommend it."
"I found Waking Up to be a vastly informative book across a wide spectrum of fronts beginning with the fundamental distinctions between the Abrahamic religions and Buddhism and the history of Western engagement with Eastern spirituality to the mysteries of consciousness including the split brain phenomenon, along with a cogent discussion of proper meditative techniques.One of Harris's central premises -- that it's the mind, rather than circumstances themselves, that determines quality of life, and that ""positive habits of mind are best viewed as skills that most of us learn imperfectly""  is at once powerful and inspiring.His examination of the nature of consciousness, in particular, the role of psychedelics in altering consciousness and ""in throwing open the gates"" to the vast fluidity of the mind that eludes our waking consciousness is both fascinating and  refreshingly progressive. The usefulness of such plant-based psychedelics in treating clinical depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, alcohol addiction and easing the pain and anxiety suffered by terminal cancer patients is compelling indeed, adding weight to his concept that a great moral failure of our time is ""we pointlessly ruin the lives of nonviolent drug users by incarcerating them, at enormous expense.""There are so many valuable aspects to the book that render it an important read. It was especially gratifying for me to hear Harris debunk the many notable purveyors of snake oil throughout history; in short, con men in the pursuit of either power, lust, and/or the almighty dollar from Joseph Smith to, most recently, Eden Alexander, including a host of libidinous gurus in between.But perhaps the book's most important message was that in plumbing the vast reserves of the mind through meditation, a great calmness, in hand with a loss of one's sense of self-importance in the scheme of things, is achieved -- a ubiquitous and harmful trait of our kind.If Sam Harris's message that ""every present moment of consciousness is profound,"" were to be widely embraced, the world surely would be a kinder, better place."
"I personally reject all religious beliefs and all notions of supernatural ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù realms, including afterlife, universal creators, and spirits as distinct entities.  As a result when people talk about ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù matters, my eyes instinctively roll upwards.  It‚Äôs part of the human experience to fear death and to long for a sense of purpose, meaning, and belonging.  This is also true for those of us who reject what we see as security blankets that offer false absolutist certitude and easy but flawed (to say the least) answers.  There are those, atheist and theist, who are happy to live a shallow materialist existence, and that‚Äôs fine for them.  For those of us who want to pursue further into these questions, Sam Harris presents ideas about how one might steer a path to make use of the useful aspects of various traditions, without drinking of the religious Koolaid.  Many atheists might mock the mere use of the term ‚Äúspirituality‚Äù, but there actually isn‚Äôt a better word in these English language to tie in these concerns.  John C. Lilly in his ‚ÄúCenter of the Cyclone‚Äù uses the term ‚Äúpsychonautics‚Äù to describe his exploration of mental states, but that doesn‚Äôt include the philoshophical concerns about seeking meaning, connection and a moral/virtuous life.Sam Harris suggests some ways to separate this from the religous or New Age hocus pocus, and presents some potential pittfalls to avoid.  I do not interpret anything in this book as suggesting that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù book with definitive answers, but as a description of his own journey and his thoughts on the topic.Some critiques suggest that the various sections do not ultimately tie in to a cohesive conclusion, and they may be right.  For me this is not a self-help guide, but rather a well-thought effort to tie together ideas which had been of interest to me for a long time.  As such it‚Äôs valuable food for thought and a worthwhile read."
"I enjoyed this book so much I bought the audible whisper sinc companion.  Sam Harris gives great detail to how the mind works undermeditation and as an atheist he has changed my perspective on the advantages of such practice.  I enjoy listening to him read the bookas well, he has a very calm, clear, articulate voice.  I recommend Waking Up by Sam Harris to everyone."
"I've been quite literally waiting for Sam Harris to write this book since I read The End of Faith (the end of which alluded to the central argument of Waking Up, and it was tantalizing to me for a number of reasons), and I am not disappointed now that I have read it. As a nonreligious person with (1) a worldview that has been carefully built around scientific skepticism, and (2) a keen and growing interest in what certain types of experience can reveal about consciousness, I found that the premise of this book both resonated deeply with my interests and personal experiences, and that Harris' methods of exploring that premise upheld the highest standards of evidence and reason. In other words, I found it both deeply interesting, and intellectually satisfying.For me, and probably for many others, the value of Waking Up is partially in the evidence being reviewed (in this case, about the neural underpinnings of conscious experience), but it is primarily in the way that that evidence is being organized into clear and straightforward arguments, and simple--if not easy--applications of this knowledge (in this case, using our most current scientific knowledge of the mind to improve our internal and social lives). I have come away from many of his books with this same thought. The End of Faith, for instance, didn't necessarily introduce a lot of facts that were new to me. Neither did Free Will or Lying, and neither does Waking Up, as psychological science is my career. However, this doesn't even slightly diminish the value of any of these works. I came away from each of these books--and perhaps Waking Up most profoundly--with something indispensable: a clarity of thought and a way of organizing and using my knowledge in novel and important ways. Harris draws connections and articulates arguments with an incisiveness that few have mastered, and I have gained immensely from watching him do this.I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in self-transcendence, spirituality, etc, and who has the gnawing sense that the experiential phenomena that have historically clustered around these terms can be understood in a secular way. This book will offer the necessary tools to tie together strings of thought that might otherwise remain unraveled, and illuminate practical paths toward more fulfilling modes of experience."
"Sam Harris is right of course: you can learn to experience consciousness in a very different manner. But I didn't get the reason why I would do it. I am not keen to spend months of meditative training to have a different experience, my current one is perfectly suitable to me. Maybe some people are unhappy, and they need these other experiences to surmount the unhappiness, but I couldn't' see the point for me."
Fantastic book that everyone should read
"I never thought I would find myself laughing out loud on a book about the science and philosophy of consciousness, but here I am, having to pause to collect myself before I keep reading, because of the bolts of humor that are woven into this masterful tapestry of intellectual inquiry.  It is not that this book is one belly laugh after another, but Mr. Harris often finds the humor in self-discovery and is extremely efficient at shining a light on it in the midst of an otherwise serious probing on the subject of the self.  It is as about as smart as a book can be on this topic without meandering into tedium.I am also glad Mr Harris did not take the advice of the Buddhist fable he references about the man with an arrow in his chest and the penchant people have over-thinking a situation in which the remedy requires action and not more tangential detail.  I am very happy he went into the detail here because it was absolutely fascinating and I am better for it.  He has processed a massive amount of science and blended it with the relatively insoluble notion of consciousness and produced something that is not only meaningful but thrilling in its own way to read. He is very adept at balancing the transfer of information and insight while maintaining interest.  Basically, he never lost me because I was too excited to read what came next."
"I started this book with high hopes. The first chapter was spent with Harris feverishly protecting his atheistic credentials, probably trying to assure that readers knew he was not giving in to those from Western religious views, because he was trying to tackle trying to share his experience of what he was calling a 'spiritual' experience. I wish he had used the time to tell me about his experience, giving me more examples and details from his experience that helped him want to write about this. Unfortunately, my high expectations for a Sam Harris treatment were way to high and the book seemed cobbled together, not of a kind of his earlier work. His desire to convince the reader that there really is no 'self' per se but instead that we are simply processors of information that passes to our brains via our sense organs seemed more an appeal to trust his experience. His appeal to those who have practiced meditation as taught by Indian 'masters' over many years, seemed more like his religious belief to which he was committed or else it may just have been a justification for spending a long time listening to the teachings of the 'gurus' who harangued him. I was left totally unconvinced about his arguments and disappointed for having spent the time trying to follow his train of thought."
"This a good introduction to mediation and its benefits, without any of the woo woo that comes with pretty every other book on meditation out there. That said, there's really nothing here that's terribly original or controversial, unlike Harris' other books. I'm sure he knows that and it seems like his goal is merely to put meditation into the conversation of the mainstream rationalist community."
"Amazing read. Portions of the book were difficult to cognitively absorb, but the remainder describes exactly what I have never been able to state clearly for myself."
"Sam Harris makes a strong case for being open to accumulated wisdom and, with a healthy dose of scepticism, goes on to explain why meditation practice seems like a good place to start filling the void of spiritualism in a secular world view. Adherents to other world views may find this book very upsetting but this should not stop all of us from having a science-based conversation on the role of spirituality in modern life as we know it!"
I expected some gentle use from a book in Good condition. But the book is distractedly marked up.....
"This is an extraordinarily unique spiritual book.Written by someone who has both deep experience and practice in esoteric spiritual traditions, AND is a published neuroscientist and skeptic, Waking Up is an examination of the human spiritual predicament, from both psychological and scientific perspective. The aim of the book is to give a completely rational and fact-based grounding for understanding the spiritual predicament and creating the spiritual life.Harris begins with an examination of the kinds of experiences that are reported in spiritual testimonies, and the problem which spiritual practice is aimed at solving: how are we to be happy now, given that most of what we do is aimed at being happy in the future? When we finally get everything we want, what will we do then? Or rather, how do we be happy when we can't get what we want? Spiritual practice is the answer to this question : using one's attention to look for a source of happiness that is intrinsic to consciousness in the present, and cultivating the states of mind which maximize that source.Harris takes his cues from the Easter traditions of Advaita Vedanta Hinduism and Buddhism, especially Dzogchen. Unlike most spiritual books, Harris doesn't give long discourses on the nature of meditation. He confines his instructions for spiritual inquiry to just 4 short, bracketed instruction blocks. Two of these (the 'beyond dualism' instruction, and the 'headless way' instruction), I had never heard of before, despite reading many Eastern spiritual books.The book is well worth your time and money. 5/5Be sure to notice that Harris has left his spiritual instruction rather understated and short. This seems quite intentional on his part. Many times, a seeker will pick up a book, and read page after page of text, hoping for a simple instruction to take them to a higher place of subjective understanding. Harris has made it so no such textual hunting need be done. It's all written out in plain sight.Open your eyes and see."
"Interesting view in terms of how the brain works and how people have traditionally viewed consciousness, self and the mind.  I sometimes got lost in the more technical parts of the book.  In the end, presence and awareness of thought are paramount."
"This is a must-read for any secular Buddhist or atheist that has a mindfulness meditation practice.  In fact, it's a must-read for anyone that is interested in mindfulness meditation but doesn't want any part of the faith-based garbage that is commonly attached to it.  I've been a Sam Harris fan for many years, but I never knew that he practiced mindfulness.  A clear and insightful book, just as his others have been."
"I have read Sam Harris and was somewhat disappointed in this book.  It seemed a bit repetitious and overly wordy.  There were some good moments and good points made but I found it to be less well organized than ""The End Of Faith"" and perhaps too personal on some levels.  I think he could have said the same things in a simpler form and with fewer words."
"One of the best and most impactful book I have ever read. Sam Harris is a artist with the english language and his intelligence oozes off the pages of this book (and anything else he has written). The topics of consciousness, spirituality, science and religion, and how they overlap, is something you would expect to be heavy and hard to read, but Harris does a masterful job in Waking Up. Parts of this book are a little hard to read and require 2 or maybe even 3 re-reads to fully understand. There are paragraphs that I re-read several times before I fully understood just how profound the material is. If you have any interest at all in mindfulness or meditation, this book is a must read. Harris tackles various parts of the subject matter and is thorough in his analysis.All in all, I would highly recommend this book. It is extremely well written, very interesting and can have a real and lasting impact on you."
"""Waking Up"" is one part curious, one part unnecessary, and one part incredibly provocative. The first part is worth 3 or 4 stars, the second 2 or 3, and the final a solid 5. I am absolutely fascinated with the implications of findings such as the split-brain experiment, the results of which I vividly remember encountering for the first time just last year while reading Michio Kaku's ""Future of the Mind."" Michio's angle was focused on technological ways of leveraging this phenomenon while Harris is chiefly concerned with the philosophical ramifications of such findings, namely: is consciousness irreducible if it is divisible?The entirety of chapters 2 and 3‚Äî'The Mystery of Consciousness' and 'The Riddle of the Self,' respectively‚Äîare worth the price of the book in my mind. I think my subconscious just slipped in a joke about consciousness, actually. The discourses on spirituality aren't insightful or helpful save for a few zingers and well put thoughts. The drug related portion of the last chapter is another curiosity worth discussion. But, once more, all praise has to flow back to chapters 2 and 3‚Äîconsciousness and the self.For anyone who hasn't heard of the split-brain experiment or read about it in much capacity I'd highly recommend checking this out. Similarly, those who are simply riveted by the idea that there are n-minds residing within your single skull and what sort of implications that may or may not have for the assumptions we all carry around in our daily lives related to the feeling of ""I"" this would be a great pleasure for you to read.If this all sounds whack, inconsequential, or somehow boring then go ahead and skip over this one. I'm sure it will be easy to find a poorly written teen melodrama set in a dystopian future."
"Sam Harris has combined his expertise in neuroscience and extensive experience as a meditation practitioner to provide rational and practical reasons for self inquiry, and a framework for how to do it. Unlike most mediation literature, Waking Up is written in an accessible way and avoids the excessive esoteric jargon used by many authors in this field.I have read dozens of book on meditation and buddhism, and Waking Up is one of the best.If you are interested in exploring the mind and learning fundamental techniques of self-inquiry, look no further.A brilliant book!"
Love it
"A very good guide to meditation, from an objective view. Harris is a serious, clear and easy to follow scientific with wide profound experience as spiritual seeker. The book is a first step on meditation, for those interested in a non religious option. His personal account is direct and honest. The book has a huge amount of valuable notes a very useful index."
"I really enjoyed this read! Great book, worth the price."
It will help remove some of the fear of questioning religious beliefs and come to a better way of understanding reality.
I found this book very timely!  In my search for a spiritual path over the past 3 years I had honed in on Buddhist Theravadism (specifically the Mahasi Sayadaw approach) as the most promising available.  I am attending my first 10 day silent retreat at IMS in the spring.  Based on my research this path appears rather daunting as it could take more than a decade to obtain advanced attainments.  I was excited to hear from Sam that Dzogchen may be a faster approach to dissolve the illusion of the Self!  Now to find a good teacher.  The sons of Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche seem to be wandering Northern India and not teaching at the moment!  Thanks Sam!
A thoughtful and enlightening discussion of spirituality delivered concisely by a keen observer of the human condition.  Science and spirituality need not be at odds if the two are clearly defined.  Neuroscience has made great strides in understanding the functioning of the brain and thoughtful people continue to debate the nature of mind.  Mindfulness and a meditative approach to what is known scientifically can enhance a spirituality that can be empirically derived without the dogma of religious traditions to impede its progress.
Always liked his writing.  He writes clearly and adheres closely to what is known and clearly delineates this from speculation.
"Really great book and worth the read.  I have some mild differences of opinion with the author but that makes this book all the more flavorful !!  If you are into religion/spirituality/consciousness at all, this is a must read.  Agree or not, very thought provoking and well reasoned."
Overall I really like this book. It did get a bit slow in parts that felt like a review of my cognitive psychology class and I  wasn't always sure why the information was relevant to the broader topic. But in the end I enjoyed the scientific perspective and feel compelled to reread A Variety of Religious Experiences by William James
Interesting Book for anyone working on their Spiritual Life. Spiritual counsel from a vocal critic of religion might seem unwise but it is clear that Mr. Harris has a first rate mind and his thoughts toward the evils of religion have came from deep and lengthy consideration.  He has spent his life on a spiritual quest; who better to to advocate Atheism.
"Excellent first chapter followed by interesting (although not extraordinary) chapters on consciousness, the self, charlatans, and drugs. Overall a short, worthwhile primer on Eastern thought, meditation, and the exploration of self... although doesn't quite live up to its billing as a 'Guide to Spirituality Without Religion.'"
"Insightful. Very informative and entertaining. Consider this to be opening Pandora‚Äôs Box. Then go read Sam Harris‚Äôs book, Free Will."
"Sam Harris has written books on ethics, religion, atheism and is known for founding Project Reason, a group that debates science and secular values. He continues in that vein with his newest book, ‚ÄúWaking Up.‚Äù  From New Age mysticism, near death experiences, gurus of all stripes, few are spared his critical eye, including The Dalai Lama.  He finds little to embrace in institutionalized religions, including Buddhism.  Disputatious but not  negative-- its often a fun read.  But virtually all his positive attention deals with the concept of awareness and the importance he places on loosening the grip of Self from our perception of reality. The book also roughly chronicles his lifelong pursuit of the enlightened state of being starting with a solo wilderness trip at 16, an Ecstasy trip at 20, living through years of multiple hallucinogenics and then later, in month-long silent retreats with renowned teachers.  He is zealous.  His pursuit of a rational basis for spirituality is the primary focus but along the way he offers interesting discussions on the nature of consciousness, spirituality, and various personalities and practices of meditation.From his published works on philosophy, ethics, religion and an armload of degrees he seems well qualified to render judgments on his subject, and he doesn't disappoint. After throwing jabs at every religious practice-- almost, he zeroes in on the simple, but profound observation: we are not a Self looking out at the world through the eyes in our head, rather we are consciousness itself.  From his perspective meditation is a practice which, by breaking down identification with thought, reveals pure consciousness not constrained by thoughts.  This jibes with other Buddhist texts and the idea sounds simple, but it is not easy in practice.Harris has ruffled many feathers with his broadsides and critiques and of anyone he sees guilty of intellectual dishonesty.  Even in this current work he has disappointed some Atheists who think that he has dropped his atheist cape by embracing a form of Buddhist meditation.  The strength of the book comes from his low key style and a 'see if you agree with this idea...' approach to selling you on his ideas. The importance of selflessness is not his idea-- its a core Buddhist teaching-- but Harris fleshes out the implications of that with great clarity.  This book is a big YES on many fronts and I came away impressed with his pointing out  these simple ideas. Highly Recommended for Buddhists, Atheists, and those of us who fall anywhere in between."
An extraordinary and well researched read. Sam Harris is an enjoyable and entertaining writer who has spend his lifetime searching for true reality and his insights are readily available here.
"In ""Waking Up"", Sam Harris shares some amazing and important insights into the human mind and consciousness itself. If you approach this book with an open mind, it just might change your life. I think many religious people might even benefit from reading this book."
Not a great book but has some interesting information about brain functions and the effect of meditation on the brain. Outlines some meditation techniques. It has a huge bibliography and a thorough index with links to related pages.
A great piece of literature for skeptic people like myself who don‚Äôt like mixing new age thoughts with spirituality
"Amazing, life-changing book.  Will enhance your meditation practice too"
"Sam Harris is an interesting character on the scene between ""evidence vs faith"" based mind-states. He is touted as an Atheist, a human secularist and his morality is apparent when you read one of his lesser known works ""Lying.""  I generally believe he is trying to help create a world he would like to live in. He makes no bones about religion as being one of societal's biggest ills so it is no small wonder he draws a lot of fire. His issues appear mostly to be with Western Religions, and makes a distinction between Eastern Mysticisms (Advaita Vedanta, certain sects of Buddhism) as being free of the western problems he so passionately rails against. He spends a good time pointing out the human frailities of certain teachers and their abuse regardless of where they fall on the east/west continuum. He is more forgiving to ones whose breaches of power seem less consequential.. I believe Harris is a true seeker of altered consciousness and the benefits of meditation. I believe he is important in pointing out how it can help the human condition. It must be difficult to be constantly defending yourself against the big-wigs and bigotry of the religious groups, while trying to bring a message of transcendence that can be measured scientifically and not be embraced by the skeptics either. I enjoyed a great deal of this book and believe one can gain lot out of it. It was difficult for me to get passed his judgement of others in statements such as ""Frank Lloyd Wright once declared Gurdjieff ""the greatest man on earth"" Coming from a narcissist of Wright's character...""Much is known about FLW's strange behaviors and I believe Harris is using this to validate his point about Gurdjieff being a sham and huckster, but it comes off more a character assassination  to me.. Gurdjieff is perceived by many as a gifted charlatan, Wright is perceived as self-absorbed by the history books, yet Harris himself takes a lot of criticism in the present. I wonder if there is a less judgmental why for Harris to make the same points. He uses Koestler's criticism of traditional hatha yogis (and I believe these criticisms to be valid) but chooses to not include any of modern yogas advancements giving an instant dismissal to yoga in general as I'd guess a matter of expediency (there are a lot of hucksters in the yoga world and I'm guessing he's choosing not to include the controversies perhaps to keep it simple and not stray too far from his point). I wonder what a panel comprised of Sam Harris, Robert Sapolsky (another humanistic Atheist) Dan Siegal, Richard Davidson (proponents of mindfulness meditation and ""hard"" scientists in their own right) and Matthieu Ricard ( a scientist who became a buddhist monk) would come up with? I would love to see more congruence.Sam Harris, appears mostly to be one of the good guys, yet it is difficult for me to get fully onboard with him because of his criticism of others. I get it I think, it is  hard to not appear dogmatic when you are fighting dogma.  I still wish he was working more to building coalitions with like minded proponents of life-serving ideals rather than blanketly knocking down the belief systems of others in a seeming way to making his Atheistic views more valid.  He appears uneasy with being touted as an atheist too. Must be lonely at the top of his mountain but I believe good things will come from his isolation, some day...."
"Incredibly interesting. In my opinion this book should have been the prequel to Sam's book ""Free Will"" I feel he did a much better job convincing me of his opinions on the illusions with ""Waking Up"". This has also prompted me to look into meditation techniques that have already given me an improved qualify of life. Very happy with this book and highly recommend it!"
Highly suggested.
"This is a great book and requires slow reading, contemplation, and returning to re-read.  I'm circling back to it a second time now and zeroing in on the chapters The Riddle of the Self, and Meditation, as I'm currently studying the theory of Anatta (No Soul or No Self) and recalled those chapters from the first read-through.  I find it easier to use the word ""soul"" instead of ""self"" in order to better understand the concept and Harris' careful outline and explanations, in which he tries to help the reader understand there is ""no soul"" (or no self).  Any atheist can be interested in these spiritual teachings as they are basically atheistic, really, in teaching us that we are made up of a ""combination"" of things (skandas), and that the idea that we are just one simple entity (self or soul), is an illusion.  There is no religion in this (or there does not need to be), and that is his point.  He provides ways to obtain this realization:  Meditation, drugs, etc.  He is courageous enough to end the book with a spiritual curiosity that admits, we don't know what consciousness is.  It is the spiritual mystery.  For those interested in more on the theory of anatta, I found the clearest teaching online, a 69 page free booklet called ""No Inner Core:  An Introduction to the Doctrine of Anatta"", by Sayadaw U Silananda.  Reading it can help you circle back to Harris' chapters on The Riddle of the Self, and the chapter on Meditation, and understand them better.  Wonderful and careful writer.  Thanks Sam for showing that Spirituality does not have to be chained to a religion."
"Some books of this nature are presumptuous and difficult to read and understand. I found Waking Up to be easy to read, if not to understand.  To truly grasp what Mr. Harris is getting at takes a lot more reading and study, this book alone is not likely to be a revelation.  But if one has a deep interest in the Self and consciousness it is another interesting perspective and piece of a very large complex puzzle"
Comprehensive coverage but maybe less coverage of drug induced states and more focus upon meditation. techniques would be helpful.  Overall very informative & inspirational.
Wasn‚Äôt the greatest experience reading a book. So much so that i can‚Äôt make myself give examples from the book for everyone‚Äôs sake.
Sam Harris delivers an amazingly articulate perspective in regards to spirituality without religion. This is the third book I have read from Sam Harris and I highly recommend this book as well as his others.
"Interesting book. Dr. Harris is definitely a smart guy and I respect him. Like any other book, take everything in it with a grain of salt. Overall very enjoyable read"
High quality writing and thoughts presented by a brilliant man.
"I'm not gonna slam Sam Harris, I like his writings. Be advised though, that this is not what I would call ""A guide to spirituality without religion."" It seems to be one long promotion of meditation. Would not have paid the Kindle price had I known that."
"A rational, balanced treatment of, for lack of a better term, spirituality, without the religious encrustations. If you have any interest in yourself, consciousness and your brain, read it."
This book took me out of my comfort zone in a really beautiful way. Thanks Sam.
"A good read. It emphasizes that spirituality, charity and good deeds can be emanating from a desire to help others and they can be falsely attributed or, for that matter, can be polluted by religiosity which may not stand to reasoning and can be manipulated easily."
"You (like me) may not feel a need for spirituality of any kind in your life, or maybe you do, either way you'll find this book interesting.Sam Harris is a proponent of meditation and self-discovery, and that's what a good deal of this book has to do with.  As a humanist myself, I never considered spirituality of any real use, especially to science; but Harris makes the case for just that - a scientific undertaking of spirituality.I can't agree or disagree with Harris much on what he presents in this book until I try meditation (among other means) to experience the mental states of which he writes.  I can say it is a concise book, that wastes no time getting to the point and is genuinely interesting."
"Normally I race through Sam‚Äôs books, but this one had some sections with hardcore neuroscience and very subtle philosophy about the self that I really struggled through. The last few chapters were so excellent ‚Äî his demolition of near-death experiences and his discussion of the role of drugs in reaching states of bliss were especially good ‚Äî that I‚Äôm going to have to read this again sooner rather than later. And parts were so mind-blowing that I can‚Äôt stop thinking about them: Like how people who have the two halves of their brains separated will answers questions differently depending upon which side is asked the questions. The hard part for me to get: There is no self, only consciousness. And the book‚Äôs bottom line: Spiritually transcendent states are not unusual among humans; they are natural and can be cultivated with simple, straight-forward steps without recourse to religion (which comes with the baggage of superstition) or drugs (which can cause bad trips or physical problems). Grade: A-"
I must admit that Sam has a lot of guts writing a book like this. Mr. Harris is a public figure who is respected by people who more often then not would chew and spit out concepts like spirituality and practices like meditation. Personally I am still trying to digest this book.Thank you Sam for giving us some insight to your own experience.
"This book mirrors some of my( and others ) thoughts about conscious experience that seems to transcend "" normal reality "" .  The sense that we are connected to something larger than ourselves is consistently connected to religious experience when it is a part of what  human consciousness can obtain and with training such as meditation, actually access with relative ease.  Sam's book is excellent and (as always ) easy to read with no unneeded language.  I'll be giving some copies for holiday presents this year!  That's great, right!"
"I'll be recommending this one for sure! This is the first I've read by Sam Harris, and his ability to build sound arguments and make profound observations about the nature of existence is, as far as I'm aware, unrivaled. I'm about to reread this book, because the ideas within are seriously important. Because of Waking Up, I've realized that I'm not the person I thought I was, and that there are alternatives to feeling constantly subject to the ways of the world. All in all, it was a revolutionary read. Now on to Free Will and Lying!"
"It's very easy in our science center works to be a reductionist. But there is a great deal to be learned from inner experience, and this book does a better job of conveying this than any other I've read."
"Very interesting stuff.  I'd almost say that this is the way spirituality SHOULD be.  I consider myself an agnostic, so I kinda feel like we should live as if there is no God because we shouldn't assume there is one.  I like that this book legitimizes spirituality for atheists and others who wouldn't otherwise go near it."
"If you are thinking about what spiritually can do for you, give this a go. Sam Harris is a non bullsh** kind of guy that gives you the general idea of what spirituality is and how you can make it your own. Cleverly written and very interesting. You won't regret buying this."
"If you are looking for advice on exploring consciousness and spirituality outside of the confines of traditional theology, I highly recommend this book. Eye opening read, that challenged some things that I had previously just assumed and accepted were correct."
I love the way this man writes. He has a gift with words and enough humor to make difficult ideas digestible.
"Despite my very high regard for all I have read or listened to from Sam Harris, I was reluctant to read anything remotely associated with spiritualism. This book has nothing to do with seances or ghosts. He uses the term 'mindfulness' in the book, which is much less evocative of things that go bump in the night, or eternal souls. I thoroughly recommend both the book and the thought trials he suggests. It certainly woke me up - and profoundly so."
This book is insightful regarding meditation and consciousness and how it all works.  I have to admit that some of it was over my head and I will probably need to re read it to really judge it.
"Greatly insightful book, really helps establish the conversation of spirituality and the illusive nature of self without the basis of religious dogma to a newer generation."
"Sam Harris eloquently shows us how we can still be spiritual beings in the modern age without having to embrace ancient religious beliefs.  Loved this book.  It's a myth that you have to believe in some god to have meaningful, ""spiritual"" experiences as a human being."
Good
"Drawing on philosophy, neuroscience, common sense, and his own extensive experience with meditative practice, Harris makes a persuasive case that spirituality need not be restricted to religious practice, but can be a meaningful part of life for people who have a skeptical, scientific, secular outlook."
"Very insightful.  He has addressed many deep issues; peace of mind, happiness, etc. without the use of deities.His directions on mediation are something that I need to do more work with.  Overall, I would highly recommend this book!"
Good reasons to meditate
Enjoying reading it.
"Excellent read. I have this on audio as well. If you've not read any Sam Harris, or seen his youtubes he will make you seriously think. I have even given copies to my friends who teach theology, just to challenge them!"
"A well thought out book.  Based on personal experience,  Harris explains how a non-believer like himself can have spiritual experiences that can't be explained by science, and have nothing to do with religion, i.e. the supernatural.  The illusion of the self chapter was the most challenging and at the same time intriguing.  A great read that will encourage you to explore your mind."
"This book touches on a subject that I feel that the atheist and humanist movements have almost completely overlooked, which is spirituality without belief in God or the supernatural. I would recommend this book to both believers  and non-believers because I think there is ignorance on this subject from both sides and because Mr Harris's writing is both witty and succinct."
Sam Harris does an excellent job of breaking down his theme in a step by step basis.  He opened up my view on spirituality and it's relationship with  meditation and the  levels of consciousness.
"This is a wonderful book that provides a sort of ""unifying theory"" to the secular/spiritual dichotomy, making it seem much less like a dichotomy at all which I'm sure is what he intended. As Harris explains, we don't need to choose one over the other; we can cultivate a sense of awareness, compassion and wonder (Spirituality) without having to claim any sort of faith or religious dogma as our source of inspiration.Many of us have come to the secular worldview through what I would call a ""spiritual quest""; where we cast off our previous belief system and begin to explore others. Maybe I appreciate this book more because, even though I didn't travel to other countries to study with Gurus, I too embraced meditation in an attempt to gain a greater understanding of my mind and the nature of consciousness which eventually resulted in my abandoning religion altogether. I also relied on the teachings of Buddhism to guide me on my quest and, even though Buddhism is considered a religion in the strict sense of the term, I stuck with the empirical teachings and rejected the dogmatic approaches some Buddhists value. However, I believe anyone could benefit from this work regardless of their past, provided they come to it with an open mind and a sincerity in seeking the truth.As in The End of Faith and his other books, Harris's style is clear, concise and understandable. A very enlightening book and joy to read!"
"I gave my man Sam five stars because Waking Up added something more in the quest to determine the danger of dogma that lurks in every belief system. Knowing that you can Devine spirituality without alienating the rest of the world feels right, even if my journey will be sans mushrooms and LSD."
Must read
Fantastic read. This is a gem in understanding spirituality. It has reinforced my beliefs about search for spirituality without dogma but with reason and humanistic outlook. A scientific emphasis on Meditation and journey to a reality beyond physical realm
Exploring what Sam has to say on spirituality was grounding and uplifting. It‚Äôs nice to have a frame of reference on spirituality that gives an honest account of its benefits without trying to sell snake oil.
I found this book to be very insightful. It does an job of introducing the concept ‚ÄúThe Self‚Äù. It also provides an excellent overview of Mindfulness and the role of meditation.
"Great book, especially in times like these."
I did learn a lot about spirituality and consciousness. There were a lot of anecdotes throughout the book to help explain the theory.  In the end too much filler material and not enough content for my liking.
I love this is a great book
A genuine and valuable book demystifying spirituality and simplifying the notion of self-transcendency. It's wonderful to read a book of this nature not only devoid of  mumbo jumbo but rich in insight and honesty. Thanks Sam.
Very useful book that presents a version of spirituality which can be implemented without needing to believe in magic or accept supposedly infallible morals.
A profound book that requires an intense focus to truly get the most out of it. Sam Harris is cerebral!
A must read for anyone that desire to find a deep and meaningful spirituality to their journey in life without dependence on a religion to do so.
"Good viewpoints and references for discussion about the broader view of spirituality. As someone who needs more understanding of possiblities beyond monotheism, I appreciate the continuing efforts of Sam Harris's work to help me understand my own spirituality."
Really enjoyed many points of this book and learned a lot about consciousness and subjectivity. I was intrigued from the beginning and gave my whole attention at each point of the reading. Definitely a must read
"Excellent!!!!  Watch his youtube debates too, he is amazing!  He is single handedly brining about a thought revolution!"
One of the best books I've read recently
Easy to grasp
This is an outstanding read. Thought provoking on almost every page and makes you challenge your assumptions about how and why you perceive the world around you. Can't wait to start putting it into practice.
"Sam Harris attempts to take a broad sweep at a deep and wide subject. He hits some fine points that now need further investigation. Subjectivity and the empirical feelings and emotions seem to tear apart the idea of the ""I"" and the ""ego"" and leaves one standing naked in the stream of just what is."
"Sam Harris has a knack for pointing out what should be obvious, but somehow isn't.  For centuries, religions have had a near monopoly on meditation and other forms of spirituality.  Harris points out that spirituality has little, if anything, to do with faith.  Quite to the contrary, he explains that we can alter our consciousness for the better without believing in God(s), or otherwise holding unscientific beliefs, through meditation.  Harris has extensive experience in meditation, having spent years meditating under the tutelage of various instructors.  Personally, I have never meditated and I do not pretend to follow everything Harris writes.  Yet, I found Waking Up to be a fascinating book and plan to read more on the topic."
"It's as if Sam Harris said to me, "" Let me put all your reading and all your questing thoughts into a reasoned, sequential, entertaining, and dryly humorous form for you."" I finish each of his books with a sense of gratitude."
"This book brings up excellent points about spirituality (the energy) versus religion (the bureaucratization of the energy). Harris has extensive experience as a practitioner of Buddhist meditation techniques, but he always keeps his bulls*** detector on high alert. I really enjoyed reading this book, and, as a skeptic with an open mind, I agree with many of his insights."
"Let me state first that I think the book had a bit more potential than it lived up to, but it is such an important book that I had to give it a full 5 stars to encourage people to buy it. On the positive side, it's so refreshing to see one of the spokesmen of the ""New Atheist"" movement confronting head-on the notion that atheism is just this mechanical, overly logical mindset where an inquisitive nature about the unknown is shunned. Instead, atheism can and should be married with a contemplative, explorative spirit that is willing to admit to ourselves that there are a lot of things that we simply do not and probably will never know or understand, and we should not be closed off to any possibilities. Our consciousness is so incredible and mysterious, and is such a powerful tool for finding inner peace and making the world a better place. Just as we go to the gym for our physical bodies, it is of utmost importance that we ""go to the gym"" for our minds as well...and Harris explains how to do just that, even if it's not communicated as well as I'd like.This is the next step in the evolution of society. I truly believe that we are a sick, a mentally sick, society in great need of some ""cognitive therapy"". Well done, Harris."
"I admire and appreciate everything Sam Harris does.  He may be the most articulate public intellectual today.  His viewpoint is original, his writing is impeccable, and his generosity towards humanity is obvious."
"Sam Harris is my go to guy when I want to feel like achieving more in life.This book however for those times when you are totally concentrated without distractions.  Otherwise you will have to reread time and again to understand the gist.  Or may be I am a little too thick in the head.However interesting read but at times difficult to follow but that can be fixed if you take those headphones out of your ears and stop checking your phone every 5 minutes while reading it.My only qualm is that if the readership of this book is already at an intellectual level to follow it correctly, is there even a need to make a case with them about achieving spirituality without religion?  I think it would be pretty obvious to them that it is possible and is/was done before their respective branch of religion was sent down by their respective God/Gods.But I have been wrong before so give this book a try and find it for yourself."
"Great book! Highly recommended if you want to separate the dogmatic spiritual views; from an agnostic, more practical way of diving into yourself and your self awareness."
In waking up Sam Harris gives the tools and knowledge to understand what we know about consciousness. A scientific and spiritual window into our mind/brain/body experience without religious dogma that gives clarity to what we call the self. Sam demonstrates that glimpses of self transcendence can be possible by anyone simply by understanding what we think of as self doesn't actually exist. I listened to the book well read by Sam.
"If you want to know about meditation without any religious strings attached, this is for you. As long as you don't mind a few tiny jabs that he throws at believers and at the idea of God you will find new and interesting information in this book."
"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. As usual, Harris takes a no nonsense approach to his subject. I don't know of another book or place to find a secular approach to spirituality that rings as true as this. Excellent read!"
"I love Sam Harris, and I was expecting great things from this book. This book is awesome and thought-provoking, but I don't think it accomplishes its purpose. It spends a lot of time exploring the neuroscience of the self, and hardly any to actual spiritual practice. I understand he's a neuroscientist, but he's also a longtime practitioner, and I think he could have done better on that topic since that was the stated purpose of the book.I had some buyer's remorse as soon as I bought this because I thought ""Wait, I already know how to live a spiritual life without religion. I don't need this,"" so when fascinating neuroscience turned out to be the biggest portion of the book I personally benefited more. This book turned out to be exactly what I needed, just not quite what it says it is. Still love Sam Harris though."
Of all the books by Sam Harris I like this one the least. I find it difficult to buy into this stuff about spirituality; especially when he mentions how so many of them are charlatans out to make a buck. If everybody was enlightened and lived contemplative lives who would do the work. All these enlightened folks seem to have their needs ministered by those who worship them. If Buddhism is such a great way to live then why the countries that practice it are not so good at catering to the needs of their populations?
I am leading discussion of this book in a book club at an Episcopalian church. I am confident it will give the attendees a rational and human introduction asceptacism.
Love this book!
product is in condition as described and came on time
"Spirituality put in words, and explained in a way that makes it seem much more possible to achieve. Very interesting points made, with logic behind each."
Sam Harris takes what is an abstract concept for most of us and distills it into consumable pieces.  A must-read before exploring meditation.
"A very well reasoned argument for acknowledging the pull towards spirituality that always resides somewhere in each human being, no matter how jaded."
Terrific book by talented author; non-offensive regardless of one's beliefs (or lack thereof).
"Sam offers a strong case for the value of contemplative practice without depending on religious thinking. His writing is clear, compelling, engaging, and entertaining."
It's great to read some of the background behind Harris' thinking and his own practices. There are valuable insights here and at least one key exercise that you'll likely not have encountered before.
Great book.  Read it.
I couldn't put it down and now I can't wait to read it again!
Good read
"I‚Äôm almost positive that Sam Harris was possessed by the ghost of Alan Watts while in the process of writing this book. Nonetheless, I loved it and can‚Äôt wait for the next big thing Sam Harris puts out into the universe!"
"Harris has written a great conversation starter for dealing with the serious problem of dualism in human culture and religion.  His exploration and expose' of the importance of meditation that he has found within certain traditions within Buddhism offer valuable insight into how our limited world of self can be transcended.  Harris is searching out the path of ""mindfulness"" and states ""What we need to become happier and to make the world a better place is not more pious illusion, but a clearer understanding of the way things are"" (p. 46).  While Harris is seeking the path of the contemplatives he also needs to be more mindful of those who are not religious fundamentalists and see an entirely different dimension and dynamic taking place in such sources as scripture when viewed in the context of evolution and human anthropology.  Thus, 4 stars.  I would like to see Harris continue his quest of mindfulness into Native American traditions, and other Western schools that also dispel the dualism of self/creation.  I also invite Harris and others to read my forthcoming work that will offer a path through the bible that takes one beyond the atheist and fundamentalist reduction of it to mythology and religion."
"Exempting the blog posts I've missed and whatever he was required to write in his schooling, I think I can accurately say that I've read every word Harris has written. As I have read his books I can't help but think that this man is determined to write about all the subjects that I've been concerned about all my life. He's covered religion, lying, free will, and now he's covered spirituality. Unlike all his previous subjects however, I'm not sure what I think of this one.Let me be clear though, I don't mean this as a put down. I think Harris has presented a case for spirituality that is plausible, reasonable, and perhaps the only one that lines up with reality. I only mean to say that, unlike his previous subjects, I've always been skeptical about what Spirituality even is. This was my main motivation for reading this book and Harris didn't disappoint. Even though I read this book merely to learn his view about what spirituality is, he still succeeded in showing me a new perspective and my waking life is improved because of it. This is perhaps the most impressive thing about Harris's new book: In reading this book why might even enlighten ourselves by accident.This book is thick with cerebral quality so you may need to read it multiple times for your mind to fully digest it. For this reason I think you shouldn't be discouraged if you don't think you fully understand it as you read it for the first time. Read it, wait, think about, and read it again when you're ready. As you will find in the book a good spiritual life requires patience. Be patient with yourself in reading this book if you need to. I'm sure the author will soon grace youtube.com with lectures that will help us understand his meaning even better.I loved this book as I have loved all of this good fellow's books. Thank you Sam Harris. I can't wait to see what subject you will illuminate next."
Item arrived on time and as described.  Very pleased.
Harris dives into who we think we are and why that‚Äôs probably not reality. A quick read with a lot packed into every sentence.
AwesomeHe also has audio book on YouTube and is also the reader. Fantastic Book.  Very insightful.
"I found this book to be very informative especially in the area of meditation. The basic functions of the brain were also most enlightening. I highly recommend this book to anyone with a sincere desire to expand their knowledge of ""self""."
"Its always a pleasure to read Sam Harris' work given the clarity and wit of his arguments. He makes a pretty compelling case to decouple the preposterous claims of religious dogma from spirituality. He also shows that that there is much more to consciousness than what we take for granted and that this is worth exploring in the pursuit of happiness. It is not a detailed how-to guide on mindfulness and how to enjoy the spiritual benefits of meditation and in this sense it is something of a disappointment. One gets the impression that the spiritual journey is best undertaken with the aid of an experienced mentor and Sam does a good job of warning the reader about charlatans masquerading as gurus. The world of secular spirituality is nascent and Sam's book leaves one with a strong desire to explore this world further but without a clear roadmap showing the next step. It now makes sense why he felt the need to do a lecture series and one hopes this becomes available to those readers that, like myself, were unable to participate."
Intellectual page turner that kept me in thought every time I put it down. Six more words are required here.
I was interested in finding out more about Sam Harris having been struck by his Moral Landscape. I was not disappointed.
"Modern and rational insights on ancient, primitive, and outdated religious beliefs.  A provocative challenge to firmly held religious superstitions."
"One of my favorite books to read and reread, by one of my FAVORITE people on the Planet.Highly recommended!!!!! üíõ #Lifechanging"
Absolutely great super enjoyed and worth it. Off to read another one.  Will definitely help with meditation practice. Highly recommended
"I've followed Sam Harris for awhile and this latest work from him I've been eagerly anticipating. This book offers a brilliant guide for believers and non-believers alike on the importance of mindfulness and the benefits of practicing mindfulness in our daily lives.If you are serious about practicing mindfulness and becoming a happier, more attentive person, then I highly recommend buying the book, along with viewing his talks on YouTube and reading his posts on his website."
"Sam Harris has his views, and since he is an empiricist, you cannot refute them.One interesting point of discovery for scholars of Mr. Harris's work would be social class,Meaning the people his books appeal to.Mr. Harris may be a brilliant logician, but he does not use the word paradigm. Obviously he has noHead, so he has nothing to peer out of.Yoga starts of storing prana or light, namely celibacy or energy transmutation. To developEnough force to progress rapidly. There are supposedly seven main energy centres or chakras.This is all technique. By the time light reaches the heart chakra and opens it, technique becomesReligion. This is the beginning of miraculous happenings, and yogic attainment.No need to stop at the heart though!I agree with Mr Harris that there is no I or self, however to live at the mercy of pleasure and painIs not necessary, so some conditioning is necessary from a young age. Also there are legalRamifications."
"Do you feel like the rational empirical view of the world is also painful and depressing? Do you think there is some truth to religion, but that most of it is old superstitions and illogical, empirically invalidated dogma?Do you believe the scientific method is great for finding the truth but think ""we are all atoms in a meaningless numerical dance"" is not simply depressing, but wrong in a way you can't articulate?Read this book. You will be glad you did."
Interesting and worthwhile approach - Harris is worth follows ng.
"Awesome and interesting with several educational tips, but it is definitely a book of nonfiction. It is not a fun novel. It is definitely a book to take in chunks."
Sam Harris is amazing and this book reflects his inner intelligence!
"If you are a fan of Sam Harris, this succinct prose on consciousness and other aspects of spirituality will not disappoint. If you are not a fan of Sam Harris you must read this book at your own pace with a great deal of discipline. Being emotionally open to such a very literal book on such a personal topic is extremely difficult. But please give it a chance, and may no excuses or assumption of offense hook you as you read."
"Fast delivery. Great book for those unwilling to encounter meditation, Vedanta, or dzogchen willingly. Important in a climate of religious scientism, tibetophilia, and monotheistic imperialism."
"In concise, crystal clear prose, Harris will at first challenge and then overturn your most basic, fundamental conceptions about consciousness. He argues convincingly that the ""hard problem"" of consciousness is very real, and that the reductionist project will never fully succeed. He points to corpus callosotomy procedures demonstrating the astonishing reality that human consciousness can actually be split into two. He touches on the work of Derek Parfit, showing that our sense of the continuity of personal identity is illusory.That the potential expanse of conscious experience is far vaster than we typically assume is easily proved by the use of psychedelics (Harris urges caution), though what this suggests about consciousness itself is difficult to ascertain.Above all, however, the book's most important passages concern self-transcendence and the true nature of your own existence:The potential for awareness that the self (its thoughts, feelings, intentions, and desires) amounts to mere contents illuminated by the light of consciousness in exactly the same way as everything else; that the self is *not* a subject but an object in consciousness (just like the words you're reading right now); That you are not what you think you are...that you are, in a very real sense, everything you perceive.Harris credibly makes Douglas Hofstadter look deeply foolish when he expounds on Hofstadter's arrogant, churlish dismissal of a detailed account of self-transcendence (by the spiritual teacher Douglas Harding, a man who found a novel way to transcend the self). Any book that can show a brilliant man like Hofstadter for a fool is worth reading. And of course, one only needs a modicum of firsthand experience to prove Hofstadter wrong definitively.This experience of self-transcendence, of turning consciousness in on itself, seeing through the illusion, and (in effect) perceiving reality more clearly lies at the root of many of the world's spiritual traditions. People who were able to do this almost invariably became teachers; the poverty of language and generations of transmission led to organized religions, unsubstantiated spooky claims about the physical world, and gurus who sometimes maliciously exploited the passions of their followers.Harris goes a step further than much of the literature regarding self-transcendence and meditation because he points out that years of intensive meditative practice are not necessary to ""wake up""- that this awareness lies so close to you that it is at the surface of all experience, always available.Considering the stakes (the nature of your own existence), readers are fortunate that Harris is up to the task."
Sam's intriguing view beyond lingering beliefs of ancient civilizations is an interesting and controversial read.
"I became interested in this book after hearing Sam talk about it on the Joe Rogan podcast. I was actually surprised to learn that Sam practices Open Awareness meditation that was taught by the father Yongye Mingyur Rinpoche. My kungfu teacher practices the Tergar method taught by Yongye Mingyur, and I hope to start learning that method in the fall.I really enjoyed the neuroscience and psychology material, but as a theologian interested in teaching about actual spiritual traditions and practices, I greatly enjoyed what Sam has to say regarding ""spiritual practice."""
"Refreshing point of view and nice to hear that Eastern approaches and benefits can be had without all the ""voodoo"".Especially valuable for agnostics and atheists that dispel any notion of spirituality."
Sam Harris is clear to state his points without any lack of reason or mysterious nature. He brilliantly address how we can properly gain benefits of meditation and the reality that self is an illusion without religion. Be open to this book and it will bring positive change to your life
"A must have, a must read. You will understand and adopt a different perspective to everything."
Sam Harris has a mind that needs creative release. He seems to fill pages with such unique knowledge and with an intriguing depth at a constant pace. Loved this book and his take on spirituality.
"I appreciate Sam Harris's attempt to create a secular version of spirituality that can improve people's lives.  It is my own opinion that the future of religion and spirituality should move towards a secular context: specifically, all the truths of life and reality should be approachable and experiential to any person regardless of their wordview.  The main point Harris keeps hammering throughout the entire book is that the ""self"" or ""I"" is an illusion that must be transcended.  However, in my opinion, Harris fails to explain why this realization should be liberating and help people to be happier and suffer less.  Harris is correct that when one tries to search for a permanent, core, changeless ""self"" or ""I"" it cannot be found.  Yet beings and persons nevertheless exist (as complex phenomena that depend upon many dynamic factors), and Harris doesnt deny this.  We all have the sense that we are sentient beings who wish to be happy and not suffer.  Yet, in my opinion, Harris's book offers little substantial practical import as how to be happier and suffer less.  To simply tell a confused, hurting, and suffering being that their ""self"" or ""I"" doesnt exist isn't going to help at all, in fact, it will likely only add to their confusion and misery. In conclusion, if one is looking for a secular spirituality to help them live a happier, more meaningful life, I recommend looking elsewhere. In particular, I highly recommend Jon Kabat Zin's Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction program (fully presented in his book Full Catastrophe Living, or check out his book Wherever you go there you are for mindfulness within a more spiritual but still secular context.)  The MBSR program has decades of scientific studies that demonstrate its beneficial impact on people's well-being.  In contrast, there is little to no scientific evidence showing how Harris's major claim that the realization ""the self is an illusion"" can improve your life.  In fact, modern psychology asserts that a basic level of self-knowledge, self-identity, or view of one's own ""person-hood"" is required for living a healthy, sane, functional life."
Insightful read.
I like that this book takes into account opposing thoughts and digs like a shovel onto the human mind instead of religious aspects.
"Sam has the ability to explain with such clarity. I feel like my understanding of meditation is greatly improved. I love the emphasis on testable, verifiable practices that can be taken regardless of religion or lack of it."
Was hoping for more specific instruction on meditation instead of a book mostly about the obvious flaws with the religious frameworks behind most spiritual practices.
Brilliant! It's Sam Harris - what do you expect?
"The least instructional instruction manual I have ever read. I found the book intriguing and a good read, but to be honest the principle take-away I got from the book is the desire to try LSD..."
"Sam Harris's mind is all to familiar sometimes, this insightful book is an excellent supplement to anyone seeking spiritual balance.To me it was less of a guide and more just affirmation of my own feelings.  Spiritual experience is not exclusive to religion."
"An excellent read. Insightful, instructive, and full of fascinating observations about the neurological and the ""spiritual"" from a no non-sense perspective that doesn't rely on new age rhetoric."
So far so good.  Only 80 pages into the book.  Harris is a great thinker and communicator and is as genuine as they come.
"Sam Harris is great. Always exceptionally articulate and provocative. This book primarily discusses his tropes into meditation and eastern religions. I've always been a fan of such things, so this book was right up my alley."
Harris does a great job of giving the reader a neurobiological understanding of consciousness so that his arguments against religion and support for spirituality are easier to understand. I greatly enjoyed this book.
"I really don't know, or have sufficient evidence whether what Sam Harris claims here work. But the way he conveys his proposition is indeed compelling, supported, scientific and yet very entertaining. I was quite skeptical about some of the topics covered here, but I'm trying now. Let's see."
"A concise, interesting and compelling treatise on how to think about spirituality as something that everyone has access to and should be paying attention to."
"Great insights on every page, but ... half as long would have been twice as good."
"Sam Harris' Waking Up is a thoughtful, enjoyable, well-written book that accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do: make the case that one can reject traditional organized religious belief as irrational, dangerously divisive, and providing false comfort while still pursuing ""spiritual"" goals.This is a book that is certain to be controversial, like all of Harris' work. He tackles complex and sensitive subjects, and anyone who has read all of his writing is bound to be displeased by something that he has written (personally, it is his unflinching support for Israel and his questionable position on guns). Still, this is a bright, reasonable, talented writer and mind who is rewarding to engage with. A viewing of any of his interviews, debates or lectures will show that he has a gift for calm, logical discourse.Many of the criticisms of the book seem to be ad hominem attacks on Harris' character. These can be easily dismissed. What is ironic is that people who feel the need to lash out at an author whose opinions make them uncomfortable could probably benefit from the message that he is trying to get across here! I find it strange when Harris is accused of arrogance, when he repeatedly admits in the book that he is far from enlightened.It is important to recognize what this book is not. It is not a guide for how to meditate (plenty of these exist already), it is not an academic study of Buddhism (ditto), nor is it a polemic. It is an attempt to explore the possibility of having a spiritual life (a term Harris carefully qualifies) while remaining skeptical of unnecessary religious dogma, superstition, and charlatans - all too common in the spiritual marketplace.I will not attempt to summarize its contents, but simply recommend this book to anyone who is atheist, agnostic, or simply interested and open-minded about different views on spirituality. This is the kind of book that I would have loved a few years ago when I was letting go of my Catholic upbringing but feeling depressed by the spiritual void left behind. If you have already made up your mind that the ""New Atheists"" are evil fools, best to avoid (unless you feel compelled to read books that make you angry, in which case, I would gently suggest that you ask yourself why?)I would also recommend reading Alan Watts - especially ""The Wisdom of Insecurity"" and ""The Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are."" Like Harris, he articulates key elements of Eastern spirituality, and demystifies mysticism in a way that can make a skeptic realize that there may be something to certain ""religious beliefs"" that might otherwise be dismissed out of hand. If you come away from the book interested in meditation, I recommend ""Mindfulness in Plain English"" by Bhante Gunaratana. Best wishes to you all in improving your lives and finding true happiness."
Worth reading to be informed of his views
I spent quite a bit of time with this one. it was deep and brought up many points I'd never even considered. highly recommended.
Good for people of any religion or of no religion.
"Harris is perhaps our best know atheist and is author of several books including ‚ÄúThe End of Faith.‚Äù In his new book ‚ÄúWaking Up,‚Äù Harris deals with the issue of spirituality for the secular person‚Äîhow do people without a belief in the supernatural obtain the benefits of transcendence, wholeness, and peace that are usually associated with religious practice? How do we understand that spirituality comes from within us, not from without? Harris brings his usual thoughtfulness and clarity to the topic, and the book will be of interest to both religious and nonreligious folks who want to think seriously about the matter."
"Excellent, excellent book by a brilliant guy."
"Very quick delivery. I liked the book, not great, but a good read. A bit dry in some spots but very informative. Surprisingly entertaining at times."
"Exceptionally informative book about not only the nature on consciousness in scientific terms but also rational about what is available NOW for people seeking enlightenment free of liberal Christian poison or guru dogma. Many who have been avid fans of Sam for his unparalleled criticism of Christianity will want to whine but this is just Sams necessary next step in trying to avail the public of intelligently accepting our automation.He is ruthlessly trying to make common knowledge of the fact that we're automated and without a ""self:"" that our consciousness is a rolling cylindrical mirror that is too often mistaken for all the motives, emotions and behavior it happens to be reflecting. Truthfully, he claims; it can be wiped clean of these disturbing thoughts and even the feeling of self.Waking Up is an appropriate title and should be mandatory reading for anyone who has foolishly prayed to a god that doesn't exist."
"Sam Harris presents simple instructions on how to meditate early on in Waking Up. The bulk of the book is an argument for practicing meditation, and in this he covers all the bases. The final chapters seem a bit tacked on, but do have some tangential relevance to the main thesis. Not a masterwork, but a practical introduction for spiritual neophytes."
Great read
A eye opening and very well written book. Sam Harris presents is theories in a clear and eloquent manner.
"It‚Äôs been a lonesome corner for those who want a real culture of non-religiosity, non-New Age fashion, non-scientific and atheistic piety, non-philosophical pretension, but possessing an intelligence that is decidedly more evolved than the choices generally available. I won‚Äôt say that Waking Up is the answer we‚Äôve been waiting for, but it‚Äôs a beautifully written book and a firm stepping stone in that direction. It‚Äôs amazingly adventurous for a high profile like Sam - a devout atheist and former trumpeter for materialism - to take such a stance, speaking intellectually about spiritualism in more than less spiritual terms under the rubric of science. And he is trying to communicate into hard-core materialist mental constructs, to impinge to make the metal more malleable ‚Äì a heroic challenge. He does it well and makes it interesting. So I easily forgive him for speaking about spirituality devoid of the spirit, and still confusing the mind with the brain, and even forgive his misinformed opinion about Scientology. The consciousness he‚Äôs talking about doesn‚Äôt necessitate meditation, but it‚Äôs a much better method than not going in that direction at all. I recommend the read."
"I loved chapter 1, really liked chapter 2, and then he kind of lost me. I love how Harris thinks typically, and the mind - brain duality research was really well presented. However, he seems to outstretch his evidence in his claim for monism over dualism. I don't think either one can really be proven, given that they are metaphysical concepts, and that there is value to each perspective, depending on the situation. Just a theory, but I think Harris had a series of (possibly drug - catalyzed) experiences with monism in his early years and as a scientist, has tried to reconstruct an empirical explanation in the years since. It's a valiant attempt, but I just don't think it's possible."
"I would be unable to conjure up the efficient words necessary to claim my approval and appreciation of this book. Sam Harris has started a conversation, that I will forever appreciate. The knowledge gained and the insight to be had here are crucial to the evolution of our society, true words of wisdom."
An important and exciting book for those of us who have truly dismissed ancient and current mythology. It rescues the purity of experience from the quagmire of religion and mysticism. A breathtaking and fresh perspective.
I will make a conscious effort to apply the recommendations and practices of Mr. Harris. My life depends on it.
"Sam is insightful and brilliant.  Whether or not you agree with him, he inspires thought; isn't that the entire point of life?"
Very insightful book. If you have the intellect to comprehend all the parts in this book then I truly believe it could change your life and your perspective on it. Sam Harris is awesome!
"Sam is an incredibly gifted writer, his ideas carry weight and are expressed simply enough for most. Lots of great insights for your life, dont pass this one up!"
A deeply philosophical exploration of self with extensive referencing. A few instances of prosthylitation of atheistic beliefs. Well worth the read.
The best empirical review of consciousness I've read
A voice of reason and logic on the illusion of spirituality .
high quality
I appreciated how he relayed a spiritual nature without bringing in religion. It was helpful to me as an atheist.
Well written
While his perspective is very different from my own I still find the book to be a very valuable contribution to the study of the mind of spirituality from a secular humanist perspective
"Taken alone, the paragraphs on the two identities that arise when the corpus callosum is severed are worth the price of admission. This entire book is like a bucketful of cold water. I feel more awake already, and fully expect to integrate these ideas into my own meditative practice for years to come."
"I waited a couple of years before reading this new one from Sam Harris. He is, of course, a major figure in the meditation and mindfulness world, and he‚Äôs also a major figure in the world of atheism. He has some baggage from his work in the latter endeavor, some of it earned and some un-earned, in my opinion. His first major achievement in books was The End of Faith, in which he famously denounced all religion, but singled out Islam for special treatment as being, in his opinion, a religion that was iredeemably violent, through and through. He caught some flack for that but has not backed down.Now, years later, he has written a book in which he presents his current viewpoint about meditation practice. Much of it is very standard fare and can be found in any number of books that introduce readers to mindfulness, insight, or vipassana-style meditation. But in this case, he‚Äôs trying to find a way to use the word ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù while eschewing religion (of course) and ruling out anything supernatural. That‚Äôs a tough assignment and I can‚Äôt say he has accomplished his task; he provides his special definition of spirituality thus: ‚ÄúThe feeling that we call ‚ÄòI‚Äô is an illusion. There is no discrete self or ego living like a Minotaur in the labyrinth of the brain... Deepening that understanding, repeatedly cutting through the illusion of the self, is what is meant by ‚Äòspirituality‚Äô in the context of this book.‚Äù This is standard fare in Buddhist circles, but it provides us no good reason to say that the word ‚Äúspiritual,‚Äù which in common parlance refers to the non-material, applies to a mental process of recognizing that all thoughts (especially including those that involve I/me/mine) are ephemeral and transitory, and that it‚Äôs helpful to learn to observe them as such, and to take them less seriously,The remainder of the book consists of some basic meditation instruction, competently done; a short discussion of the applicable contemporary neuroscience, a good section with some hair-raising tales about how spiritual teachers and gurus can go horribly wrong, more discussion on the illusory nature of the self, and a lengthy discussion of his own use of psychedelic drugs. His conclusion re: the drugs is that they can be helpful for some people, but they can be very harmful, as well.I teach meditation and have to say that I‚Äôm not recommending this book to my students. I don‚Äôt think it would cause any harm, but there are so many better books to read out there ‚Äî this one lands low on my list."
This book has been hard for me to get into.  The writing is complex and the thread doesn't always follow.  Interesting thoughts however.
read the last 3 chapters twice and will read them again.
"As one of the ""four horseman of Atheism"", Sam treads daringly into the topic of spirituality. He embraces it, while often reverting to religion-bashing to ensure his readers that he hasn't flipped to the dark-side. Indeed, his experiences provide an insight that the other three horseman simply haven't attained."
"A bit dense, but that is to be expected for a book on this topic and by this author. Recommended for the reader who is looking for an unbiased view of an ""expert"""
"Read... this... book.  A fresh perspective that, for me, came out of nowhere.  Since reading this I've read all of Sam's other books.  This one is by far my favorite.  Great read."
"Waking Up is an excellent approach to meditation from a secular and scientific point of view. Many people have never taken meditation seriously because they think it necessarily goes along with a whole set of irrational and superstitious beliefs, and have discarded it entirely for this reason, which is a big mistake.Sam Harris tells us that we do not -and for our mental health's sake should not- have to believe in any superstitious beliefs or make any unjustified claims about the cosmos and our place in it, in order to be able to achieve certain states of conciousness that can be enlightening and very liberating for us.This is a book that can really change your world-view and  the way you think about virtually everything regarding conciousness; but above all, it can change the quality of your life, in a very literal sense. Through meditation and self-transcendence you can live a happier and more attentive life, and make the most out of it through living in ways that most people think are not even possible, but really are accessible to us all. It's an excellent start for anyone curious about meditation and the states of enlightenment that many people have described throughout history, but who doesn't want to compromise on the scientific -and reasonable- approach to things."
great book. Sam Harris is plain speaking and easy to follow
"Shipping was SUPER fast and I mean come on it's Sam Harris, he is such a GREAT critical thinker and writer."
Sam Harris es un autor fascinante. Su visi√≥n de mundo es muy atractiva. Un libro para compartir con muchas personas.
"Important topic adequately dealt with. Treatment thorough, but now as flowing as similar books"
thanks
This is a gem. Not only is it well argued but the quality of the writing is top notch. Thought provoking.
Good follow up after reading 'Free Will' but makes me want to ask the author some questions one-on-one.
"An apologia for spirituality from a person who rejects organised religion. The coda is the most important text. Let us not mistake the search for meaning, the search for calm, satisfaction or happiness with false beliefs and ritual."
"I too was asleep for the majority of my life, however it was individuals like Sam Harris that helped wake me up. Many Christians are in a comatose state because of indoctrination and deep programming since birth and hopefully this book will be the tool that pulls them out of religious bondage."
"Another solid book.  If you're not familiar with his writing, be sure to pick up ""the end of faith"" ""Letters to a Christian nation"" ""lying"" or ""free will"""
"An excellent book about a ""regular guy"" learning how to meditate and quiet his brain.  It got a little draggy at one point but it was well worth reading it to the end!"
Very interesting view of religions and sporituality and an alternative guide to meditation. As a beginning student of these subjects I would higly recommend this book
Sam Harris explores the profound difference between religion and spirituality very cogently. I love his exploration of the divisibility of consciousness. I want to have a nice long conversation with him.
Excellent
"Wonderful, wonderful book. Read it in one sitting! Harris has a sensibility, a way of expressing himself, that I find quite engaging. 'Waking Up' is now on my ""Must Read Again"" list. Recommended!"
Definitely a hard but interesting read. Give Sam Harris your time and you won't regret it.
Book came damaged.
"I thought he was quite philosophical and I got bogged down in it. It was well written, I just could not relate to what he was saying."
"I think I've bought all Sam Harris' books from Amazon, and listened to many (most) of his on-line lectures and debates.  I'm a total fan. Sam writes like he talks: clearly, concisely, no-nonsense. As a person who was rather deeply religious and gradually able to work my way out of it, I can say I'm now profoundly and completely atheistic. Still, I'm interesting in the potential of human consciousness and well-being. So you can see Sam's ideas are good food for me. After reading ""Free Will"" and hearing his lectures on it, I was glad to study ""Waking Up"" which addresses how one might participate in scientific study of how your own consciousness functions. I think it's a very supportive book for atheists (although Sam doesn't think it's a good idea to use that term), and for those believers who'd like to step out."
The author brings unique rational thought to the subject of spirituality. Love this book and recommend it to everyone. Amazing!
"An interesting read where the idea that ""spiritual"" does not have to mean "" religious"" nor even be related to ANY idea of the Divine, yet neither can it be denied by the "" scientific."""
Life changing good!
"Harris takes you directly into the present moment and explains about the process of knowing you are thinking. For anyone who needs some understanding of why we think the way we think and an non-dogmatic explanation of the Buddhist idea of the illusion of the sense of self, this book is awesome!"
"Sam Harris provides a guide for spirituality, without any pseudoscience, mythology or woo-woo required. In this powerful book, Dr. Harris covers topics such as mindfulness meditation, near-death experiences, psychedelics, and more!"
Incredible read.  Love it.
"Very interesting, but I still struggled to understand how to engage in the kind of meditation he recommends."
"Since reading ""Waking Up"" I've taken some time to review the (many) favorable and (occasional) unfavorable reviews of this book to see if I could add anything useful to the would-be reader.A self-proclaimed malcontent, this is Sam Harris's most personal offering, wherein he shares what he's learned in his own (let's face it, smarter-than-the-average-guy's) life to help minimize the needless suffering that his own mind is happy to create.  No false promises, no grandiose miracles for sustained enlightenment or constant happiness, no living in a cave for years.  Mr. Harris limits himself to practices that actually help and accepts that there are limits here as well.We have a consciousness.  With it we experience life through our senses, our feelings and our thoughts.  But this consciousness should not be confused as actually being those thoughts and feelings.  They arise just like a sensation of sun on our face or a pain in our knee.  With a bit of practice they can be observed to surface in our mind, exist for a brief while and then pass away on their own while we simply observe the process.  This practice limits the suffering they can cause.  Really.This simple message has been known to work for millennia, but like most things that aren't intuitive, everyone needs a mentor of sorts to get started.  Sam Harris has had many of them, including a few psychedelic aids, and has personally achieved a significantly lower level of suffering than he would otherwise experience.  He has experienced moments of transcendental joy that help him identify with the ecstatic moments that others have felt and attributed to whatever their religious mythology dictates.For example, a suicide bomber likely has some such moments before senselessly ending the only life he'll ever have and attributes these moments to something like Allah's love.  These moments matter and can greatly enrich life without any need to cheapen them with religious nonsense.Again, no hyperbolic claims, but if you've always wanted to know what the hype around the benefits of meditation might be or if you've sat with your legs crossed for an hour only to be frustrated that the universe didn't reveal its deepest secrets, this would be a great book to start (or re-start) the road to greater self-awareness, that ability to exist outside our own (often negative) thoughts.  Each of us can escape much of the unhappiness they cause and I must add that this book has already helped me significantly."
Sam Harris' writing always keeps me thinking and it may do the same for you. I find his ideas are clearly presented and well reasoned.
Great read. Lots of insight. Why does religion have to have the monopoly?
Objective and rational. We need more of this
"I was very excited about this book after hearing Sam Harris on Tim Ferris' podcast.  He is obviously a very bright man with some interesting insights but in this book, he is way too full of himself.After the first 50 pages or so (which were very good), I felt he was more interested in showing off how much he knows about religion, science, etc.  The structure was very poor - his observations and arguments kept going around and around and around.I would put it this way - he is a good author in desperate need of a great editor.  I didn't hate the book but I was disappointed about it."
Great insights. I've always felt that you don't need woo to be serene and mindful.
"Sam Harris is clear minded and honest.  While he points out the harm in false and dehumanizing religious beliefs, he promotes an understanding of existence that brings reality into the realm of the sacred. Particularly interesting is his discussion of psychedelics without romanticizing them or drawing spiritual conclusions. Central is the practice of being mindful, deriving from Buddhist practice.  Worth the read. Could open new insights."
"This is the book you want to read again and again. It is more than Sam's rumination on consciousness, it is a refreshing and profound exercise in intellectual honesty."
"Interesting read, especially if you're a fan of ""The Power of Now"" by Eckhart Tolle"
For those willing to take that step out of religious doctrine into the light of truth.
I wish I would have read this book sooner. It helped me meditate more effectively.  A must read for seekers.
"I respect Sam Harris a lot for being such a magnificent intellectual and neuroscientist, however, this book did not convince me of what it is consciousness, actually I still don't know what it is."
"Deep discussion of very edgy ideas. Sam Harris goes where most scientists wouldn't bother to expand their thinking.  Like The Moral Landscape Harris expands science to the previously ""unscientific""."
The book handles abstract concepts presented in a way that was easy to understand. Very good food for thought.
Nuggets from Sam: 1. Ego is when you are not thinking that you are thinking.Just made me laugh a minute ago.
"Common sense most of it(in my opinion)I never relied on any book to tell me that the wonders of the world are still wondrous without a faith system.I personally don't believe that spirituality and a spirit are one in the same. Mr. Harris' title makes it seem that way, but perhaps he is just saying ""wake up and smell the roses"" there is something meaningful in our lives even without a book or supreme being telling us that we have value.Remember - my opinion..."
A simply superior in-depth look at consciousness coupled with clear advice for how to actually meditate. Written by an intellectual for intellectuals.
Sam Harris at his finest. Readable to a soldier :)
Sam Harris is probably one of the five smartest people alive on Earth today.  Listen to what he says and it will make you a smarter person.
Study
"A great book, like all I have read of Mr. Harris."
Fantastic book and author!
"3 stars because I love Sam, but I want to give less. I don't know where I got the idea that this would help me meditate, it doesn't. He refers to very interesting things but then doesn't explain them. He literally starts a thought, adds a period, and forgets about the conclusion of that thought over and over again. Maybe it's too smart for me but I tried both reading and listening to this book, I'm 50% through and still don't really know what it's about. The book seems designed for the reader to finish Sam's sentences and I can't do it."
I liked it a lot!
Refreshingly candid. Clear. Wish it was longer!
Strong sections on mindfulness. Narrative does become disjointed in the second half.
A excellent book for open minded thinkers who want to examine a dogma free analysis and approach to consciousness and spirituality.
Sam Harris is wonderful! Thoughtful and so well written... A joy to read and definitely inspiring!
"Sam has certainly done his research.  A very good read, interesting and thought provoking."
Accessible and lofty at the same time.  I took away some great anecdotes and theories. Its a must read for fervent agnostics.
"Amazing book, really makes you think about a lot of stuff that you're better off knowing than not knowing."
"It is a life changing book, which does connect scientifically all the wealth of information from neuroscience and psychology to the world of the meditation and the theory of mind. Clear, compelling and exceptionally well referenced. Great reading from a great scientist."
Excellent.
I found the book very interesting and profound. However I found it digging too deep in topics that were less in my interest for me.
"Very insightful. Would recommend to a friend. I enjoy listening to the first half on his podcast, and had to finish it."
amazing insights in spirituality
"Great book, i recommend for everyone."
Sam Harris knocks it out of the park in this book. Highly enjoyable and meaningful read. Get your hands on a copy!
"If you have ever thought about thinking, read this book."
Sam Harris accomplished a very accurate and epistemological approach to spirituality. Initially sounds weird but perfectly done. No better than a rational and lucid mind to approach to these fundamental topics without falling or packaging it by myths and delusional belief.
"Enjoyed it, certainly believe in its message."
"Some new ideas, well presented.  A good addition to my collection about mindfulness."
Sam Harris is in my opinion the most intellectually honest writer on the subject of religion/secularism I have yet to encounter. His ideas are clear and straight to point. Is it possible to have an spiritual life without the belief on the supernatural? Sam thinks this is not only possible but necessary for human beings to find happiness. I agree with him. All my life I have been intrigued by how so many people find some sort of happiness and fulfillment in supernatural beliefs. This book will help you understand that the principal of spirituality is not the belief on the supernatural but the inner journey of understanding oneself. Thank you Sam! another home run.
Great Book. Great mind opener in all aspects of life.
4 stars. includes some Interesting personal background on the author
"A book that takes you on an in depth conversational ride into the realm of nonduality with plenty of intriguing insight, ways of achieving this state, and establishes the benefits of the journey towards reaching it."
Fills a niche that few can write well about.
"Having reading all of his books, Waking Up did not disappoint. It's a message whose time has come. Sam's clarity of thought always impresses. As a physician, I appreciate the neuroscience. Yes, we can have altered states of consciousness without all of the ""woo-woo, hairy-fairy crap"". Thanks again Sam."
"Great book! Its the science of spirituality without the spiritual terminology that usually puts me to sleep. If you like books that take a more scientific approach to topics like meditation, id highly recommend starting with this one"
Excellent.  He is a wonderful writer
Excellent discussion on meditation from a neuroscientists point of view. Dr. Harris studied meditation with some of the great contemporary Buddhist masters. This book is a valuable read for anyone interested in meditation and the search for meaning in one's life.
It just doesn't get me anywhere.  Concepts are not clearly delivered.
A bit repetitive but a very interesting thesis
Sam Harris's writing style is clear and concise which is important especially on a subject as contraversial as spirituality.  This is a great work that is intellectually brilliant and is an interesting guide to anyone trying to better their own lives as well as the lives of others.
"I've read a lot of books about meditation and spirituality, but for some reason Waking Up just helped everything click."
"As usual, Sam's writing and thinking is crisp and clear.  I have been on a ""waking up"" journey for two decades, and this book gave me new insights, new questions, and new ways of thinking about what it means to think at all.  There are few books that I read more than twice.  This will be one of them."
Just a lot of good stuff.......No....I haven't transcended into an immersion of mystical irridescent illuminating Presence but the teachings are there.
"Sam Harris constantly impressed me throughout this book, discussing matters of consciousness and ""spirituality"" with total rational thought and scientific skepticism. If you're religious, please read this book. But even if you're not, it can give you the basic tools to help improve your mind and mental well-being in real, everyday life, without forcing you to accept supernatural or unreasonable beliefs."
Remarkably sharp. Sam Harris provides a very unique perspective on developing spirituality that simply cannot be found elsewhere. He is proving himself to be one of the great thinkers of our time.
"I was only slightly familiar with Sam Harris before reading this book, but I found him to be an exceedingly interesting thinker. What ""Waking Up"" has done for me that no other work has is describe the nature of consciousness itself. His metaphor for ""the window pane that is also a mirror"" was alone worth the price of this book.There are many other great insights here, but honestly after only a single reading I probably grasped only a tiny fraction of them. I intend to read this book again at least once to see if I can distill more out of it."
"Sam delivers the goods once again! A succinct, no nonsense plunge into the nature of consciousness and methods to better understand the machinery behind it - informed by science and empirical inquiry. Finished the book in two sittings, clear and direct."
"IMO, Harris brings an updated take on Alan Watts' lectures from the 60's & early 70's. It's probably one of the best books to come out in the last ten years."
Beautifully written as are all his books.  Honest and profoundly thought provoking book for everyone.  I feel it has changed me for the better.
"A very refreshing perspective for a person like me. Having once been very religious, having lost faith and searching for new answers, I feel like this book helped me feel a peaceful balance between where I once was and where I am now."
"I liked it for the most part, yet not so sure it's points were fully expressed or made completely coherent, but then again, we are speaking of something that may be inexplicable, or as of yet, just out reach of the human mind. Bravo for the effort."
This book is pretty hard to follow. Maybe after years of meditation I'll catch on.
Read it with the book club. We all loved it
"Great to read an atheist who is a true, critical, seeking spiritual person."
"A profound, heartwarming and entertaining journey through Harris' spiritual journey. One walks away with a clear sense of what lies beyond the superficial, conditioned realm - an existential experience imbued with deep, beautiful truths on the nature of reality, devoid of supernatural nonsense."
"Waking Up is a perfect balance of pop spirituality and weighty scientific analysis.Like with The Moral Landscape it seems I'm  going to need to go straight back in for a second read, or should I meditate for a few weeks first?Harris's ability to cram so much into so little is his greatest asset."
"I like the personal perspective Sam offers.  A deep subject with thousands of years of science, art and personal experiences involved."
Fantastic.  This is one I will read several times.
Really interesting
"Brilliant book. If you still think that you need religion in order to be spiritual, think again."
"Fantastic.  Sam Harris is always willing to apply his incredible logic and reasoning skills to subjects that are snubbed by other well known critical thinkers.  Once again, he does it brilliantly here."
An overall scientific and objective treatment of the subject with an approppriate touch of personal opinions that makes the read as fun as it is informative.
well written and easy to understand like most of this author's works
"I've enjoyed all of Sam's other books, this got a little...heady for me."
I feel #woke
"It inspired me to get back into my meditation. I hadn't been aware of Harris's quest, so it reinforced my admiration of him."
Excellent discussion of what spirituality outside the bounds of religious doctrine can be like.  So a sort of exposition on spirituality as a species of consciousness: what it's like to be a spiritual being without religion!
It's always wonderful to hear someone elucidate on what you've been thinking.  The world has to take his direction or be lost.  It's a path for all peoples to unite but it'll take a long time to walk it.
"Sam is an excellent thinker, his art form. Truly a pleasure to unravel subjects with his guidance. Non religious spirituality is something I've been waiting for someone to begin discussing for years. Sam is a great guide.  I enjoyed the writing too."
Enlightening!
Great short little read for anyone interest in meditation or the nature of consciousness
".I enjoyed The End of Faith, and I appreciate and generally agree with the author's message. However, this book fell short of my expectations."
Mind awaking to the reality of what life truly is in the present moment. always there but ever changing by each individual minds perception and reaction to its discovery. Truly finding the entropy in every reality could yield the insight to walk on the best path thru the world as it truly exists.
A thoughtful perspective on the best of spirituality without religion
Total freedom of the  mind
Excellent!
"A thoughtful, engaging exploration of spirituality and the nature of subjective experience. Worth the read, regardless of personal background."
excellent
"The phrase ‚Äúspiritual but not religious‚Äù irks believers and atheists alike. Sam Harris‚Äôs latest book is subtitled A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion. He gained fame with books bashing faith and says he won‚Äôt do that here (but he‚Äôs unable to refrain).Harris says most of us see life in terms of pleasure versus pain ‚Äì but there can be more ‚Äì a deeper contentment grounded not in transitory well-being but rising above that. The key is that the self is an illusion, and only by getting out of it can one access that more fundamental nirvana. We must break from ‚Äúbeing continuously spellbound by the conversation we are having with ourselves‚Äù and wake up from the dream of being a separate self.How? By mindfulness meditation. Harris says that ‚Äúhow one uses one‚Äôs attention, moment to moment, largely determines what kind of person one becomes.‚Äù Author Paul Dolan recently authored a book about how happiness is shaped by how you choose to allocate your attention and contextualize experiences. Harris goes further and prescribes ‚Äúovercoming the illusion of the self by paying close attention to our experience in the present moment.‚Äù In other words: not just choosing which aspects of experience to focus upon, but stepping out of the whole web of experience as mediated by a seeming self.Despite calling the self an illusion, Harris is emphatic that consciousness is not illusory; even thinking about the question proves the reality of the conscious experience. (Cogito ergo sum!) But I frankly fail to see how the one can be deemed illusory and the other not. Our (present) inability to understand how consciousness arises, Harris insists, does not gainsay the phenomenon‚Äôs reality. (Consciousness must arise somehow from the information processing among the brain‚Äôs neurons; there is no other possibility that makes any sense.) We know consciousness is a real phenomenon because we all experience it. Why wouldn‚Äôt that apply to the self too?Harris does argue that one can be conscious without a sense of self, and that while the former‚Äôs existence is undeniable, any penetrating effort to put one‚Äôs finger on the latter ultimately fails. He strangely omits quoting philosopher David Hume that introspection could never enable him to catch hold of his self. The problem is that he was using the self to search for the self. Similarly, one can‚Äôt see one‚Äôs own eyes (except in a mirror). But we know they‚Äôre there because of the perceptions we get through them. And such perceptions must of course somehow be registered. Consciousness enables that. And a sense of self is a kind of meta-consciousness enabling us to perceive and experience that which is registered.After all, we evolved a self for logical adaptive reasons. A self that cares about what happens to it is more motivated to act for its survival than a bare consciousness more neutral toward its existence and experience.And the sense of self, the internal chatter, is not as continuous as Harris says. In fact, it disappears in many circumstances, not just meditation ‚Äì when one is absorbed in a book, or drama, or task. Indeed, we even speak of ‚Äúlosing oneself‚Äù in them!Furthermore, when Harris asks you to step out of your normal mode and view your experiences from a place apart, as it were, what actor would be  doing that if not your self? This is the fundamental contradiction at the heart of Harris‚Äôs book: the contradiction between the idea that ‚Äúan egoic self doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù and the idea that we can attain some desirable state (‚Äúhappiness,‚Äù ‚Äúcontentment‚Äù) by grasping this ‚Äì when it can only be the egoic self that does the grasping and, moreover, experiences the desirable state. If the self is an illusion, wouldn‚Äôt the contentment be equally illusory?Harris acknowledges that, at best, no human being can achieve the detachment from self that he prescribes except on a fleeting, momentary basis. Thus he says the goal ‚Äúis not some permanent state of enlightenment . . . but a capacity to be free in this moment.‚Äù Do that, he asserts, and ‚Äúyou have already solved most of the problems you will encounter in life.‚Äù Really? I don‚Äôt think so. Nirvana for a brief moment might be nice, even eye-opening, but what about the zillions of other moments during which one remains trapped in what Harris reckons to be an unsatisfactory state? He acknowledges this problem but seems to think that even the momentary glimpses of the alleged deeper reality somehow change everything.But in any case, I don‚Äôt see the basic point. Even if Harris is right about the self being an illusion, I don‚Äôt understand how grasping this helps us live better. I‚Äôm not rejecting the evidence Harris presents that meditation somehow can make practitioners feel good. But I question whether something is happening other than the changed understanding he stresses. How, exactly, does seeing the self as an illusion, and (briefly) experiencing consciousness without it, enhance the experience of life? Harris keeps saying it‚Äôs so, but never actually explains why and how. Frankly, I very much like having a self, and definitely do not want to give it up."
"Fantastic read for anyone, highly recommend. I even bought one for my sister so that she can be enlightened as well."
An ok read.
"This book started out well and then degraded into a very drawn out description of gurus, crackpots and drug altered states. I was left with little to take from the last half of the book. It starts out much like a book by Theldblocke, Finding Purpose Beyond Religion"", but doesn't offer the same insight and conclusions about consciousness or life well lived."
All his books are great
"Don't be stuck just along for the ride in your mind. Read this and better understand your options. Good at many levels, knowledge, self-improvement, etc."
Check out his other stuff as well.
Excellent so far
Great book that presents good reasoning for a secular meditation practice.
MUST READ.
"This is  a very solid introduction if you're new to contemplative practice, but if you've been practicing for a while there is not much new here--though it is good to read Harris's perspective, and the writing is clear and lucid"
"Coming from a physics background, I often find myself at a loss when confronting physicalism in emergent phenomena- the greatest of those mysteries is human consciousness. After years searching for an alternative to nihilism, Harris' ""Waking Up"" made its way to my Kindle in time to rescue me from a life of depression and philosophical deprivation. The work is scientific in nature, yet touches on the deepest of existential questions while managing to offer a humble, yet no-bullshit guide to the examined life of a non-believer. If there was one book I could ask everyone I know to read, it would be this one.Good luck in your intellectual journey and buckle up for a mind-blowing adventure; I read this book in 48 hours, but established wisdom that will last me a lifetime!"
"Everyone needs to read this book!To get the most out of it, I think it might be helpful to have already investigated mindfulness meditation to a small degree, and to have had some experience investigating one's own mind introspectively. Otherwise it might be too easy to dismiss some important points, which are given - of necessity - light coverage.I knocked a star off because I think Sam is too gentle in regards to his treatment of 'gurus'. Unless there is some positive correlation between behaving immorally and being a gifted contemplative, I don't think fraudulent or criminal gurus should be allowed for in any way. In fact it is precisely these kinds of abuses of power which lead to some of the worst consequences of religion that we have seen.Take a harder stance on cult leaders, Sam! Then you'll have my vote all the way."
"I love any book that deals with Biblical characters, especially women, if they are faithful to Scripture, that is. Liz Curtis Higgs' devotional is certainly that, and she does bring up some interesting points about Mary, Elizabeth, and Anna. Her character profiles, as it were, are written with a respectful and tender hand.With this said, I do feel Liz skimmed over a lot of important information when she could've gone deeper. She also drops Scripture all over the place like Christmas candies from a parade float, without then delving much into why she chose that verse or translation, or what place it has in the larger story of Christmas and Jesus. This happens so often, the chapters feel simultaneously too long and too short.Overall, Women of Christmas isn't at all a bad book. Be aware though, it's more a gift book than a deep devotional or Bible study. If you want that, I recommend Liz' other books, such as her Girls of the Bible studies, or something from a writer like Beth Moore, Priscilla Shirer, or Jess Connolly."
"When I spotted this Christmas book, my mind immediately went to a sweet friend that loves this author.  I hurried online to order it as a Christmas gift.  Lo and behold..sorry, had to do it..it's the season..I found a place that said if you gave the book as a gift, the author would bless you with a free copy.  FREE..so I just had to get into that.  Sorry, it's probably over.  It was a while ago.  So I was also blessed with a copy of this book.  What a deal!Not expecting a great deal, I opened it and became fascinated with Liz Curtis Higgs take on the lives of Elizabeth, Mary and Anna.  Tucked between the pages are scriptures and comments from ordinary ladies like myself.  Some aren't really deep but the fact is, the story touched each lady at her point of need and growth in God's word.  Elizabeth, wife of Zechariah, who was barren, all of a sudden was pregnant while burdened with a husband who was struck dumb while ministering in the temple.  Elizabeth, whose child in the womb jumped for joy when he heard the voice of his Savior's mother, was probably the first human to encourage the young, newly pregnant Mary.  When Ms Higgs got to Mary, what a refreshing point of view!  Not some super person but a girl that God knew would step up and say ""yes"".  God never had to have a plan B!  Anna, the prophetess, who saw the baby Jesus in the temple and hurried over. ( She must have been a dimple pincher!)  She was so plugged into the Holy Spirit, she couldn't help herself.  Here was the redemption of Jerusalem and she wasn't going to miss it.  Not content to see, she went away, telling all that would hear and encouraging all who longed for His coming.  Whoa!  At the end is a bonus study guide.  I can't wait to finish that.I would recommend this to any lady this Christmas.  My giftee called and she loved it so it makes a nice gift.  Don't miss it."
"If you like folksy, straight- talkin' versions of the women of Christmas in the Bible, then this book is for you. This interpretation of the women in Jesus's life makes them seem like someone you would know in your life today. Sadly- I was looking for something a little more esoteric, so this book is not for me. But I can see how it would appeal to a lot of women looking for a way to integrate the story of Christmas into something you can easily relate to. I donated the book to my local community rummage sale and I suspect someone will be very happy to find it. i give it four stars for being well-written, well-published and well-meaning."
"I led my Life Group (8 women) through this study for four (4) weeks, two chapters each week. We were all awestruck with Mary ... a baby herself, giving birth to the Lord of lords and King of kings. The discussion about her and how she felt when she held Him in her arms for the first time, parenting Him, raising and training Him, only to let Him go and do what God had sent Him to earth to do. Knowing your child's fate and not being able to control it.  Powerful teaching. The question came up ""Mary, did she know?""  I believe she did .. because the Angel told her she found favor from God to be the Mother of our Savior .. so how could she not know His fate?This little book is full of wonderful insights into the three women .. Elizabeth, Mary and Anna.  It amazes me what insight Liz Curtis Higgs brings to the table .. the in depth study she has done on these women.  We can learn so much from young Mary.  So much wisdom from a 12-1/2 year old.  So much faith and immediate obedience. Oh wouldn't life be so much simpler if I were like Mary?  Or Anna...who prayed continuously?  Or Elizabeth who never gave up on her dream and prayed without ceasing and God honored her in her old ago (what was old back then anyway)?  Beautifully written.  Inspiring.  Must read for all."
"I will be posting on my facebook about this book - highly recommend reading.This is the PERFECT book to experience the season afresh with Elizabeth, Mary and Anna.Rather than a story told, this book was an experience.One of wonder, and reflection. My heart needed this book at just this time - thank you!!"
I did not care for this book.  I read it in a church book club and would not have selected it on my own.  It was a superficial analysis.  The writer seemed to me to state the obvious.  I did not get any new insights into the Women of Christmas.  My overall 3 star rating is generous.
"Liz Curtis Higgs is an excellent writer.  You feel like you are having a conversation with her.  I love her insights into Jewish life during the times she writes about.  I learned a lot about the women, and men, surrounding Jesus‚Äô birth.  So glad I bought the book."
"An in-depth study of just 3 important women: Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna. This really made Nazareth, Bethlehem and the players of the Nativity come alive for me. Steeped in historical research and solid exegesis, this study helped me to ""ponder these things"" in my own heart as I worship the King of Glory!"
"This was a Book Club selection so I bought it.  I learned from it, so it was worthwhile but not as strong as I expected it to be.  It needed to have 3-4 more women in it, as it was not enough information for each character, IMO."
"Our bible study group of 6 women loved this book.We have done other studies by L.C. Higgs but this was the one we really enjoyed the most.  We found the study guide questions at the end of the book ,stimulated in depth conversation and sharing.  We range in age from 60-89yrs. and have unique life stories of our own that reading the book helped  us bring out.  Elizabeth, Mary and Anna special women indeed. Merry Christmas and may our Lord bless you.  Marilyn Audet"
Theology is empty and confusing. Seems to suggest God chooses who can have babies and contains other misguided thinkingNo one in our book study liked it
"This book is a delight to read and contains many nuggets to ponder in the story of the women of Christmas.  Liz Curtis Higgs has a way of examining every detail of the scriptures about Mary, Elizabeth, and Anna, and has left me with a sense of awe at the lives of these women and their service to God.  Liz is such a good writer with her sense of humor, her ability to find the golden nuggets of truth in a passage, and relay it to her readers.  I have read other books by her and find that when she has a new book, I want to read it because I know it will be good.I recommend this book as an enlightening look at the Christmas message."
"This is an absolutely delightful and thorough look into the women that are part of the Christmas story. I've read many books by this author,  both fiction and non, and loved every one. Ms. Higgs is also a wonderful speaker and a delight to listen to!"
"This has been a wonderful read during this precious season of the celebration of our Lord's birth.  It has been very helpful for me to focus on the ""reason for the season"" instead of the materialism that is prevalent at this time of the year.  I loved Liz's style - I loved how she provided insight into the culture and the times.  She made it a fun, but informative read.  A few ladies from my Bible study group met with me weekly (we did 2 chapters a week for 4 weeks) and we discussed it at length for sometimes 2 hours!!!  I have purchased the ""girls"" of the Bible books (Bad Girls, Really Bad Girls, Not So Bad Girls, etc.) and we are going to work on them through 2014.  I haven't seen a WOMEN OF EASTER book but have seen Liz's notes from last time which included the Mary Magdalene book so we are planning on studying that before Easter.  GREAT JOB LIZ - THANK YOU FOR KEEPING THE MEANING IN CHRISTMAS MEANINGFUL.  Blessings . . . Judi"
I received the book in no time. But really haven't had a chance to read it yet. I started and with the busy Christmas seasonpicked it up once and just couldn't concentrate. I gave it a 4 start only because had it been an exciting pull you in kind of bookI probably would have stuck with it and wanted to pick it up again. But I'm a book worm. So now that the Christmas season and NewYears is past I will pick it back up again! It must be a good book cause read all the reviews on it before I bought it. And this authoris great!
"I want to give this book a 10 or more out of five stars!!  Liz Curtis Higgs shares insights about three women within The Christmas Story who were close to the heart of God.  I love the way each new chapter begins with lyrics from a traditional Christmas carol and is loaded with scripture!  The Study Guide is included, best completed in a group."
"This was good, but maybe a little too light.  Some more theological meat would have been welcome, but as women's devotionals go, it wasn't bad.  It did help me get into a more Christmas-y/Advent mood, which I appreciated."
This book made me think deeply about the birth of Jesus and the lives of the women involved.  God truly meets us where we are!  I'll read this every Christmas!
"I really enjoyed this book. It was easy to read, simple, and to the point. However, it was an intense study of God's word at the same time. It's a short but indepth look at the story of the birth of Christ. It breaks down a verse and explains about the importance of the wording or the timing of an event. I've never had it explained to me in this much detail before. I plan on recommending it to everyone I know who wishes to celebrate the true meaning of Christmas. I plan to incorporate reading it yearly as my own Christmas traditon as well."
Oh my goodness! What a nice way to begin celebrating Advent and the Christmas season! Terrific book! Don‚Äôt forget to answer the questions for thought in the back of the book.
"Much like The Women of Easter, this book points you to scripture in such a fresh, beautiful way. Highly recommend this book and this author!"
Loved the author's perspective on the women in the Bible that were featured. Liz makes their lives more real and relatable.
"This book examines the lives of Elizabeth, Mary and Anna and their relationship to the birth of Christ. Liz Curtis Higgs does a wonderful job of digging deep into the Scriptures and the cultural background of the times, to give us glimpses into these women's lives. This book is a great way for women to prepare their own hearts for the Christmas season. There is a study guide in the back that makes it useful for individual or group study.I received this book for free from Blogging for Books for this review."
"I led my small group in this excellent study over the holiday season.  I feel I can share on all of our behalf's and say that this was a very meaningful study.  Liz Higgs takes a close look at the lives of the three women of the Christmas story, Elizabeth, Mary and Anna.  I loved the thought provoking insights that Ms Higgs had for each of the women, but I felt I could relate more with her in sights on Elizabeth.  I recommend this study for small groups especially during the holiday season."
Our Women‚Äôs Sunday School class used this at the holiday for study. I learned so much. Well written in today time to hold your attention.  I now have the women of Easter as well! Must read both.
"A book deserves a five star rating when it goes beyond what I expected it to be.  The author wrote in such a way which allowed me to apply to my daily life.  The book is not just something to read - but something to read!  And it isn't just about three amazing women, but men and groups of men who were shown - through the author - in ways to walk in their shoes also.  Bottom line - great book to see the Christmas story in a new light...and could be read all year long."
"A perfect book for the Advent season, one of my favorites. I‚Äôd recommend this with the Dawning of Indestructible Joy Advent devotional!"
Using for a Christmas Sunday school class. Great way to prepare for the Christmas season.
Loved every minute reading this book. Learned a lot more about these three women .  Very well researched. Thank you so much for helping me understand.
Great reading and has some questions for thought. Did not use for small group study it was just not right for our group but worked well for an individual study.
Ordered it for my mom and she had no bad things to say about it.  Recommend.
"This book was beautifully written as a study of the Christmas story with Elizabeth, Mary and Anna. The chapters followed with study guide questions encouraged thoughtful conversations and discussions. I would recommend this for new and seasoned believers."
"Mrs. Higgs kept me reading as she made the women and the men of Christmas real. She helps the reader see the reality of each situation rather than the sweet sterile nativity scene we are so used to. Her questions at the end help the reader look for the strong Elizabeths, Marys and Annas in our own lives. She knows how to challenge us to live strong Godly lives in the face of all the adversity life and the devil can throw at us."
"Normally I enjoy books written by Ms. Higgs, but this one did not hit the mark for me.  It was for a small group study and we all had trouble getting into it.  The study section at the back was not as thorough as we would have liked."
"Each year as I go through this book, I will learn something fresh and new. God's word is always working in our lives. This is a beautiful book to enjoy during  the hectic holiday season."
"Such a wonderful and well written book by the insightful Liz Curtis Higgs. The Women of Christmas does just what the title says - it helps you see the season afresh.I can never read enough about Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna. To enter the Christmas season with the joy of these women...what a season it will be. Be prepared to cozy up on the couch with a soft blanket and some warm chai- you won't want to leave until it's finished!Highly recommended for all."
I‚Äôm already making a list of friends to give copies to.
"We have used this for a women's bible study done over Advent.  It's okay, some really nice things to think about, but not any huge revelations.  One nice thing, the readings were fairly short, bible study questions in back, so no need to purchase another study guide, and there was no 'homework' involved outside of the readings.  So if you need a study for busy women, this is a good one."
"I am currently reading this book with my online women's small group. It has helped take my focus off the hustle and bustle of Christmas, and placed it on the one true meaning of Christmas. Its interesting to read from the womens view of this experience (such as Elizabeth and Mary). I have enjoyed this book as it shapes my heart for Christmas."
I liked the writing and what I learned
Lovely view into the lives of the women. I gave them as gifts to several ladies.
"Such a lovely book! We used this as a topic for our small group Bible study.  It is such a heartfelt perspective on the Christmas story.  While there is a lot of conjecture and imagining on the part of the author, it helps you think about the biblical women involved in the Christmas story in a new way!  The author provides context and history surrounding the events, but also she gets you to imagine and put yourself in their shoes.  What a great way to get in the true spirit of joy and thanksgiving for the celebration of the birth of Jesus!"
This book told about the women and it made it much more clear what their roles were.  I enjoyed reading it very much.
These are for very dear friends for Christmas. We had used it for a bookclub choice and really enjoyed it.
I really enjoyed this book!
I have heard the Christmas story my whole life but this added a new meaning and deeper understanding. There are questions in the back of the book if you would like to use as a study.
Liz has done it again!  Great teacher of women of the bible
"A side by side look at 3 women at different stages of life who have a personal encounter with Christ and who are forever changed. Reading this book helped me slow down during  the Christmas season and ponder my own personal journey with Christ. Liz's other books have focused on ""the bad women of the Bible"" and this book looks at women of faith."
"Beautiful Read. Liz definitely has the gift of drawing one right into the story with her. A must read and wonderful gifts for your sisters in Christ (Secret Santa's) any family or friends who you would love to bless this Holiday season. Liz Curtis Higgs is definetely one of God's Blessings on this earth, and I hope everyone will take the time to view her work and enjoy her storytelling."
A new perspective on the biblical story.Great advent reading
"While you've read the story of Jesus' birth from Luke many times...nothing puts it in such human thoughts and feelings as Liz Curtis Higgs does.  Such great life application for us today.  The story comes alive in the book I read more as a devotion than a ""novel.""  A must read during the month of December - truly prepares your heart for celebrating Christmas!"
I like how Liz tells women about the women of the Bible and how God has used women throughout the Bible.
I bought 6 of these to give as gifts at Christmas time.  Liz Higgs weaves a beautiful story - a special story- tying 3 Godly women together with her amazing humor and Biblical insight.  I highly recommend this beautiful book!
"As a Liz Curtis Higgs fan...I was not disappointed.  She makes Elizabeth, Mary and Anna come alive...and deals with all the points you might have missed by just reading it from the scriptures.  I have been reflecting back on the wonder and strength of these women all through this month., and am sharing the book with my sister and sister-in-law."
Excellent reading and learning experience.
Insightful
"A present for my wife, she liked it"
"I really enjoyed learning about these biblical women. So much so that I bought a copy for a friend. She liked it so much, she suggested that we use the book as a basis for a Bible study."
Beautiful story about the women behind the most amazing birth yet!  I loved reading this book and sharing it with my family.
"I love this book and decided to buy a second copy to give to a family member. However, when I received this second copy, the book had been written in. I do write in my books but when I buy a book labeled NEW I expect nothing to be written in it. Nothing wrong with book! Just disappointed that the book had already been written in. That is the only reason why I am rating this a 4/5 verses a 5/5."
"I had the pleasure of meeting, serving and worshipping with Liz Curtis Higgs this fall at Women of Faith.  What a beautiful woman with a compelling testimony. Her writing makes you feel like you are there and part of the story.  Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down.  This is a MUST read.  You will not be disappointed."
"Short, easy read, with great style and inspirational content. Brings these stories to life!"
"As usual, Liz delivers.  I would have liked it to be more like her other stories, like her novels, but it was still good.  It will make a good study group for a short time, especially the holidays.  Liz offers tips for that too."
Wife loved it
Liz Curtis Higgs is connected to the Lord. Her insight and exposition of oft repeated verses is wonderful.  She puts a new slant on the Nativity and it is wonderful.  We are reading her book and watching the video The Nativity as part of our Wednesday evening Bible study.
"This was the perfect book for our Life Group for the month of October, getting us ready to celebrate Christmas with a more intense look at three specific women of the bible.  I liked how the book was written simply.  Some authors like to add all kinds of big words which can confuse you at times, but Liz Curtis Higgs wrote it beautifully with some thought-provoking comments by others.  I would highly recommend this book."
"This book was a gift to me, and I liked it so much that I have given it to several people.  This book makes you remember what Christmas is all about."
Great little study that the ladies at my church did just prior to the holidays. This brought three of the first women in Jesus' life to life for me and acquainted us with the possible relationship Mary had with Elizabeth and also brought Anna to the front. Loved it.
"Beautifully written. What a wonderful Christmas gift or stocking stuffer this would make for the women in your life: your girlfriends, or members of your Bible study. Liz Curtis Higgs's books are always well researched and her message is that every woman has a place in God's plan."
"I needed this wonderful reminder form Liz Curtis Higgs.  As always, down to earth and real."
3 friends are getting together to read the Women of Christmas!
"Liz Curtis Higgs has once again brought to life the women of the Bible.  In sync with their stories and the story of the birth of the Saviour of the world, she brings hope to every page and every circumstance that life might bring.  A must read this holiday and I years to come."
This is for late fall study at church. Have not read yet. Her other book Women of Easter was really good.
"This is a wonderfully well written book about Mary, Elizabeth, and Anna.  I have enjoyed all of Liz Curtis Higgs books.  They will keep your attention throughout with facts, humor, and insight.  Highly recommended!"
"Liz Curtis Higgs brings alive the three women in the Christmas story in such a way that you could identify with them.  The three women are Mary (mother of Jesus), Elizabeth and Anna.  Higgs inserts scripture throughout that reveals the emotions that must have been felt by these women and that we as women would feel under these earth shaking events that each encountered."
I enjoyed her writing very much
There's always something to learn and/or appreciate from Ms. Higgs' books.
"Liz has a fresh look at a familiar story. I was drawn in like I'd never heard the of the birth of Christ before.Betwee the story and the study questions,this book helped me keep my focus on Christ during Advent which is exactly what I needed."
Excellent book. I am really enjoying it.
Liz is great and I learned more than I thought I would about Elizabeth and others who were around the family when Jesus was born. Only thing I don't like about a Kindle book is that I can't share the book with family. They had to buy their own.
This author is fantastic - our book club loves her writing - a message with wit!
"Having grown up in a Catholic household, I was surprised to learn things that I had never encountered before in my Continuing Catholic Development weekly Sunday school sessions!"
Great bible study for Christmastime.
"this is a wonderful book! I learned so much about the three women ms, higgs wrote about. I recommend this book to everyone. I can see readng this every Christmas."
Easy read but thought pervoking.
"Love, love, LOVE the writing of Liz Curtis Higgs! She is so insightful. Her writing is brilliant, entertaining, and meaningful. If you haven't read her writing yet, get this book. It's a great place to start. AND get ready for Christmas! I LOVE Lizzie!"
The books arrived on time in perfect shape and we couldn't be happier.  This is one of my favorite authors and about something I love can't wait to share with all the women in my family!  This book will be the perfect gift for our family this year!
Informative. Easy to read
Nice book
great little book quick read
Great book about the women in the Christmas stories including Elizabeth
"If I'm writing this review a second time, it's worth it.  Liz Curtis Higgs brings her scholarship, insight and just plain good sense to anything she does.  And she didn't disappoint with this book, either.  Enjoy it yourself this Christmas."
"After several years, I've come to expect thought provoking, deeply research Truth from Liz Curtis Higgs. Her obvious love for our Triune God is evident. I learn and so much with her books!"
I love everything Liz Curtis Higgs. This book is no different. I lead my small group through this over Christmas and it was perfect. We watched the parts of the Nativity Story she suggests and it was just a really light and refreshing study to do over a crazy holiday season. We learned a lot about the ladies around the Christmas story of Jesus' birth. It's a book I love to read now each season.
"I have heard of L.C. Higgs, but this is my first time to read any of her work. Wow! I love this. It really opened my eyes to scripture passages that I've read many times, but Higgs sheds new light and re-ignites my passion in scripture reading. She weaves such a beautiful connection between these women. A very inspiring read, and I plan on reading it each Christmas from now on."
Awesome book a must read. I read with a group of ladies during Christmas and it touched my heart
I never thought of these 3 women as to the way Liz has written about them.  It made me stop and think and pray over what I had just read.  I am certainly thankful that I grew up with this beautiful writer.
Beautiful study that provides a new look at an old story. I loved taking time to look at the details that I had skipped over the years.
I loved this book.  It was such an easy read.  Liz Curtis Higgs is great.  I am anxious to read the other books written by her that I have bought.  Just need more time & fewer distractions.
"An excellent picture of the woman and men involved in the Christmas story. For a older person who has celebrated the birth of Jesus many times over, it gave fresh insight and challenge."
Bought for a women‚Äôs book club st church... really liked the book!
"I liked the book, however, I didn't love it. I expected something a little bit different, like a novel not a paraphrased story. I feel I could have read the bible instead. I don't know maybe if I hadn't been expecting something else I would have liked it move. I enjoy watching Her on u tube!"
"I loved the conversational style of this book. It was amazing to literally take the story verse by verse. Liz brought out a lot of ideas that made me really think about some of the facts of the Christmas Story in a different way.I actually used this book at my church as an Advent Study and followed her suggestion of using the movie The Nativity as a companion video for the book.The actual book focused on three very important women within the Christmas story - Elizabeth, Mary and Anna. Her descriptions and explanations brought the characters to life and truly made you ""walk"" in their shoes.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to go deeper into the lives of those women within the Christmas Story.Thank you WaterBrook for sending me this copy in exchange for only my honest review."
Will probably study over and over on many Christmas to come! Great for small group or just for informative read on your own. Loved the insight in Anna's story. Great read!
Powerful book!
"I love the way Liz gets deep into the lives of the women of the Bible. Her insight brings them to life not just as characters in a history book, but real people with struggles in need of a savior. I recommend this book to everyone."
I learned so much from this book. There were things in this book that I never knew about. Try it for yourself!
A Special Lady is Liz Curtis Higgs.  You can never go wrong when you order her books or if you attend a women's conference where she is guest speaker.  You will love this book.
Nice book to enjoy for the celebration of Christmas.
Love her books!
Buy this book and start reading it right after Thanksgiving. It really prepared me to celebrate Christmas from a whole new angle.
"I received this book as an early Christmas gift from a dear friend, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it before Christmas.  It is a book I would highly recommend.  It was a great way to prepare for the birth of Jesus :)"
I really enjoyed this book. It went through the book of Luke verse by verse examining these women of Christmas.  I learned so much that I had previously just not seen in the Word.  A great book to get your focus back on the miracle of Christmas.
Great devotional
"Beautiful story, I am going to buy a few copies for some of my family. I think this will be a Christmas tradition for me. It was so nice take time for myself and read these stories."
This is a great seasonal book.  Liz Curtis Higgs has a way of giving the detail both Biblical and personal interpretation to make for an interesting and thought provoking read.
"A very enjoyable book, especially at Christmastime. I also enjoyed learning more about each of these special, beautiful women of long ago. I feel I know them better than I did before reading this."
Good read
"Although this book focuses on Elizabeth, Mary and Anna, it does not leave out the men of Christmas either. This book was an easy read, but brought many good points to mind. A very good book."
I love this book as it gives a fresh perspective on the timeless Christmas story.  This is a welcome addition to my growing Christmas resource library!
A must read for everyone.
"If you need time for yourself, away from the to do list and wrapping paper, read The Women of Christmas. It will be a treat for yourself. I highly anticipated my quiet time each day as I would escape into the world of Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna and through the writing of Liz Curtis Higgs and the Word of God, was able to see God's hand on the lives of these women. It was a constant beautiful reminder of the true meaning of Christmas."
I never got it
These is an excellent short book that I used for my Bible Study during the month of December. She makes the women‚Äôs stories come alive and I saw things I had t seen in their stories before!
Received in great shape
Got the book for a women‚Äôs bible study  the price was great
I loved the insight she had on all the women.
Excellent book! Able to relate to the women and understand their roles to Jesus's birth.
Very informative and interesting. Love her writing style.
"IF YOU HAVE NEVER READ HER OR SEEN HER IS PERSON,  YOU ARE MISSING OUT.SHE IS COMING TO ROCKLIN IN DECEMBER 2013, AND I AM GOING TO SEE MRS. HIGGS."
"Very much to be enjoyed, and thought provoking.  Everything that LC Higgs writes is worth reading, I have given this book to several of my friends.  It can be enjoyed year after year during Advent."
Great read.
I love all of Mrs. Higgs' books both the fiction and non-fiction.  She is a master of communicating and also a wise woman of God.  She really makes you feel like you know these women and are their friends!
This book is wonderful  out of all the books I have reas from Liz Curtis Higgs this is the best. I love the way she puts her humor into it
Studied this book with my small group at church.  Then bought several copies to give as Christmas gifts.  Great book.
"I absolutely love Liz Curtis Higgs and I could hear her speaking as I read the book. She really sets the scene so that you can imagine what it was like to be in each woman's shoes, which gives you such a greater understanding of the story that you read in the bible. An excellent read anytime not just at Christmas."
"I ordered the book specifically to use for our Saturday Ladies Bible Study, which are scheduled every other week.  What a great way to get a closer ""look"" at the  women (and their men) of the Christmas story.  And the study guide in the back helps to open our hearts and minds to how we can apply the character traits  of these women to our own lives.  It is definitely a good time spent!"
"This book is an excellent help in preparing for Christmas. I learned so much from the story of Elizabeth, Mary and Anna as well as Joseph and Simon. I highly recommend this book for individual study as well as a group study."
It made a wonderful gift to myself .
I ordered this for my girlfriend for Christmas. She enjoyed it so much.
I ordered two books my mistake and would like to return one
Came as described.
"Wonderful!  This is a great Liz Curtis Higgs book.  As usual she is funny, whimsical and thought-provoking!  A great read!"
"Liz breaks down the Christmas story in digestible bites through the lives of the Mary, Elizabeth and Anna.  She sheds light on the historical and geographical aspects of the time Christ was born that most authors don't cover.  It sheds a new light, especially from a woman's view point."
Good read
"As always, Liz Curtis Higgs presents a well-researched study of Bible personalities. My Bible Study group and I are enjoying using this as our Advent Christmas study. I highly recommend it!"
I purchased this book for 2 friends as Christmas gifts and one for me. I can't even begin to tell you how great it was to read in detail about the birth of our Lord. I loved the way Liz explained everything with the back story. I would recommend this to everyone!!
Very clearly written and easy to understand the Author's points.
"Not finished with it yet or I might have picked all the stars. I do  love this fresh look, especially in the season of celebrating the great time in the Christians History."
"This was one of the best written books I have read in a long time. It was thought provoking, and imformative. It made the reader come to realize the importance of these three women in christian history."

This book was such a blessing.  Liz did an excellent job writing this in a down to earthapplicable to our lives...... Highly recommend it
"What a wonderful, fresh perspective on the Christmas story and all that it tells us about God's love and care for us."
The Women of Christmas is well-written and thoughtful. Beautiful explanations of the value of women to Jesus. I love this book!
Gave a good representation of the role these women played. Also provided a different perspective. This book would be great for a women's ministry group.
Very interesting study. We enjoyed it
This book caused me to ponder what choices would I have made in these different women's places in life and times.
Great authorAwesome way to start the holidays
Really enjoyed this bible study.  So many things to consider about Mary and the other characters in the Christmas story.

Great book - enlightening as to the background behind the Christmas story!
Excellent
"I really enjoyed this book immensely. I actually looked forward to reading it because it gave me such a new, refreshing perpsective on a story I thought I pretty much knew- I was so wrong! It renewed and excited my faith in the miracles that God has provided for us."
I have enjoyed this book a lot. Higgs' writing style makes for easy reading and gives the reader an inspirational perspective of the ladies at the true heart of Christmas.
"I bought this for my mother-in-law who lives in Montana. She does not get to the bookstore very often, and so I am always looking for books that she might enjoy. When I called her on December 26, she told me she had already read half the book. That makes it a winner."
Wonderful Bible Study for all ages.  The youth are as active in discussions as the women.  We are in week 4 a lot to think about and discuss.  Wonderfully written.
I thought this book was well written and enjoyable to read this holiday season.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for something new to read at Christmas
This was purchased as a short Bible Study.  It has been a very enjoyable experience reading it in the weeks leading up to Christmas.
New thoughts on age-old stories which guide our lives. Liz Curtis Higgs joggles the memory and infuses the heart and soul with new ideas helping to increase the depth of our spiritual awakenings.
Good read!
I have a new take on Mary and Elizabeth.  I have known these ladies through the Bible for at least 70 years.  Thank you Liz for new insights.  It really has made Christmas 2014 special.  I may read it through again the week of Christmas.
"I love everything Liz Curtis Higgs writes!  She opens my mind and heart to allow new concepts and perspectives on God and His love for us.  Christmas is my favorite time of the year and this book proves, once again, God's profound ""organizational skills"" for generations to come.  I look forward to reading more material written by Liz."
Refreshing look at women so familiar to us. A nice way to revisit Christmas through new eyes.
"Beautiful, enjoyed every moment of this book~"
Great book
Excellent book. Using it for my Ladies Bible study.
This book was a Christmas favorite.
Love this book.
My favorite author - Liz Curtis Higgs!  Her books are awesome and this one is definitely up to her standard.
I love how this book draws its information from the bible and then explains it in today's context. It then goes back to the perspective of the focus women. A great bible study or personal study source for Christmas time.
I bought these as Christmas gifts.  I love everything that Liz writes.  She has a great writing style and brings these women to life in a modern day spin.  I can't wait for my girls and family to open their gifts.  What an amazing book...... Highly recommended.
It was a good book to get you thinking about some of the key stories and people surrounding Jesus' birth. Good for a book discussion.
Wonderfully written. A read again every year !
I bought this book to give as Christmas presents and heard from the recipients that the book was just what they needed. Liz is a great writer.
This is an excellent book.  It came in time for my Sunday School teaching on Mary and Elizabeth.  Great insights.
We used this book as an 8-week book discussion/Bible study before Christmas.  Everyone enjoyed the experience.
Good devotion. Less story
"Liz is a great writer she really knows how to get her readers interested in the story.  All of her books are down to earth easy to read and understand and bring a new and refreshing view of the people of the bible, bring them all to life."
"My ladies are doing this for our Bible study.  We all think it is one of her best books yet.  This book will make you think of Christmas in a whole new way.  It is truly a book to be read, pondered, and treasured."
"I received my package on date it was promised. I ordered this book for myself and as gifts for four friends. We all agree it us a most uplifting and eye opener for us women, it's message gave us much for discussion. I am going to recommend it to my Bible Study leader for a future class."
"I bought this book last year. Enjoyed it very much! I'm going to be reading it again this year, at Christmas time."
Wonderful book!
Good book

"Quick shipping, item exactly as described, very satisfied."

Perfect for Christmas for yourself or others!
nice
Wonderful book!!  It made my advent season!
"This is a great book to read at anytime of the year.  We NEVER hear enough about Mary, Elizabeth and Anna and what it was like for them, or who they were, what they felt like in reality except at Christmas time."
"I learned so much more than I had known about Elizabeth, Mary and Anna.  It was a great study for our single mom's group through the Christmas season.  I loved that I could also follow her blog to get even more insights."
I have a new respect for the women of Christmas! So good to learn more and better understand the role these important women played.
This will be a great gift for Christmas
"A Great read, I would encourage Anyone to read. Very inspiring and encouraging - easy to read, yet captivating and thought provoking."

Great. I love Liz Curtis Higgs
Very good. Enjoyed it
"Love her writing always directing us to the Word. The bible is the real book, I love her direction to read it."
very enspiring
This is a GREAT boy to read before Christmas. It is truly based on the Bible and gives you a look at really how it was for Mary and Elizabeth in the Christmas story! Wonderful author!
Loved digging into a piece of the Christmas story of the women of Christmas. Was encouraged by these brave strong God loving women. Highly recommend this book anytime of the year.
This book is very thoughtfully and beautifully written.  It makes the  story of Christmas new again.I used it as a women's study and we all loved it.
"Used it as a study guide for our Women's Bible study group this Advent, and that made it even more meaningful."
very good buy
This book is very much scripture based and well researched as well as informative and reassuring.  It made the Christmas story alive and personal to us.
Loved having a clearer look at the women who bring joy and love to the story of the Christ child.
My very favorite Christmas read!!!!!
Awesome - simply awesome!
My wife enjoyed the book enough to buy some for Christmas gifts for friends (including family). Will perhaps buy more.
Wonderful December read! Used it for a Women's class at church and everyone enjoyed it--engaging writing and wonderful scholarship on Higgs' part!
"Just started to read it, and so far LOVE it !!!So far I'm learning a lot.It would make a great Christmas gift."
"A new perspective told in a unique, conversational style. This book will be a special addition to my advent preparation each year!"
most timely
Liz's writing puts you right there with these wonderful women of Christmas. You feel their emotions in a whole new way.
"I was like now I am finished with the book now what. Now to use study guide of these three tremendous women,"
Great study for Christmas.
Always enjoy anything written by Liz Curtis Higgs!
Ms. Higgs is a great storyteller and what better story to tell! You will see Christmas in a new way and your heart will be filled!
Always a good author to read :)
"i loved this book, every lady young or old will feel the same as i did, go get a copy or borrow mine."
Everything was great
I expected something more from this book. It wasn't bad. I based my purchase on the reviews of this author and was disappointed.
I got this book to use for a Bible study.  It caught my interest at page one and kept it all the way through.  Quick easy read.
Love it.
Great reading for prayer time and meditation during Advent or any liturgical season. I think it would be ideal for a group study at a parish.
Liz has a way of taken the veil aside from the probably best known stories of our Lord's birth and cause you to see a bit deeper. Challenging to what we always think we know with the truth.
I love the book. Liz always delivers a great book. very thought out. And you know she has dug into the Bible and brings everything together for us today.every detail brings out how to apply it to our lives and that is what is so helpful.Betty Boyle
"In following the familiar stories of three women surrounding the birth of Christ, Liz Curtis Higgs gives us a fresh look at their lives and their hearts as revealed in scripture. I found myself particularly drawn to the story of the old prophetess Anna. She was old and bold. ""When no-one else in authority was proclaiming the birth of the Messiah, this old woman was telling the world."" She was not afraid to speak up and speak out what God had revealed to her heart. I've been doing a lot of 'pondering' this Christmas season and was wondering about some of my own personality traits. Anna's story gives me hope for my own journey into being the old and bold woman...bold but filled with God's grace and wisdom. I'm encouraged to allow God to temper my rough edges while speaking His love and His message to others.I'm thankful that Liz points to David, who once wrote these words...""The Lord announces the word, and the women who proclaim it are a mighty throng.""You can read this book quickly, but I would encourage you to slow down and really savor the message of what God is doing in and through each of these women of Christmas.I think this would make a great book club read for the Christmas season. There is a short study guide in the back of the book that would be useful for this.This is a book that I will revisit year after year."
"It's a quick read, only took me a couple evenings. I love her conversational style of writing. It's like she's just telling me a story. I want to curl up on her sofa with some tea or coffee and just chat.This is not the typical advent study. It does discuss Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna, but it's so refreshing to hear this spin on it.These women are brought alive in the books as we ponder each verse, each event, the omissions as well as the details. Even thought I've read the verses in the Bible numerous times and taught them to my children each holiday during our advent studies, I learned so much and prayed through this book that it would touch my girls' hearts this season. I plan to read a chapter or so each day for my girls. I just know they'll love it!Each chapter open with a beloved Christmas carol or hymn and those set the themes for the chapters. Love this! I'm also fascinated by the description of the angels and the important they play in the Christmas story. Interspersed are encouraging and enlightening quotes from women from Liz's online Bible study. Women just like you!Silence is just as important as shouting in the Christmas story and in our Christian lives. The ultimate theme in the book for me was the difference in voices, all important to God in their own way: struck silent, singing, praising, shouting, praying, pondering, worshiping.I love how God uses the ordinary in extraordinary ways. We idolize people in the Bible stories, imagining they were so different and we could never do that, but oh, yes we can! These women were faithful. Elizabeth's husband questioned. Mary's betrothed worried. Despite it all, they were obedient. I pray that I could be obedient and faithful too. God can use anyone for His purposes.Eight wondrous chapters tell the tales of these three ordinary women surrounding the coming of Christ as a babe. A study guide helps us on the journey to celebrate this event with joy."
"Author Liz Curtis Higgs wrote in the first chapter of this 2013 book, ‚ÄúThree women played vital roles in the Messiah‚Äôs birth: Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna‚Ä¶ Their lives were markedly different. Elizabeth was married, settled, mature. Her kinswoman Mary was young, still living at home, and engaged to a carpenter. Anna was an elderly widow whose every waking hour was wholly dedicated to God. Before we reach the final page, we‚Äôll understand why God chose them‚Ä¶ We‚Äôll also spend time with the men in their lives, including an old priest called Zechariah, a new husband named Joseph, and a brother of the faith known as Simeon. Still, it‚Äôs the women who carry the story, teaching us by example to wait upon the Lord, to trust him with everything that matters to us, to pray until our prayers are answered.‚Äù (Pg. 3-4)She observes, ‚ÄúZechariah believed in God, but he wasn‚Äôt certain the Lord could overcome an obstacle like Elizabeth‚Äôs infertility. No, the man wanted proof. REALLY? Wasn‚Äôt the appearance of an angel enough? This elderly priest should have known God was trustworthy‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs easy for me to find fault with this man---and hard to admit how many times I‚Äôve done the same thing‚Ä¶ The promises of God seem ‚Äòtoo good to be true---too hard to believe!‚Äô Yet BELIEVING is what Christmas is all about.‚Äù (Pg. 17-18)She explains, ‚ÄúIn Mary‚Äôs time barely one hundred people called Nazareth home. They were hardworking folk. Laborers, shepherds, tradesmen, farmers. Some lived in limestone and clay-walled homes‚Ä¶ The poorest families dwelled in caves. Little wonder that when he first met Jesus, Nathaniel scoffed, ‚ÄòNazareth! Can anything good come from there?‚Äô Yet God considered this insignificant village worthy of his attention..‚Äù (Pg. 40-41)She notes, ‚ÄúMary was very young---twelve to twelve and a half, perhaps even younger. Girls were betrothed as soon as they could bear children, both to protect their innocence and to allow for many healthy years of childbearing. Babies having babies, we‚Äôd say today But two thousand years ago that was how things were done.‚Äù (Pg. 42)She comments, ‚Äúthe traveling distance between Mary‚Äôs Galilean town of Nazareth and Elizabeth‚Äôs home outside old Jerusalem is seventy, eighty, or one hundred miles, depending on which path you take‚Ä¶ Joseph was left behind, uninformed. Betrothed couples weren‚Äôt allowed to speak to each other without someone else present. But she could hardly tell Joseph about her angelic visitors with curious villagers standing around.‚Äù (Pg. 63-64)Of John (later, ‚ÄúJohn the Baptist‚Äù), she says, ‚Äú[Was] John‚Äôs life ‚Ä¶ one of ease with God at the helm? Not for a moment. We can be sure he still ‚Ä¶ got into childish mischief, and was disciplined by his father. As old as his parents were, John might have been orphaned at a young age---tragic to think about, yet almost a certainty. And his story abruptly ends with his brutal beheading by Herod. No, John did not have an easy life. Even so, he was God‚Äôs man, doing God‚Äôs will, honoring God‚Äôs name.‚Äù (Pg. 95)She recounts, ‚ÄúSince Mary was ‚Äòfound‚Äô to be pregnant, she must not have confessed it verbally, Instead, her changing figure no doubt gave her away‚Ä¶ Because we know the happy ending, we often forget the harrowing beginning. Mary would have been shunned in her small village. Every door would have been closed to her; every friend would have deserted her‚Ä¶. Her betrothal only complicated matters. Either the unborn child was Joseph‚Äôs, which marked them both as guilty of sexual immorality, or the child belonged to another man, which meant Mary was an adulteress‚Ä¶ In Judea, ‚Äòthe punishment was death by stoning.‚Äô ‚Ä¶ Everything depended on the husband‚Äôs testimony. He alone could claim her as his wife or charge her with adultery.‚Äù (Pg. 102-103)She points out, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs something that often goes unnoticed: Joseph doesn‚Äôt say a word in Scripture. He wasn‚Äôt unable to speak, as Zechariah was. But whatever Joseph said, his words came and went unrecorded.‚Äù (Pg. 110)Of the trek to Bethlehem, she notes, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt be certain how close to term Mary was, but definitely ‚Äòin the later stages of her pregnancy.‚Äô Tradition and Hollywood often show her reaching the edge of town at the first contraction, but that‚Äôs not found in Scripture. She and Joseph may have been in Bethlehem for some time before she went into labor. With a sigh of relief, was can probably let go of the image of an about-to-give-birth Mary being jostles on the back of a donkey.‚Äù (Pg. 119-120)She states, ‚ÄúNow consider this: the first person to hold the newborn Christ was Mary of Nazareth, and the first person to touch the newly risen Christ, however briefly, was Mary of Magdala. God placed himself in a woman‚Äôs care when he came to earth, then entrusted a women to announce his resurrection when he came back to life. When I hear women rail that the Bible is misogynistic, I wonder if we‚Äôre reading the same book. God loves women, redeems women, empowers women---then and now.‚Äù (Pg. 122)She acknowledges, ‚ÄúScholars differ on the timing of the wise men‚Äôs arrival. Was it soon after Christ‚Äôs birth? Months later? Two years later?... Some time had indeed passed‚Ä¶ because the Maji came not to a stable or a lean-to or a cave but to a true house‚Ä¶ And Jesus was no longer a new-born‚Ä¶ but ‚Äòa child under training,‚Äô old enough to respond to discipline and instruction.‚Äù (Pg. 141, 144)She writes, ‚ÄúMary was standing in the temple court with the Christ child in her embrace when he was ‚Äòtaken notice of by one Anna.‚Äô ‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs Anna, our final woman of Christmas. ‚ÄòThere was also a prophet, Anna.‚Äô [Lk 2:36] Yes, a FEMALE prophet‚Ä¶ a rare creature in Scripture. You‚Äôll find only a handful of them mentioned: Miriam, Deborah, Huldah, Noadiah, the wife of Isaiah, and in the New Testament the daughters of Philip the evangelist.‚Äù (Pg. 167-168)This is an excellent book: well-researched, without this research being ‚Äúobtrusive.‚Äù It will be of tremendous interest and value to Christians seeking to go deeper into the biblical material of the birth of Jesus."
"This book review was one that I really wanted to write before Christmas. I just got so wrapped up in the season of Christmas I did not get it done.The Women of Christmas is a wonderful book! I just love Liz Curtis Higgs. This book is the third Bible study of hers I have done and can I just say that I love the way she writes and brings Biblical characters to life. I should not call these women characters. They were real people who existed. Women that God used to advance His kingdom here on earth. Ordinary women just like you and me.You will meet Mary the mother of Jesus, Elizabeth the mother of John the Baptist and Mary‚Äôs cousin and Anna who lived and served in the temple most of her of her adult life.Three ordinary women who made a huge impact on the world.  Three women that were waiting for the Messiah. I have learned so much from these women through Liz‚Äôs writing.  Mary who was just a young girl, but God had a huge for her life. One that would change many lives including my own. She was just a normal young girl, but God knew her heart. He knew that she was fit to be the mother of God‚Äôs own Son.Elizabeth who was shamed in being unable to bear children and thought God would never answer her prayer of longing for a child. He did. In His own time.And finally Anna. Anna who became a widow early in her married life and then went on to serve in the temple. Everyday. She knew where she wanted to be. She waited for the Messiah!Can you imagine living in the time where there was no Jesus? We live in a time today when we are waiting for Jesus to return to us. These three women lived in a time where Jesus did not exist here on earth. We live in a time where we have the Holy Spirit. They lived in a time where sacrifices were made. We live in a time where Jesus was the sacrifice for all.Out of these three women I can relate to Elizabeth the most. Longing for a child and wondering why God would not allow me to become a mother and wondering why. God granted Elizabeth what she most wanted just not in the way she expected or in the time she expected. I can relate to that so much in my own life.The Women of Christmas is a remarkable book. You will perhaps identify with these wonderful women. Women just like you and me. We also learn about Joseph, Zachariah and Simeon who also waited for the Messiah.Even though the title says Christmas please do not let that deter you from reading this wonderful book now. It is not just a Christmas story. It is a story for today. For everyday. You will not be disappointed if you read it. I promise.disclosure: I received a copy of this book from Blogging for Books in exchange for my honest opinion. No other compensation was received. All opinions are my own."
"Step with me into the Bible, into the stories of Elizabeth, Mary and Anna ‚Äì there story is much like ours ‚Äì mothers, want to be mothers, women who have dreams and women who serve the Lord, even at the expense of their reputations, their independence and their marriage.  Their stories are so much more than ours though!  The mother of Jesus, Savior of the people.  The mother of John, who prepares the way for his cousin.  A woman who has been a widow many years and who dedicates her whole life to the Lord by living in the Temple, fasting and praying and is a prophetess.  Usually we read about these women in passing ‚Äì oh we know their roles but do we really?  Do we really understand and recognize their roles in the Christmas story?  I‚Äôm talking of venerating them or of elevating them to some super human pedestal.  Just knowing them.Liz Curtis Higgs brings us these three women to show us that despite popular opinion God isn‚Äôt misogynistic ‚Äì in fact He loves women and He loves to us.  We don‚Äôt need to be in a pulpit to glorify Him or take His Word to the world.  Liz points out how these three women, who were nothing in society‚Äôs eyes ‚Äì a barren woman, a young virgin, and a widow with no family ‚Äì gave them purpose and all were blessed in different ways and were used to bring about God‚Äôs great plan.  Some may scoff at this.  Why should God need to use anyone, as if being used by the God of your life is something bad ‚Äì as we are to be His hands and feet on earth.  I know the joy that comes with the birth of each of my children ‚Äì how much more so was Elizabeth‚Äôs joy after years of barrenness knowing her son was destined for something great?  How much so when Mary carries the Savior or how much joy to Anna when she gets to hold Him?There are points that have been lost through the years ‚Äì such as how many angels really appeared to the shepherds.  How many wise men really came? Three? Fourteen? Twenty-one?  How old was Jesus when the wise men did arrive ‚Äì most agree that He was older than a babe.  How often do we focus on what the women of the story brings?  These were three figures that played predominantly in the story and had a lot of play in bringing God‚Äôs plan to fruition ‚Äì come, join me in discovering more about these women.  There is also an included study guide if you‚Äôd like to delve even deeper and a suggested schedule of how to read the book in the weeks leading up to Christmas.**I was given a copy of this book from Waterbrook Multnomah in exchange for posting my own opinion, no other compensation was given."
"The Women of Christmas by Liz Curtis Higgs is a wonderful book for the Christmas season or for any time of the year. The book covers the lives of Mary, Elizabeth, and Anna in the months before the birth of Jesus and a few weeks after His birth. Each woman is presented through Bible scriptures and the narrative of the author. Mary is newly betrothed but she is pregnant, Elizabeth is old and barren but she also becomes pregnant, and Anna is old, widowed, and lives in the Temple waiting for the arrival of the Messiah. Of course the story also includes Joseph a carpenter who is betrothed to Mary, Zechariah a priest who is the husband of Elizabeth, and Simeon also a priest and living each day waiting to see the promised Messiah. The one thing that all three women have in common is that their hearts belong to God. And Mary and Elizabeth are blessed to have husbands that love and obey God.Liz Higgs does an excellent job in presenting the story of these three women and showing the involvement in and contribution of each of them in the Christmas story. The style of the writing made for easy reading and enjoyment. Liz wrote a paragraph or two to introduce each woman and then a verse of scripture was given and Liz would then give her interpretation of that verse, another verse was given, Liz would interpret, and this style of writing was continued throughout the entire book.. This form was also used for the three men in the story. This style of writing made the Christmas story so easy to understand and brought new thoughts to mind even though I have been hearing and reading the Christmas story for decades. A study guide is presented at the end for individual or small group study. This is a small book but it packs a big punch.I definitely recommend this book to all who would like to know more about Mary, Elizabeth, and Anna and their participation in the Christmas story.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Waterbrook Multnomah Publishers through their Blogging for Books program in exchange for an honest review. I was not required to give a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own."
"The Women of Christmas: Experience the Season Afresh with Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna, by beloved author Liz Curtis Higgs, is a beautiful addition to any Christmas preparation in your home. Taking the verses in Luke apart a few at a time, Higgs leads us through close up looks at these three women so instrumental in the life of our Savior as He made His earthly appearance in Israel. We look at Elizabeth, mother of John the Baptist, and the beautiful grace visited upon a barren older woman. We look at Mary and her simple faith that defied the social stigma she surely faced. And we look at Anna, an intensely devoted elderly woman who was spiritually ravenous for a glimpse of her promised Messiah.I particularly like the conversational tone Higgs takes through the book. A group of us could be gathered for a home Bible study around her as she reads a few verses and then expounds on them, bringing forth our thoughts on the things she brings up. Most of all, I like how she weaves many different translations into her descriptions of the scenes, making them part of her commentary. I personally like to look at different translations of the Bible in my reading, so this was a special treat.My favorite character as described by Higgs is Anna, a woman ""always in a praying frame"" and with a ""strangely expectant faith."" She's basically who I want to be when I grow up!I would recommend this book be kept on the coffee table during Christmas season for devotional use, or that you purpose to read it through fresh each year. Liz Curtis Higgs' website is here, and if you'd like to read the first chapter of the book you can do so here. While you are visiting her site, take a look at the many other books she has written: nonfiction, contemporary and historical fiction, and even childrens' books. I was blessed to receive a complimentary copy of this book for review purposes from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing."
"I really enjoyed reading this book during the Christmas season. Learning more about Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna gave a new, refreshing look at the events leading up to Jesus‚Äô birth, when He was born, and the days right after His birth. The Lord used each of these women in a profound way and they were all faithful servants of the Lord! To have the patience, commitment, and love of these ladies is what I desire!"
"Liz Curtis Higgs possesses the God-given ability to breathe life into familiar biblical accounts that we often unfortunately take for granted.  The Women of Christmas is a short but powerful exploration of the three women who had a crucial role to play in the birth of Christ.  Exploring the inner conflict, ultimate trust and quiet humility of Elizabeth, Mary and Anna will inspire us to strive to emulate our biblical sisters.Mrs. Higgs deftly explains the culture within which these women were raised, showing how each one risked their very reputations in their following of God's leading.  This verse-by-verse study also introduces us to the men who had to choose whom they would trust.  I particularly loved the author's emphasis on the need for silent waiting upon God.  As we read Luke Chapter 1 and 2, we see that verbal pronouncements are inspired by direct prompting of the Holy Spirit, and that each one is a joyful exaltation of God.  As an example, Zechariah, (Elizabeth's husband), was struck mute in order that he might reflect upon God's awesome ability to accomplish the impossible.  Only when his son, John, Christ's forerunner, is born can Zechariah once again speak.  By contrast, Mrs. Higgs points out that Joseph never says a word in Scripture, yet his actions speak volumes.  Mrs. Higgs made me see God's wondrous working within the lives of these individuals, showing how He uses the humblest among us so that His glory will be revealed.I particularly loved learning more about Anna, the devoted and devout woman who served at God's temple and proclaimed Christ to all those there.  Ashamedly, I had often read over the verses about her hurriedly, never stopping to consider that this elderly woman, widowed at a young age, was granted a wondrous gift.  Her humble life of fasting and prayerful service to God moved me so much, for I realized how Jesus came for everyone, poor and rich, married and unmarried, the elderly and the young.My favorite line from the book concerns the event where Jesus was presented to God on the eighth day of His life at the Temple.  Mary brought a pair of doves to sacrifice to the Lord since she and Joseph could not afford a lamb.  As Mrs. Higgs so beautifully points out, ""Mary could not afford a lamb, yet she carried in her arms the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world"", (Chapter 7).This book will open your eyes to the beauty of God's intricate work within history as He chose to become poor for each and every one of us.  May we, like the women of Christmas, express our praise and thanksgiving to this awesome Savior."
"We all know about the greatest birth in history, the birth of Jesus Christ.  We know about the angels, the shepherds, the wise men, King Herod, and the manger. But have we ever taken a really good look at the women who were a part of the story too?Elizabeth, an aging woman who was barren.Mary, a young woman betrothed to be married.Anna, an elderly widow living out her days and nights in the temple.All in different places in their lives, doing different things but all on the brink of having their lives changed forever by the Lord.This book by popular author Liz Curtis Higgs helps us take a look at the birth of Jesus and the events leading up to it through the eyes of the three pivotal women who God chose to use in His plan.Each chapter is titled after a significant line in favorite Christmas hymns, and is utterly overflowing with Scriptural references and notations. Breaking down the Biblical account of each woman, line by line, this book will draw you into a world brimming with trials, hope, and faith.Can you imagine the joy that Elizabeth felt when she discovered she was with child despite her old age and life of barrenness? That baby, that special child growing inside her would be one of the most influential people in her time to lead people to Christ.What about Mary?  A young girl, a virgin, awaiting to be married to a humble carpenter.  Then one day she is visited by an angel of the Lord and told the most important message she would ever receive in her life.  She would bear the Christ child.Then there is Anna, a prophetess who has the amazing privilege of seeing and touching the newborn Jesus because of her devotion and righteousness.Liz Curtis Higgs brings these women to life in an inspiring way to help readers look at the birth of Christ with a new perspective.  This would make an excellent read during this Christmas season.O Come Let Us Adore Him."
"With advent being one of my favorite topics to read about, this book caught my eye. Higgs walks through Luke's Christmas story, chapters 1-...and she creates sentences and paragraphs by stringing together different translations and paraphrases of the Bible. Example: (pg. 10, 87, 90)...She also includes the opinions of women who attended the original Bible Study that this book was birthed from. Sometimes these women state the obvious, sometimes they share something encouraging, sometimes they share what they have learned from the verse at hand; but sometimes they read into the text, example: 68, 78, 81  I really enjoyed how Higgs explains some greek words that add to the richness of our understanding. She also explains some traditions that add to my appreciation of the season, like ""gratia plena"" and other Latin words familiar only because of their use in Christmas carols.I wish she had explained thoroughly that she would be quoting from Scripture, and from paraphrases; clearly defining the difference in her sources.  On page 88 she encourages us rightly to value the Word, but an unlearned woman could read this, assume the Message (or NLT or others which she uses liberally throughout her book) was actually a translation instead of what it really is--a man's words based on Scripture, not in any way to be clung to as a translation of the original texts that were inspired.  Higgs also explains some fascinating points of history that really add to our understanding of the Christmas story! For example, page 89 as Zechariah and Elizabeth are naming their son John. All the while, Higgs is teaching us nuggets of truth for our daily lives from this wonderful season in history; for example, when Zechariah begins praising God directly after receiving his voice back. Our temptation in life is to question or grumble but he praises God, and Higgs looks at this from some examples in the Psalms applying the need for praise in our hearts to our daily lives (see page 92).Overall I would recommend this book for someone wanting to meditate on the Christmas story, focusing on each verse and really visualizing and musing on all the Holy Spirit has to convey therein.  I would also like to thank the publisher for providing me with a copy of this book for my review."
"Now that November has arrived everyone seems to be getting ready for Christmas. I am making lots of ornaments for my etsy shop and I started my shopping.  I will wait to decorate until after Thanksgiving because Mom always said we must give thanks first.  Of course, I will probably still turn some Christmas music on while I paint.  The rush to welcome the Christmas season seems to be earlier every year. (The stores have been stocking their shelves for quite some time!) But, how about getting your heart ready for Christmas?I just finished reading The Women of Christmas by Liz Curtis Higgs. The cover invites you to ""Experience the Season Afresh with Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna.""  It is an in-depth look at these three women and their part in the Christmas story. There is also a study guide included at the end of the book. (I wish I had seen that before I actually got to the end or I probably would have taken notes!)I took a lot away from reading this book and I plan on keeping it to read it again. It was so thorough and brought out many details I had never even considered. I learned quite a bit and it made me look at the Christmas story from another perspective. It would be an excellent book for a women's Bible study in the weeks leading up to Christmas. (Even though many groups take a break during this busy season it is even more important to slow down and take a really good look at WHY we are celebrating!) I would highly recommend this book as a way to get your heart and mind focused on the real reason for the season!I received this book for free from Blogging for Books for this review."
"This was an absolutely delightful little book, filled with snippets of the different stories we we're told in the Bible, thoughts from everyday people (like you and I), and the author's whimsical thoughts about each part.The book tells the stories of three women - Mary, the mother of Jesus, Elizabeth, the mother of John, and Anna, the prophetess.  For those of us who have heard the Christmas stories over and over again, you would think it would be the same thing as normal, but it's really not!  The author takes you through the stories piece by piece, commenting on all aspects of what's said - and not said.  I loved the way she made them come to life, and really make sense for us NOW!  She asked questions about parts of the Scriptures that made me laugh out loud, they were so funny.  But she had some really, really great points!At the end of the book is a study guide, with three questions for each chapter.  It's an easy guide, not a whole lot of work there, but would make a great starting point for a small group study, or even for a group of girlfriends who read through the book together.I received a free copy of this book from the publisher, in exchange for an honest review.  The thoughts and opinions expressed here are completely my own."
"Liz Curtis Higgs is one of my favorite authors! I thoroughly enjoyed her recent book The Girl's Still Got It which told the story of Ruth in great detail by dissecting line by line of the scripture. She brings this same writing style and in-depth analysis of the story of Elizabeth, Mary and the birth of Jesus. Maybe because these stories are more familiar to me, I didn't get as much added insight into the stories as I did with her writings on Ruth.However, Liz puts such a great amount of research into writing her books, that you do learn some interesting tidbits along the way about the people, the geography, the culture, etc. For example, the shepherds were among the first people to see the baby Jesus, but I never knew that they were despised in the culture and were regarded as thieves.  Liz mentions that because shepherds were seen as unreliable, they were not even permitted to give evidence in court.  This type of detail does give new dimension to the fact that the shepherds were among the first to hear the news of Jesus' birth and to seek out the newborn baby.This is a fast read and is an interesting source to immerse yourself with the Christmas Story as we head into the holiday season. There are also tips at the end for how to use this book in a small group and a discussion guide is included.I received a complimentary copy of this book from WaterBrook Multnomah in exchange for this fair and unbiased review."
"If you ever read a book by Liz Curtis Higgs (or even if you've never read a book by Liz Curtis Higgs), you definitely need to read this book.  She opens up the Christmas story in a way I've not seen before, focusing on the women God used in bringing the Messiah to His people.  Like the summary says, the author goes verse by verse, going over all the intricate details and presenting old ideas in a new light.  She starts with Elizabeth and the details surrounding the birth of John the Baptist, explaining them in simple but profound ways.  Mrs. Higgs does the same for Mary and Anna but doesn't end there.  She also gives account for the men involved in this important time - Zechariah, Elizabeth's husband; Joseph, Mary's betrothed; and Simeon, a righteous and devout man who was waiting for the birth of the Messiah.  As they are in the gospels, their stories intertwine but Liz lays them out with her trademark humor and way of explaining things.  This book is for anyone looking for a new way to look at and study the events surrounding Jesus' birth.  It is tops on my list and one I look forward to reading again and again.This book was provided by Waterbrook Multnomah for review without compensation."
"Liz Curtis Higgs is one of my favorite ""new to me"" authors. Everything she writes has meaning, humor, and Biblical values. This book is about the three main women during Christ's birth and childhood. Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna. Higgs breaks each story down with Bible verses pointing out details that I have missed before. She asks questions so the reader can realize they were real women, they were people just like me and look at how God used them!The story of Anna is my favorite because it is not one I have thought about much. She is not talked about a lot but in the few verses there is a lot to take away. As the author wrote she would have been someone to look up to. An older woman who became a widow seven years into her marriage. After that, instead of returning to her family home she stayed in the temple worshiping God and telling everyone about Him. She wanted to be His servant and lived her life in a way that pleased Him.Another thing I really enjoyed about this book is how Higgs started each chapter with a song-mostly Christmas songs we all know. Then she picked out one line from that song and used it to lead into her chapter. I like this because it gives me more insight to what the song actually means.This is a great book and perfect as you prepare for the holidays. I love the slight humor that goes along with the Biblical truth!Highly Recommend!! ""I received this book from WaterBrook Multnomah for free in exchange for an honest review."""
"This is a beautiful book about the women of Christmas. I was so incredibly touched and uplifted by this book!Liz Higgs really goes into depth on her study of Elizabeth, Mary and Anna and shows how their faith can be our faith. I loved how she slowly goes through the Scriptures throughout  and then explains what it means and how these women probably felt as God blessed them. I also loved that she is constantly telling us how much God loves us as women. Sometimes, I wonder if we really understand how much the Lord does care for us as women. This book will show you how much He really does love us.She also has comments from the women that did her study throughout the book. I loved this because so many of these comments revealed exactly what I was thinking as I was reading this book. There is so much insight from these ladies that will just bless your heart.This is a wonderful book and would be wonderful as a Bible study for a small group. It's very easy to read and Liz explains everything so well. Since it's written almost like a novel, it really opens up the story around the birth of Christ. It was so special reading this as we prepare to get ready for the Christmas holidays. This would be a wonderful book to read each year before Christmas to prepare our hearts as we celebrate the birth of the Lord's Son. I highly recommend this book!*This book was provided to me for my honest review by the Blogging For Books Program"
"About the Book:A sacred season is about to unfold for three women whose hearts belong to God.Elizabeth is barren, yet her trust in God remains fertile. Mary is betrothed in marriage, yet she is willing to bear God's Son. Anna is a widow full of years, yet she waits patiently, prayerfully for the Messiah to appear in the temple courts.Following in their footsteps, you too can prepare for the Savior to enter your heart, your mind, and your life in a vibrant, new way. Best-selling author Liz Curtis Higgs explores the biblical stories of Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna, unwrapping each verse with tender care and introducing you afresh to The Women of Christmas.About the Author:Liz earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Bellarmine College, and is married to Bill Higgs, Ph.D., who serves as Director of Operations for her speaking and writing office. Liz and Bill share their 19th-century farmhouse in Louisville with their two college-student offspring, Matt and Lilly, and too many cats.My Review: It is no secret to those of us that have read Liz Curtis Higgs' work in the past, she is a remarkable writer. I think I like her best not for the in depth research she presents to us, but for how she lets her personality and own personal experiences come in through the words she places on paper. I just love her! So here I am, I get the chance to review her latest The Women of Christmas. This book is written in the usual Liz fashion but this time she takes us through the lives and thoughts of three very special women that ""all"" had to do with Christmas in some form or fashion. The first lady that the author places at the fore front is Elizabeth and her significance to the Christmas story. God preforms a miracle in her when a barren Elizabeth becomes pregnant with John the Baptist. And we all know that John the Baptist was the announcer that the Messiah was due to arrive soon. Then of course there was Mary, Jesus' mother, she I'm sure went through some ridicule herself becoming pregnant with the Savior. The author ends her fascinating study with Anna, the Prophetess, she prophesied about the Messiah and knew Him when he was presented at the temple. All these women play a special part in Jesus' birth and the proclamation of it. To them we should be truly grateful that they were not afraid to do what God asked them and chose for them to do.**Disclosure** This book was sent to me free of charge for my honest review from the Blogging for Books program."
"I was so excited to see the blogging for books program has one of Liz Curtis Higgs books available. And not just any book, but ""The Women of Christmas!"" I was tickled pink.Liz Curtis Higgs unveils this inspiring book of these three women: Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna. Each one a witness of faith and devotion and showing just how much God loves and values women. She applied what they applied to her life and that we can apply it to our lives in this day and time. It's not ""well that was in biblical times.""Elizabeth though she was barren and the women around her surely talked about how she hadn't or couldn't provide, as a wife should, she still believed God loved her and that his time was perfect. And when she became pregnant she gave him all the credit.Mary, when the angel came to her and told her she would have a son, the Son of God, she didn't question it. She didn't need proof that God could do such a thing. Though she was an unwed virgin, she believed God could do anything and was glad to be a servant and carry our savior.Anna...Mrs. Higgs really shed light on this woman to me. A widow at such a young age, I could only imagine the heartache and loneliness. But instead of wallowing in sorrow and returning home to her family, she stayed. She devoted her life to God. Praising him. Praying to him. Turning that loneliness into love filled relationship with our heavenly father.In her Study guide found inside Mrs. Higgs, through God's word, helped me realize what a godly woman can look like and how she can praise Him and show her faith in ordinary daily life. Like keeping your house in order. Cooking. Cleaning. Working. Gardening. Looking for bargains. And that God can do anything. That there is nothing he can`t do.How often do we say ""Thank you God for making this happen? For loving me. Making me special even when the rest of the world thinks I'm just ordinary. For using me in an extraordinary way. For keeping your promises.""""For no word from God will ever fail."" Luke 1:37 (NIV)This book is phenomenal. Really for any time of season, but especially one so special. It will get you into the spirit and remind you what it's truly all about. Merry Christmas Everyone!WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group provided this book to me for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review as part of their Blogging for Books program.(by Victoria W.)"
"I must admit I love to read anything that Liz Curtis Higgs writes... so when I was offered a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review I grabbed it from Waterbrook Multnomah's Blogging for Books program.I quickly realized this book is a treasure! In the midst of a very busy, hectic, rushed Christmas season - the time I spent reading this book was calming, relaxing, and worshipful. I saw Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna in a new way. I recognized the hardships they faced day to day in a time when it was a disgrace to be barren like Elizabeth, unwed and pregnant like Mary, or widowed for decades like Anna. Despite the struggles each faced, they sought to serve the Lord with their lives and God used them.I loved that Liz also included information about the men in these same stories - Zechariah, Joseph, and Simeon. Again these men were familiar to me, but I saw them in a new way.The Women of Christmas will be pulled off my shelf each December and I am sure as I read and re-read it I will gain new insights into the lives of these servants of God as well as truths that can be applied to my own life and struggles! I appreciate the  clear Bible knowledge and research that Liz shares making Bible people real and alive and Bible truths easy to understand and applicable to my life."
"Liz Curtis Higgs has a way of bringing the women of the Bible to life, which no other author can do. As with her previous books, Higgs has taken women who lived so many hundreds of years ago and made them relatable to today‚Äôs woman. The prose she adds to the beautiful wording of the Bible carry your heart into another place and time, and your heart is forever changed by the beautiful retellings of hope and love displayed by the three woman this book focuses on. We are greeted by a patient Elizabeth, an obedient Mary and a devout Anna. The presentation of characters by Higgs will capture your heart and forever change the way you see these ladies.ExcerptOneJoy to the world, the Lord is come!Let earth receive her King;Let every heart prepare him room,And heaven and nature sing,And heaven and nature sing,And heaven, and heaven, and nature sing.‚ÄîIsaac Watts, ‚ÄúJoy to the World,‚Äù 1719Let Every HeartPrepare Him RoomLong before silver bells jingled, Christmas lights twinkled, and horse-drawn sleighs went dashing through the snow, God reached down from heaven with the best gift of all.Love, wrapped in swaddling clothes. Hope, nestled in a manger.Three women played vital roles in the Messiah‚Äôs birth: Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna. Even if you‚Äôve met them before, I think you‚Äôll enjoy getting to know them better. And I‚Äôll love sharing the journey with you!Their lives were markedly different. Elizabeth was married, settled, mature. Her kinswoman Mary was young, still living at home, and engaged to a carpenter. Anna was an elderly widow whose every waking hour was wholly dedicated to God. Before we reach the final page, we‚Äôll understand why God chose them. And why‚Äîthis part boggles my mind‚ÄîGod has chosen us too.We‚Äôll also spend time with the men in their lives, including an old priest called Zechariah, a new husband named Joseph, and a brother of the faith known as Simeon.Still, it‚Äôs the women who carry the story, teaching us by example to wait upon the Lord, to trust him with everything that matters to us, to pray until our prayers are answered. We‚Äôll also hear from more than two dozen women who shared their comments through my online Bible study. Their honesty and humility bring these ancient stories right into the present, showing us what it means to surrender our lives to the One who loves us most.And he truly does love you. Always has, always will. If only one message from this book finds a home in your heart, let it be that God‚Äôs love for you is wider, longer, higher, and deeper than you can ever imagine!Christmas is so much more than a holiday. So much more than buying and wrapping and cooking and eating and trimming with tinsel and mailing out cards. It‚Äôs a season for reflection, for preparation, for renewal. The perfect time to put aside our shopping lists and reach for our Bibles, where the story of the Christ child awaits us.Curl up in a comfy spot, and let‚Äôs dive in.‚ÄúThis year I want to look up and be refreshed anew by the true meaning of it all.‚Äù ‚ÄîMiriamAnd so we begin with Elizabeth, our first woman of Christmas.Anticipation builds as we turn to the book of Luke. We know what‚Äôs coming. Or do we? The forgotten details, the overlooked truths may catch us by surprise and teach us something new about God and his love for us. The birth of his Son is a story that never grows old, never loses its power to alter our thinking and realign our priorities.Mary is, of course, the most famous of our trio, yet her older kinswoman Elizabeth moved into the limelight first, along with the man she married.  In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah,‚Ä¶ Luke 1:5Just an ordinary priest. The streets of Jerusalem were full of them. Depending on the translation, his name is spelled ‚ÄúZacharias,‚Äù ‚ÄúZachariah,‚Äù even ‚ÄúZachary.‚Äù Same guy. Zechariah was not only a good man; he was also God‚Äôs man, descended from a long line of holy servants.  ‚Ä¶who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah;‚Ä¶ Luke 1:5Abijah was just one of twenty-four divisions, so there were lots of priests. Since the time of Aaron, their duties included handling various offerings, giving thanks, and singing praises at the gates of God‚Äôs dwelling place. A worthy calling, though with so many priests, few were singled out for ministry within the temple‚Äôs Holy Place.Now that we have Zechariah sorted out, here‚Äôs the woman we‚Äôve been eager to meet.  ‚Ä¶his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron. Luke 1:5A popular name, much loved through the centuries. My mother was an Elizabeth, I‚Äôm one too, and so is my daughter-in- law, though each generation picked a different nickname: Betty, Liz, and Beth. The meaning remains the same: ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs promise‚Äù or ‚Äúoath of God.‚ÄùLike her husband, Elizabeth was in Aaron‚Äôs lineage, which made her a fine catch since marrying a woman of priestly ancestry was a special blessing. Among her many tasks Elizabeth kept her husband‚Äôs priestly garments in good repair and welcomed visitors into their home to discuss temple matters.We know this couple. We‚Äôve seen them at church, exchanged smiles in the parking lot. Happily married people, busily serving the Lord, always doing good.  Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord‚Äôs commands and decrees blamelessly. Luke 1:6They lived ‚Äúhonorably before God‚Äù (msg ) and humbly as well, knowing the Lord alone was their source of righteousness. It may sound as if Elizabeth and her husband were obedient and so earned God‚Äôs approval, but, in truth, it was the other way around. God‚Äôs power and strength at work in their lives made it possible for them to do the right thing in the first place.The same is true for us, of course. Though it‚Äôs tempting to praise people for their goodness, it‚Äôs better to praise the One who made them. ‚ÄúFor we are God‚Äôs handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.‚ÄùAfter such cheery news about Elizabeth and her hubby in the opening verses, it‚Äôs time for the other shoe to drop. When God‚Äôs blessings are piled on our heads, it‚Äôs easy to be faithful. The real test comes when disappointment calls and sorrow pulls up a chair.  But they were childless‚Ä¶ Luke 1:7Oh no. Not these two godly souls?Afraid so. Even with all their goodness and righteousness, sadness had crept into their home. In their world children were seen as God‚Äôs reward for faithful service. We can guess the desperate questions that threaded through their minds as each year went by without a child in their arms. Are we not faithful enough, Lord? Have we dishonored you in some way?Whenever they heard the psalmist‚Äôs words ‚ÄúThe fruit of the womb is a divine reward,‚Äù Zechariah and Elizabeth must have steeled themselves, hiding their pain, even as they avoided sidelong glances from their neighbors.  ‚Ä¶because Elizabeth was not able to conceive,‚Ä¶ Luke 1:7Excerpted from The Women of Christmas by Liz Curtis Higgs Copyright ¬© 2013 by Liz Curtis Higgs.

"From the publisher:God Reached Down from Heaven with the Best Gift of AllA sacred season is about to unfold for three women whose hearts belong to God.Elizabeth is barren, yet her trust in God remains fertile. Mary is betrothed in marriage, yet she is willing to bear God‚Äôs Son. Anna is a widow full of years, yet she waits patiently, prayerfully for the Messiah to appear in the temple courts.Following in their footsteps, you too can prepare for the Savior to enter your heart, your mind, and your life in a vibrant, new way. Best-selling author Liz Curtis Higgs explores the biblical stories of Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna, unwrapping each verse with tender care and introducing you afresh to The Women of Christmas.Once again Liz Curtis Higgs has developed an amazing Bible study for women.  Ms. Higgs takes us through the ‚ÄúWomen of Christmas‚Äù, Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna.  How appropriate for this study that it is the season of our Christ‚Äôs birth.Throughout the book are thoughts from women that stop and make you think about what you‚Äôve read and about what God has done in our lives.This is a great study, either on your own or in a group setting.  There is a study guide in the back of the book, where you are given a reading and then have a set of questions to answer.  I would love to see and will use this in a group setting to see other women‚Äôs thoughts on the study.I received this book free from the publisher (WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group)  .

"How would you like to experience the Christmas story in a whole new way and from the perspective of the three most influential women in the story? The Women of Christmas: Experience the Season Afresh with Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna is just the book to make that happen. This is the first book by Liz Curtis Higgs that I have read and I love her writing style‚Ä¶I will have to look into some of her other books.We all know the Christmas story. We read stories about it, we watch movies about it, we sing songs about it. But have you ever thought about it from the side of the three women that were most involved: Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna? Reading this book will give you a whole new appreciation for all they went through. I love how Liz Curtis Higgs weaves in quotes and scriptures to really make the Christmas story come to life! There is even a wonderful study guide for each of the 8 chapters at the end of the book.I loved the retelling of all that Mary may have gone through, from the time the angel visited her until the time Jesus was born. I never really thought about how deeply this would have affected her life, and yet she made no hesitation to answer ‚Äúyes!‚Äù to carrying the Lord‚Äôs son! I can‚Äôt even imagine the emotions she must have experienced! She was one strong girl and was obviously chosen for that very reason.So many times we are made to believe that God doesn‚Äôt use women for important things. But reading this story proves that is far from the truth! He chose these 3 women to do jobs that required a deep and strong faith. They never questioned the job they were given to do. They did it with a faith that we should all have‚Ä¶knowing that God is in control and His way is THE way! What a treasure this book really is!"
"What a wonderful book to begin the Christmas season.  In our busyness at this time of year it brings a peaceful reading of things past. It also takes the stories that we are familiar with and expands on them.It takes the lives of Elizabeth, Mary and Anna to a broader understanding. The author digs through each sentence and each word in scripture.Each of these women's story brings us to a new level and new promise in our own lives.  Liz Curtis Higgs writes like these women are more than a story. More than words in the Bible.It is these women involvement in the most awesome story told, that brings everything alive to us.  The book explains how important each of these women were during the birth of Jesus.  They were an important part of history.If you want to refresh your passion for the Christmas story I recommend this book.  You will come away with a new appreciation for these women. It will reinforce that women today are just as important to God.God used these women in a mighty way, just as He can do in us today.""I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing group for this review."""
"Every year I hear the Christmas story.  Over time, it's easy to assume that we know all there is to know and we can start to tune out the message.  That's why I like to read material that allows me to view the events in a fresh way.  The Women of Christmas highlights the stories of Elizabeth and Mary (which are often told), and the story of Anna (less frequently taught about).  The scriptures written about these women are printed verse by verse, intermixed with Liz's thoughts and commentary.As in many of her books, Liz Curtis Higgs writes in a conversational style.  It almost seems as if she is sitting next to you telling the story herself!  I also like the way that she incorporates wording from different versions of the Bible and identifies them in the text.  The reader can see how the verses are worded, and learn background information to help them understand and relate these stories to their lives.  Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna show us that if we have a willing spirit He can use us, no matter how young or old we are.There is also a study guide included at the back of the book.  Each chapter has a scriptural focus and three major points of discussion to get a small group started.I enjoyed reading about these women in a different way.  I suggest reading this book in December to help you focus on the events surrounding Jesus's birth and the meaning of the Christmas season.*I received a complimentary copy of this book from Waterbrook Multnomah in exchange for an honest review."
"The Women of Christmas by Liz Curtis Higgs has been a blessing to have read during the month of December. So much that I would most assuredly will pick this book up again next year to enjoy and study during the Advent Season.  The author does a beautiful job at giving readers an eye opening fresh look at the story of Mary, Anna, and Elizabeth surrounding the triumphant arrival of our Saviour Christ Jesus.I appreciated the bit of history and culture included focusing on the time that these three ladies were living. We can clearly see how boldly they were for their God pressing on despite the culture! I've always enjoy digging deeper into the era of which our Biblical brothers and sisters resided as it gives a more personal feel and understand as to what was going on. Much praise to the author for giving that insight on those ladies. She has given us so much to ponder!I enjoyed that this book takes us verse-by-verse through the Christmas Story. There are eight chapters total. Suggestions are that you could start reading one chapter a week in early November. Or read two chapters each Sunday of Advent. Or immerse yourself in one chapter a week during the week leading up to Christmas Day. Whatever works best for you or your group!I highly believe that any lady would be blessed, encouraged, and find a rich deeper meaning to the season after going through this study.  I highly recommend this book!*I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.*"
"Thank you Blogging for Books for giving me this book in exchange for an honest review.EXCITED!  That's all I can say.  I was just so excited to be chosen to receive a free review copy of The Women of Christmas by one of my favorite authors Liz Curtis Higgs.  I adore Christmas books.  You probably know that if you've read my blog for long.  ~smile~  This book is no exception.Liz Curtis Higgs can make characters come to life like no other writer I know.  This time, the characters are real women from the Bible.  Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna.  All precious women who were central to the Christmas history of Jesus' birth.Mrs. Higgs can get more out of a few lines of scriptures than I can dream.  The insight that Mrs. Higgs gleans through use of multiple Bible translations and versions, study helps, original languages, and other research give a depth to the Luke 2 story that makes it vibrant.  You might say that her descriptions quicken the scriptures for us.  Contextual history and customs bring depth.Cocoa, The Christmas Story, and insight from Sister Liz Curtis Higgs.  What more could you want?  Oh, maybe some slippers and a blanket.  Can you tell I enjoyed this book?~smile~"
"Christmas is my favorite season. I plan for Christmas from the beginning of the new year and don't stop until Christmas Eve. For me it's not just a one day event, it is a year-round celebration. And the story of Christmas - the wonderment and beauty of the love we were shown on that cold evening so long ago, never ceases to amaze me.This is the first book by this author that I have read so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.What I found was a well crafted narrative written in a comfortable friend-to-friend like conversation that drew me in and made me feel as if I was experiencing the events first-hand leading up to our blessed Savior's coming right there along with our Women of Christmas.Ms. Higgs's view of Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna, their personal life stories along with their loved ones and other people of their time, gave me a fresh perspective and lovely reminder of how God uses the ordinary for the extraordinary and how WE are all part of this amazing Story of love!""The Women of Christmas"" is a wonderful book that I will be reading again and again and using to share the beautiful story of God's best gift of All with others.I look forward to reading other books by Liz Curtis Higgs."
"The Women of Christmas: Experience the Season Afresh with Elizabeth, Mary, and AnnaLiz Curtis HiggsWaterBrook, Sep 17 2013, $14.99ISBN: 9781601425416Descendants of Aaron, righteous Elizabeth and her husband Zechariah the priest prayed to the Lord for a child, but though she remained barren she still remained faithful to God while her mate became a doubter even after Gabriel visited him.  Engaged to Joseph the carpenter, Mary the chosen one gratefully thanks Gabriel for the Lord honoring her with bearing his son but wonders how a virgin can give birth; while her betrothed obeys the angel by marrying her.  Elderly Widow Anna never leaves the Temple as she prays to the Lord to allow her the glimpse of the Messiah before God takes her.The three generations of believing Women (and their doubting men) of Christmas is a wonderful scholarly account of the nativity.  The biblical citations make a strong case that though not understanding the lord's mysterious ways each woman thanks God for involving them in the birth of the Messiah.Harriet Klausner"
"If you have never read anything by Liz Curtis Higgs, it is about time you consider picking up one of her books.  And this would be a great one to start with considering it is a short read about some very familiar women in the Bible.What Higgs is known for is her ""girlfriend theology"" but don't let that put you off.  It just means she is down-to-earth and makes the familiar stories come alive in a fresh way.  I learn something every time I read one of her books.  Young or old, no matter your background, she reaches out to you in a way that you feel like old friends by the time the book is over.The thing I love the most is the way that she goes through selected passages verse by verse and walks you through in sort of like a devotional commentary style.  This would make a terrific small group or Bible study book and there is even a short study guide in the back with questions.5 out of 5 starsI received a free copy of this book from Waterbrook Multnomah in exchange for a fair and honest review."
"We just finished this study in our small group.  What an amazing way to look at the Christmas story!  It brings to life a whole new view of how much God values women.  We hear constantly about how women are treated harshly or looked down on in the Bible....not so, and this will make you see why that is not true.  Highly recommend this book whether you read it on your own or in a small group."
"With Christmas upon us, what a better time to post this review. I'm going to be technical first; it's a really quick read (though I spread it out and used it as a devotional this month). As usual, Liz writing style is amazing and makes for a wonderful read.Every Christmas I read the story of Christ's birth. And even though I've read those versus numerous times, and from different bibles, I've learned so much from this book, and it has really opened my eyes and made me appreciate these women even more. So many times I caught myself amazed at something I overlooked in these stories..I really enjoyed how she uses different translations of a verse to get the point across.This book isn't just about the women, Liz also talks about their husbands, Elizabeth's husband questioned God. Mary's betrothed worried. But despite it all, they remained faithful to God.These women are brought alive in the book! Each chapter opens with a Christmas carol and those set the theme for the chapter...And scattered through each chapter are encouraging and enlightening quotes from women from Liz's online bible study.Liz really out did herself with this book.Truly a beautiful read, I recommend everyone read this!I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this book review."
"I have always loved the way Liz Curtis Higgs has been able to walk through Bible verses and bring the people to life and this book is no exception.  She pulls from many different Bible translations to give us real insight into what these special women in the Christmas story may have thought, felt, and experienced.  But she doesn't stop at just these women, Higgs pushes us to consider our own faith; how might we have responded?The addition of traditional Christmas song lyrics at the beginning of the chapters is charming.  I also enjoyed the way Higgs inserted the thoughts of those who participated in the first presentation of this study.  A great way to honor them.There is a Bible study section in the back of the book to help you dig deeper into Scripture should you choose to.  All in all this is a great study to do alone or with a group during the Christmas season!Thanks WaterBrook Press for the opportunity to read and review this title!"
"I love Christmas and I love learning about the women in the Bible and i love Lis Curtis Higgs so, naturally I was excited to see this book. I think that Elizabeth, Mary and Anna all have unique stories and ones that should be told over and over again.I was interest to see how Liz Curtis Higgs was going to address these three wonderful ladies stories and I was not disapointed. I was thrilled how she wove their stories in with real modern day women's stories. The book is laced with scripture and multiple versions of scripture so that you can see how each of the translators throught the original language should be interpreted.I hope to read this story/stories with my daughter in the near future so that she can see in detail how God miraculously wove each of these ladies stories into his perfect plan for his Son.I received a free copy of this book for review from  Blogging for Books, Thanks!You can see more reviews posted at [...]"
"This book has been a blessing to read, and it kept me focused on the true ""reason for the season"" instead of the materialism that is prevalent at this time of the year.Eight wondrous chapters tell the tales of these three ordinary women surrounding the coming birth of Christ.  The women are brought to life in this book, and it isn't just about the women.  Liz also talks about their husbands, Elizabeth's husband questioned God. Mary's betrothed worried. But despite it all, they remained faithful to God.Each chapter open with a beloved Christmas carol or hymn and those set the themes for the chapters.  Scattered through each chapter are encouraging and enlightening quotes from women from Liz's online bible study.I love the author‚Äôs style, and how she provides insight into the culture and the times.  She made it a fun, but informative read. Truly a beautiful read, I recommend everyone read this!"
"This is a wonderful book to help us remember the reason for the season.As she did with the Bad Girls of the Bible series, Liz Curtis Higgs invites us to take a closer look at the women of Jesus's birth.  Elizabeth is the aunt who experiences a miracle baby herself.  Mary is the mother of her savior.  Anna is the prophetess who serves daily at the temple awaiting the Messiah.  Higgs weaves the Biblical story with her reflections which causes the reader to ponder the Christmas story.We all need to take the time to reflect during the holiday season.  This book helps us to reflect and to remember the true meaning of Christmas.I received this book for free from Blogging for Books for this review"
"I recently received and finished The Women of Christmas by Liz Curtis Higgs, just in time to be able to recommend it for Christmas, which I do. I thoroughly enjoyed The Women of Christmas! It was short, easy to read, and gave me lots to think about and rehash in my mind.Liz goes through the scriptures that touch on Christmas and discusses them and the women involved, from Elizabeth {mother of John}, Mary {is an explanation needed}, to Anna {the widow who lived in the temple and blessed Mary and Jesus}.The whole book just shows God's love for women, all women, and how He puts his hands on them and blesses their lives. How these women just opened their hearts and lives to Him, without question. Definitely a book to spend a few hours in during this Christmas season."
"My Review:I love Christmas and I love Christmas books.  I really love when Christmas books bring you back to the real reason for the season-Christ.  This book is like none I've ever read as it talks not only about Mary, but also the major roles that Elizabeth and Anna played in the birth of Christ.  This is a great book to read to get in the true Christmas spirit and reflect on the real meaning behind the season.  We always get so busy with things and it is nice to have a book like this to help us reflect.  There was so much that I learned about these women, especially about Elizabeth and Anna.  I never, ever realized the crucial roles they played.  It is amazing how God worked everything out for the good of all.  There are so many pieces to every puzzle and He knows exactly how they need to be put together.I received this book in exchange for my honest opinion."
"was so excited to get Liz Curtis Higgs, The Women of Christmas and joyfully, this book lives up to my expectations. If you have watched Liz on any of her video studies, it's easy to laugh along when she raised those eyebrows or gives one of her funny looks. Well, in reading The Women of Christmas, I felt like Liz was right in front of me, speaking and making her ""lizzy"" gestures. It was great! Liz starts this Christmas story off with Elizabeth And how that Elizabeth was busy in her priestly wife duties, but still had that void and ache which only a child can fill. And I love the point that Liz makes in while Elizabeth is doing the best she can she is well up in years. But with God, age isn't a big factor; when He gets ready to do something...watch out! Cause He's going to do it in a big way! Woman number 2 is our blessed little Mary; so very young in years but so full of faith that God chose her to be His precious Jesus's mother. We know the story, but `hearing' Liz tells it, brings freshness and since of awe and this is a story we should never tire of hearing. And then we hear/read about Anna. A very old woman who lost her husband early in life and spends her time, in the temple, worshiping and serving God, and caring for others. When Mary & Joseph bring Jesus into the temple, Anna knows that this is the Christ, the Messiah and after seeing Jesus, she is bold in talking about Him to everyone she sees. This is a great little book and I recommend it to women of all ages. Yes, you may know the stories of these 3 women already, but Liz really makes them come alive in her colorful story. Thank you WaterBrook for sending me this copy in exchange for only my honest review.

  
The Women of Christmas: Experience the Season Afresh with Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna"
"Enlightment to those who aren't fimiliar with the scripture. But I expected more. I was eager to read words that would cover me with a blanket, stir my heart, overflow me with tears. I was expecting big moments. I was looking for spirutual uplifting. I did have a lump in my throat on two occations. And, I discovered something new.But if you're looking for a spirutual journey to experience these wondrous moments, you have to look somewhere else. A white dove won't land on top of your palm to deliver and melt your heart.I read recently a newsletter sent by Linda Yezak last Christmas, and it didn't take the whole book to have snowflakes melting in my heart."
"I've actually done much better at keeping Jesus in focus this holiday season, and ""The Women of Christmas"" by Liz Curtis Higgs has had a lot to do with that. If you've ever been blessed to hear Liz speak, you'll know she has a verse-by-verse teaching style.  This is exactly how the book is set up, going through the birth narratives in Luke 1-2 and Matthew 1-2 verse by verse. I find this method helps to slow me down and really ponder what Scripture is teaching.The book starts by focusing first on Elizabeth, mother of John the Baptist, then Mary, mother of Jesus, and finally the prophetess Anna.  The details Liz provides give new insight to what for many is a familiar story.  For instance, Elizabeth's husband was unable to hear or speak throughout the duration of her pregnancy, and she kept herself in seclusion for five months (Luke 1:24). Imagine how happy she was to receive Mary into her home and have someone to talk to! And think of what a blessing for Mary to hear Elizabeth declare she was carrying the Messiah (Luke 1:43) when she may not have been sure herself if she was pregnant yet. I can imagine Mary traveling to Elizabeth and going over and over in her mind what she could possibly say to Elizabeth to explain what God was doing in her life. What a gift for Mary to hear Elizabeth's declaration? And who could understand Mary better than Elizabeth, and vice versa?""The Women of Christmas"" consists of 8 easy to read chapters (the first chapter took me 12 minutes to read) and has a study guide with discussion questions at the back of the book, making this great for groups as well as individuals.  This book is well worth the read regardless of the season."
"Liz Curtis Higgs is a super author and speaker, and best of all an encourager. Who doesn‚Äôt love a girl who write books called Bad Girls of the Bible and Really Bad Girls of the Bible.Elizabeth advanced in years, received the promise of a son, John the Baptist, who would pave the way for Jesus.Mary, so young, unmarried, accepted her role as the mother of Jesus.Anna, a prophetess, worshipped her God day and night in the temple.Gabriel said to Mary that her son would be called Jesus. God Saves.So simple. So striking. God Saves.He does.Higgs brings needful seasonal encouragement through this study."
"Liz Curtis Higgs has done it again with her latest book, The Women of Christmas. As Christmas is quickly approaching, this book allows you to experience the season through Elizabeth, Mary and Anna.In typical Liz fashion, she not only brings these characters off the pages of the Bible, but shows the reader how it applies to her life. She takes a close look at these three women and scriptures that you have read over but missed some details. Liz does an excellent job of shedding light on these treasures. There are even study questions included in the back of the book to take the study deeper.I highly recommend you purchasing this book and reading it to prepare your heart for the celebration of Christ's birth."
"In December, I read The Women of Christmas by Liz Curtis Higgs.  It's an easy read and the author is a great storyteller! This book is not your typical advent story, but rather it focuses on 3 women of the bible; Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna.  Each chapter unfolds as we dive into the lives of these 3 women and how it relates to the birth of Christ.  The book is filled with Christmas carols and hymns, which introduce each chapter, which makes it wonderful to read!I received this complimentary copy of this book from Waterbook Multnomah in exchange for my honest opinion."
"This is a great study. Mrs. Higgs gives some wonderful insight into the minds and hearts of Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna ‚Äì the women of Christmas."
"Liz Curtis Higgs is blessed with the gift of sharing testimony in a powerful and meaningful way. I wept my way through this book from sheer joy as I became even more aware of my Savior's love and acceptance. She takes a well-known story and makes it seem new. And not only that, she personalizes it by bringing events right into her readers' lives. Yes this happened centuries ago but women share a sisterhood with Elizabeth, Mary and Anna  that transcends time. A powerful affirmation that the sacred event of two thousand years ago is still relevant today."
"This was a great book for my to dive into before the Christmas holidays and it was a nice and different Christmas read!It only took me a few days to read it and this book takes a look at the lives of Elizabeth, Mary and Anna and their relationship to the birth of Christ. Liz Curtis Higgs does a wonderful job of referring to the Scriptures and the cultural background of the times, to give us glimpses into these women's lives.I loved the study guide in the back of the book too and plan on using this in our study group next winter season!"
I found this book of great spiritual growth and understanding in the lives of the three women during the birth of Christ. I also enjoyed how easy of a read it was as well as the use of scripture during the read. The study guide at the end of the book was also of great help in my spiritual growth and study. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants a better understanding of the lives of the three women involved in the birth of Christ.
"In essence, ""The Women of Christmas"" is a super-amplified version of Luke 2. Verse by verse, Curtis Higgs creatively weaves the chronological story of Christ's birth, as recorded in the Gospels, together with various background context and explanation, personal commentary and anecdotes, different Bible translations, and comments from women in her online Bible study. The ""extra"" information and insight add depth and understanding to the sometimes vague, factual Biblical account of the Christmas story, and thus offers a closer look especially at the lives of Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna.Curtis Higgs draws out the qualities as well as culturally-perceived ""faults"" in each of these women that speak to both the value of Godly womanhood and the importance of having a right view of God, Who will use us no matter what our age or status is. Further, throughout the book, there are reminders for women readers that we can confidently place our trust in God, have peace knowing He has a plan for our lives even if we don't know it, and bring glory to Him by praising His name when we speak and by how we live. I was especially intrigued by the different translations integrated into the book and the broader understanding of certain words or phrases provided by these differences and nuances.""The Women of Christmas"" is a quick read and certainly not unenjoyable {nor did I happen across anything that I questioned as misleading or not Biblical}. However, I did not consider the book to be overly thought provoking, and, overall, the content was on the shallow side. On another note, I personally did not care for the author's ""conversational"" style, and after the first chapter, I found the format tedious and at times ""choppy"" {though, in hindsight, I think it would have been helpful to have read the Christmas story in Luke 2 in its entirety first, before starting the book}."
Used this to lead a Bible Study for my women's group between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Fit perfectly in our timeline. The ladies LOVED it and the movie was such a bonus.  It was a great way to dig deeper into the lives of these special women and learn more about the life and times when our Savior was born. I was a great study for a first time leader like myself with enough direction to get us going.
"This is such a wonderful book.  Liz has a way of capturing you, grabbing you by the hand excitedly, and taking you on a journey long ago and far away.  But she makes those stories of old, fresh and new, so real, and shows how the God in those times is the same today.I've loved this book.  So many wonderful gems within.  Stories I thought I knew brought to a new perspective.  A book I would read again and again each Christmas.  ...or at any time!"
"If you are Catholic or any other Christian religion and want to prepare your heart for a meaningful Christmas, this book is a must have. You will learn all kinds of wonderful lessons from the women of old and how they dealt with various trials and still felt Christ's presence among them. This book is wonderful. I received it for free on Waterbrook Multnomah.com."
"This book was amazing I loved that it talked about women in the bible. Most women aren't recognized in the bible and I'm glad they talked about these women having so much faith and trust in God. God choose them to have ""his choosen ones"" imagine taking care of God's choose ones wow and they didn't even flaunt about it they were humble about it. So many women can relate to these women I'm glad this is a book for people to read."
"Every woman should read this wonderful book.  Liz Curtis Higgs - five stars to you - you have allowed God's Spirit to speak mightily through you.  This book is a ""must read"".  You will never think of Christmas as you have in the past.  You will never again doubt how very much God cherishes and loves all women.  Let His Spirit speak to you through Miss Higgs."
"I love Liz's style of sharing her faith highlighting wonderful women of the Bible.  I have heard Liz speak, read her other books and appreciate her great sense of humor.  Reading Liz's wonderful books, helped me write my book ""Bury Me With My Pearls""  [[ASIN:1938499336 Bury Me with My Pearls] I love her humor and unique approach to writing for Christian women. What a blessing!!!"
My friends and I really enjoyed this book!
"Simply put, The Women of Christmas is changing my life. What's helped most? The line that says. 'The opposite of disgrace is grace.' One thing I know for sure--I am likely to keep The Women of Christmas on my must-read pile every year from here on. What I love, absolutely love, is how Liz breaks it down and speaks in plain language. She is very quickly becoming one of my favourite authors."
Wonderful book!  Did as holiday bible study last year.
"This slim Christmas devotional offers nothing particularly compelling or new to the Christmas story.  The chatty tone often disrupts the flow of the narrative.  The author is simply re-telling the Christmas stories, inserting a wide variety of Bible translations along the way and adding in observations from 'real women'."
Really enjoying reading this with my women's home Bible study.
"Our women's ministry chose this title for an online Bible study in December and Liz did no disappoint!  Her thorough research added such insight to the familiar Story and these characters took on a fresh look!  More than a devotional study, The Christmas Story is guaranteed to add hope to your holiday!"
"Our book club at church is doing 'The Women of Christmas' for our study this month.  What a perfect book for this time of year!We all decided it's the book to read during Advent every year, putting the word into a meaningfull book for all.Deb Baumgardt"
"A wonderful look into the lives of those that were there that first Christmas...a great daily read to experience the Advent season in a deeper, more thoughtful way."
"I am enjoying reading The Women of Christmas!  I highly recommend it!  Liz is a great writer, and we have enjoyed discussing her book!"
"I have been a fan of this author ever since she was a radio personality in Louisville Kentucky more than 30 years ago. Her genuine spirituality and faithfulness come through in every word she writes. I love this book, and I think you will too. My goal is to read all of her books"
A totally new outlook on The Christmas story! Just what I needed!
"This is such a well written book. Brings the woman of Christmas aliveMary, Elizabeth and Anna."
excellent book. Well thought out.
I recommend this for Christmas reading.
A group of us are reading this to prepare our hearts for the Christmas season.
"I am never disappointed with Liz's books. She is one heck of a writer and always true to scripture. This is a wonderful Bible study with notes in the back to spur you on. Keep up the great work Liz. I consider her my friend and if you write to her, she writes back, yes she writes back now an assistant but Liz herself."
"Reading through this book at my own pace has been a beautiful window of rest and quietness in my usually very busy house with four children under 7 years. Liz Curtis Higgs takes you through the Bible passages and as you read verse by verse she adds other Bible translations, her thoughts, back ground information and the original meaning of words. With that she sheds a refreshing new perspective on well known stories and challenges you to go back to the Word of God. I really enjoyed it and especially liked the part about Mary.At the end of the book is an appendix with questions for group study or for personal study. So you can 'dig deeper' if you want to."
I was very pleased with the condition of the books.  Cost of shipping from multiple locations would effect my decision to purchase in this manner in the fu
"I had never read anything by Liz Higgs before so was a little leery on ordering the book BUT I really enjoyed her perspective on the Elizabeth, Mary and Anna ... made me look at them in a different light.  I liked it so much I gave my first copy away and then had to order another one for myself."
A wonderful book to prepare one's heart for Christmas. Higgs' style is warm and engaging- I've bought a copy for beloved friends and family this Christmas season.
"Really interesting book to read at Christmas, food for thought, and prayer.  Loved it.  Will be reading it again each year, I think, along with Ann Voskamp's The Greatest Gift."
"Pages were yellow -looked old. Not much content at all-wanted to give it as a Christmas gift,but was not able to -not good enough!"
"This is an incredible book, thank God for Pastor Louie Giglio :) This is one of three books we have purchase from this series. It teaches our precious children about God, His power and His amazing Creation.If we don‚Äôt teach our children and grandchildren to love God, the world will teach them no to!!! We love it!"
It‚Äôs cuteBeautifully illustratedMuch less content then I expected. Great for 3 years and younger but not enough for older than that.
"I love the connection between God and science. My 2 year old loves books about Earth and Space, and now he loves this book about God too. I can't wait to get the other books in this collection as my son gets older."
"Great book, kids love the interactive parts."
Fun book for my toddler son. Love that I can teach him about God in the early years as he discovers the world. Bought for his Easter basket!
So sweet and interactive. We have the original as well however we wanted this for my youngest. She loves it and seems super sturdy which is good since she loves books and flips through or has me read them often so they usually get wore down after a while.
"My 2.5 year old son enjoys this book so much! I love that it has interactive features on every page, it keeps him engaged as he learns."
My grandkids love the devotions in this book so much that they usually want to do 2 in a row.  Bought several for gifts for new parents and not so new parents
What a beautiful book. Great for toddlers and preschoolers. I‚Äôll be using this book alongside science lessons.
Such a cute book to begin discussing the greatness of God with your little ones. ü•∞
I bought it for my 3 year old grandson and he loves it.
My grandson loves this book.
My kids love these books and how much they learn from this series.
A really good book for toodlers. Easy to explain the creation by God and also science facts. Is really entertaining for the kids.
This book holds the attention of my 4 year old grandson.  He loves the illustrations and interactive design.
My grand baby loves this!!!
"My kids love it, fun and easy to read!"
"I love looking at books for little ones.  This one is perfect for ages 3 and under in my opinion.  You will be able to share with them about God's creation including the earth, space, and animals.  The information is very basic.  The children will enjoy spinning the wheel and pulling the tabs to find out answers to the stated questions.The illustrations are colorful and realistic.  I particularly like the page of aniamls...bess, zebras, and birds fill the page.The book ends describing God's amazing creation....people.Be sure to check out this board book for a little one in your life.  It would make a nice gift for a baby shower too.I received a copy of this book from FrontGate Media for my honest review.  Thank you."
"Here is another great childrens book from author and pastor Louie Giglio! I wanted to get this quick and positive review of¬† Indescribable for Little Ones out as quickly as I could!¬† This is an interactive board book that will help young children learn about Gods amazing world. Children can pull a tab, turn a wheel, and be thrilled with the creations from ants to giraffes!¬† What a great concept and teaching tool, while entertaining young minds!"
"So fun for the little ones with the pull-out tabs and being able to spin around the earth on the front cover. Best of all, it‚Äôs a great message that we have an Indescribable God who knows all the stars by name and yet, knows our name too. Just wish it was longer, but good content and size for the little ones. Definitely recommend!"
"My son and I enjoy Indescribable and How Great is Our God as a fun resource for learning about God and His creation. Now, they have a board book for my grandbabies! I will be sharing it with each of my four grandbabies. I may even buy each of them a copy for upcoming birthdays.Each page is full of vivid colors, as you can see below. They have short sentences to read to your babies as they look at the creation filling each page. I know they‚Äôll enjoy the pull tabs featured in the book; my 8-year old son enjoyed reading the science facts on each of them.This book is a wonderful way to encourage a love for reading and science."
Item came quickly.  Excellent board book - purchased for my grandson.  Very interactive and Biblical
"Your pre and early readers will love this board book! Nice size, cute art, and has push pull tabs throughout as well as a spinning wheel in the front. Perfect gift for young kids."
Awesome book
Informative and fun
"This Little Book of Prayers is an excellent board book for infants to toddlers. The Precious Moments illustrations complement the 18 different prayers offered for little ones to grow in their understanding of God, specific prayer, interacting well with others, and offering daily blessings. The illustrations feature multicultural children in a variety of settings including: God Knows Me (based on Psalm 139) with children at a birthday party; Lord, Keep Me Safe (Psalm 36:7) with 3 toddlers in a barrel sail boat; and A Prayer for the Animals (Job 12:10) which reflects tenderness as children discover the joy and responsibility of caring for the unique creatures they are discovering.Your precious individual will love turning the pages herself/himself and learning to talk to their Heavenly Father about many of life's situations. Children can learn these prayers through repetition or hand motions as they commit them to memory and treasure them in their hearts. Prayer is a language which calms the heart and helps children to learn that while our world may not be perfect, they can talk personally and specifically to Our Creator about anything they face."
This is a beautiful book my Dad got this book for my girls and let me tell you it is a beautiful gift I recommend this for all little angel Go for it !!!!! I post 4 pictures so you can see how it looks ...
"Love it! It has various short prayers and very short verses that is easy for kids to follow. Just what I was looking for to keep my toddler interested in learning about and enjoying prayer time. the characters illustrated are adorable and in light of current events, I think it's good to note that they also take diversity and representation into consideration which is great so kids of all ethnicities see someone that looks like them and feel included. That point may not be immediately apparent from the cover page :)"
"There are many different prayers in this little sturdy book, with pictures to go along with them. I like that there is a prayer for forgiveness and for classmates. I bought this for my godson's baptism and paired it with a Precious Moments praying bear that I can't wait to give him! Highly recommend this book."
Ordered for my Godchild  for her birthdaY beautiful prayers and pictures.  Very sturdy for a young child!  Great gift!  Would definitely buy again for a gift!
The Precious Moments book of prayers is such a sweet book with great devotions for children. I purchased this book for my friend‚Äôs little girl who made her first holy communion and she loves the book there‚Äôs passages for children to read about daily routines and life topics. It‚Äôs truly a good book for the soul of young children.
Love this book for my kids. I had it before and my son broke it so i order another one. Definitely recommended!
The book was ordered for my grandson and everybody loves the book he loves the pictures and mom and dad love all the prayers. This grandmother loves reading the prayers to my 18 month old grandson. Making memories sharing the Lords word. Thank you
"My granddaughters, age 8 & 6, love reading the prayers in this book.  They say it helps them sleep better :)"
My six year old loves this book! She reads it with me every night before bed‚ù§
"My son (2) loves  this book. It‚Äôs become our routine to read one page each night before we put him down for bed. We‚Äôve already gone through it all, but we‚Äôre restarting from the first page again."

Parents of brand new baby nephew enjoyed it immensely.  I loved it as it was very sturdy and made for little hands.  Prayers were simple and beautifully written.  I truly love Precious Moments items.
Niece loved it! Great book. Loved that it‚Äôs a hardcover because my niece tends to ‚Äòread‚Äô quickly and turn the pages quickly and in her regular books the pages ripped üôà (niece is 2) she loved the characters sweet faces also üíï

"A very cute book, good prayers,"
Love the prayers it would be perfect for my 6 year old to be able to read on her own and understand.
Bought this for a 9 year old and it's very nicely illustrated and prayers are child friendly.  Book is constructed of cardboard pages thus it seemed a bit too baby-like for my niece.
I gave this to friends for their young daughter‚Äôs baptism.  They love it and read a prayer to her every evening before bed.
We try to our son little prayers from this book every night. I love that they are short and sweet.

"This book is adorable, the pictures are so cute. It has short simple prayers for small children. Gave this as a baptism gift and the parents loved it. It has thick card board pages so little hands can't rip the pages. Love this book!"
It does what's advertised!!!great for small kids !!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND
Excellant!
Cute.
"This was a popular item at our women's retreat. Most saw it as a good a gift for children, grandchildren, etc."
"Book is exactly as described; ""Precious Moments""!  One of the nicest and most endearing books for children that I've ever read!"
Poor handling. Received it ripped at the binding. Had to tape it before gifting it to our friends baby baptism. :(
Love!
Love the book. Perfect baptism gift especially for precious moments collectors.  Was disappointed with a small piece of the padded cover damaged. No time for a replacement but I know they love it anyway.
"Absolutely love this book for my daughter, who is 2.5yo. She always asks us to read from her prayer book. Even in the middle of a tantrum, when nothing else could calm her down, I asked if she wanted to read her prayers and she nodded her head yes, sat in my lap, and listened the whole time.I love this one for the ‚Äúbasic prayers,‚Äù like the morning prayer, mealtime prayer, prayer for safety, first day of school, etc etc etc. I‚Äôm just finding my way back to my faith myself, so my ‚Äúpraying skills‚Äù and verbiage needed a little help since I‚Äôm working on my own journey as I help my daughter start hers üíñWe love the Precious Moments characters and artwork, couldn‚Äôt recommend this book more, and are looking to collect more of the Precious Moments prayer books!"
"I have found that children's prayer books can be excellent resources for teaching children about prayer. The Precious Moments Little Book of Prayers from Tommy Nelson is one such resource. Full of prayers that are just right for children, from prayers about animals to forgiveness, the Little Book of Prayers has some great examples and ideas. We use the prayers in this book as prompts. We read a prayer, and then I encourage my oldest to think of other things to pray for that relate to that prayer. I try to help her understand that we can talk to Yeshua (Jesus) about anything, from itchy mosquito bites to her desire for a puppy.I like that the Little Book of Prayers is a sturdy board book that my youngest can enjoy too. The prayers are presented through simple rhymes, making them easy to remember. The classic Precious Moments illustrations remind me of my own childhood memories, which makes the book all the more of a treasure. From morning until evening your precious ones will fall in love with this Little Book of Prayers.Disclosure:I received a copy of Precious Moments Little Book of Prayers through the Tommy Nelson Mommy Program. I was not asked to write a positive review. All views and opinions expressed are solely and completely my own. I received no compensation other than a copy of the book featured in this post, which is mine to keep."
The book is perfect for children.. special in younger age.. very well made it.. beautiful-thoughtful prayers with God and Jesus and have little writings from Epistle  and Scripture in the end of a prayer.. LOVE IT!!!Gonna be a great gift for a Baptism of a baby!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"Great gift for a baby's baptism. That's what I got it for, my niece's baptism. The drawings are super cute and precious. Sturdy book too, makes it great for little hands to rough up a bit until they're actually able to read it themselves. Also great as a keepsake too."
"Disclosure: I received a copy of this book as a Tommy Nelson Mommy. Thoughts are my own.What I love about this is that I can use it to teach my child to pray. Each spread in the book features a prayer for a specific thing. And it helps me teach my child that prayer isn't just for food or sleeping or for family. Kids can learn that you can also pray for your friends, for school, for animals -- and that it can be about a lot of things like protection, forgiveness, blessing, help, and more! Plus it helps that the graphics are so cute!"
The book is adorable but it arrived with a finger sized dent on the front cover! This is suppose to be a gift!
Very nice prayer book
"Book is nicely made, durable."
"So adorable it has a prayer for going to bed, waking up , pets , school , family . ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Amazing little book
Gift
"We got something similar last year to put in a 'shoebox' collection/gift for needy youngsters in eastern Europe. That worked well (fitted the box for example!), and the book itself if well produced, sturdy and the pages are easy to clean from marks of little fingers."
"This now my third purchase of this book. Instead of buying a baby shower card or congratulations card, I buy this book. I have one for my granddaughter that I love to read with her. This book board is wonderful for little fingers that sometime are rough on paper. No rips and easy for page turning. I also can wipe this book clean with a damp cloth to keep the dust off. But this seller was the fastest seller I have purchased from! Completely happy to give this as a gift."
"This book is just amazing for everyday prayer, morning and night, play and mealtime. It is all about having a true ongoing spiritual ritual. Also the book quality is amazing and the drawings are warm vintage style with modern colours and printings which i love so much, if this makes any sense :)Highly recommend."
"another child's present making an adult pause, and watch, sometimes in fascination, what  a child will pray for, leaving some adults in wonder, and in tears, relieving some of our adult fears for them. Thanks."
"Love this prayer book, used it with my first child and had to get another for my newborn."
Everything about this book is beautiful. The quality of the pages are thick and harder for the little ones to rip it apart. The drawing is WOW. Has prayers for different situations. Highly recommend this books.
Love this little book of prayers.Bought one for my daughter ended up buying three more for gifts.
Beautiful little book and perfect for a baptism gift! I would certainly recommend this item.
"The book is very nice and pretty.  The only problem was that I got it with a smashed corner, I guess due to the delivery handling.  Since the book has a soft cover the delivery packaging needs to be improved to avoid this issues"
An adorable book of prayers that are short enough to teach to your kids. I love the variety!
Very fast shipping just as described
The cutest prayer book in the world!! My 4 year old loves saying these prayers n he's started to memorize them. These kids are so adorable n the prayers are so simple.
Bought for my son and one for my cousins daughter
Love it. Good stuff. Precious moments always has wondeful books. Will last a long time. Great for gifting as well.
Great!
I love precious moments and am very happy to have this book. It‚Äôs the first in my collection for our grandchildren‚Äôs library.
What an awesome little book! My granddaughter & I love it üíó
"Cannot wait to send this to my son, for my first grandchild !!"
"Absolutely adorable and cute for the occasion, which was a Baptism.Keepsake memories."
Great!
Small cute book
Great keepsake and great quality!
Really cute Baptism gift. Good quality book.
I love all the prayers
Love this book and love precious moments.
High quality
absolutely adorable little book. the prayers are short & very sweet... and its a board book... love it!
The kids had this now the grandkids can too.
the sweetest little book! excellent quality - thanks again!
My daughter loves this prayer book. Great for every time of day and has cute pictures for kids while you read.
"Horribly small print.Do not buy unless you like to hold it in one hand, and a huge Sherlock Holmes magnifying glass in the other.Don't believe the bottom of the cover stating ""Accurate Readable Clear""The print is so tiny, it's NOT Readable, so I can't verify the other parts of that."
"Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are healthy, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are unhealthy, your body also is full of darkness. -Luke 11:34This is great if you have excellent eyesight. However, I'd suggest something with larger print if you want to keep that excellent eyesight. I found¬†

  ¬†to work quite well with the kids at my church at a decent price."
"This is one of my choices for a giveaway bible. Even though I am a KJV guy, I believe the NIV is much easier to read.  I also suggest the CSB and the ESV versions for regular everyday reading or as gift bibles. if you can find them at this price as well. Any Bible that has the old and new testament complete for this price in a reputable version is a good bible."
"I bought this for a Bible to use at church so I would not have to take the one I use for daily devotions (it has booklets, etc kept in it that keep falling out or getting in the way at church.)It is a nice compact Bible, but the print is about 6 pt - very small - so small I need to be in a good light to read it.If You like small print, this would be a great Bible to have."
The print in this Bible is very tiny. It's readable if you have good eyesight. If you are looking for something to hold you over until you can afford a more expensive Bible or want one to mark up with all kinds of notes and highlighters without permanently marking up an expensive one this is the one for you. It could also be a good one to give away to a new believer or someone you are evangelizing to without spending too much. Just make sure they have very good eyesight or they have a good magnifying glass.
Unlike many bibles this one is not printed on paper so thin is looks like it might rip at any moment. The paper feels strong. The book is a bit big for carrying out etc. but the size is helpful when highlighting passages and making notes etc. The language is very easy to understand too. It's cheap enough for me to feel comfortable scrawling all over it. Overall I really like it for the price.
The print is small & pages thin but it is a good price for having a spare on hand. I did have to remove two pages out of the extra material after the actual Bible because I believe it is incorrect doctrine promoted by a particular denomination.
THIS IS THE WORST TRANSLATION IN THE HISTORY OF TRANSLATIONS. SO MANY OF THE OTHER BOOKS ARE JUST AS HORRID SO BUYER BEWARE. SEEK THE HS FOR GUIDANCE AND DISCERMENT.
....these were ideal.  Well priced and an easy translation.  I hope they were able to use them as they were somewhere in Africa.  But I was able to help because of their purse friendly price.
"This bible was purchased for my bible study group. Although priced very inexpensive, the lettering is very small. We have a few older people in our group and the print is just too small from them to read."
"Print so small and compact, it is not a book made to be read.  The bible is the only book you find typed in this minuscule print.Shame on zondervan!Do not waste your money!"
The print is very small and hard to read.  Don‚Äôt get these unless you have very good eyes!!
"Great price, fast shipping.  Ordered the wrong version, but they will work fine as is.  Thanks!"
This is a very cheap Bible that is good for the price. Useful if you need a lot of Bibles
I keep a supply of this Bible in my classroom incase students need new ones.  The school was charging the students a higher price for the same bible.  I don't charge the students so I need to keep a supply handy.
I wanted a cheap one so I could mark it up with notes. I certainly got cheap. Spend $5 more your eyes will thank you.
"I really hate to give bibles a bad review, unfortunately they arrived in very poor condition as if they had been read reread and read again. The photos above aren‚Äôt pictures of the initial order but the replacement order ! And they were worst than the first."
This is an economy item but you must consider how hard it is to read the small print.
"I was so excited to get this that I ordered two; one for home and the other for my travel bag. The print is so tiny that even with my reading glasses, it strains my eyes to read. Strictly because of the tiny print, I was not enjoying reading this... at all. I ordered the thin line (larger print) and all is good again. I find the larger print version to be a wonderful read."
"Wanted this to take notes in and highlight. Font is kinda small but not as bad as others made it out to be, I almost didn't get it because of other reviews but I'm glad I did because it's perfect."
Great value over all! What a great way to feed the spirit! Handy!
We ordered 4 to pass out. They got here fast and are a nice size. But the font is TINY!! We won't buy this version again.
"Box showed up a day or two ahead of schedule, but was 2 of 25 books short. Recieved 23. Box was already open when delivered. Product is good otherwise."
Gifted it to a womens bible study in Southern California.
"I do like how light weight, I'm able to carry everywhere and I do my best to read the Bible a little each day."
This bible is amazing to buy in bulk for gifts. Great purchase.
The print on this Bible is so tiny.  Even the kids I teach can barely read the print!
It seems to be made very well.  It arrived in time for our fourth of July parade.  We like it.
The writing is a bit small for me. This bible would be perfect for younger people.
"value for cost is spot on. however, I wish I had paid more attention to print size.i bought these for a bible kids club.even they have a difficult time reading the type."
Came quickly and has everything you need in a Bible.
Print too small.
Don't order this if you need normal size font! This is definitely not large font. So tiny! Very disappointed as ordered to give out at nursing home and there is no way they will be able to use this Bible.
Good quality
Cheap economy bible but I bought them since I donated several to the prision system for immates to read them. They have very strict policies on the materials that are allowed so it definitely served the purpose.
"It doesn't have too big of writing, though it said it had large print"
Great gift
Print to small
Good
Gave them out as Christmas presents.
"It was a little torn on the spine and bent, but overall it's still a good bible."
Full bible for this cheap! Awesome price and the Bible is great!
For the price this is a great little economy bible.  Print is on the small side but that's as advertised.
"They‚Äôre nice, but the words are really small."
"Bought a bunch of these and gave to my church.  They were distributing bibles to homeless individuals, and these were purchased at a great price. I could buy more than expected because they were so affordable."
Print is very small
"Thank you kindly,God  Bless you and yours. Stay safe and well.  Perfect condition and fast"
I‚Äôm very pleased with my purchase. Only one small complaint; the print is very small.
The print is very small unless you purchase a larger print size but they are great to gift or for evangelism.
Exactly what I wanted and expected. Very readable even though small print. Lightweight so it's easy to carry. LOVE IT! Now I have a bible within reach anywhere I am.
"I didn‚Äôt realize how small the font size would be. Very distressed, it‚Äôs impossible to read comfortably."
Perfect price for buying many copies to distribute!
Print way too small
Terribly small print can barely read the text
Print too tiny even with glasses.
I love it. Perfectly printed.
"Great for the price, a little hard to read, but I am old, so everything is a little hard to read."
Print is very small
the bible is great.... but it has really really small font
Quality as expected.
Lettering is a bit small but what a great deal !
"Great price, but who knew the print could be made so small . . ."
most accurate version. Great deal !!!
Excellent deal for quality product. My family with use this book for years to come
Very thin and font too small..
Small print size
Cheap easy to ready. Great for beginner bible!
The print was super super small.
I did not get my whole order
"The print is too small. Otherwise, it is good."
I ordered them to give away
The letters are too small
As described good price
Nice paperback bible
"never did a two star review before but there is a first for everything. We bought these to give to all those who ask at a local soup kitchen. I also had several used ( library returns ) of bibles from the same publisher. My issue is that the font is so small it's like trying to read the writing on a bottle of Dr. Bonner's Magic soap. I thought that the economy end of things was that it was ""newsprint"" type paper, plus paperback, plus no frills..not miniature writing. So I have a case of these that have such small writing that even the teenagers needed magnification to read it and are essentially useless for senior citizens and the homeless that we serve..Other than that, the content  is good and it's in modern easy to follow language."
"No pic available as this was sent to my incarcerated loved one. The shipping was fast & it is a bible as he requested, no frills. Paperback which is all that they can be sent during their stay. I hope to never have to order one of these again for a loved one. If I do have to or if his gets tossed during transfers. I will return to buy another.  Thank you."
"The book serves its purpose. I bought it for a family member who is in an unfortunate circumstance, and since they are Christian, I thought that a bible would help them. That being said, the item has incredible small font, and the paper itself isn't great. As I said, it'll suffice, but that's about it."
"Todo esta bien con las biblias,  pero deber√≠an quitarle ""prime free one Day "" no las env√≠an a tiempo,  yo ten√≠a un programa para regalarlas y no me llegaron hasta 5 d√≠as despu√©s.  No recib√≠ las biblias a tiempo"
This copy of the bible is both affordable and easy to read.  :>)
Research. Zondervan is now owned by the same people who print satanic bibles.
I love these Bibles they really come in handy to give out Bibles when studing with someone. I will continue to buy these Bibles in multiples.
The print in this is very very small. It is almost unreadable.
"The content of the Bible itself is as reliable as can be, but so is this particular NIV printing! I received it just as Amazon had advertised. The copies were clean, no tears, errors, or other damage at all. Furthermore, I rather appreciated the extra features that are included. Resources, such as reading plans, footnotes, and summaries serve as help supplements. I hope to distribute many more in the future!"
Because of this I gave it away as I could not use. Bought me a large print as love it.....
"I bought this Bible to own an NIV translation, although it is not the primary translation I use. For $4 CAD, this is a good value to make quick reference to the NIV translation. If you are looking for a Bible you will read regularly I wouldn't recommend this. The font size is pretty small, however there is little bleed through from the other pages. I also can't see this lasting a long time, but once it does start to fall apart it is easy to replace.Overall for my purposes, this gets the job done well, but if you are a regular NIV reader and are looking for a daily Bible, look elsewhere."
The writings are to small to read. I thought that it would be better. I have to use a magnifying glass to be able to read it. It would be nice to be able to read this Bible better.
Nice
Easy to read and understand
Awesome
Good bible ..but font size too small
Very poor quality

"First word. First steps. First handprints.  Parents relish in these moments. Most parents want to hold onto these childhood moments. A good way for parents to hold onto their childhood is to buy this book. This book has pictures ranging from boats, to flowers, to doggies. They can sit at the table or in their room and color. Everything can be a different color. A child can bring their picture to their parents with joy. They could use this book as a way to see their growth. For instance, the first page could be scribbles and coloring outside the lines. As they progress, the scribbles turn into coloring inside the lines. Though this book is great, if the pictures were labeled this would help the child learn what they are coloring!! :)"
"I‚Äôm not sure how you can go wrong with a coloring book, but this one is great! I have a 2 year old and a 5 year old who love to color, and this is perfect for them. The paper is heavy duty which you know is important if you have feisty children. There are so many options for them to choose from: different animals, vehicles, plants, you name it. I love that the pictures are large and open, which makes it easier for my kiddos to use. It‚Äôs also super cute to have the certification of completion at the end. I think it‚Äôs a different touch, and something my 5 year old would be happy to show off!"
"This is such a cute coloring book! There‚Äôs many different animals, plants, and objects in the book to help your child learn. My daughter loves this book! I highly recommend this book!"
"Upon receipt of the 101 Big Things Coloring Book, I was greeted with bright colorful happy images of animals people transportation and more. I absolutely adored the very first page which allows the owner of the book to be able to write his or her name! Every single page is crisp, clear, and easy to look at.  The certificate at the end is a sweet touch that I know most 3-5 year olds would love to show off! I think this was a very well thought out coloring book, and I look forward to being able to share this with my niece and nephew!"
"The 101 Big Things Coloring Book is a fantastic first coloring book for any child. As they dive into the magical excitement while learning to color, this book will also help develop recognition skills. The plants, animals, means of transportation, and more will develop fine motor skills, dexterity, grasp, and endurance in their hands. As a bonus, the Coloring Pro Certificate will build your child‚Äôs self-esteem!"
"Great book of over 100 big things for toddlers and young kids to color.  Planets, animals, plants, objects, vehicles, and so much more.  This will keep 3-5 year olds busy coloring and using their creativity and imagination on the pages.  Make sure to check out the last page!"
"I LOVE this coloring book! It is simple, yet provides different level of coloring for different ages within the target group. I also really like the certificate of completion at the end! This is a great starter book for younger children who are starting to show interest in coloring, and the book as a whole is really eye-catching! I'm excited for my toddler to color the pictures!"
Great coloring book for the age range listed on it. The big pictures make it easy for them to color in the lines and the pictures were adorable.

  ¬†This is easy coloring books for young toddlers. Not too much difficult pattern which make them confuse. So they easily recognize the things and learn their names. Fun things for kids."
The book is well put together and seems durable. There is a wide variety of pictures to color. Pictures are big and clear. My kids loved it. And it kept them quiet for over an hour so I loved it as well!
"My child loves this book, he is very attentive and he has picked up so much already. This book is so great every parent should get it"
This coloring book is well constructed and has a great selection of simple images to be colored. My kid loved it. There is a large selection of images to color and a couple opportunities to practice counting and number recognition. We enjoyed this coloring book.
My daughter loves it!
"Hours of entertainment for the beginning color fanatic.All the kids will want to participate in this coloring book, there is something for everybody."
"This is a peculiar coloring book. When I saw ‚ÄúBig Things‚Äù in the title, I assumed it would be full of large animals or objects. But that‚Äôs not the case here, unless you consider an apple, a baby chick, or an old-fashioned alarm clock ‚Äúbig‚Äù! I then wondered if ‚Äúbig‚Äù might mean that the illustrations themselves nearly fill the pages, but they don‚Äôt. So, I can‚Äôt quite figure out why the publisher considers these ‚ÄúBig Things.‚Äù The book is supposed to be for 3- to 5-year-olds, but the illustrations are not consistent for this age group. Some illustrations had little detail‚Äîalmost enough to not be interesting‚Äîwhile others had enough fine detail that some of this age range would find them difficult. Also, the illustrations did not have a consistent look. Instead, it looks like the publisher sourced pictures from all over the place. All in all, I wasn‚Äôt wild about this coloring book.I received a free copy of this book, but that did not affect my review."
"No intricate details and simple pictures make this a perfect coloring book for younger children. Flowers, presents, balloons, ice scream, there is a great selection of images to color. The bat is the cutest in my opinion!I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review."
"Thank you for making this awesome coloring book! It kept my kid quiet and entertained for hours. Very high quality, very cute drawings."
"Definitely 4.5 Stars!This is NOT a standalone read. You must read Book 1 to both appreciate and understand this well-written thriller suspense that continues the Murphy Shepherd's breath-taking rescuer series by Charles Martin.Unlike Book 1, which was set primarily in Florida, this installment is set mostly in Freetown, Colorado: a fictional isolated mountain community of vigilant rescuers, healing survivors, and their protectors. Their nemesis is an elusive and wealthy global powerbroker that continues to traffic the most innocent and vulnerable young victims, while now increasing attacks on Murphy Shepherd's heroic crew. This has become personal!Murphy Shepherd, an ex military, trained priest, and determined rescuer of victims of human trafficking, is back with his unusual team of experts and specialists, all trying to find and extricate vulnerable abducted young girls and boys who have been captured and held by wealthy and powerful sex traffickers in a vast, global crime organization.Although the book centers around a difficult and haunting theme, this action adventure is written well in a general-audience storyline that avoids explicit descriptions and foul language and instead focuses on good storytelling and the human costs to victims and their desperate family.Strong key characters with unique and likeable personalities drive this intense story of dedicated rescuers, facing incredible conditions to find the next victim or victims of sexual abuse and life-threatening slavery.At times almost superhero protagonists take on huge risks to find those who have had their lives, futures and all hope stolen from them. This book is a fast suspenseful read, just like the first installment. Neither is a disappointment.Written as a first-person narrative by Murphy Shepherd, the book is hard to put down because of multiple surprises and many plot twists.I thoroughly enjoyed this book an look forward to the upcoming Book 3 that builds upon the first two books."
I hope you are new to Charles Martin. I‚Äôm almost at the end of all his books so far. That makes me very sad. This book is number 2 in a series and number 3 is coming out in 2022. The hard part of waiting for me is I read so many in between it‚Äôs hard to keep the memories & emotions current for the next book. I know I LOVED The Water Keeper (book1) but I really needed to cliff note it again for this one. I think I‚Äôll reread both for number 3. His books go beyond something you read and love. They connect on some level you don‚Äôt expect and that‚Äôs what you don‚Äôt forget. Every single book and character he creates stays with you. His books are magical.
"I cannot do justice to the way Charles Martin's books get to me.  There is suspense, love, philosophy, mystery, every emotion, every element woven into each story.  The unspeakable evil that Murphy is fighting against is tangible and frightening, but hope prevails, love  won't be banished and the goodness in the world will not give up.  Why can't I give Martin's books 10 stars???  It's so hard to wait for the next one..."
"This book and its predecessor are among the finest written books I‚Äôve ever read. His words have a way of holding your attention and your heart. The storyline is unfathomable, yet you know that there is more truth in these books than our human minds want to acknowledge. I hope when parents read these stories they hold their kids a little tighter, monitor their social media and their friends a lot closer and pray for God to protect them every day. The world needs a lot of real life Murphy Shepherds and Bones‚Äô"
His heart for finding the captives oozed with Biblical symbolism as in Christ the good shepherd leaving the ninety nine to find the one lost sheep. Martin somehow shows the heart of the captives like no other author. I urge you to grab this series if you want a reading experience like no other!
"I actually read this book by accident and I‚Äôm glad that I did.  Enjoyable is not a word that I would use to describe this novel. Maybe compelling would be more appropriate.  The central theme  Is certainly a timely issue and one that deserves to be exposed for the evil that it is.  There is no way to make the tragedy of human trafficking an enjoyable tale.However, the author‚Äôs sensitive understanding of the trauma of rescue and recovery provide hope for humanity.  His single-minded determination to rescue these victims give us the example of a hero.  One who shuns fame and wants only to restore the battered souls to health and safety..I do wish that I had read the first book in this series (The Water Keeper). Although Martin does give the reader background information through the form of story-telling to his daughter Ellie, there are missing pieces that can only be satisfied by reading the initial novel. So now I will read the first while waiting for the third to be publish."
"The Letter Keeper kept me engrossed until I finished it.  Very few books are good enough to do that.  Love the characters, though they're so engaging, it's hard to realize they're not real. Charles Martin tells a hard story with such mercy, grace and compassion. Be sure to read The Water Keeper too."
"This second book is much improved from the first.  You definitely need to read the first prior to this one. In the old days this would have been one book prior to authors  writing smaller books for more money making series. I have read all Mr Martin's books, and this one is a little too macho for me but has very good truths throughout the book. And of course he leaves a cliffhanger for another book to follow at $15 a book."
"Charles Martin never disappoints.  But dang I hate to be left hanging.  I hope he is finishing the next and releasing it soon.  I read them way to fast and have to wait way to long for the next one.  I read almost 50 books a year and Charles Martin to date is my favourite author.  I've read all of them.  I love this Murphy series and the way he mixes in the hope and love that conquers all even in the darkest of darkness.  It is a must read, couldn't put it down."
"Storyteller with purpose.  Charles Martin has become a master storyteller of good versus evil, of the dark side of life trying to squash  the light of life in the human spirit. His latest book is a story of hope, of the dream that never dies. I've read all of Charles‚Äô books  and found inspiration in all  of them.  ln the book The Letter Keeper the reader is quickly drawn into a masterful story of perseverance. If you have not read Charles‚Äô previous book The Water Keeper, I recommend reading it first. Charles exposes light on the dark evil world of human trafficking and some of the lengths evil goes to insnare its  victims.  Action packed throughout, the reader will journey  through the lives of those headed into a life  of drugs  and sexual slavery.  The main character is determined to rescue the enslaved and reunite them and get them help. Rating this book on my part is an absolute 5 stars. Really looking forward to Charles‚Äô next book."
"As is was getting closer and closer to the end of this book, I wanted to stop reading so it wouldn‚Äôt end. Hands down, the best book I‚Äôve read and I am always reading. Charles Martin captures every emotion I have in his books and this one captured and held them. I need the next one quickly"
"Just finishing this book the only words I have right now are just absolutely excellent. This author continues to amaze me. I never want his words to end. All of his book make you stop and reflect on your own life, the good and the bad. All comes back to love. And I sure loved this book."
"After reading The Water Keeper, which I consider one of Charles Martin‚Äôs best novels (and I‚Äôve read almost all of his novels), I couldn‚Äôt wait to read The Letter Keeper. It did not disappoint! Continuing the story of David Bishop,, the story‚Äôs highs and lows take the reader on quite an emotional yet enlightening ride. Highly recommended."
"Charles Martin does another incredible job of storytelling about a most sensitive and timely subject: human trafficking and evil. I‚Äôm not sure where he gets his inspiration from but the subject, while vile and upsetting, is one we have ignored for too long. I love how he weaves forgiveness, love, and redemption into the plot. I can‚Äôt wait for the third and final (I‚Äôm assuming) book in the Murphy Shepherd series."
"I love the insight this book gives to trafficked girls and foster kids. The struggle is real. For that I hope he keeps writing in this genre. This book though just seemed the same as the first. Also, there is so much emphasis on a person filling the hole in our hearts. Only God alone can fill our longing."
I have read ALL of Charles Martin's novels ... they always point to a Heavenly Father who works through us to impact others in this world...I can't wait for the next one and am so grateful for the gift Charles Martin has for writing that he is using to impact the world not for himself but to point his readers to the Author of Life!
"I have read every single book Charles Martin has written. I usually complete them in two days; this one was different‚Ä¶instead of a super-hero, this Murph was human, fallible, and not able to control his destiny as he seemed to do so effortlessly in prior books. His humanity made him a better hero! Can‚Äôt wait for the next in the series."
"I have not found a book written by Charles Martin that I didn't love!  This one had me right there with him.  I found myself praying for the outcome!  What an ending that's not an ending!  I can't wait for the next book.  Thank you Charles for sharing your God given gift of writing.WELL DONE, AGAIN!"
In a way it reminded me of my life I fought in Veitnam in 1968 too 1969 they are a lot of corrupt people out their some are people just trying to survive while orthers at much higher level from police officer too dirty politicians from DEA too Congress too Supreme Court do the same as the bad people in the story I fought the Gov. from 1969 till 1996.I never won but they knew who I was a good thing and a bad thing I would recommend this book for anyone to read it doesn‚Äôt hide the hurt but Love wins out in the end . Thank you for writing the book and may God Bless you.Lester Barker
"Powerful story. I don't know which was greater, the how much I enjoyed the action and great illustrations, or the principles of life that I needed to hear. Regardless, this is an outstanding story, and I look forward to the next in this series. Thank you,"
"Charles Martin's Letter Keeper is about sacrifice, devotion, rescue and protection. It's about the killing of the soul that happens when a child is trafficked. Murph is peculiar and crucial. I can hardly wait for tge sequel.."
David Martin is an exceptional writer but that's just my opinion.  Murphy Shephard's story has entertained me through 2 books. Its been a great journey to travel so please Mr David don't leave me in the dark please finish book #3.
"Charles Martin entertains with hard truths. His foundational theme of ‚Äúlove conquers all‚Äù is straight from the gospel of Jesus Christ. His courage to unveil the evils of human trafficking can only come from sacrificial love. Most of us would rather pretend it does not exist, but he exposes it in a way that provides hope. Read this series."
"Five stars because it keeps your attention and the excitement is never ending.  Mr. Martin's knowledge of weapons and the human heart are spot on and given these trying times, it is refreshing to find a white knight and dog loving hero."
"I love Charles Martin‚Äôs ability to transport me to the different locations of his story. I feel like his characters are living, breathing people I could care about. I was not ready for this story to end. I hope he will create another installment of this beautiful love story."
"Like all of Charles Martins book,this is a great story of love, loss and triumph.  Murphy fights to save those everyone else forgets about but rescues one victim after another.  He leaves the 99 to search for the one."
This book is between light and dark.  Charles Martin is a writer that you can not figure out the ending how I wish no. Three was coming out sooner.  He is a story teller with a message.  This darkness is all around us and we are not aware
"Charles Martin is the absolute best writer!  His books just keep getting better. There is so much to absorb,so many wonderful nuggets to consider.The Letter Keeper is the best read yet! I so look forward to the next in series!"
"How do you shine the light on a scary subject and entice readers along? Read this series and see. Charles Martin enthralls, takes his words and slaps your face with evil but reminds you of redemption. Love the characters."
If for one moment we see clearly the answer to our questions then the trip was worth it. This story reveals so much of our lives and the why. What a ride and yet we are left with a question unanswered.
This is one roller coaster ride of a story.  It takes you deep into the souls of the characters and the real evil in the world.  It leaves you with just the slightest window of hope.  I loved it.
"CM is a good storyteller.  I enjoy his books, because I know he is not going to waste my time.  I also know he will develop a lead character who makes a difference in the world with God's help."
"Really like the Murphy Shepherd series.  His topic is a hard one to read about, but it‚Äôs real and we need to know more about this horrible crime.  Just read all Charles Martin books, they are all excellent and you will learn a lot about the souls of people."
Just when you think Charles Martin has out down himself with the Water keeper. He writes the The letter keeper. the Letter Keeper is one of his best novels. The characters are woven together masterfully.  The story flows smoothly. You don‚Äôt want to stop reading.. then you get to the last page. What! A cliffhanger. I have to wait as well as you do to reveal the rest. Masterfully done. Look forward to the next adventure with Murphy and Bones .
Again no words for how emotional and intelligent Charles Martin spins a story. Horrifying evil fought relentlessly by the few able to make sure the one lost sheep is never left .
"Another incredible story by Charles Martin! Very eye opening, heart wrenching and full of pleasant surprises. Wish I didn‚Äôt have to wait a whole year for the third book in this series."
I have read all of Charles Martin books and I have enjoyed them all. I always hate to start a book because I don't know if I will like it as much as I do Charles Martin
What makes a hero? Someone who wants good for another more than good for one self. This book has plenty of heroes: Clay Bones Murph Gunner and Marie. Incredible read.
"I loved each word...the images, the feelings and the truth. I hated that it had to end, yet I sense there will be another to finish the story.Please world, pay attention to the plight of trafficking. Eyes open, arms outstretched. Be part of the rescue."
"Read with my daughter 6,000 miles away on the other side of the world with a shared kindle app. Could not sleep until I finished it. His best yet! Powerful gospel glazed story line. This is not entertainment‚Äîthis is healing and transformation. Perfect for anyone believing the lie that they are unlovable."
This is something everyone should read. It brings to light the very internal horror of trafficking while giving a prescription for healing. I couldn't put it down.
"Another fabulous book.  Wonderful, spiritual prose.  Beautiful characters.Can't wait for the next one.  A must read for those seeking realnstories."
Excellent read. I have read all of Charles Martin books. This was the best one! Now I have to wait a year for the next Murphy Shepherd installment. I hope I live long enough!
"The author of the story tells it in such a way that your heart longs to hear more. He lets you see inside the heart of a true man, a man who loves deeply and lays down his life to fight evil. Excellent read!"
"Charles Martin has to be one of the best writers I've ever had the pleasure of reading.  I've never been disappointed with any I've read and this did not disappoint,  I've laughed and cried with the characters  one of his best."
Love the Murphy series. The letter keeper is a great heart warming book. I cried and then was happy for Murphy putting his life for others. Read it in one day. Great story and a must read!
"Test book was a good read, it kept me interested throughout the book, the ending was a page turner . I did enjoy the book I gave it four stars"
Looking forward to his next novel in 2022. This is a series favorite of mine from a favorite author. I've read and enjoyed all his novels.
Charles Martin has written another great book. Full of action as it deals with the evils of six trafficking and the people and children involved.
Another great story from my favorite author. I am a huge fan and next book!Hard to choose a favorite as I love all of Martin's book.
I had waited patiently for book 2 of the series. It did not disappoint. My only disappointment was that I will have for book three.
Another magnificent novel by Charles Martin. Already looking forward to the next Murphy Shepard book! Don't forget to read The Water Keeper first.
"I've never written a review and I've read thousands of books.  And all of Charles Martin's books. This is a book about self sacrifice.  Giving everything you have for those you love.  Fighting for what's right despite the cost, even to the death.  Something that today's world could use some of.  More ""Murphs"".  This book, like everyone of Mr. Martin's books, made us laugh, cry and everything in between.  Can't wait for book 3."
The sequel to the Water Keeper will keep you turning pages. I read it in 2 days. Can‚Äôt wait for #3 in this series.
Knew there was going to be a sequel but what a way to end.  Going to be a long year before it is released.
I enjoyed this book from page one.  And now to wait for the next part!  Hopefully not too long of a wait.
This Book is like trying to drink water from a fire hydrant.  I couldn't not put it down until I had read it twice. It is full of hope and wisdom and surprise at every turn.  The best book yet.  Thank you.
Heartbreaking topic (child trafficking)RescuesRehabilitationRestoration
This book pulls you in and you do not want to stop reading ! Charles Martin is a gifted writer! My favorite! This story continues the first story where we met Murphy Shepherd and this is a powerful story!
Good Book. I am glad to see someone talk about the slavery that is instead of the slavery that was. This is an issue that can actually be addressed if more people would wake up to understand this is real.
"Charles Martin is one of my favorite authors. The ‚ÄòMurphy Shepard‚Äô novels has been what I believe are his best yet. At times tears in my eyes, at times edge of my seat. Wonderful character development. Had a hard time putting them down!"
So excited when these two books came out and just finished both in two days. So so many thoughts!  Wow!
"Just as good as the first book in this series, and the rest of his books! Can‚Äôt wait for the next one. Love the references to the locations around Jacksonville (Harbys was a nice touch), as I am a resident too! Thank you Charles for sharing your gift with us!"
"This series is keeping me on my toes. Multiple unexpected twists and turns , I hope there‚Äôs more to come!"
I have loved every one of his books I‚Äôve read. I can‚Äôt wait to read the next one in this series.
Charles Martin is one of the best authors.  He writes in a way that you feel like you‚Äôre in the story
"There are too many improbabilities to be believable. Murph is not Superman. No human can survive that manny beatings, shootings and explosions. Subject matter is disgusting. Excellent tensiom though. I don't want to read the next book in the series. Sure makes me wish for more books like Chasing Fireflies or The Mountain Between Us."
"After having read Book 1, I had to get Book 2. Such a twist of stories and I had a hard time stopping reading once I had started. Can't wait to read Book 3!"
This book was such a great follow up to The Water Keeper. It was written beautifully. The insight into the abused and trafficked was startlingly profound. The description of the trauma and after math was on point. It left me at peace yet wanting more at the same time. Charles Martin is a beautiful storyteller:
"Charles Martin is an amazing author! Loved this book. I relish his insights on life, love, the individual.  Now it‚Äôs a waiting game for the next one."
This series is phenomenal.  It touches every emotion and you dreading coming to an end.I can't wait for the next one.
"Real, exciting, and emotional. I loved this book. My problem is I want to read the entire book in one sitting."
"Every book by Charles Martin is my all time favorite while I‚Äôm reading it. Beautiful, thought-provoking prose producing a story that is never long enough. At the last word of The Letter Keeper I said/whined, ‚ÄúWhat? Noooo!‚Äù"
Once again a wonderful story that both intrigues and keeps you on the edge of your seat! Can't wait until June to continue!
"My favorite author now makes me wait yet again for another story, and hopefully another installment in the Murphy Shepherd series. I've read each and every Martin book and now begins a long hot summer. Until next time...thank you."
Have been reading his books for many years. These two may be his best ever! Can‚Äôt wait for #3. Very intense couldn‚Äôt put it down.
My hands down favorite author does it again.  I vary between wanting to read it slow to savor the words and reading head long into the night as I cannot stop.
Overall plot was enjoyable. Some of the phrasing was more cliche than typically in his books. Would recommend if enjoyed first.
Wonderful writer. I highly recommend all of his books! Knows how to keep me from putting the book down before finishing!
"I love how complex the story line is, yet easy to follow.  Now to wait for the next one... whatever shall I do??  Maybe I should finish ""what if it's true"" which I enjoy as much as the fiction!"
"Best story yet from Charles Martin! This book was absolutely amazing, addictive and heartbreaking for sure. Total cliffhanger! I loved it! I hope there are more Murphy Shepherd stories to come!"
"Once again, Charles Martin has woven a story that draws in the reader and touches the heart. His characters are realistic, and his plots are riveting. The details in describing the settings show how thoroughly he has researched."
I couldn‚Äôt put this book down. ‚ÄúLove shows up‚Äù is the resounding theme that beats like a drum through every page of this book.
"Charles Martin is my absolute favorite author. The Water Keeper and it's sequel, The Letter Keeper were devoured by this life time reader. Do not miss this series. Book 3 hits shelves June 2022."
Love all Charles Martin books
Martin touches your heart in ways most authors can‚Äôt! Can‚Äôt wait for book 3.
"Beautifully written, unexpected twist and turns. I was on edge throughout and was not disappointed. I cant wait for the next book"
Every book that Charles Martin writes I ask myself can it get any better and The Letter Keeper just proves that it can.
Charles Martin is a great writer. These two books were excellent. I hate that we must wait until June to finish the story!
It‚Äôs 12:30 am and I need to get to sleep but I couldn‚Äôt put this book down. Martin never disappoints!
Another fabulous book.  Always a pleasure to read sad to see it end.  Can‚Äôt wait to read what comes next.
"I like all of his books and finally got the hard cover I had pre-ordered, and got Kindle version instead."
Love wins. This story proves it. Depth of character and story kept me hooked from page one til the end.
"Great story teller, I love all his books!"
Another great Charles Martin book. Can‚Äôt wait for the next one
"This did not live up to my expectations for a Charles  Martin  novel. It seemed more like a ""who done  it""  thriller"
"The Letter KeeperMurphy Shepherd #2By Charles MartinA Richly Told and Riveting Story ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èSUMMARYMurphy Shepherd finds girls and women who are victims of human trafficking. His mission in life is to help these women not only find their freedom but he goes the extra mile by helping them recover from the ordeal in a safely guarded location called Freetown.  When his new wife and daughters are kidnapped from Freetown, Murphy shifts into high gear racing across the country to find them.  One dead-end leads to another and he and his canine partner Gunner find themselves racing back across the country yet again to find the men responsible and make them pay.REVIEWThe Letter Keeper Is a richly told and riveting story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It‚Äôs both a heart-wrenching and action-packed tale, with a protagonist that will leave you speechless.Murphy Shepherd also known as David Bishop will stop at nothing to save women in trouble. He‚Äôs a priest of sorts who is bold, fearless, and determined.  The characters in The Letter Keeper are the pillars of the story. Murphy, his new wife Summer, their daughters, his mentor Bones, and his friend Clay all coalesce to form a perfectly well-rounded cast of characters. The quintessential German Shepherd Gunner takes the prize for the best partner/dog ever!  I hesitate to even call them characters because they all seem so real.  You can‚Äôt help but feel the intensity and heartache and wonder if it‚Äôs a true story.One of life‚Äôs pleasures is a book that sweeps you off your feet, a poignant book that you can‚Äôt put down until the last page is turned, and even then you don't want it to end.  This is that book.  This is the second in a series and while you can certainly read THE LETTER KEEPER as a standalone, why would you want to miss the emergence of the intrepid Murphy Shepherd in THE WATER KEEPER. Besides, there will be a third book, and who doesn‚Äôt love a good series.Charles Martin is one of my favorite authors of all time. His writing is beautiful and descriptive. His novels before this series include Send Down the Rain, Long Way Gone, and The Mountain Between Us, which was made into a major motion picture all of his books are a pleasure to read.Thanks to Netgalley and Thomas Nelson for an advance reading copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."
"First, I have not read the first book in this series, but I wasn't lost, the author did a wonderful job of keeping me informed.This is a tough subject, but what a need, which has becomes more evident in the past few years with the news reports and headlines, sick individuals and a fallen world.Murphy Shepherd is awesome, what a heart, and I loved he would leave the 99 to find the 1, yes!There is some sweet romance here, but mostly your heart goes out to those who had been trafficked, the healing if possible, I can't even imagine. Maybe this should be a required reading book?There is another book to come, and we hope for a good out come, there is a bombshell dropped at the end of this read!I received this book through Net Galley and the Publisher Thomas Nelson, and was not required to give a positive review."
Wow.  I just finished Charles Martin‚Äôs The Letter Keeper and I have to say this author just gets better and better with every single book.  David Bishop/Murphy Shepherd is a priest who also rescues kids from human traffickers.  This is book#2.  I loved this one as much as I loved book#1 The Water Keeper.  We get a lot more of his background in this story.  I love that the author gives us a lot of action and then he gives us a moment to catch our breaths by giving us some background story before we are off again to more action packed scenes.  I love the main characters in this series.  I was not prepared for the ending at all.  I cannot wait for his next book!  I highly recommend reading The Water Keeper first.  Thank you to Netgalley and Thomas Nelson for the ARC.  All opinions expressed are my own.
"It has taken me a couple of days to figure out how to word my review. When I finished the book I was totally and utterly speechless, crying like a crazy woman and couldn't possibly write a worthy review of this book. I still don't feel like I can adequately put into words a review that will give glory to this book and to the amazing author that Charles Martin is.The Letter Keeper is a sequel to The Water Keeper. Both books tackle the tough and painful subject of human trafficking, but with the most delicate of hands. The main character, Murphy Shephard and his coworkers have made a living of saving the un-savable. They find them, no matter how hard it is, no matter how dangerous it is, no matter the costs and they bring them back to life, heal them, protect them, help make them whole again. Remind you of anyone? They leave the 99 to go after the one. Just as Jesus goes after his one sheep who is lost, who needs Him, so do they. Charles Martin does a perfect job of putting into words, into a beautiful story a way to show Jesus' love for us. It doesn't matter how many times we need rescuing, how far we've gone, His love shows up. Always. And in that same fierce and relentless way, Murphy goes after all of the kids who are taken and lost.This story really moved me emotionally. So many times in this book I felt like God was reaching back for me again. He was leaving the 99 to come for me. And that's what is so awesome about Charles Martin and his writing. He took the gift God gave him and has amplified it to God's glory. It's beautiful, it's heart wrenching, it gives you hope, it's a reminder that there are people fighting evil everyday and will show up.I honestly cannot recommend Charles Martin's books enough to the world. I will read anything and everything he writes, every book has inspired and touched me in a different way. He is hands down my favorite author. I encourage you to read one of his books, I promise you will get hooked.And 2022 cannot come fast enough for me. Book 3 on Murphy!!! I'm dying to know what happens next!!!!My thanks to Charles Martin, Thomas Nelson Publishing and netgalley for a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."
"‚ÄúThe wounds of the past carry a lot of weight when it comes to walking into one‚Äôs future, and if anything can rob you of now, it‚Äôs yesterday.‚ÄùThe Letter Keeper is the follow-up to The Water Keeper. You definitely need to read these in order.  While The Water Keeper brought the action, The Letter Keeper focusses in on the repercussions of the life Murphy Shepherd has chosen. He‚Äôs given up his life to rescue people from human trafficking, but the toll is high. He doesn‚Äôt know how to handle new relationships, and an injury forces him to let others take care of him for a while. But don‚Äôt worry, there‚Äôs plenty of action in the story as Murphy faces many life and death situations, because he always leaves the ninety-nine to go after the one. Nothing can keep that man down.The name of Freetown says it all: what is freedom worth? The story dives into the dark spots of humanity but Charles Martin weaves a message of hope through every page. The rescued women struggle with love and understanding that everyone is worth being rescued, but Murphy shares a similar struggle. He needs to let go of the past and so he can find hope and love in the future. Such great themes in this story make the characters come alive on the pages.This story captured my heart on such an emotional and insightful level, and it will be one of those novels that I think about long after I put the book down. I am excited that there‚Äôs a third in the series ‚Äì this does end on a bit of a cliff hanger, so I‚Äôm ready for book three!Overall Rating:5 stars (I loved it, couldn‚Äôt put it down)Suspense Rating:5 stars (Non-stop edge-of-your-seat suspense from start to finish)I received an ebook review copy of this book through NetGalley. All opinions expressed in this review are my own."
"Before you start this book, set aside about two days to do nothing but read because you won't want to put this book down. This has basically been the case with every Charles Martin book I've read, but I absolutely love this series. It's not because it gives me the warm fuzzies or makes me smile, but instead it makes me think. It affects me deep in my heart and mind. I feel so invested in Murphy Shepherd because the story is told completely from his point of view, so the reader is able to dive deep into his thoughts and feelings. I love this hero. He's a mix of a Jason Bourne/Jack Reacher type, but with a heart of faith and love. He's a protector, not only in the process of rescuing those trapped in human trafficking, but after their rescue.This book, like the previous one, looks at Murphy's past and how it impacts his present. In the first book it focused a lot on his relationship with his first wife. This book explores that some more, but answers a lot of questions about his relationship with his mentor and how Murphy came to be who he is. The present intersects as this past connection impacts those he loves in the here and now.This book, along with The Water Keeper, are two of my favorite books. I can't recommend them enough. After I read both I had to take a step back and just process all that happened. I really want to go back and read them again. Both have plot twists and turns that I didn't fully understand until the end. For me, that equals well written fiction.*I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in order to give an honest review, which I did.**"
"I finished this book several days ago.  But I had to wait and absorb it before I could even think about writing a review.  Once again, Charles Martin has ripped my heart out of my chest and made it ache for the characters you discover as you find yourself lost in the story.  The author has an amazing gift of taking a current global issue and relating it to the Bible and Christian principles.  Murphy Shepherd‚Äôs dedication and openness in helping to rescue and heal those who have suffered so much is inspirational.I will warn you, make sure you have a box (or two) of tissues close by.  You will need them!  And make sure you‚Äôre in a place where you can sob out loud ‚Ä¶ I mean ugly girl crying ‚Ä¶ and gasp out loud.  There are twists and turns, moments of intense agony, times of extreme joy, and pages of sitting on the edge of your seat in suspense.  Charles Martin has written a story that delivers the ugliness of humanity but is cleansed by God‚Äôs love and sacrifice.Be prepared for the last chapter!  But don‚Äôt peak.  It‚Äôs worth the wait.Thank you to NetGalley and Thomas Nelson for my advanced review copy.  All opinions and thoughts are my own."
"At times an action thriller, and at others a heart-tugging romance, Charles Martin is back with the second installment in the Murphy Shepherd series.Picking up in the previous book, Murph continues to risk his life to safe the one, but when the traffickers target his newfound family he will stop at nothing to bring them home.Filled with moments of non-stop action mixed with heartwarming moments, this book never stops for breath. I liked how we get to learn more about the inner workings of Free Town, as well as Murph's backstory. The story is nothing short of cinematic and larger than life, compelling and action packed, it is a difficult book to put down. Christian faith is alluded to, but not discussed plainly. Though not overly explicit this book talks about human trafficking in honest terms as well as the trauma experienced by the victims.A must read for anyone who read The Water Keeper, as it follows the same characters as they face new challenges. Heart-tugging, romantic, and heroic you won't want to miss it.I received a complimentary copy of this book. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own."
"I am a Charles Martin junky; I have read many of his books, several of them are in my all-time top reads, ‚ÄúWhen Crickets Cry‚Äù is in the top 5. But I knew at some time Charles would change genre‚Äôs and he would lose me. He did‚Ä¶.I gave the Murphy Shepherd series a second try and it struck out again. I think this series just goes over the top. The story starts out with a bang, a lot of action going on, then we mellow out for a while, deal a lot with women/child trafficking and then we have a bunch of action again. It loses the believability when Murphy just keeps going and going, like the energizer bunny.I guess at 64 years old and being a CM fan for years, I just didn‚Äôt want him to change. I want him to write more like Chasing Fireflys, Wrapped in Rain, and The Dead Don‚Äôt Dance. He had everything I love. Will I pick up another Charles Martin to read, you betcha I will, will I pick up another Murphy, probably not.I want to thank Thomas Nelson along with NetGalley for allowing me the opportunity to read an ARC. This one earns 4 stars."
"Charles Martin‚Äôs unique, powerful writing style is on full display in The Letter Keeper - it gets to the point, keeps the story moving, and packs an emotional punch. In this book, we pick up where The Water Keeper left off, with Summer, Angel, and Ellie starting a new life in Freetown. Meanwhile, Murphy continues making enemies as he rescues more children from traffickers. This book also dives into more of his backstory, from his childhood to how he met Bones and found his calling. Now he faces his most dangerous mission yet, with the highest stakes - rescuing the women he loves. The fierce, sacrificial love Murphy shows in his fight against evil is a beautiful picture of the lengths Christ has gone to rescue us. Suspense, drama, action, and a powerfully emotional story are all wrapped up in this one book - I highly recommend it and can't wait for the next book to round out the trilogy!I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own."
"After reading and loving The Water Keeper by Charles Martin I could hardly wait to get my hands on The Letter Keeper. I was not disappointed! Only that I now have to wait for this author's next book.The Letter Keeper is a perfect page turner!Once again we are in the world of Murphy Shepherd who has devoted his life to finding survivors of human trafficking.Freetown, a town high in the mountains of Colorado is where he brings the young people he has rescued so that they can heal physically, mentally and hopefully emotionally. However the story becomes personal for Murphy when his world is shattered by the sudden disappearance of his new wife, daughter and two others. He battles good vs evil as he hunts the evil men out to destroy him.Multiple surprises, many plot twists, edge of your seat suspense and wonderfully endearing and unique characters make this novel unputdownable.I am totally captivated with Charles Martin's story-telling!* I highly recommend reading The Water Keeper first *"
"The Letter Keeper by Charles Martin is book two in the A Murphy Shepherd Novel. When I requested this book, I was not aware this was a book in a series and had no problem following the story. The author does a wonderful job of filling in background information to keep the story moving along and easy to follow. This is a fast-paced, action filled suspenseful story. This story focuses on the topic of human trafficking and the struggles those who are rescued have to work through.With this story we catch up with Murphy as he is finishing high school and follow him through making a career choice that saves so many young people but costs him so much. This story is full of emotional and physical hurt that is not always easy to read but it is also a story that is hard to put down. I was totally surprised with the ending of the story and hope the author has another story to follow.I received a complimentary copy of this story from Thomas Nelson Publishers through NetGalley, this is my honest review."
"First things - I should have read the first one. I didn't realize this was the second in the series. Secondly - Trafficking of humans is the subject matter so if this triggers you, proceed with caution. It doesn't dwell on all the details and most of it is in the rescue phase, but it is handled well and it wasn't as heavy as I anticipated.I couldn't put this one down. It was a rich story that moved around quite a bit. I was in it until the end which brought a twist that I wasn't expecting and the promise of another book in this series.I admire the people that are strong enough to save others from this dire situation. I loved the relationships that were among those behind the scenes and the honest way it showed the healing process and the time that it takes for these victims to heal, if they heal.The characters were complex and flawed humans in the best sense of the words. I was honored to receive an eARC through netgalley and give this honest review."
"As I finished reading chapter twenty-one, I questioned whether or not I could finish reading this book. Not because I was disappointed, I wasn't. Not because I wasn't fully immersed in the story, I was. But simply because I did not know if my heart could hold any more. The Letter Keeper picks up where The Water Keeper left off, and this book is just as raw and vivid. It is filled with thoughts that one must sit with for a bit before reading on. It is one of those rare pieces of fiction that has the potential of being life-changing if only the reader is willing and not rushed or overwhelmed by life circling around them as they read.I did  go on to complete this book, and my heart does runneth over. I am very grateful to have received a complimentary copy of The Letter Keeper from Thomas Nelson via NetGalley without obligation. All opinions expressed here are my own."
"Murphy Shepard, a good man who deals with bad people, once again takes on the very serious job of saving victims of human trafficking. In this second part of his story, Murphy finds himself in Freetown, a town high in the mountains of Colorado where the young people he saves can heal both in body and spirit.As Murphy finds himself settling in to thoughts of a new life with a family, the bad guys come back to remind him they are still there. His trusty assistants, Bones, Clay, and Gunner, are back to add their own unique twist to the story.As always with Charles Martin, the emotional aspect of the story is gut-wrenching. Human trafficking is a tough subject. Charles Martin puts it out there and makes us look at some of the realities of an ugly world while showing us the power of healing and love.  As always his storytelling skills are on fine display and the story enfolds the reader and pulls you right in."
"Once again. Charles Martin has written a another suspenseful yet  thought provoking novel which manages to weave a story around the dark world of human trafficking alongside philosophical questions about finding meaning, purpose, joy and beauty amidst the realities of this  broken world.  The main character, Murphy Shepherd, is a complex man with a unique calling in his life work.  That life work was born out of his own pain and brokenness.  Charles Martin is a gifted and prolific writer, but I believe this series (of which the Letter Keeper is book 2) is some of his best work.  He is a skilled story teller that draws you in with complex characters.  He is skilled in bringing the reader greater awareness of one of the burning issues of our day - human slavery/sex trafficking, all the while likewise telling the story of individuals who are searching for meaning and connection in their own personal life.  Full of suspense, a share of relational issues and just a gripping read  - I highly recommend this book.  But also urge you begin with book one - The Water Keeper."
"""He leaves the ninety-nine.""Charles Martin has a unique way of writing stories that stay with you long after you read them and this one is no exception. This is the sequel to his novel, The Water Keeper, which also deals with the horrific subject of human trafficking. There is the same edge-of-your-seat tension in this story, but it did slow down a bit to give you the back story of how Murphy came to be such a sacrificial hero. And I loved that.I loved getting to know the characters better, especially Casey. Her story was so heart breaking, but Murphy gave her hope and a chance at a new life. I just finished this book last night and know that I will be thinking about it for a long time. It was just so powerful. Obviously, I highly recommend this book.**I was given a complimentary copy of this book from Netgalley and the publisher. All opinions expressed are my own.**"
"There are not many books my husband and I enjoy equally‚Äîbut Charles Martin hits it out of the park yet again with this phenomenal novel.‚ÄúBecause the needs of the one outweigh those of the many.‚ÄùHuman trafficking, abandonment, forgiveness, and grief are tackled with a beautiful tenderness as rescuer, priest, and author Murphy Shepherd puts his own life at risk, believing everyone is worth saving. But when his own loved ones are kidnapped, Murphy faces his most challenging rescue yet in page-turning action and heartbreaking vulnerability.The Letter Keeper can be read as a stand-alone but I would highly recommend reading The Water Keeper first‚Äînot only because it‚Äôs an exceptional read and should not be missed, but the reader will also fully appreciate the growth of the characters in this breathtaking story of freedom and redemption."
"This is the sequel to Martin‚Äôs The Water Keeper.  If you have not read it yet, you definitely will want to  before reading The Letter Keeper.  Once you‚Äôre ready to start this new book, hold on to your seat!  Again Martin takes his readers on a wild ride through the dark world of human trafficking.  There‚Äôs more on Murphy Shepherd‚Äôs background, as well as what happens after the end of The Water Keeper.  Gut-wrenching plot twists make it hard to put down the book.  Insights into the true nature of sacrificial love lead to thoughtful introspection.Be warned ‚Äì you won‚Äôt like the ending, because it‚Äôs a cliffhanger!  I don‚Äôt want to wait another year to find out what happens next!I received a complimentary copy of this book. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.  #TheLetterKeeper #NetGalley"
"I‚Äôm going to be honest. I was about 40% through the book and I didn‚Äôt really care to read anymore, which is weird, because I always love Charles‚Äô books. But the first half is really a lot of backstory and narration. I was bored.But I kept reading, and wow, I‚Äôm glad it did. I was up until 2am because I had to see how it ended. So push through that first half because the last half is well worth it and it does add a lot of depth to the overall story.I would say I think you need to read The Water Keeper first, otherwise you will probably be pretty confused, but you won‚Äôt regret reading that one either.A copy of this book was given to me through Netgalley. All opinions are my own."
"Wow, just wow.When you think Charles Martin's writing can't resonate with you more than it already does, he tops that by adding deep character dives, raw-panged emotion, and tense scenes.Murphy Shepherd is a man to be reckoned with if you're on the wrong side of the law, and as heroic as the Duke for those needing to be saved. This novel can be read as a stand-alone, but read The Water Keeper too. But, have tissues nearby for both, you're going to need them.I want 2022 to hurry up and get here, I've got a ""book date"" with Murphy Shepherd, and I don't want to be late.One amazing read.I received this book from the publisher but was under no obligation to post nor write a review."
"Among the many stories published in a year, there comes those that stand apart. The books with substance. The ones that address issues of our times. The ones that throws in a real life hero...not a Marvel superhero, but more of a Sampson whose strength comes from within--given from above. A hero who longs to rescues while wrestling with the same problems we do.I especially enjoyed reading this story written from the male perspective. Emotions are communicated in a far different way, yet true to the core.Don't hide from the this book because of the topic (trafficking) because if you do, you'll miss so very much.I read  a library copy of this book."
"The Letter Keeper is the second book in the Murphy Shepherd novels. This book started off with a bang, and then it goes into the backstory of how Murph became the kick butt hero he became. It also slows down a good bit and reflects on Casey. A girl he rescued from the first book and all the traumatic and emotional issues that come from being trafficked. I cried tears through much of that section of the book. Then, it takes a turn and there is a lot of action at the end in true Charles Martin style.  The ending leaves you wanting to read book 3.4.5 stars*I was given a copy of this book by Thomas Nelson and this is my honest opinion."
"Intense!  This is the second book in the Murphy Shepherd series dealing with human trafficking!  I doubt if any human is able to endure all that Murphy Shepherd does and survive to fight some more but it makes for a great read!  I learned a lot about the rehabilitation that has to be done after victims are rescued.  Sometimes a person keeps a secret because more people will benefit from that action.  We all need the love of an earthly father and, even more so, the love of our heavenly father!  I recommend The Letter Keeper to others.  I received a complimentary e-book through NetGalley.  This is my honest opinion."
"The Letter Keeper is an absolutely riveting mystery with an engrossing storyline. Murphy and Bones are multi-layered characters with true to life strengths and weaknesses. The other characters are richly developed whose recovery from their pasts remains a work in progress. Murphy‚Äôs new love is heartwarming but not without a few obstacles to overcome. With pulse-pounding urgency, Charles Martin brings this suspenseful novel to a jaw-dropping conclusion. Old and new fans of the Murphy Shepherd series will be impatiently awaiting next installment due to a stunning revelation.I received a complimentary copy for review."
"Charles Martin continues to be one of my most favorite authors. His stories are energetic, compelling me to keep reading or listening, but also demand periodic pauses to ponder some magnificent paragraphs. I listened to The Letter Keeper on audio (Jonathan K. Riggs is a fabulous narrator), but plan to purchase the hard copy when I can; there‚Äôs just too many passages I want to read again.The Letter Keeper continues the story begun in The Water Keeper (also magnificent). It‚Äôs a story that depicts sacrifice & love that withstands, no matter what. It‚Äôs a story that makes your heart pound with concern and then resound with the relief of victory. It‚Äôs a story with characters that live their moments loving others more than themselves. It‚Äôs a story that depicts the depths of evil hearts, but also the heights of glory-filled hearts. I will happily read every one of Charles Martin‚Äôs books."
"Murphy Shepherd‚Äôs life mission is to save children from human traffickers. He‚Äôs been shot at, burned by exploding bombs and put in other extremely critical situations. He is also clearly a haunted, broken man.With an arsenal of weapons and the coolest, most faithful dog ever by his side, he kicks butt along with his mentor, Bones who plucked him out of college to lead covert operations. These two characters are amazingly portrayed and I felt fully invested in their lives. Martin has a gift for writing, expert at creating atmosphere, strong characters and powerful emotional moments."
"This book had me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end.  I was holding my breath as Murphy Shepherd continued to ""leave the 99 to find the 1"".  The searches in this second installment of the series became extremely personal which made for an emotional read.  It was also helpful to learn more of the back stories for the memorable characters Charles Martin has created.  The subject of human trafficking is tough to tackle, but I believe this author handles it in a sensitive manner.  Thanks so much to NetGalley and Thomas Nelson for the advance copy to read and review."
"4.5 stars rounded upAnother great read by Martin! This book had more of slow build than the first one in the series, however, once the action started, it didn‚Äôt stop. I highly recommend reading The Water Keeper before The Letter Keeper to get the necessary background to appreciate the developing relationships between the characters and the story as a whole.I really enjoyed learning more about the characters that make up this book, each story is so powerful and unique. There are some hard parts to read, due to the series being about human trafficking, but this topic is one that needs light shone on it. Martin shines a light with heart and grace. Overall, Murph‚Äôs love and care for the women in his life is a beautiful picture of how God loves and rescues those He calls His own.Thank you to Thomas Nelson and NetGalley for a complimentary copy of this book. Opinions expressed in this review are my own."
"I‚Äôm in the minority here, but I‚Äôm not a fan of Charles Martin‚Äôs style of writing. I couldn‚Äôt get passed the first couple of chapters. The book jacket says it‚Äôs a sequel OR a stand-alone book, but that‚Äôs not the case. Read the book, The Water Ends, first. When I searched Amazon to order the first book, l learned that Martin also wrote Where the River Ends, another book I tried to read years ago and couldn‚Äôt get through. I don‚Äôt do that often. I‚Äôve decided not to finish this book or The Water Keeper. He‚Äôs just not for me."
"Murphy Shepherd finds the survivors of human trafficking, but then, it hits too close to home.  As in, very up close and personal.  His new wife, his stepdaughter and two other teen girls are taken.  Such an unimaginable thing.This was an emotional story for me.  Wiped me out.This is the second book in a series.  It will leave you hanging and begging for the next book.I was given an advanced copy by the publisher, Thomas Nelson and Netgalley.  I was under no obligation to leave a positive review."
I have had a countdown regarding this book since I learned of its debut.  I love Charles Martin's Books.  EVERYONE of them.  The Water Keeper was his best yet...until I finally got my hands on the Letter Keeper yesterday.  Now....today I am suffering because I stayed up all night reading - because I couldn't put it down.  This second book in the series DID NOT DISAPPOINT.Amazing writing. Engaging Story.  Deep Character development.Now to wait for Book Number 3.
Martin has crafted an intense suspense thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I was immediately engaged in the drama. The twists and turns kept me turning the pages. This book is hard to put down.Recommend to readers who enjoy inspirational suspense.I borrowed a copy from my local library. I've expressed my honest opinion.
"This is a well written book that hooks you on the first page and doesn't let go. It's a roller coaster ride of emotions and is full of action, suspense and drama. Loved it and can't wait for the next book in this series. Thank you Thomas Nelson--FICTION via NetGalley for the ARC copy of this book. All opinions expressed are my own."
"This book is a sequel to the Water Keeper and answers a lot of questions from that novel.  The ending was a surprise for me and now I am eagerly awaiting the next installment.The author did a great job of relating this story to how far Jesus the Christ goes in His love for us.  We will never be so far away that He will not come for us, just like Murphy does in these 2 novels."
The Letter Keeper is another awesome book by Charles Marti .  An edge of your seat page turner that captured my attention and held it from beginning to the end.  I highly recommend this book.  My thanks to the publisher and Netgalley for my advance ebook.  This is my unbiased review.
"The characters are compassionate, witty and intelligent. They have a strong moral code and live consistent with that code for good. As tense as things can get, I know that the good guy wins."
"Absolutely fantastic book. Im enjoying this series very, very much.Another great read from my favorite author!"
Very clumsy writing. Too far-fetched. Boring. Not likely to read any more in this series. Was halfway through before I found out the writer was a guy!
Charles Martin is my favorite author and this one!  The one is my favorite of his books! Buy it!  Read it!
"From the very first book of his that I read, I was hooked.  I am an eclectic reader.  I am never pulled in and fully engulfed by any other author.  He‚Äôs an amazing writer and I truly pine away waiting for his next book."
How he thinks up these twists and turns with such powerful words is truly a gift! Have read all of his books and this series is spellbinding!
As always Charles Martin doesn't disappoint.  A gifted writer with an amazing imagination.  A joy to read and a page turning story.
"Thrill, chills, and an amazing story. So well written that the words take you to the story as if you‚Äôre personally there in real life."
His books draw me in so tight and when they end I almost cry.  Thank you for this gift. Write on!
"......will we have to wait for the next book in this series???? As usual, an excellent read that leaves me asking, ""How long? ......"""
Amazon always has great prices on books. Plus this was a great read.
"Charles Martin has a gift with words‚Äîthey flow like the water that is central to his stories. In The Letter Keeper, he once again pulls readers into the shadowy world of Murphy Shepherd, tackling difficult, even nightmarish subjects with sensitivity and offering us a story of hope and the power of redemption. One caveat: this is not a standalone book; read The Water Keeper first. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.*I received a complimentary copy of this book. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own."
"With each book I‚Äôve read and continue to read, I am never disappointed. Reading a Book by Charles Martin always leaves me with a feel good feeling.. They are easy reads and the characters and settings are always who you want to know and where you want to live.."
"I really enjoyed this book, but probably not as much as the first one. However,  you can always rely on Charles Martin to deliver a fascinating story."
Great follow up to The Water Keeper.  Charles Martin's writing just draws you in.  I had a hard time putting this one down.  Can't wait for the third instalment in the series.
I liked the story. I found it a bit repetitious and then boom it ended and I found out the sequel is not for another year .
I like all Charles Martin books... this is just the latest...
Some times it's too scary and I have to put the book down and leave it a few days....but I know he will win.
I couldn't put it down.  I sure learned a lot about human trafficking. It breaks my heart that this goes on.
Relationship Goals the series he preached was AMAZING!! This book is just a walk through plus more of that series. He‚Äôs so genuine about helping people win in relationships and you can tell through every word and every page. Thank you so much Pastor Mike for giving us something we didn‚Äôt even know we need.

It seems that the study guide is more beneficial in a book club setting than just for myself. It has discussion questions that are suppose to be discussed in a group but it‚Äôs good to sit and reflect on what my answers would be to the questions. I also feel that the study guide is more geared for a group of single people. I know later in the book he talks more about success in marriage so maybe the study guide will have more discussion questions for people that are married toward the end of it. I‚Äôm only half way through the book now. Either way I highly recommend the book and the study guide and hopefully in the future I can use to study guide in a book club setting.
"After watching the sermon series, I expected the book to pick up on and delve further into the topics presented.  The writing is all over the place and the Biblical scriptures that grounded the sermon series are glossed over.  Total disappointment."
"Love everything about this study guide!! It encourages discussions based on the book and allows everyone regardless of marital status, to open up and dig deep when it comes to relationships! Thank you Pastor Mike and Nat for letting God use all of you to create such a blessing in our lives! ü§üüèΩü§üüèΩ"
"If you want to grow and win in relationships you should definitely go buy this book! I'm ready to win in relationships and so should you. So, go buy! It will bless your life, trust me."
"Absolutely love this book, couldn't put it down halfway through so real and honest.Michael Todd  is an amazing preacher I love his YouTube channel and live. He helps me get through a lot and have better understanding of the word and I hope he continues to encourage,  comfort, inspire and teach me and others for a long time. This review is for the book but ended up under the study guide. But I did get both and the study guide is amazing also. üôèüôåü§ó"
"This was one of the best Books we have read on Relationships within the Christian perspective! Not only was is honest, real and heart provoking it was convicting and beneficial to us individually and as a married couple! I highly recommend this book to anyone thinking about getting married or married! Thank you Pastor Michael Todd and Natalie Todd for sharing your trials, battles, brokenness and your overcoming and redeeming love! To God Be The Glory!"
"This book is more like a journal for a group session! Highly disgusted, I am glad that I only paid $6 for this book. I should send it back. DO NOT buy this book if you are looking for healing and a breakthrough. This book isn't it. This is clearly a book for a classroom of people. You take notes in this book, it's just so much wasted. I was looking for something totally different from this book and I didn't get it. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER book with his name on it. He should state what type of book this is on the cover, instead of having people buy this book and be highly upset like I was. UGH !!!! NEVER AGAIN !!"
Super excited to receive both books on time üôåüèΩ
If you‚Äôre like me and thousands of others who struggle in relationships and want to figure out your goal this is the book to read it is helped me so very much to see what God has planned for my life and how to have a God centered relationship.
Please check my book review. This is definitely what you need to win in your relationship
"Best relationship challenge I‚Äôve ever done!! I am currently single and so I was reluctant to get it and read it, but let me tell you, it was more than worth it!!! It does focus a lot on relationships (preferably married people) however, it helps you in daily life and relationships. Knowing how to talk to people, how to have a healthy friendship, and how to be open. It gives principles and guides that anyone can follow, but with scripture to back up everything!!! Awesome, easy, quick chapters!! Don‚Äôt miss out, get the book!!"
"Michael Todd is a  gem the world! God gave him such a down-to-earth Grace and it reads through in the study guide. Do it with a partner, a friend, or a group. This book and study guide help us to do relationships with a goal or a name in mind reminding us and putting special emphasis but God is our most important relationship!"
I finished this book in one weekend. Mind you I just went through a horrible break up but it was very eye opening on boundaries that I do not set for all relationships not just love. Must read!! I will keep and re read as needed for a reminder.
"The book was awesome! The study guide, not as much. I ran a book study group this summer and ended up writing my own study guide questions to direct our conversations. As a whole, our group found the companion study guide lacking depth and maturity for our age group. We are in our early 30's to late 40's."
Whoa. This book has drastically changed the way I view dating and other relationships. I love the Biblical way Pastor Todd and his wife speak truth. For an added bonus check out the YouTube sermons!
I opened the package and it looks like the study guide has been used. I would return it but it was on backorder and I dont want to wait for another one.Update: Wonderful content!!!!
"I saw the original sermons from a couple of years ago on YouTube and this book seems to have mainstreamed the message. I appreciated the original sermons because they seemed to approach relationships from a Godly, but interesting perspective. This book reminds me of the other books that I can read about religion and relationships - bottom line: it seems a bit bland."
The book is a great book. I‚Äôm happy to have it.The packaging for this book was destroyed when I received it. Including the book was destroyed.
"A great guide for those dating or already married. God‚Äôs ways are best & this is a fun, relational book to help give biblical pointers."
I have been waiting to get this study guide to read the book. I can't wait to learn and put the advice given to my life.
Easy to read and understand. Definitely there is information you need to get you on the right track
I loved the guide along with the book. It's most effective to tackle the guide in a group setting though.
Great study guide for couples. I love how this is helping me and my partner in our relationship.  Give it a try! Also it came well packaged and in great conditions
My best friend and I are going through the study guide together while reading the book. It has so many thought provoking questions and definitely increases your level of self-awareness! It pushes you to evaluate your thoughts and reflect.
Pastor Michael Todd is a blessing and a good leader! I study this and remain Anchored in God‚Äôs word.
I enjoyed the book and wanted the study guide to go along. I would recommend the study guide if you are going to read the book as a group. It has great discussion topics.
I like the book and the study guide. Good for those who are married or preparing for marriage
"Just ok, not rocket science.  Lacks substance in my opinion."
"Love the book and I bought it for my brother and me got mail surprise fast at home, pastor mike just killed it with this book. Love it!!!! Too books I recommend for everybody."
"This is a must have. Pastor Mike is a excellent teacher and very transparent. So, easy to relate to and engage in whatever he is speaking on. My daughter and her friends have a book club surrounded around this book. They really love it. God has given him a gift to connect with the old, the young, and in between. Got to love him!!!"
Have the book so wanted to try the study guide as well
Excellent advise for every relationship you are in.
I love this myself and my soon to be husband have been reading and doing the study guide together and I love itIt has helped us already and we aren‚Äôt even finished yet
Complements with the book when your doing a life group study
Purchased this by accident for a book club. It was the perfect mistake. We used the prayer before and after each read. We used the questions and benefitted from the topics
This book is definitely a MUST READ!  It gives you lots of tools to use to analyze every relationship in your life and compare it to your relationship with God.  I am recommending it to everyone I know!
Perfect study guide by Pastor Mike Todd
I can‚Äôt wait to read it just for it today
Love Michael Todd and his series on Relationship Goals!! Highly recommend! Life changing insights on how to do relationships.
Any help cannot hurt.
"Simply put this is a MUST READ! Regardless of your age, your relationship status, or your religion! Pick yours up today! Pastor Todd has been a life saver for me."
"Arrived quickly. And I just Love pastor Mike Todd, he‚Äôs so relatable and real."
My 20 year old daughter absolutely has been enjoying this book.

Life-changing!!!! I have purchased copies for so many friends and family members.  The best buy of 2020.  Buy it you won't regret it!!!
Powerful and Practical teaching
This study guide!! Pastor Mike has really out done himself. Using this with the book in our book club has made for such a great guide for our discussion.
Okay book.

A must read for every young Christian
Look forward to using it!
Great book I would highly recommend it.
"‚ÄúFor i know the plans i have for you‚Äù declares the Lord. ‚ÄúPlans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future‚Äù-Jeremiah 29:11"
Extraordinary this was purchased as a gift but I had to check it out...Awesome
Wasn‚Äôt for me
The sermons are the bomb I know this book is going to be the bomb your relationship is truly a goal if not better I‚Äôm trying to reach thank u and I haven‚Äôt even starting to read this book yet I know it‚Äôs fire I will be starting this week for sure
Great step by step on how to read the book. I love who it even prepares you to ask those awkward yet vital questions to you family especially since I am an-only-child sometime asking is hard but the guide helped me.
A lot of informative information on here.
The book is amazing! It‚Äôs so detailed and it motivates you to do the right thing
"Pastor Mike Todd did his thing with this one.  If your looking for  biblical guidance in relationship, get this book"
Enjoyed the book
Great book to help with a group study.
Love this book and this study guide helps so much with my women‚Äôs group I do! Keeps us on track and helps us think about the questions provided!
This is more for a book club or group setting not for a solo. But still useful and pairs up with the actual book great !!
Best book/ study guide I‚Äôve ever read. I recommend it to everyone I meet haha
Such a blessing. The sermon is amazing and to add a book and work book it‚Äôs personal and allows me to journal even more. The Word of God has to be the foundation to every relationship.
I was expecting the book more psychology oriented but it was mainly religion oriented.I like some concepts which I have uploaded picture but as non-Christian the effects were not very strong.
This is awesome for leading a small group
Great Study Guide to go along with the book. Highly recommend
Looking for more in this book
Loving it
Every married couple of all ages need this book!!! Love this powerful Holy Spirit gilled preacher!!! God Bless you Pastor Todd!
Great book I learned a lot
Just received my book. I reader the first section already good!!! Getting a group together!!
"This book is the most amazing relationship book I have ever purchased. Everyone should read this book! It is truly a blessing, on blessing, on blessing!"
No matter where you are in life this book will definitely give you the Godly based principles that you need to win in all relationshis! I recommend that you get it ASAP!
Love it!
"I found this book is very help, it offers multiple approaches in helping you navigate in your relationships. If you in a relationship, I would recommend reading it."
This book is amazing for someone who is just getting into Michael Todd. It is always good to see things on paper but I love the content. Most of the books are written dialogue of his sermon series.
A great tool!
Amazing
Received today damaged. Didn‚Äôt want to rate it since I literally just received it and haven‚Äôt used it yet but it‚Äôs damaged so that‚Äôs why it gets 3 stars
We didn‚Äôt use because we weren‚Äôt pleased with the book.

Beat book for relaxation building
Amazing... awesome book.
Life changing
Wonderful read.
very good reading
The book came early and it is perfect!
Awesome read!
Changes life
"Pretty good book overall, I think this may be a must read for people between 15 and 25 I can see this being used by youth groups all over the country.  I don't see this book being helpful for married couples or people over a certain age but I can be denial on what I think people should know. It's a fun read even at time find my self laughing but nothing really ground breaking in book, or things to be studied in the future just more organized and put on paper. It's a quick read and can be informative."
Just purchased this book will be reading it together with my wife. Cant wait to dive into Gods word on Relationship Goals!
"Let me first start by saying I didn‚Äôt finish this book or even the first chapter. I should‚Äôve done a little homework on the author first, but he is a prosperity gospel teacher, and has preached with people like Joel Osteen, and at charismatic churches. His intro into the book writing about his wife, he calls his wife his ultimate relationship goal. This is being written by a ‚Äúpastor‚Äù saying his ultimate relationship goal is his wife, not God. It‚Äôs idolatry. And he tries way too hard to be relevant to today‚Äôs culture in the way he writes versus trying to set himself apart. I just couldn‚Äôt in good faith continue reading this book. I would advise against anyone who is a Christian reading this book."
"I got this book base on the reviews. I hesitated since its written by the preacher, but I already read some books from spiritual leaders that are very valuable. Everything in this book is: trust the God, follow the God, obey Gods rules. Difficult to find anything else there."
Realizing that after 38 years of living and 3 kids and numerous failed relationships. Doing things all wrong I just hope that today this new hope ive found will lead me to the desires of my heart. This book was incredible! I do not like self help reads they usually bore me but this was real and exciting from beginning to end. I‚Äôm waiting on my workbook and will reread once I receive it! That‚Äôs Pastor for this amazing read. I am angered but enlightened Better late than never.
"#RelationshipGoals is a very thorough book to help us see how we can truly win in ALL relationships through God‚Äôs Word. Our most important relationship is with God and when we nuture, build, and master our relationship with God 1st we ultimately win in any other relationship!"
"First of all I would like to say I love Pastor Mike he is my favorite pastor. This book was icing on the cake it‚Äôs educational, humorous, and most important to me it‚Äôs real. My boyfriend is actually reading and enjoying it and he hasn‚Äôt read a book since high school 20 years ago, that says it all. It‚Äôs a must read......."
"I give this book easy 10/10, everything in this book is top quality and backed up by the wonders of God. I myself have been going through a lot and one thing I manifested this year was a healthy relationship and I am slowly seeing It come to pass since I started reading this wonderful book. Pastor Mike Todd is truly blessed and I cannot wait to visit his church in the future."
I just read this book. So good. So insightful. Just bought more to give to my adult children.
Great Brook!!!!!! A MUST GET! So much truth I can‚Äôt take it! üôåüèΩ
Love the Book. Really changes my relationship interactions now.
"Love it ,Love it ,Love it !!!!!!Awesome"
Excellent book!
Super super ecstatic! I have been waiting for my books so anxiously and now that I have them I'm so happy I made the choice to get them both at the same time!
This is perfect for a group study or a couple to study together.
Reading it now and so far so good. I love everything about it. Can't wait to finish it and discuss it with others who are reading it as well
"Thought I was buying the book, this is great though."
This book is beyond a blessing !!
Like the examples!
So happy I bought this.This book allows you to be a heart surgeon.And really dig deep into the foundation of why you think a certain way about such a big topic.
"Pastor Mike is a blessing. This book has really helped me a lot , I‚Äôve learnt a lot from it . God bless pastor mikeüôèüèæ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Amazing book would recommend
Wow wow wow this book is amazing God is speaking to many in this book thank you for the great revelation.
Great information work book.
Everyone I bought this Study Guide for loves it!!
Loved the book but it seems like it's aimed at groups rather then individuals
I‚Äôll recommend it everybody go read it!!
"I've listened to the audio book and it is a MUST read. I accidentally purchased the Study Guide, instead of the actual book. I kept this study guide, although it is intented for a small group (church members). The study guide has helped me for my daily devotionals. The study guide refers to questions based on a video (which is not included). It has a great reflections based on the book. It is definitely the next level to reflect and make changes in your life."
This has been a great study! Max Lucado is a wonderful author and speaks as well as writes from the heart. This consist of 5 sessions that focus on Anxiety and what the Bible says about it and what we can do to help with the subject. This study has really helped me a lot. I highly recommend this to anyone who suffers from Anxiety.
"Amazing book. so much so, that I bought several copies to give away to friends who needed this exact help."
"I bought this study guide as advertised: In this five-session video Bible study, bestselling author Max Lucado explores God‚Äôs treatment plan for anxiety found in Philippians 4:4‚Äì8. ...I bought this in addition to the book of the same title to help in leading a small group. When it arrived on my Kindle, i was very disappointed to find out that none of the videos are included! In the ""VIDEO"" study guide, to me it is implied that you would also be paying for access to the videos that are integral to this study guide. Very disappointed, not in the content but the fact that I can't access the videos that the content is based on!"
Excellent book that anyone who has ever panicked or been anxious should read. Common sense writing that is clear and easy to understand this is a winner from Max Lucado. We used it with our Sunday School class and found the scriptures to be excellent that are included in the book.
"Did this with my bible study group via Zoom during Covid. Not only did it come at a perfect time because of the pandemic but for a regular worrier like me. I have to constantly remind myself that worrying does not honor my trust in God and that I have control over the thoughts I have. I‚Äôve passed along some of this knowledge and feel more equipped to comfort friends during this time. Non-believers included, Max‚Äôs words and the scriptures he talks about are a must. Phil 4:8-9"
"Wonderful 5 week study. We completed this study in a small group setting and it went well. The video sessions are great! I would recommend the book (sold separately), too. You can never go wrong with Max Lucado, and this topic of anxiety is one many can relate too at some point or another."
"I used this book in an online bible study forum, but it is rich with helpful, insightful, and probing material that even several weeks in a study cannot cover. The exercises in the text require some thought and reflection through which obstacles to peace may be uncovered. I loved this book, as I do most of Max's writings, but it seemed to promote more digging and a deeper look at what can and will hinder our peace if we let it. God's desire is that His children experience the peace that surpasses human understanding, which only He can provide. I highly recommend for those struggling with anxiety or simply want to  experience His peace in this chaotic world."
Great small group study - Make sure you allow 90 minutes for the study or do over multiple weeks.  It is really worth the time.
"We all go through times of anxiety, and I read this a while back during one of them.  Then the pandemic struck, Max Lucado offered his course online, and I did this again.  I saw different things which I assume was from the different circumstances.  But I recommended this to so many during these challenges.  He has a wonderful way of being encouraging, not scolding, infusing every sentence with scripture and reassurances.  I am sure there will be a time I am revisiting this book.  I almost look forward to it, except that he has so many great books waiting for me to delve into."
"I have only read a couple chapters so far, but my wife has read this and loves it. She bought copies for her closest friend, who have too much anxiety like most of us.  The title is from Phillippians, and is basically to be anxious for nothing, but instead to ask God for answers."
Just get the book. This study guide is not needed at all. But know that the book is very confusingly laid out. It's def light reading for fretting. Not so much for severe anxiety.
We chose this book for our virtual bible study group during the pandemic. It could not have been a better topic for these uncertain times. Max Lucado is an amazing writer and speaks straight to the heart of your fears. It has provided a voice of comfort and peace.
I was unaware this book was set to go with a group setting.. I thought I could get past that and possibly still gain something from It until I realized I was also supposed to purchase a cd to go with it.... so it‚Äôs useless to me
Have Downloaded and deleted this book multiple times on 2 different Windows 10 computers..  But everytime I try to open the book via Kindle it crashes.  I bought an eBook from another source and it works perfectly.  It's a great study for these trying times.  Just don't buy the Amazon version to use it on a PC.
A good topical study that uses the Bible to search for peace it offers in this chaotic world.
"I'm rating the quality of the copy that was sent to me. I'm very pleased. It arrived just as was stated in the information. I haven't started reading it yet, but I'm pleased with the delivery."
Did not realize it was a group based activity type book. Purchased it to read alone. Now I have to pretend I‚Äôm a group counselor and my family needs therapy.
"Wisdom for the worrisome soul. This book is wonderful. Max Lucado gets it. If you suffer from worry or anxiety and want Christian insight on what God says about it, this is the book for you."
I really enjoyed this study. There is an accompanying book that I also purchased. You don't need the book to do the study but I enjoyed having something extra to do throughout the week. You will also need to purchase the videos to stream during your study.
The material  was great and  conducive to  small group  study...  i no longer  want the hard copy  and will be returning it  soon... thanks
My small group is using this guide paired with the book. It has some really thought provoking questions/topics for discussion. The video content (purchases separately) is a bonus as well
Every one needs to read very supportive living our daily lives. Helps one to live in peace. Anxious for nothing but Lord is near.
We watched the videos at our home group which we found helpful. The study guide is useful to help the person leading the group.
An excellent read!!!!!  Very encouraging!!!!
"The guide is helpful; however, I thought I was ordering the book which is easy to read & very helpful. A good study./"
"Typical Max Lucado style...encouraging, uplifting and filled with God's truth.  A great read to help in any circumstance.  I loved it."
My friend had always wanted to read the book.  I found this workbook and got it as a gift.  They loved it.
I liked the stories that applied to the scriptures in the study and the cool way to memorize scriptures.
This has been a wonderful focus for our Bible study group.  He has such a relevant way of writing that makes you absorb the real truth into your soul.
"Excellent for those leading Bible study. Did not always reflect my thoughts about how a chapter in the book , but always provocative."
At least half of the pages were written on. The writing made reading the texts difficult and distracting.
This book did not disappoint! Since I struggle a little with anxiety myself this was such a great help! LOVE!
Bought to go with the book. Just adds a little extra depth into thinking through what the book is speaking to you.
The format is a bit confusing as you go back and forth at different places in the book and the workbook.  Lots to think about just distracting from the content.
I find this book to be pack with much-needed information since I am in school and it's apart of my course assignment it's very useful even away from school.
I thought this was a book
It was a perfect book for the covid world we live in even though written prior to it.
My five stars are because this study reminded me who my trust needs to be in regardless of my life journey wheather good or bad  the Lord is always near. It also made me realize that memorizing Gods word truth is a lamp unto my feet.
Looking forward to the study!
"What an awesome book. Really enjoyed this. Lots of great info. Anyone who is anxious, this is a great book. Very helpful. Bought several for gifts."
Loved the book but the audio version that I bought only went up to chapter 8!! I am legally blind so I depend on the audio! Very disappointed!
Favorite Author. She was thrilled
Wonderful insights for my Ladies Bible Study
Would send to a friend.
So good! I struggle with anxiety daily and this book has helped bring so much peace!
Used it in our Bible study group.  High praise from the participants.
Great book.  I did it as a Lifegroup Study.  You can learn so much reading this book and watching video.  This book changed my life.  I don't worry anymore. Great read for everyone.
Very helpful book --- simple great suggestions for managing anxiety
Fantastic
Religious crap.  Ok if you‚Äôre into that.  Gave to a bible believing pal.
Did this bible study with friends!  I enjoyed it
Our women‚Äôs Bible study group has been using this material for the past five weeks. It is excellent and has been very helpful to all of us and we have grown spiritually.
Great Product!
you won't regret buying the study guide and boo together.
Love it
love the book Max Lucado is one of my favorits spiritual writers.
A great reminder despite worldly events who is in control.
Good learning tool for use with the hard cover book.
"Great ""warm-fuzzy"" lessons from Max!"
We have just started. Study with this book but I am very impressed so far! Practical and well written!
Was not an actual book just a study guide and cannot return
"Great book, based on and sticks to great scripture. Recommended to any one who struggles with anxiety or anyone who wants to be better equipped to help people. Sticks to the bible and it is presented well."
Excellent book. I got the CD version since I travel a lot and will be listening to it more Than once
Love max lucado. Does not disappoint
This was quite inspiring.  I have now purchased this book for friends and family.
"I already knew the author. The book is great and I am really enjoying specially during this time of Covid, dealing with anxiety. A great help."
Have not read it yet but happy with quality and shipping.
Good small read
Great add to the amazing book!
Great study guide. Check you local library for the book and/or CD
Book arrived soaking wet!
Great resource to use if you're doing the video study. Has good discussion questions.
A wonderful book reminding me of how much God is in control and all the worrying in the world gets us no where! Filled with little jewels of wisdom. Something you can read over and over.
Great Study
Helps me show my love and concern for a friend.
Using this for a Bible Study at church. Easy to read and understand!
Good material and DVD.  Expected to have the book included for the price.  Was under the impression it would be.
"Meant to buy the book, but purchased the workbook instead.  I will share them with friends."
Great book to read to help you with worry and fear.
The fort knight toy was not in a box or a bag. Was left on my porch anyone could of seen it and grab it. I was lucky I was coming home and it was there.
Excellent study! Highly recommend. Practice & effective! Highly recommend!
It's fine not high reader
I would highly recommend this study!
"The topic is well handled and some of the questions the author asks are very good.  But the format of the book is basically a work book and I did not find the format useful to our group that chose to ""read"" the book."
GREAT BOOK
This book provided one of the best studies in our church prayer group.  All the women said they planned to keep the book as a frequent reference they would use.
Enjoying this book.
Great read
"I love Max Lucado and his practical way of teaching scripture that is so deep, yet so easy to comprehend.Let this book reach your soul and grant you peace"
"The Bible Study ""Anxious For Nothing"" is very relevant to issues that many face in our world today. I give it high marks and reccomend this study to anyone, particularly if you deal with anxiety. Max gives tools to help resolve our anxiety!"
This a top-knotch series for small church groups.  We just finished it and were very happy with it.
Can't wait to dive into this study!
Everyone should have this book in their library...
Great book
Excellent book!
It was a gift comments from the person that received it or positive
So far using this in Bible study and is very helpful.
Muy buen libro
Good study book but the actual full book is better
Max Lucado books are always good. ‚ÄòAnxious for Nothing‚Äô was no exception. In it he tells us how to overcome life‚Äôs pain and stress.
Awesome book just what I needed.
"New, clean looking"
Gave it to my sister who is always anxious for everything and anything. She read it three times and told me it has cured her anxiety!!
Great
Very good study on Anxiety
Very well put together series and extremely helpful.
Max Lucado is amazing! Our Bible Study using this book along with the video was very helpful in learning to deal with stress.
this book gives me hope. I love reading it over and over again
How can you go wrong by listening to Max Lucado?
Very good study and has DVD companion.
This study has helped me to go into greater detail when reviewing the text and the associated scriptures. It's a wonderful adjunct to the main book.
A great help in overcoming anxiety
Great bible study by Max Lucado!!!
thanks for a great book Max
Good book
I am in a book club and this book was on point.  I look forward to reading more from Max Lucado
Another Max Lucado hit!  Our group is highly encouraged by the study.
thought I ordered the book not the study guide.
You can bet
Excellent Study - would highly recommend!
Our church had this for bible study we gotsome insight with the whole group contributing
Ordered for mother in law. She loved it
Totally recommend this book.
Great book!
"Incredible book, has changed how I approach my day and life with Christ."
The content is very easy to understand and Max Lucado uses scripture to teach about letting Jesus take our anxieties and carry them for us.
Max gets to the heart of the matter in this book. What makes us anxious? He brought out things in this book that I have never thought about.
Another P31OBS pick and study winner
Still doing the study and finding it very helpful!
"Our bible study is currently using this book and videos. Excellent message, great group discussion talking points. Highly recommend."
Great advice for handling the stresses of life
Max Lucado does it again Great Book
Good book. I did this study with a friend. We both benefited from Lucado's encouragement and wisdom.
Used this guide for a wonderful inspirational bible study.
perfect
my friend loves it
I didn‚Äôt realize it was a study guideSo I am disappointed....
Cd box was Smushed and broken cd was upside down not attached to holder and has scratches all over it.
Beautifully written.

Love this study
Great study!
Fantastic book!
Have not read this yet but even my non christian friends love this book.
Very good it goes along with the book Anxious for nothing.
Came in great condition.  Look forward to reading and reviewing
"As an Anxious person, this is a helpful read!"
Great Bible Study! Fast Shipping!
Great companion to the book.
Max Lucado is my favorite Christian author - awesome verbiage in all circumstances
"It appeared that it was to go along with some DVD series, and that was not included, so it was a waste of time/money."
"I purchased this book from Amazon to read with my sister's as a bible study group. All opinions are my own. üåüüåüüåüüåüüåüAnxious For Nothing by Max Lucado. With the chaos in the world today with technology, war, terrorism, and fast paced life we choose, it is hard to keep the anxiety away. It's there always close and very, very real for some people. Lucado gives us hope in finding a different way to perceive and keep anxiety at bay while gaining faith in powers greater than ourselves. As a nurse, I truly realize just how anxiety can grab a hold of you and make you struggle to even breathe, and while this book is not a cure all for an anxiety disorder it will give you a calm feeling and a hope to one day become more powerful than the emotion that is trying to control you. My sisters and I chose to do this as a group bible study but this can be read and the workbook done alone in your own space and pace. I enjoyed the group discussions we had and the way we can talk to one another about the book. It gives you an insight to other perceptions, so if you have a buddy that will read and work through the workbook with you it makes it that much more rewarding."
"Borrowed this book that had a different description, and nothing on the cover indicated that this was a book for a church group. I was looking for something more based on research and scientific studies, so I only made it a few pages."
I used this series to conduct a Bible study in the Colorado Prison system. It was a fantastic experience for my self and the attendees!
"This book truly brought me calm. Using the study guide, it was a great tool to focus on true perspective and the God who brings peace. Highly recommend."
"I love every page ,so soothing!"
Excellent Bible study.  Good notes and insights.
"This book felt like a big hug from God! With Max Lucado's comforting style of presenting God's will for our lives, it brought me much peace."
This is a good study guide for anyone struggling with anxiety. I'm only in session 3 but it's been great and I'm learning a lot.
"What a wonderful book and Bible study for any time, but especially this time of pandemic."
Great companion for Anxious for Nothing: Finding Calm in a Chaotic World.
Liked price!
Absolutely wonderful. I am reading it for the second time!
Max Lucado is AWESOME as Always!
Great book
Nice read.
Great reading especially during this time for especially those that experience anxiety.
"The quote on the introductory page to each session (Session 1 - Session 5) is/are excellent & I am building the foundation to my lesson plans around each session introductory page.  I've been invited to teach a class about anxiety @ church & this study guide will be an integral part of our class dynamic each Sunday for 6 weeks in a row!  The study guide is practical & promotes inspirational thought by the reader.  There is plenty of material to keep both teacher & class member busy, although the guide outlines the schedule for both a 60-minute session or a 90-minute session each week."
"Brilliant, really helped me understand my anxiety and what to do. Also helped to read something that I could relate to"
"we read this as a church home group,  excellent way to get everyone to open up about the woes life throws at us"
Good teaching on the subject in hand for group use or personal use.
Excellent study for the book of the title.
Great product and price
It‚Äôs been such a great help in what my husband and I have been living. It helped us do turn away from our problems and trust in God. And God did prevail with a job and housing for us all within a week.It helps me and reminds me to keep faith and lean on my Heavenly Father and not fret and be thankful in everything at all times. I had forgotten this and was looking too much at our problems and not look at all the daily blessings.
Helps to learn doing a study with group on it
Great book and study guide
ü•∞ i love itMay faith be the guiding Light of our life
Great lite read for those wanting to get more in the word of god. It has 2 days of devotion focusing on a single topic with the first day focusing on a story or devotion and the second day focusing on the biblical versus.I like it because I will read the two days at the same time and then reread the second day on the following night to really let it sink in.Overall great for those trying to get in the word but not overly deep for those trying to feel moved.
"Bought for my husband, nice to find one that is for men on here, not as common in local stores. Loves daily strength for men by chris bolinger 365 day day devotional.  has ribbon marker. DAY 1 you read a small verse, (from psalms) followed by a story type reading the first day and take time to reflect on your thoughts, then on DAY 2 you read a passage, verse, & context  followed by questions for reflection and application you answer (perhaps in a notebook if you keep one) followed by a prayer. nice faux leather cover. would reccommend‡∏Ö^‚Ä¢Ôªå‚Ä¢^‡∏Ö‡∏Ö^‚Ä¢Ôªå‚Ä¢^‡∏Ö‡∏Ö^‚Ä¢Ôªå‚Ä¢^‡∏Ö"
I read a review on this book and it stated that it was ONLY old testament verses. That is not accurate at all. The author does use a lot of Isaiah but he throws some new testament stuff in there. The main thing is that this devotional is amazing. Every day has such a great message then the next day takes the previous reading a step further and offers questions to ponder. Every man needs this devotion book.
"This is the best devotional I've found and I've looked at A LOT... it's hard to find one which is balanced with inspiration, a verse, thoughts or questions to ponder and humor. Well, this slim edition does it all and offers true words of comfort everyday."
Great for daily devotions
I got this for my husband. It is a very nice looking book and he does enjoy reading it.
Great daily devotional for men who real want to walk the walk.
Excellent
I bought this for both of my sons. Great gift to provide inspiration for my grown sons.
I bought this for my husband he really likes it everyday he reads in it.
GIFTED TO A FRIEND.  VERY PLEASED WITH THE QUALITY AND CONTENT.
Great devotional for men
Husband uses this daily. He loves the messages.
I purchased this for my boyfriend and he absolutely adores it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Need a good devotion in your life? I really like this one. So much so I bought several for gifts
Brother liked it
Just As described.
Love the verses
My husband loves it.
wasn't my speed
I really appreciate this devotional because it's unique. Most men's devotionals I've found are sports-focused or don't have many Old Testament references. This devotional JUST has Old Testament verses. It's really well-done.
"Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!  Got my copy, was excited for the content and approach.  Love the cover; far more durable than paper, and more flexible than a hard back. I consider my daily reading akin to taking a vitamin for my sole. Well done Chris!"
Recently acquired this Devotional at a Men's conference.  This is a great way to provide some perspective and turbo charge your day.  This will make a definitive positive impact on your life in 2019!
My co worker received  it today and the first thing he said great gift to start daily with a motivation.  I liked that we all need God;s words daily
Enjoying this devotional very much.
"My husband hard to buy for. He has everything you can think of. I got this devotional to read nightly as he wasn‚Äôt really raised on the Bible and don‚Äôt quite understand it. It has some great stories in it to be able to connect to it. Some stories are like from ancient times or stories about the wars on how people changed. It also mentions a story about field of dreams. He loves it. Easy read and small stories for the day. Nice soft leather and worth the money. If you are trying to add faith and devotion back to your life, this is worth it."
"Any time a pastor asks a congregation for tough questions, the first one that always seems to pop up is ""why do bad things happen to good people?"" And it's a serious question, worthy of a serious answer, which is why so many books have already been written on the topic by some of the best-known names in church history over at least the past 2,000 years.What makes this particular book worth reading is that it's by a famous pastor I could (and have) sit/sat and listen(ed) to for hours. T. D. Jake's views on almost anything theological are worth a read or listen. He has a way of making his arguments simple and personal, yet convincing.With one caveat, at least for this book - he assumes readers believe in the existence of God and accept the Bible as authoritative for Christian living. Back in seminary I was taught not to rely on such assumptions, because they only work on those who already believe. If you think God is as imaginary as Santa, and that the Bible is just stories from ancient history, nothing in this book is likely to convince you otherwise.But for those who DO believe in the Bible as a guide for life, this book is a very readable and understandable guide to how the God of the Bible allows and uses trouble to mold us into who he wants us to be.I particularly liked how open the author was about his own problems and fears over many years, as it's one thing to say God loves you and wills your best when you've never had reason to doubt such a sentiment, and quite another thing to still say the same after being dragged through the meat grinder of human ills.Overall, a good read for Christians hitting a tough patch and wondering where God is in their troubles."
"This is the 1st book I‚Äôve read by Bishop Jakes and I loved it. He got me thinking that in nature things that undergo crushing or pressure become transformed and improved by the experience. The obvious is grapes crushed to make wine, carbon crushed to make diamonds, wheat crushed to make flower etc‚Ä¶ And then there‚Äôs me, the physical human being living a spiritual life. I too am under the same physical laws. I crush my body in the gym to make it strong, I crush my mind in books to make it smart, I crush my spirit in The Word to make prosper. And then there‚Äôs the crushing that I never want or expect. These are the crushings that challenge me to rise above and become a better, more refined person. IF and only IF I do not identify with the crushing experience. If I can let go of the emotional attachment and keep pressing on, forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead. IF I can allow God to process me then I will come out of the valley of the shadow of death a new and improved me‚Ä¶. Wow, what a revelation for me. I very much recommend this book."
"For many years, now, Bishop Jakes has been in sync with whatever it was I needed to know NEXT on my personal journey and walk with GOD. From Reposition Yourself, thru DESTINY, INSTINCT and SOAR, he's authored the perfect word for my season. Well, this one is so right on, I think he's obviously had a wiretap on my conversations with God, all this time!! If you've ever dealt with the questions of ""Why me, God?,  Is this just another course correction, God? Is this 'crushing' of my plans, really YOUR will for me, to be still and truly address WHY I'm being detoured?"", this is YOUR book and the one you've been waiting on, all this time.Just know, if you're looking for me, for the next fifteen days, I'll be right here, in my favorite chair, before sunrise, reading and meditating on a chapter a day from CRUSHING, because I trust that when I come through, on the other side, I'll not only know that I'm not alone ... but I'm exactly where I'm meant to be and ALL THINGS are working for my good."
"This is the first pre-order book that I‚Äôve purchased. But, I had to have it because I‚Äôm literally just coming out of a season where ‚ÄúI was crushed beyond recognition!‚Äù I didn‚Äôt even recognize myself at the end of the crushing. Although, I knew God would use it for His glory...I didn‚Äôt want Itbecause I didn‚Äôt want to be in the wine press anymore. I said to the Lord, ‚ÄúI give up, you can keep the blessings because the testing is too hard!‚Äù This book has me looking from God‚Äôs perspective and His strategy to fulfill His divine purpose for my life. If you‚Äôre in the ‚Äúcrushing‚Äù season, this book is for you. If you‚Äôre not being crushed right now, this book is for you too, because it will better help you understand the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù when everything falls apart. Thank you, Bishop Jakes for sharing your crushing experiences with us and for letting us know that we will be ‚Äú...stronger, truer, and more dependent on God‚Äù in the crushing places!"
"T.D. Jakes Crushing God Turns Pressure into Power is inspirational, uplifting & riveting at its best. It‚Äôs very refreshing to read a book where a Leader who has been in ministry for over 40 years bear all with the people of God by leading by example that he is acquainted with the very struggles that we all tend to deal with within our very lives. I haven‚Äôt been able to put this book down because it is diffidently a page turner filled with golden nuggets of wisdom. I especially love Chapter 9 page152 where Bishop T.D. Jakes share & I quote ‚ÄúBut waiting was far more beneficial because the Lord was working on something marvelous in a secret place. He was working on my Character. He was working on my heart. He was working on my nervousness. He was working on my motives. He was working on my wisdom. He was working on me, boiling off every single impurity because there was no way God was going to present to the world an unrefined, unfermented, underdeveloped product. That right there is a mouth full. If you haven‚Äôt purchased your copy of this book you really need to get this book it will truly bless you in many profound ways. And while your at it if you can be a blessing and bless someone else with this book. Happy Reading!!! :)"
I buy Audiobooks for the speaker‚Äôs abilities to teach or educate using their gift or talents.Very disappointed to watch an 1.5 hour YouTube episode on this book......  Buy it ahead of time.....then have a third party speaker to read the book with the celebrity‚Äôs picture on the advertisements and cover.I did not buy this audio book so I can listen to a fill-in person to read it. It is no different than going into a Cinema and watching an actor play the part of the ‚Äúmissing‚Äù star performer.
"I was in tears by the end of this book. Such a profound, biblical take on the harrowing crushing seasons we endure in this life. If you find yourself undergoing hardships that you don‚Äôt understand, and you want a godly perspective, this is the book for you."
"We've all had ""rock bottom"" moments in our lives, and in this book, TD jakes shares his emotional ""rock bottom"" moments which leads him to walk in his purpose with God as his  guide. It's good when successful people share their story because it kets me know that i'm not the only one that's going through this treacherous wilderness. I highly reccomend this book to people that just needs a ""push"" in life. Don't give up, who ever you are that's reading this."
"I needed this book NOW! This is just TD Jakes doing what he does best. I needed a breakthrough. I needed a revelation. I needed some answers to the questions that had been plaguing me for the last 4 months. Why Lord why? Why must things be so HARD! I've spent nights wandering around my home and staring out the window at night looking at the stars and being thankful just to see another sunrise. My life has been in such turmoil and anguish...from sickness that never leaves to restarting my business after a contract ended to failed business deals when the government shutdown to almost losing my home because I just couldn't get anything to work out. But thank you God...Jesus was there and I had such revelations about my ministry and my business and my purpose but the strongholds of this world just wouldn't let me go! I was starting to minister again in the prison system and I was working with the kids in foster care in my community and praying for my husband to come home from prison when the laws are on his side but we're face with a judge with a mission that's standing in our way...I needed this book...my husband needed this book...my ministry partners needed this book...so for Easter I bought this book in multiples...I sent a book and a study guide into the prisons...I sent a book and study guide to my husband in hopes that God would reveal the mysteries of his delays in releasing him after serving more than 10 years more than he should have and I bought the book because I needed a word from Jesus...I needed to know that my path was still in his will...I needed hope to be restored to my life so that I could preserve and continue to teach and preach and train those that God had given me to serve.I started this book at midnight on Easter morning and I only stopped to sleep until Church at the Potter's House started online and then right after Church I picked up where I left off and I finished it in 10 hours because I couldn't put it down...I was on my way...I could feel the peace of God in my heart...I had hope again...I needed this word...I needed the revelation...I needed Jesus and he was right on time! So I thank you Bishop TD Jakes for ALWAYS being my guide through my adult life...you have helped me when I was called to serve and you have helped me in making key decisions in my life and my ministry and you are still helping me now when I needed your revelations and your experiences to help guide me through the crushing moments...the pain is so great but I'm standing strong...I bought a bag of apples just the other day and when my food was getting low I chuckled to myself because you had just spoken about a time when you and the Jakes family had apples you picked by the side of the road for a supplementary meal when you were in need of food and then I knew...I knew that I would be able to follow in your footsteps and that my family would survive as well...its just the little things that can turn misery into ministry and I thank you and I pray for you and your family to stay protected and in good health to continue to do the work that God has called you to do...your life matters and what you teach is working in our lives! Continued blessings on you!PS. I have a Facebook family of almost 5K and yesterday I blew up the book on my pages to let people know to get a copy and to read it too! Thank you for your service...you literally save lives.Together in Service to the One True God, Rev Dr Joy Bennett"
"I bought this after watching the discussion about this book between Steven Furtick and TD Jakes (two of my favorite speakers at the time). It was uplifting because it appealed to my self-focused desires (health, wealth, recognition, ""success"", etc.).The idea of the book is that God will use your current undesirable circumstances to ""crush"" you (like grapes into wine) in order to prepare you for ""your season"" of prosperity.I later realized that this doesn't line up with what the one true God (of the Bible... in its proper context) taught us in His word.I was raised in the charismatic Christian movement and I now realise (after actually studying my Bible) that it is a man made doctrine that is built on extra-biblical personal revelation (the same is true of Islam btw!), emotional experiences and Biblical error. If you consider the massive following and the message of preachers like TD Jakes, Joyce Meyer, Joel Osteen, Steven Furtick, Robert Morris, Rick Warren, Kenneth Copeland and the like, it seems like this is what the Bible warns us about in Matthew 7:13-23 (the passage that proves most self-proclaimed Christians will go to Hell). Mr. Jakes and anyone else that tells you about the amazing plan that God has for your life (to make you rich and heal every illness on this side of eternity) are the teachers discussed in 2 Timothy 4:3. Don't be deceived, friends. Please read these scriptures (and the Bible, period) for yourselves. Don't be caught in the wide gate thinking you belong to God just to find out you were seduced away from the truth and wom have to depart from Him.My book recommendations would be the whole book of Matthew, Revelation and Proverbs."
"Bishop Jakes has done it again! I can assure you that this book‚Äîout of all of his books is the most transparent of them all. He reveals his personal Crushing place, and as he pulls back the curtain for us to see that he is exactly as human as all of us. You will understand that if it had not been for the Crushing places that he wouldn‚Äôt be who he is and do what he does for people around the world. With that said, as he eluded in the book people with destiny will go through painful times, but life‚Äôs Crushing situations are actually Coaching situations that will not end us. More so, produce something in us that is pure, refined and precious."
"All of Bishop Jakes books are anointed but there is a special anointing on this book.  I was moved to tears after reading the first few pages.  I‚Äôve only read the first chapter and it has just sat down in my soul.  So far it has helped me to understand the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind the suffering and to see and embrace my process more fully.  It has helped me to take the pressure off of myself and trust God‚Äôs process more completely.  Chapter 1 was very enlightening and I eagerly anticipate the wisdom of Chapter 2.  Thank you Bishop Jakes.  Your ministry is such a blessing to me and the body of Christ at large.  This world is a better place because of you.  Continued blessings be upon you and your family, forever in my prayers."
"Having had the opportunity to see Bishop Jakes at a closer look as a former church member and employee of his, I can tell you that what he details in this book about his own life, his own crushing seasons and how God walked him through, then giving us the wisdom and encouragement to continue to move forward with trust in God, is authentic and inspiring! His words and transparency in ‚ÄúCrushing‚Äù serve as a deep inner ‚Äúfirst aid‚Äù to all ‚Äúgoing through‚Äù a crushing time. The book is amazing!"
"Last year I was flipping through Bishop YouTube channel looking for something to watch. I came across a video of him being interviewed for his new book! If you are a fan as myself! Anything about this wonderful man of GOD. Always catch my attention lol.. I believe the video was about an hour and forty minutes.. Not that it mattered to me anyways! As I listen I felt yet again that the message was directly for me. See I was right in the middle of God molding me into the woman he envision me to be. And my past would no longer hurt me, but bring me joy to talk about. Nonetheless this book is wonderful it‚Äôs a must have for your collection"
"This book is a great read. It‚Äôs helping me to understand that everything is a part of God‚Äôs plan, including the timing (seasons). I now have a better understanding of loss and how it relates to the pruning and crushing process of life that is inevitable."
"First, I checked the book out at the library to see if I‚Äôd like it. I liked it so much that I wanted to add it to my own home library. I searched for the large print because that‚Äôs what my library book was and it was more pleasing to read.The content was so unexpected even though the title Crushing says it all! A beautiful comparison/explanation of the grape, the vine, the grower and the wine. You must read it for yourself!Sometimes I have to read a sentence more than once to understand what is being conveyed, but that doesn‚Äôt change my mind about how I enjoyed this book! Wow, enlightening, a perspective unexpected, and so many bible references to substantiate what sounds so simple, yet so deep.Did I mention that I really liked this book?"
"I purchased this book because of the title. I literally could not put it down. Thankfully, I was wise enough to purchase 2 copies and will buy more. Bishop TD Jakes did not disappoint!!! It‚Äôs one thing to write a book on crushing.....Bishop Jakes went far beyond by openly sharing his own personal experiences of being crushed. He gives hope to all..that God will redeem our brokenness and strengthen us. The crushing is not the end. I am humbled that Bishop TD Jakes humbly shares what many leaders do not! I‚Äôm forever changed!! Pastor Pam Kacys, Chicago"
"I love this teaching! We often hear about pruning but with most teachings, it stops there. This really clarifies the Lord‚Äôs process after the pruning, when you‚Äôre waiting and waiting and you‚Äôre confused because you expect the tides of your circumstances to turn back again but they don‚Äôt. I have often come to the conclusion that there‚Äôs something wrong but the Lord is up to something deeper, and this is what the book is about. I highly recommend!"
"After reading yet another heartfelt version of Bishop Jakes heart expressed reasoning and believes that are geared towards helping us become what God has ordained us to be I now understand my crushing period. I now understand why I had to bleed so much, it was for my good, it was for me to let go off my will and desires and allow my maker to mold me into His purpose for my life. Thank you again Bishop for pushing me further along. Be blessed sir!"
"A Spiritual Masterpiece. My thoughts, the only method that sustains the value of the grape is to squeeze or press the juice out the grape. This process turns the grape into wine. A fine wine becomes more valuable over time. So as the pressures of life comes to crush me, what it is doing is pressing out of me the value of who and what I am to become. With each crushing, I became a better wine filled with favor (flavor), richer (an elixir), and unique (fearfully and wonderfully made). I thought, God, if crushing me yields value to who I am and who you want me to become, then allow life to crush me, resulting in my coming forth like FINE-WINE worth its weight and gold."
"Bishop TDJakes tells us that, ‚ÄúYou cannot have success without sacrifice.‚Äù The enemy is using your crushing moments to distract you, but God‚Äôs blessings will overtake you. Sometimes when we are in the Crushing moments we think that God is not with us. But we are always in God‚Äôs hand. I literally cried when I hear, ‚ÄúGod turns pressure into power.‚Äù God is the winemaker and we shall come forth as pure gold. Thank you Bishop, ‚ÄúCrushing‚Äù is perfect timing. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"This a powerful book and well written, It really touched my heart and has helped me in my walk with God which at times can be difficult and bewildering this help to bring understanding to me and it encouraged me so much so that whatever really spoke to me I wrote down in a special place to make it an easier access when times start to tough. Feeling like we are being crushed doesn't mean we are being punished but we are being pressed into greatness! Thanks TD Jakes!!!"
"We are gifts one to another. It is our responsibility to cultivate our gifts. Bishop T D Jakes does so to the uttermost, encouraging us to do the same.  Knowing everything is working for our good eye; its through the wisdom and knowledge of Gods ""Crushing"" that gives us a new perspective regarding our test and trials on earth. for those that live Godly in Christ Jesus will experience ""Crushing"". Thank you Bishop Jakes!"
"This book is encouraging to the soul as I am being crushed right now in my personal life. We are also being crushed every which way as a nation with this pandemic. Thank you for reminding me that plenty of goods and blessings will come out of my pain. This is my first book by Mr. jakes. He is an excellent writer, story teller, and interpreter of the bible."
Crushing is a book that everyone should keep in their library. There are chapters that need reread when you are being crushed in your journey. They will help bring clarity and understand when you don't know why.
"I‚Äôm so thankful I purchased this book! When you are going through this crushing period a lot of times you can definitely feel alone so to have someone I look up to break down crushing periods in their life, it motivates me to continue to push because the crushing is not the end! I love and appreciate all you do Bishop T.D. Jakes!"
"I felt I was ready for a book like this. Many times we only see the crushing and dont realize that the joy of the wine has out weighed the squeezing from the Master. We can be wiser, stronger  and better in Him, for Him, by Him"
Bishop Jakes is a gifted spiritual teacher. He brings to light many aspects of the Bible that are vague to new and seasoned believers. I enjoyed this book and learned a lot from  It.
Came as expected in perfect condition! Love Pastor Td Jakes and I‚Äôm so excited to read this!
"Everyone has crushing moments in life. This book is a very good resource for those moments. If you haven‚Äôt had a crushing moment yet, keep living...and get this book in preparation for it. If you‚Äôve had a crushing moment, this book may shed some light in areas that may still be unclear and may comfort you in knowing you‚Äôre not the only one to go through this."
This books talks about the suffering we will have to go through; in which no one likes to talk about. We have to go through this to get to the promise! because it's in the process what enriches us and shows us how to handle predictable ways of life! I am ever so grateful that Bishop T. D. Jakes wrote this book for us; thank you!
"This is an awesome book that gives clarity to the situations that you go through in life.  Bishop Jakes gives clear insight and revelation on the trials and tribulations that one faces, and how it all plays into the path and purpose that God is leading you to.  All things are working for the good.  Enjoyed this book tremendously and have recommended my adult sons to read.  As a woman, I think that every young male should read this book as they prepare for life's challenges, families and careers."
Thank you for this amazing book!  I love how he explains the scriptures.  That's where he's best at to me because obeying the scriptures is how we live life in abundance.  There's no way around it.  It's fascinating.  God watches how we handle problems that He creates for us.  This book has motivated me to be what God created me to be by being obedient.  It's deep and it should be required reading for all Christians.  There will be problems and pain in life but God has promised to deliver.
"Just when it seems as though you get tired trying to wrap your mind around situations and circumstances that God allows to impact your life, a fresh, targeted, on-time illumination comes to brighten your pathway. I was blessed by Bishop Jakes' transparency and the ability God has given Him to help believers ""make sense"" out of the fire that they are enduring for the sake of the kingdom.  I am preparing to read it again so that I can truly receive the nuggets that are for me. I am grateful to God for this beautiful illumination to my soul! If you are trying to make sense out of this stage of crushing in your life, please buy/read/apply this book to your circumstances!"
"I bought this book several months ago when my life felt as if it was going well.  I didn‚Äôt start reading it until 2 months ago when life somehow turned on‚ÄîI was being crushed between boulders.  Thank for the this book because I needed a shift in my interpretation of the difficult seasons.  Thank you, Bishop TD Jakes for helping me to fall deeper in love with God.  God bless you."
"This book is powerful and speaks to you where ever you are in your christian  life. After reading this you should feel empowered to wait on God and let him finish working in your life so you will become the best wine ever.Thank you Bishop Makes and may God continue to bless you, your family and your ministry!"
"I bought this book for someone as a gift, I had seen one of his sermons and thought this would be a lovely gift. The person who received it agreed and had very kind things to say."
"True to form just a blessing  to my soul. Each chapter reveals a new insight into the Bishop yet, give such life lessons. Another book for the library that is a must have for me."
"This book provided a fresh perspective about waiting through what are quite often uncomfortable life ""prunings"" of all kinds. As with most of Pastor Jakes' books, this one was written in a conversational style, which makes it a thought-provoking and uncomplicated read as well. I highly recommend!"
"Sometimes, in fact often, life can get you down. The message shared in this book is based on the truth of God's Word, thus making it a solid counsel for the battered, weary or downtrodden."
"My book arrived on time and in perfect condition.I also finished reading the book and it was excellent! Bishop T. D. Jake's includes lots of details about what the crushing is. If you are experiencing crushings in your life or have already experienced crushings in your life, this is a good read for you."
I loved this book and read it right before I started my ministry and right after a crushing episode and pruning season in my own life. I highly recommend this book.
"This book was amazing from start to finish. I have always been a fan of T.D. Jakes and I ended up buying this book for my husband originally. It was so good, I had to read it for myself. It put so many seasons in my life into perspective and helped me to reevaluate my thought process a bit. I highly recommend this book to everyone!"
"This is an AMAZING book, everyone should own a copy of this  book and any book by TD JAKES!!"
Good read. Just getting started on the book. Encouraging-TD Jakes details hardships he has endured while also explaining how to negotiate life when hard things happen to us.
"I have been through some serious crushing and I didn't always understand it or like it, but this book helped me to put and keep it in perspective and understand the why behind it."
We are here to be crushed so the best in us can be revealed through God's redemptive lens. TD Jake's inspires us to submit to the process of allowing God's perfect work to be manifested through the processing of our pain just as grapes are made into wine.
"Great book in helping people understand the reason behind struggles. Chapters are really long, but the information and encouragement you get are priceless."
"I love to hear T.D, Jakes preach. This book is as honest and deep a book as I have ever read. Since I own over 10k books that should tell you something. If you are looking to grow in Christ and understand why certain things happen get this book."
"I couldn't stop reading this book.  It's very encouraging to me to keep on service God.  My problems, worries, my pain is to build me up into what God wants for me.  Thanks T.D. Jakes for writing your story to help build me up."
"A most timely provocative read providing an earthly understanding for spiritual occurrences. T. D. Jakes offers an encouraging powerful message that uplifts, and inspires."
"I love this book! The product arrived intact and will packaged. The circus actually changing my life. TD Jakes is an amazing author, preacher and person. It would behoove you to purchase this and read it."
This is my first book from TD Jakes! He is truly an inspirational author! Everyone needs a copy! I‚Äôm planning to order the workbook! The man is inspired and gifted from God!
"I highly recommend this book if you are a person of faith.  It will bless your life.  I love to listen to Reverend TD Jakes.  I purchased this book so I'd have something good to read on a long flight to Barcelona, Spain.  Buy the book.  It will bless your life!  Makes a great gift too!"
Read the devotional on youversuon and loved it. Bought the book... Not so much
Love TD Jakes teachings. Great book. Enlightened. Excellently written.
Anything he writes is an interesting read
I love the book on CDS Crushing thank you sharing your heart with us my mother was 13 when she conceive my Brother. And 16 when i was conceived and she was a very good mother
"I marveled at the transparency conveyed in this masterpiece. I heard the voice of the Lord speaking through this sacrificing message. I have been empowered and blessed to understand what the Master is doing and has done in my life to make new wine. This revelation has crushed the grapes of my understanding and treaded out the pulp of confusion, bitterness and regret. Thank you Bishop for allowing God to use your new wine. The tasting was wonderful."
We all go through a crushing period in order to become like fine wine.
"This is such a great and empowering read for life moments and circumstance that are overbearing to understand, especially during a great moment of testing one's faith. Highly recommend this read to shift one's perspective in how they see their situations."
"Another pastor using their faith to gain money and fame. He speaks about God a lot,  talks about really nothing out of the Bible. Again, charlatan. He should‚Äôve been a life coach instead of a pastor, when do you really hear him or Joel osteen talk about scriptures."
Great read and I thank Bishop Jakes for reminding me that God is not through with me yet.  He's always at work in my life because I am his....
God has gifted T.D.Jakes to bring His principles of deep to the surface.  This is a life changing book of revelation and should be read by the young and old of faith.
This is a page turner.. and I'm not even done yet. Gives depth into going through the things you go through.. to being the best out of you.
Bishop Jakes is such an anointed man of God and provides sound teaching and explanation of how God molds and transforms us for the better and His glory.
"This book is intimate, thoughtful and life changing.  It provides guidance, direction and new insight into why we experience the seasons in our lives and a different perspective on how we should view and process them.  Our Crushing experiences are not the end, but the beginning of us becoming who God wants and intended us to be.  Wow, what an awesome word!!!"
Fast shipping. Item as described. Good book.
"This is a book you will read over and over.  Jakes really gives of his self in this book.  I was comforted, and reassured by the words in this book."
Well written & Spiritual
"This book, as all of the ones I have read by T. D. Jakes, is well written, easy to read, & full of wisdom.  I am very pleased with this excellent book.  Thank you."
TD Jakes has done it again.
"Divinely inspired, this book is just what I needed to read right now.  It provided me with a fresh perspective on how to navigate through difficult times. Well worth the read."
"WOW!!!!!! This is an amazing book, God Bless Bishop TD Jakes for his ability to inspire others and motivate millions thru inspiration of the Holy Spirit thru his testimony. After all Bishop has been thru he is still standing and now can tell about it to lift those who are crushed and can be powerful. Amen"
There‚Äôs an awesome message that you have to get! Read this text and grow dynamically BOTH spiritually and secularly! Today applications!!
"I purchased this book during the time of my grandmother passing away.  It was such a wonderful time to read it considering the crushing period I was in.I would highly recommend this read.  What a wonderful book and Jakes as always is transparent, wise and gives great insight.Buy the book, you won‚Äôt regret it!!"
"I have only read through page 32 and cannot wait to finish it then do the study guide. Bishop Jakes talks about ‚Äúthe windows‚Äù of pain; I have been there more than once, but this time is ABSOLUTELY the worst. As I read with tears rolling down my face, I hear the truth of God through the words written in this book. I truly believe this book is a blessing from God at the PERFECT time. Thank you, Bishop for being so transparent."
"This is an awesome book. If you're thinking about purchasing, or you're already reading it, make sure to get the study guide that goes with it."
I always liked to listen and read TD Jakes books. This book has been encouraging and filled with hope in God‚Äôs ability to use you and transform your life. God bless you Bishop!
"If you have been ""crushed"" then this book is for you !! Get the audio version and let it pour into you!!!!!"
We used it for our Women Sunday School class!!! The workbook was a good supplement to use for study and clarification.
Anyone who who is ministered to by T.D. Jakes should have this book.  His best writing to date.
I listened to this in my car to and from work for a month. It was wonderful to read a book via auditable. Product arrived on time and clean. Happy with purchase.
I appreciate the stories of TD Jakes life and the reality of what it takes to live in God's will.
Was a great read after I got pass all these big words and I‚Äôm like yes TD JAKES I love you and all but him And TI gotta use the most biggest words they can think of to tell a simple story I‚Äôm like PASTOR please just get it out LOl BUT ALL IN ALL GREAT READ!!
Inspiring
"I love the price and quality of the product, and Bishop TD Jakes  book sells by itself"
It was OK but a little difficult to understand. Like to watch him on TV but his books are not so good.
This book definitely came right on time for me. I am currently going through a ‚Äúcrushing‚Äù stage. But to be able to read and pinpoint exactly what is happening right now in my life has reassured me (like before and always) that God has a bigger plan waiting for me. Turning my trials into triumphs. My crushing is not the end!
"The book is great. Bought the study guide as well. I will say it will be a tough read for those not deeply rooted in Christian faith or religion in general, but it is worth a try."
"I think everyone, religious or not, can be inspired and understand this book. Jakes uses great language throughout the book, so I'd have a dictionary handy."
"I recommend everyone read this, whether you're in a storm or not, this information can apply to everyone at one point or another."
I was waiting enthusiastically for this book since the church announced it will be released because I knew it will guide me and show me the way. I Can‚Äôt say how deeply is impacting my spiritual journey. Thing are moving forward with joy and peace.
"i have read almost all Bishops books, i recommend them all. ive seen crushing in many lives and experienced my own. some ive seen fall victim to it, i dont venture a guess as to way but this book has givin me new hope that it doesnt always end that way. thank you God!!  if you are going thru anything this book can help you understand the process of the crushing to get to the promise."
"This book was everything.  I could relate to every chapter, every line and every quote. I thank you T.D. Jakes, because even reading the last chapter I felt like giving up on life, but I am trying to hang on ad best as I can."
I highly recommend this book to anyone feeling CRUSHED by llife's circumstances!  It explains so well the work the Father is doing in you during this season & gives it a PURPOSE!  It was literally LIFE to me during my season of crushing & I'm forever GRATEFUL for TD's deep insight & obedience to write it!
"This book was interesting and true. I appreciated all of his stories. I felt it was a bit long when he kept returning to the same concepts of wine, crushing, grapes, the Vintner, and fermentation almost every chapter."
Open my eyes about a lot stuff  in my life
"This book is for any person who is struggling to see the beauty of light at the end of the tunnel from the fears of darkness they have endured in their life. To witness God use the Bishop through the reading of this masterpiece to express to His children the love He has for us. . . I just need to slap somebody right. I'm so grateful for the confirming word of God. He hasn't left us, Hes making in us the most delicious wine. ""Keep the party going"""
"I BOUGHT THIS BOOK FOR MY SON , he read the whole book in 2weeks time he loved it. I listen to TD JAKES LUV HIS MINIstry"
In life we will be crushed in so many ways and this book gives us good perspectives that crushing is not our end but there is a light at the end of the tunnel
Doing a bible study on this book. Going very well. If you have problems this book will help.
"Amazing book!!! Perfect if you are going through a season that feels tough, unpredictable or crushing."
"If your are going through or have gone through a very hard/crushing time in your life, this is the book to read."
I highly recommend this book. It was exactly what I needed for where I am in my journey right now with God!
I would definitely recommend this book.  It made me think of things I went through in order to be where I am today. I know I have much growing to do and I'm glad this book helped.
Excellent read. Nonstop. Educational and inspiration
Fantastic book. Highly recommend it. Bought five for gifts plus the audiobook for me
This book is amazing...not much more to say.
"Life is challenging, but with the information contained in this book, all situations can be overcome in victory. A must read"
God has once more used Bishop Jakes to speak to the hearts of the hurting‚Äîand give hope. An on time word!
Every book I‚Äôve read by the Bishop has been life changing for every season. Crushing is no exception! Definitely a must read.
Must read!  Especially if you are going through difficulties.
Still reading it.  It is a good book though.
Great book. Take your time reading it because it is very strong
"This book was refreshing, and gave me a new respect on why I should remain in the pruning state... crushing is not the end!"
Very clear in thought and description. You can‚Äôt misunderstand what is being said. It‚Äôs a process from chapter 1 to the very end. By the time you done it all makes absolute sense!!!Thank you T.D. Jakes for being so truthful and real!!! Just what I needed
"Excellent, powerful and uplifting."
This book is so right on. It is very relatable.
I usually buy audio books but really wanted this one to have in hardcover for me and I bought one as a gift for someone else and they both came scuffed super disappointing.
"This is a book you have to study and not read, this is a masterful work; Apostle Jake's, and I don't use title lightly, T.D. Jake's has definitely spent time with Christ for he writes with the pin of a ready writer, what a gift to the body..."
A relaxing and insightful book
My wife said it's a great read
Love it and got it fir a good price
Love reading this book! It put life in a different light.
"This book is a good reminder that trials help to refine us.  However, the writer is repetitive and it is not very deep."
"The process of crushing, life testimony, experiences shared make this book unique. Sometimes it's like pastor Jakes are sitting down our side. The worst thing is not known who you are, but know who you are and don't know where you are in God process?.. this book helps to clarify this question.."
Not that interesting
Life altering!!!! He teaches in a way that helps you to be totally conceince of what you are going through and actually feel empowered by it versus victimized.
POWERFUL Reading
As usual...another great book by Bishop Jakes! This book has been a help not only to me but my husband as well. Insightful. ‚ù§
I love listening to this writer and pastor he's messages speaks to me all the time there is never a boring message with TJ  Jakes this book is good for people that don't understand why pain and suffering.
"Faith building, edifying, and encouraging."
I highly recommend this book.

"T.D Jake has a powerful message in his book ‚ÄúCrushing,‚Äù read this with my small group and got a lot of valuable insights from it."
Never think for a minute that God has given up on you. Instead we must endure the crushing to see the transforming that is happening in and on our lives. Amazing book!
PERFECT
Love it
Great
"Great insight , authentic"
We read this book in Sunday school and it was such an eye opener for our process in our faith walk. Just understanding each step that we go through is just like the grapes on the vines but the outcome is a delicious wine or a faithful servant
Awesome product
Sent to an incarcerated relatives. He thanked me so much for sending. He quoted it as being God sent. I recommend it for anyone in need of a word.
Maybe it's just me. Much of the book was written with $50 words. I found myself having to look up words to break down the meaning of the sentence.  The meat of the book is excellent and so very timely in my life. I'm grateful for his knowledge and his transparency.
"Very insightful and informative, great words of wisdom"
This is an Awesome book!  Brought so much hope and peace.
Good Book
Best read. I like the comparison he makes with the wine making process... Mr Jake's is a true story teller . Reading any of his material really gives me the visual.
I enjoyed this book immensely. There was so much revelation and it spoke to where I am in my life right now. Having gone through some things that were crushing in recent years; it ministered to me.
"The book was an okay read.  Unfortunately, I was never able to get totally enthralled."
Great book. Mind challenging.
great book
TD Jakes takes the life instances we go through and gives you a perspective of hope and faith to ensure that what we are currently going through is not the end but the process in which our Lord Jesus Christ intended us to experience! Praise Jesus!!
I thank God for this book! It helped me to know that I am not alone! Great Godly wisdom. I love it! I praise God for it!
Heartfelt book filled with personal testimony and words of insight and encouragement based on scripture. A book for everyone to read and be encouraged by.
This book is an incredible journey of understanding the value that the difficulties of life bring. The crushing is not the end!
It‚Äôs in perfect condition.
Bishop Jakes catches your eyes and your mind from the start of reading this book to the end. The realism and all the components there are so riveting are exposed in this book. It is definitely a must read.
AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME

TD Jakes has done it again! Another masterpiece of course. This book changed the way I look at adversity and even gave me the courage to face the ones from my past and extract the jewels I left behind
Great and inspiring read
A fantastic book!  Jakes writing is so good.  Makes you aware of why certain things happen to you.  I recommend this book to anyone from age 13-100.  It will be a yearly read for me.  God is good!
This book spoke to my current situation. It is a good resource when you are going through something that is crushing.
One of the BEST books I‚Äôve ever read.
Great book!! Really enjoyed!!
This is the real deal
I teach a Sunday School class. This is a wealth of information.
This book opened my eyes. My struggles and tribulations serve a purpose in the plan for my life. Thank you God for putting this book in my path!
This book was written for me for such a time as this. I highly recommend it to all that dare not give up.
I would highly recommend this book to individuals who are seeking to understand their purpose in life. Absolutely terrifically done.
This is the 2nd time I‚Äôve read this book. It revealed even more concepts of Gods love for us than the 1st read through. It‚Äôs an amazing affirmation of how we could view our lives from the perspective of our Creator.
Takes you to a better place of understanding what is happening when God is doing a deeper work in your life.
"Many struggle with why a good God allows his children to befall such hardships, and Bishop does such a masterful job of guiding us into the behind the scenes of God's plans for our life. A must read for those that are seeking an explanation to what only seems like God's absence from certain situations in life."
I FEEL AS IF THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN AND RELEASE FOR THIS SEASON OF MY LIFE. THANKS BISHOP IT IS A GREAT READ AND AN EYE OPENER TO LIFE CRUSHING MOMENTS
a must read
Freshingly honest from a mega celebrity.
I'm so happy I received my copy. T. D. Jakes is the truth!! A great read
I loved this book and the biblical references used. I found this book to be even more inspiring than I expected it would be.
"Pastor TD Jake's delivers a wonderful message of encouragement through life's challenges and crushing moments. There is hope at the end of the process that crushing is not the end, it's the beginning of something better."
I‚Äôm dep I needed this
This is one of the best books that I‚Äôve read in a long time.  Open and true with some great perspectives.
Bishop‚Äôs book takes you deeper into the understanding of the dilemmas you may be facing. He reveals what God revealed to him during his crushing season. This insight will catapult so many into their destiny!
"Great book, anything TD Jakes writes is a gift to us all!!!! Get you a copy today!"
Perfect timing
This book is scripturely sound and help you to dig deep to deal with those triggers that you fight to gain control of in your life but it is done in Christ
I actually purchased the wrong version. I thought I purchased the physical book not the books for Android. Absolutely phenomenal book!
Flesh and blood didn't reveal these insights to Bishop Jake's. This book is absolutely relevant to anyone trying to make sense of challenges being faced...
T.D. Jake's I love your message in this book. It is so humbling and inspiring and gave me peace.
A must have
I did not like this book.  I love his preaching but this book was not dynamic not engaging in the least.
Good book.
I felt something come alive in me when read this book. So good and spirit filled! Definitely blessed me and my friends that I share with. Thank you so much! This book spoke to the tee about what was going on in my life. The LORD had his hand in this pick of my next book read. Awesome!
Great Book
What a book! Be blessed
Powerful Book
Like
This book really helped me during this time of difficulty.  It's a tender reminder that God wants our best self to be produced by what we go through.
The book seems to be composed of mini sermons in each chapter. I was waiting for it all to tie together at the end or how he overcome each trail. Love his ministry but it was ok.
Love the book and study guide

Excellent spiritual reading. Really makes you dig deep i side yourself and understand the crushing
Excellent book
"In Crushing: God Turns Pressure into Power¬† Bishop T.D. Jakes tells us his story about how the pain and suffering he has experienced in his life turned out to be a good thing.  He begins his book sharing with us the tragedy of the death of his mother, who was afflicted with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.  His mother profoundly influenced Bishop Jakes life and to watch her slowly lose her mind and then her life left him with these questions many of us have asked.  ‚ÄúDo we have to suffer so much in this life in order to mature in faith?  Why would a good Father allow his children to suffer so much pain, injustice, and heartache?‚ÄùBishop Jakes follows up his story about his mother with his thirteen year old daughter‚Äôs announcement to him and his wife as they were sitting out on their porch that she was pregnant.  For Bishop Jakes, a well-known and respected minister and author, this announcement shook him deeply.  How could he have failed his daughter so badly and what would people think about this man who preached righteousness, but who could not even influence for good his own daughter?Many readers of Bishop Jakes story will be able to easily relate to his suffering, but perhaps will have more difficulty agreeing with his conclusion that ‚ÄúWe may not want to admit it, but what if our crushing is necessary for our potential to be fulfilled?‚Äù  And then he asks us: ‚ÄúCan you see the necessity of being crushed as part of your maturation process to fulfill God‚Äôs plan?‚Äù  If readers of this review answer yes to this question, they are going to find much to like in Bishop Jakes book.Bishop Jakes uses Bible stories like the Vinedresser turning his grapes into wine to suggest that like grapes we must first be crushed to become good wine or good people.  He says that ‚ÄúNo matter who we are, where we are in life, or where we come from, we must begin to appreciate the ugly stages of our inception.‚Äù  In contrast to Bishop Jakes, I consider our inception to be beautiful and wonderful.  Then he says, ‚ÄúWhen we allow the Lord to shift our mindset, we begin to see that everything that has happened to us has happened for a reason.‚Äù  I don‚Äôt agree.  I think that much that happens to people is accidental; we can be either in the right or wrong place at any time.  He concludes with his vinedresser analogy.  He says, ‚ÄúIf we look back at the sprout (us) that pushed itself through the ceiling of dirt above it, we discover reasons behind our adversity that were previously invisible and unimaginable but now are suddenly apparent and miraculous when we arrive at the fruit-bearing stage.‚ÄùAgain, some readers of this review may find that Bishop Jakes creative attempt to understand pain and suffering and our need to be crushed if we are to grow and develop as people makes sense.  For me it is not sense, but nonsense.  Jesus came, not that we might be crushed, but that ‚Äúwe might have life and have it to the full.""  If readers of this review want to read what some thoughtful writers have to say about suffering, I suggest C.S. Lewis or G.K. Chesterton, not Bishop Jakes."
More self serving religious tripe.
"A little more than a year ago, I received a phone call from a client of mine and during that conversation, I was told about a seminar that she had attended in Dallas hosted by Bishop Jakes.The seminar revolved around ""getting into business/ persevering through the initial phases of becoming an entrepreneur.""  I was intrigued to say the least.  I was also told that a book was shortly forthcoming and as asked would I like a copy.  I agree but only if I could pay for it myself (in case I didn't like and could throw it away at my own expense.)I received the book and much to my surprise, I loved the book.  The book SOAR was everything that she described the event to be in book form.  What I especially liked about the book was that it wasn't a heavy-handed religious book.  In fact, there were only scant traces of religious references given.  It was a practical and relatable book that anyone who wants to get into business for themselves would do well to read.CRUSHING, on the other hand, is about looking at disappointments and hardships in different ways.Mr. Jakes starts out, very early, talking about two painful moments in his life: the death of his mother and the discovery that one of his daughters became pregnant at a very early age.Understandably, these are the kind of moments that all of us will have to deal with at some point in our lives.From there to the end of the book, almost 225 pages later, is chapter upon chapter of how suffering is a necessary and unavoidable aspect of life.  Simple enough.  I don't think anyone would argue with that.  But, it goes on far too long, opining about the opportunities that may (or may not) be present in the time of suffering.Pulling from the stories of Moses and Joseph and from the parables in the New Testament, Mr. Jakes makes loose connections with the actions of these individuals to state that God had some intention of capitalizing, from the intentions (?) mistakes (?) of them to further His divine interest.I'm not here to debate the validity of his reasonings but simply to point out that I would have liked more detailed examples of situations that he faced and how... how he overcame them.  What steps, what plans, what actions did he (and his family) take in order to move forward.Seven years ago, moments after arriving home from work, late one Friday night, I received a call telling me that my father was very, very sick and that he had only days to live.  It was not the best time for that to happen.  The company I was working for had lost most of its clients and I was doing odd jobs just to see a paycheck at the end of the week.  Making just enough to pay my rent and to buy canned foods for the week.  Now, I had to find money to buy a plane ticket and deal with whatever surprises I was going to find when I got there.Nothing can prepare you to see your beloved father, half of his normal body weight, suffering from cancer in three places.  No amount of religion will give you solace knowing that one of your parents will no longer be with you.  I understood as I sat in the chair next to him that we were going to lose him in a few days.  Even with his faith present, you don't want someone you love to die.  You don't want them to leave.  But, you know they can't live in the state that they may presently be in.I didn't have to promise him that I would stop smoking, because I never smoked.  And, the same went for heavy drinking.  What I did promise him was that I would live out the best messages that he taught me and my siblings and that he would get those credits throughout the rest of my life.***  ***  ***It's one thing to take solace in the belief that suffering may be providentially ordained or some unknowable, indistinguishable moment that you just have to trust will only be temporary.  It's a whole other thing to stop, reflect, look for reasons and/ or take actions so that others can avoid what might be an unnecessary hardship.To find meaning and finding a solution for someone else is the real answer.  THIS is where you flip the script on the pain of suffering.  Doing this has reduced the horrendous pain I initially felt.  And, while I can't say I don't miss him, bringing value to the life of others by his experiences gives me some sense of significance for the pain."
"Revelations 12:11 says, ‚ÄòWe are OverComers by the Blood of the LAMB and the Word of our Testimony.‚Äô  The Crushing is one of the most uniquely prolific, spiritually lifting and empowering jewels penned in this generation.  Bishop T.D. Jakes takes the reader on one of the most memorable and visualistic journeys to date as he exposes life altering hurts that he‚Äôs endured on his renowned  journey.  When life is celebrated and many are spectators to the revelry that shines brightly, yet no one can discern the astronomical cost paid for numerous triumphs, accolades, and national successes.  Bishop Jakes depicts the devastation of life experiences as he‚Äôs transparent with the despair he felt with the loss of his mother and the pregnancy of his youngest daughter.  His transparency is certifiable evidence that you can not judge a book by the cover until you open it up to see what‚Äôs inside.  Weekly he shares his anointing with the world via the world wide web, and so many lives are changed with the authenticity of his gift as he delivers the Word of GOD on a monumental platform.  The depth of teaching he pours into this masterwork is spellbinding.  The astute manner that he paints the most vivid picture of life and its devastation, GOD‚Äôs purpose and the processing of grapes to wine is unparalleled.Crushing:  GOD Turns Pressure Into Power is one of the most excellent reads that I‚Äôve ever encountered.  When I initially started the book, I was a bit agitated with the usage of uncommon words, laymen terms, you have to get a dictionary to get a complete understanding.  Then I noticed that there was quite a bit of repetition, and that perturbed me as well.  Mind you the flow was smooth, even as there were some moments that would grapple some of the forgotten moments in your life as it evoked painful memories. Bishop Jakes pulls and tugs on your spiritual memories, and you find yourself peering into a mirrored image‚Ä¶I found a depth of understanding that only a professional connoisseur could develop. Impatience dissolves as you get to the grand finale and he blows your wig back with the unveiling of this journey called life.  The Process‚Ä¶the Purpose‚Ä¶and the ELOHIM Principle.  Upon completion, it all had purpose, every emotion, every thought, every description, every tear, (in Tommie Smith‚Äôs words, every tear meant something)‚Ä¶Process‚Ä¶Purpose‚Ä¶ELOHIM Principle!!  Bishop T.D. Jakes, May the Spirit of the Living & True GOD Continue to Wash You Anew With Fresh Anointing As You Continue to Bless HIS People!!!  In JESUS‚Äô Mighty Name!#ThatzTazzyezTake"
I am happy I picked up this book as my 1st read of 2021. I love a good book with great story telling. One of the things on my vision board is building my relationship with God and making it stronger than ever. One thing I always wanted to do is learn more stories of the bible and how they play a role in today's world. This book gives plenty of bible stories that maybe you can relate to. I have had 3rd row seats to see Bishop Jakes speak and if you have watched or listened to his sermons you already know he is a great storyteller and can say it in a way that we can understand it and a way to use it in our everyday life. -If you feel lost in life -If you are hurting -If you are looking for some great bible storytelling -If you are working on making your relationship with God stronger
"Bishop Jakes presents us with a book about transformation and self-discovery. The author hits us with some very pointed and difficult questions which require truthful answers. He tells some personally crushing stories from his own life; the painful experience of learning his young teenage daughter was pregnant, the agony of watching his mother succumb to Alzheimer‚Äôs, and the shock and helplessness he felt when his son had a heart attack. When experiencing these types of crushing blows we must face the sad and helpless sense of our new reality. It is only when we recognize that there is a transformation taking place, understanding that it is a process used by God, will we be able to trust Him to take us through it.This book is well written and T.D. uses the analogy of the Master Vintner and the process required to turn grapes into choice wine in a uniquely descriptive way. We are taken through a journey which has the potential to help us understand and cope with the trials and tribulations that accompany the crushing situations that we face during our lifetimes. Rushing through the experience and forcing the process is not an option that will produce quality.The underlying theme in this book as I understand it is that God causes the negative circumstances in our lives in order that He can use them as turning points of triumph for our good and His glory. While I absolutely believe that God will use our worst moments and take us through the fire, I do not agree that He causes the problems in our lives. The choices that we make and the lifestyles that we live cause us more problems than we would ever take ownership for. God has set up both physical and spiritual laws which have penalties of noncompliance built into them. The adversary of course also plays into the mix of negative circumstances that come our way. Our loving Father would never intentionally cause us pain so that He could use it to make us better!‚ÄúCrushing‚Äù has very useful information in it but I found it to be a bit boring. In fairness to the author, however, he is dealing with a very difficult subject."
"In Crushing, T.D. Jakes explored what believers need to do when they experience heartache and pain and they feel like they are being crushed and unable to get back up. He starts the book out by revealing the big news of when his world fell apart. His teenaged daughter became pregnant at the age of thirteen. A few months prior he watched his own mother die from Alzheimer‚Äôs. Jakes was very real in sharing all of his questions and statement he said to himself during this time. He wondered how he failed as a father and what he could have done differently. He shared with readers on how experiencing a crushing we are forced to choose to reply on God as our guidance. Years later, Jakes shared how now his daughter is married and how his grandson has turned into a great man. The crushing feeling his daughter had to feel when her life changed now, she able to see how God turned into something good. Throughout the book, Jakes describes the process of fermentation from grapes into wine. He also went into detail about how he was thrown another curveball a few years later when his son had a heart attack and Jakes was preaching in another country. This led Jakes into looking at why we suffer and the sadness and fear Mary must have felt when Jesus died on the cross for our sins.I would recommend this excellent book on crushing and how God can change and turn anything around for good. We all experience pressure and pain in our lives no can escape it. When we go through bad things, we can decide to rise above it or be crushed from the pain. I liked how Jakes compared to crushed to how grapes are crushed and how they are left to ferment and then they are made into great wine. Many of us like to rush the process of moving forward through whatever painful event we are facing. But often times the bad times immensely help us to grow into the person God wants us to become. I also liked how Jakes explored the story of how Jesus turned water into wine and how Jesus can turn our lives around. The book contained many Biblical stories to illustrate how others in the Bible handled pressure. If you‚Äôre looking for inspiration book, then read this book!""I received this book free from the publisher, Faithwords for my honest review.‚Äù"
"The Minister T.D. Jakes has crushed (couldn't help the pun) it with this book on sin, injustice, heartache and pain with a Godly take.This book deals with pain.  As I read this last night in one sitting, I was reminded that bad things happen to good people.  These issues seem inexplicable with the fact of God's love and Jesus's salvation but they happen all the same.  Jakes does not stay away from problems in his own life that caused him to question God's purpose: his thirteen year old daughter's pregnancy, his initial failure at being a businessman, and his son who suffered an unexpected heart attack while in his late 20s.  He also quotes and discusses people who have suffered inexplicable pain and suffering in their life: Nelson Mandela, Helen Keller, and Martin Luther.  HIs writing style is very approachable.  Although I have never  heard of this Minister before I was humbled by his approach to the word.  I really liked his overall description of the word crushing, the name of this book. At first he uses the traditional explanation for what crushing is, which is a devastating blow to the psyche and body.  Then, he describes crushing in comparison to Christ preparing us for his kingdom and gives the example of Jesus's first miracle.  What was Jesus's first miracle?  Was it raising the dead, or healing the sick?  It was making wine out of water at the wedding in Canaan he was invited to.  He then compares us to a fine wine, that takes years to develop and be served all while waiting to determine what our service will be to the Lord.  I loved this analogy.I plan to read more of T.D. Jakes works.  The Biblical references were on target as well as the examples of people he has dealt with who have struggled.  I highly recommend this.  It is a quick, useful and very educational read."
Thumbs up! I haven‚Äôt read a book in awhile that gets my upmost attention from the very beginning. I started and I could not stop! I am still currently ready the book. I usually go through books in a day or two depending on the amount of pages. This book is way too good to just fly by. I know for sure I‚Äôll have to re read this book to absorb of of its life lessons and get the most out of it. It‚Äôs refreshing to see how T.D Jakes opens up about personal situations in his life that shook the family but Gods mercy and love prevailed. I‚Äôm currently going through my own personal trials and this book could not have come at a better time. If your going through it this book will renew your faith and view on difficult times. It‚Äôs a word that will shake you and wake you up!! God will always turn the bad for the good. This is a must read for sure. Thank you pastor T.D Jakes for letting God use you as a vessel to bless our lives and thank you for opening up when you don‚Äôt need to. Totally recommend it!
"I found this book to be inspirational, motivational and empowering.  There's something motivating in it for most anyone even if you don't particularly think of yourself as someone religious.  While he does quote some scripture throughout it, it's empowering words related to whatever point he's trying to make.  If you're someone that's had a hard life, or gone through so much struggle, and you're a strong go-getter type that feels like you're working hard and seeing no little return wishing you had some kind of breakthrough, this book will especially hit home for you.  I think it's a great book for the ambitious that have goals, but never seem to find success even though what they're doing is good.  This book will help inspire you to keep going."
"His sermons tend to be much better than his books. This is a book about going through hard times. if you are familiar with TD Jakes life and ministry, there won't be anything new here. He talks very briefly about a few of his own experiences, but gives very few details. 98% of the book is about the difficult exeperiences of various Bible characters, and how they eventually overcome them. I was just hoping to hear more specifics about Mr Jakes struggles. I already knew he grew up very poor, that his father died when he was quite young, and that he struggled intensely early in his ministry.Hearing a TD jakes sermon, on the other hand, is almost always a 5 star experience."
"I discovered T.D. Jakes in a grocery store, of all places, on the rack of religious books found at the end of aisles or other non-intrusive places. It was an earlier book and I was thrilled to have one offered through this program. It's another good one!Jakes is a very good writer, using lively language and passionate examples from his own life to bring home the oft-repeated message that God is working a plan even when we can't see it. The metaphor of crushing, as in crushing grapes to make wine, coupled with the frequent use of other such wine-making vernacular ties the narrative together from beginning to end.When life is hard and you feel you've been dealt blows that don't make sense, or when you feel that God has let you down, please read this book from T.D. Jakes and get the truth. He has a plan and the good reverend will make sure you understand that truth."
"I'll be the first to admit. I'm not that religious BUT.. I was raised in the Church by my mother who religiously attends and quotes Bible scriptures like they're going out of style.This is the FIRST book by TD Jakes I've read. Once you open this book it will engulf you with an overwhelming sense of honesty and truthfulness.  TD Jakes speaking of his inner most feeling about the death of his mother, the doubt of his congregation to his daughter becoming pregnant at the age of 13 hits home.  This is something most people don't like to discuss.  From  these experiences TD Jakes exposes the reader to a certain part of his life you can tell most don't get access to.Throughout this book he gives examples of situations that would serious ""crush"" people mentally, emotionally and spiritually but he also provides scripture and reasons to overcome. Reasons to continue to thrive and accepts God's blessings.  These ""tests"" are often provided by God for you to accept your calling and shed the weight that has been holding you back.  These tests happen to everyone.This book is phenomenal for those who are going through hard times and find it difficult to see their way out of it.  This book will help you acknowledge the challenges in your life and accept them for what they are.  Peaks are there for you to get out the valleys."
Crushing talks about life challenges we go through and adding pressure to our power. TD jakes talks about your transformation. Could the worst moments of your life actually become turning points of triumph for god? The master vintner as he uses your life‚Äôs deepest heartaches and most devastating disappointments for your good and his glory?
"Love reading books that promote my God and Savior Jesus Christ.  PAGE 76 put this book in the trash.  I am sooooo sick and tired of hearing how bad the African American people have it in this country when men like Mr. Jakes debunks all of those theories along with all the many black movies stars and athletes that make MILLIONS.  Give me a break... and may God have mercy on people who use this platform for financial gain.  Jesus would have been turning over the tables at one of Mr. Jakes book signings  If you're a lover of Jesus and a patriot, I'd take a pass on this book.  Never again Mr. Jakes!"
"This book deals with the heartache of being crushed by life and yet not only surviving but becoming stronger and finding peace.  Bishop Jakes tells very personal stores from his own life where he was slammed by seemingly insurmountable experiences.  His 13 year old daughter‚Äôs pregnancy, his son‚Äôs heart attack and his dearly beloved mother‚Äôs slipping into the lonely and distant realm of Alzheimer‚Äôs.He encourages the reader to trust in the glory and wisdom of God‚Äôs loving embrace and promises that ‚ÄúEven in the moments of your greatest anguish, you often find unexpected blessings alongside and comingled with your losses‚Äù. In the end Pastor Jakes compares the crushings in your life to that of the Vintner with the words ‚ÄúThe Master Vintner becomes a part of the vineyard‚Äù.  This is a very encouraging book especially for those who are facing extreme adversity."
"If you follow the Jakes ministry, you are already aware of the transparency that they have had with their own personal struggles. Namely that of his daughters pregnancy out of wedlock and his mothers death.It's upon these personal struggles that the book seems to set the stage.I have always admired TD Jakes large vocabulary and poetic style. For me, there were times that I felt it was little too much and came across as synthetic for the purpose of being detailed and descriptive.However, that is how Jakes draws his listeners into the story and the reason many love to hear him.This is a very inspirational and motivational book and helpful for those who have experienced the crushing of life."
"I love T.D. Jakes'  ability to write as though he is reading the mail of a broken hearted saint. In this book he masters it once more. His powerful demonstration of making every point a direct yet compassionate piercing of the reader's heart is amazing. Appreciated his transparency in sharing his own struggles and ""crushings"".  It was very hard to put down because of the emotional stirrings and healing that took place in between readings. This book is a must for every believer."
"When I was growing up, I was taught about the value of pressure. We all face pressure in our lives. And like Job, sometimes we question why were made to deal with pressure. But at one point, every diamond was simply coal. Without pressure, they would never become what they are today. The same can said about people.The idea behind this book certainly isn't new. But Bishop Jakes personal insight into these ideas are very profound and ultimately inspirational. It's a very good read, we'll be ordering this book for all of our friends."
"If ever there was a time when Christians are asking"" why?"" it is likely now as churches have been forced to close amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This is added to the personal struggles so many are facing during this time of crisis. While TD Jakes wrote this book before the recent events, it is more timely now than ever. This book is directed toward believers who are facing personal crisis and uses scripture to encourage and empower believers through their suffering. TD Jakes is one powerful pastor and author and this book is one of his best."
Love the message... hate the narrator. Wish TD Jake's himself could have narrated
"I think the question of where is God in our suffering is a good question to ask, and I'm always interested to read about other people's interpretations. I can't say that I agree with everything TD Jakes says in general (I'm not a huge fan of health and wealth prosperity gospel teaching), but there can still be some good lessons to learn along the way."
What a fantastic book! It has such a great message for those who are struggling or grieving and trying to make sense of the difficulties of life and how God has a plan. It‚Äôs exactly the book I needed and I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to know why the turmoil is happening and how to get through tough times. Simply inspiring and a true self help book that is needed by everyone at one point or another. God really can use everyone and you must go through the pruning to yield the best fruit.
"On June 9,2019 I was blessed with this book from Bishop T.D. Jakes, I had always wanted this book since I seen his interview on YouTube and was blessed for getting it free through audiobooks app. T.D. Jakes story about The Crushing gave me inspiration about my own experience of Gods Crushing, the story brought tears and joy to my life, I never understood about how I endured some painful things that I‚Äôve endured and always wondered why God allowed me to be so crushed, but now that I read this testament of Bishops Crushing I can be more at peace with the way God Loves me and he truly has my life and lives I love in his hands no matter what I go through, He is able to give me rest in him. Thank You Bishop T.D. Jakes for helping me to understand and to stand firm in God Always."
"Life is not always fun, nor does it always seem fair. Notably rotten people sometimes seem to have every opportunity handed to them, while the more honorable among us often are working through difficulties that would squash the spirit of a weaker person. If you've often wondered why God lets bad things happen to good people, this is the book for you, written by an always interesting author. I'd rank it as a must-read, and I would happily send it to friends and family."
I truly enjoy the teachings of T. D. Jakes because he is unafraid of humility and using that as an example. He tells his own story of family strife and applies that to ways we can overcome the rough spots in our life and use that pressure to become diamonds and shine. Never give up on God's hope or love for you and embrace the lessons in your life. This book is a steady beacon and blessing for all.
I appreciate T.D. Jakes for opening up about his life's struggles and the painful moments he endured. This book broke down wine and opened my mind to things deep in the word of God. Certain parts of the book encouraged me during my wilderness season. I can pull things out of this book and use them to encourage others. I am thankful to use audible with this book to help me finish it in it's entirety.
"I am a big fan of T.D. Jakes and this book is just as awesome as his others. It's a dynamic and challenging word steeped in Biblical truth and wisdom.  It is good for people who are going through trials, but also a great reminder for those not in trial at the moment, about how God uses things in ways we could never imagine to grow us, further His Kingdom, and bring Him glory.  It's great for new believers, or more matures ones as well. Overall, I loved it and will be reading it again, and giving a copy to anyone I know in a tough spot."
"T.D. Jakes so eloquently and transparently describes how the crushing seasons in his life, and how those of our own, are an integral part of the process to transform us into God‚Äôs choicest wine.Having read his previous books Instinct, Destiny, and Soar! at pivotal times that served as God‚Äôs bread crumbs in my life, I believe that the release of Crushing was divinely timed‚Ä¶not just for me, but for countless people around the world who have endured the crushing weight and wait that is part of the process of fulfilling one's purpose in life.From those who are just being introduced to Bishop Jakes for the first time, to those intimately familiar with his ministry and teachings, readers will be inspired and gain a brighter hope for their future.I, for one, continue to walk in faith and see a beautiful table set for the revealing of the unique vintage of wine I am becoming, to be paired with my destined purpose."
"One of the first titles I have purchased by pastor Jakes and I was not disappointed.From the first page to the last, there are nuggets of knowledge that are relevant and Biblically grounded. I took my time reading this book because I simply wasn't ready for it to be over. He spoke directly to my life and gave a sound perspective that allowed me to capture a deeper understanding of my current situation.This definitely will not be the last time I read this book and it certainly is the first of many books I will purchase written by him."
"T.D. Jakes writes in a manner that hits all people. Even the person who isn't particularly religious will get something out of this book. I watch when he is on Dr. Phil and I am in awe of the man. His insights on why things happen that make you want to question the reason why they happen, is right on point. Life is not about being given everything in abundance, for without suffering from time to time, a person's soul just doesn't get better in life."
I love the way that T.D. Jakes communicates the importance of the 'crushing' seasons in our lives. His experience and insight gives him a voice that resonates loud and clear on this topic. God really has a plan during the times we feel like He isn't speaking or working in our lives. Crushing by T.D. Jakes reminds us that He is still working and teaches us how to look with a heavenly perspective to be in tune with how we are maturing when we feel like we have been buried.
"In this insightful book, #1 New York Times bestselling author T.D. Jakes wrestles with the age-old questions: Why do the righteous suffer? Where is God in all the injustice?I really like this author and this book in particular.  TD Jakes asks the questions listed above that we all ask ourselves at one point or another.  I enjoy his approach to writing and to life.  A must read!"
"I brought this as an audio book, but now I think I am going to buy it as a book. Because of this book I now see every situation in my life good or bad as something that God is preparing me for. Thanks you Rev. T.D. Jakes for this amazing and profoundly attitude changing book. I Love it!"
"Bought this for my grandmother who is a cancer survivor and TD Jake fan. She absolutely loves this book and says she would recommend for anyone who has been through something, 5 stars. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion."
"Using how grapes are turned into wine, as well as from personal experiences in his life, Bishop Jakes shows us some of the reasoning for suffering, as well as how we should be able to not only overcome, but also learn from the experience.."
"This is a must have! For anyone is or knows someone who is going through a crushing moment in their life, please get this book. Bishop T.D. Jakes does a phenomenal job guiding the reader through their moments of turmoil. This book really helped me with my trials and tribulations.  I would recommend this novel to anybody!!"
"This is a very good book even if you already know the basic concepts that ALL things work for the good and it's time to embrace all of the experiences of life, learn from them, and remain in an attitude of gratitude and praise."
Reads like a very long  sermon
"This is a great motivational book that focuses on a higher power to overcome the difficulties in your life; ranging from just a bad day, to my life is falling apart insight.  This is a perfect read for anyone battling how to cope and keep going."
Honestly one of the best books I have read in years. NO Fluff....No weird religion super spiritual stuff you can not relate to! REAL....life application....genuine situations of how GOD works to help his children grow and become great.
Bad Book. Td Jake's doesn't even want to read his own books. Don't plan on getting any thing else from him.
"Bishop TD Jakes is just great, from his preaching to his films even to his books.  The crushing spells out what that looks like for one called as a Christian."
"Of course anything Bishop T.D. Jakes does is good. My egroup for church did this study. The study guide make you think, dig deep down and answer questions yourself. One my members even said, I didn‚Äôt want to answer that question because it make it real. I highly suggest this study guide. So if you‚Äôre ready to face yourself and see what God is doing through you, get it! You won‚Äôt be disappointed."
I often watch his videos but there's something more intimate about reading his books. He phrases things so anyone can understand. He always gives such good insight and I feel more grounded after reading this book.
Jakes states that God can only be one member of the Trinity at a time. Not according to God's Word
We all need to remember where and who we came from.
The Crushing is a must read. This book has practical illustrations of how God uses adversity to birth purpose into one‚Äôs life. This book will challenge you to view adversity from a theological perspective. It will help you become more equipped to navigate through tough situations you may encounter.
I haven't finish reading the book but what I've read so far is really encouraging and makes me want to keep reading.  Very motivating and it's a easy read book.  I hate putting the book down.  I will update my rating once I'm done.
Crushing is a must read
I bought the audiobook. But the speaker tone of voice was very hard for me to listen. Therefore you took me more than a few week to finish the book
Nice book
"For those of you pursuing spiritual guidance, this books is very thorough with tangible spiritual strategies to grow closer with God. If you are in a dry season of disdain and feel that typical strategies for centering are mundane, consider this book!"
This book is great to learn about life lesson! Be sure to have pen and paper ready
"The words of the book was very simple, interesting, uplifting, and inspiring. I love the God-view of the book and how honest and straightforward the author was about the real life circumstances/experiences went through."
Amazing in time book. Concepts understandable and easy to apply to daily life. God is truly amazing thanks TS Jakes
The best book in the world üåé  the worlds greatest Preacher
Crushing is a wonderful and inspiring read. Bishop Jakes really breaks down the reasons Crushing is what builds character and inner strength.
"I can‚Äôt say enough about this book and this anointed man of God! For anyone going through a hard time in their life, please, please, get this book. Your breakthrough will come!"
TD Jakes writes some of the best books to me. This one was no different! Awesome read!
This audio book has come at precisely the right moment! EXCELLENT! It washes the hearer with an abundance of hope. Thank you!
"After the interview  on TBN about this book, I sit weeping, Thanking God  Almighty for the answer to my many, many questions-... Why God- so much pain- It Crushed me! But it's not the end- Thank You King Jesus~"
Very informative. Thanks for the education Bishop Jakes.
TD Jakes speaks to that season in your life when you most need direction . Worth every scent .
Avoid this man. He is a heretic.
"One of the best , TD Jakes"
Great book
As pictured
Amazing
Bishop Jakes has a way of phrasing things that are comforting and purposeful at the same time. I know that crushing is not the end!! I recommend this read. So good.
The greater depth of truth and inspired revelation caused me to believe that ‚Äúcrushing is not the end‚Äù. Thank you for this book mr. Td. Jakes
"Pastor jakes always brings the reality and make us think better with biblical views, yes am crushed but it cannot break me rather it make me üëç"
"I didn't read the description very well.  Was hoping to hear the Bishop's voice, but not his."
"As always, TD Jakes uses great stories and in particular wine making To depict how God molds and makes us during our Christian walk. Great ‚Äúread‚Äù on audible. Listened to it twice!"
This book has given me a great perspective on critical moments in my life. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is currently going through a difficult time.
Amazing I really love this book!
Loved this book and understanding the process God uses to grow and lead  us into our purpose and destiny.

This is an awesome read!!
Awesome read
If you are going through a season of uncertainty and discomfort this resource is packed with wisdom and hope for you.
Simply Amazing!
"Amazing, challenging, and empowering."
"As a Christian for many decades, I have over the past 5 years endured so many difficulties that they nearly crushed me. And the Lord did bring me through. Then I started reading TD Jakes & found a profoundly humble, caring man of God who has deep insights into human trials. This book was so incredibly helpful in giving me a new, inspiring perspective on what I have just come thru. The Lord's timing is perfect & Bishop Jakes is most definitely worth reading along with the ""original handbook"" from God-The Bible! How healing & freeing."
This book is life changing. As god always is it‚Äôs on time for the season in my life. I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking answers to the toughest times in life and trying to get through.
This book has truly changed how I see myself and people I allow into my life.
This is my 3rd best seller by T.D Jake's great read!
Purchased for my mom. It was book and work book.
VERY Well laid out & material presented was excellent in nature ... easy read - nicely done TJ :)

Everybody should read this book
I bought this for a family friend. She loves it!!
Love it
This book is a life changing tool. It makes you trust and love God more and appreciate His paths for your life even when you don't understand yet the reason why He allows you to go through some circumstances.
This book is just what I needed!!!
Love it
Love
this book is a blessing
This is a really easy yet powerful read. It felt like Pastor Jakes was talking to me as I read through the book. Jakes uses his personal testimony to inspire hope and encourage perseverance.
The Crushing discusses in detail the process of how God can turn all of our failures into joy. It is for God to get ALL of the GLORY!!
I love how vulnerable Bishop T.D. Jakes is in this book. It's so relatable and encouraging.
"Oh my goodness I am only 1/3 in to this book and it is already changing my life. It is confirming everything I was daring to believe deep in my spirit that this season of intense pruning, doubt, conflict, confusion, failure, stress and uncertainty, is actually a time of the deepest blessing and even commendation for how far I‚Äôve come in God already. Praise him! I will trust and wait and rejoice in the pruning.I have already bought 5 more copies for various friends and am recommending to many more."
"The way God uses TD Jakes to articulate his words is writing will never cease to amaze me. Crushing is an eye-opener to the realm of God's way of working in our lives during the constant pain and noise we hear and feel from time to time. The book strongly encourages us that through the trials and tribulations we encounter, we still have hope and faith to believe in our Father who knows the end from the beginning. I enjoyed in particular chapter 13, and also the sub-heading 'invisible trouble' - which caused me to look deep within myself and ask what troubles am I going through that God is using to bless me in the long-term. The pain that you are currently going through is not the end! The best is yet to come! I pray God grants you abundant wisdom in writing more books Bishop TD Jakes. God is using you to touch millions of lives including mine! God richly bless you! <3"
"I have waited for this book! Now I have it. I have set aside a special day to fully start reading it, uninterrupted,  the little I have read is so poweful ‚Äî I know this book will turn me inside out, as most of Bishop Jakes‚Äô work seems to do."
"Excellent book . Perfect gift for yourself or someone you needs good advice in life, I have bought this book for myself and I couldn't stop reading , I will read again as it as so many good messages in life. 10 out of 10 I Recommend anyone to read it. you will not regret"
This is the best book I‚Äôve bought this year. The insight gained from this book about my many life situations is priceless. Highly recommended
What an amazing book that spoke directly to my heart when I was at my lowest! It gave me perspective on what God was doing in my life and showed me that He hadn‚Äôt abandoned me but was with me through my process. Bless you TD Jakes for sharing your  experiences through your creative writing!
This book was compiled in such a way that it brought soundness of mind. Bishop Jakes has made a very complicated concept that I struggled with in my walk of faith and made it simple. I am now patiently waiting for the wine i will become. Thank you for this wisdom and may God bless the work of your hands.
One of the most life changing books I have read in a long time!!
Good condition on arrival and great book.
"An amazing book by Bishop Jake's.. very very inspiring, insightful and faith evoking..I love Bishops clarity in writing and his detailing in explanations..a must read for anyone ready to learn a d move to new levels in life..."
"This book will shake you to your core but the analogy of us being crushed by the Master is hard but so worth it. Because through the crushing we will become the choicest wine, wine that others will want to emulate."
GREAT >:)
Crushing (International): God Turns Pressure into Power

This book has really helped me understand my personal journey of my Christian faith. Very inspirational and easy to read.
I'm being crushed at the moment. TD Jake's book  has done so much...Oh I can't explain how awesome this is.
Blessing
Best book ever
"Had to wait for delivery, but well worth it!"
A deep & thoughtful book that will bring out the best from our trials & suffering. A must read for any believerm
"Delivery was on time, It was neatly packed and in best condition.while reading though this book, each and every page you turn and every line you readthere is something that relates us and gives you a sense of how things are proceeding in our life ,the perspective of GOD and us. Bishop TD Jakes, Beautifully speaks to us and profuse us in the words of GOD.I personally felt after reading the book, a divine peace knowing that Christ our father knows every details of our life, that he perfectly plans the end from the beginning.I personally request everyone to read this book."
"This is one of the best books that I‚Äôve read. Wonderfully written. Each chapter is a journey that God takes us through. If you‚Äôre in a hard season of your life, where you feel the crushing weight over your chest and it seems that it‚Äôs gonna consume you and you‚Äôll have no life at all.., trust me, God can change that situation around. In fact, sometimes he uses those situations to make us strong. To make us more & more like him. Slowly & Steadily, he transforms our image into his.We‚Äôre seeds and he has planted us in the dark soil, not to bury us but to make us grow.We‚Äôre grapes of his vineyard under a crushing process to become Wine. His Choicest Wine!The pressure is applied so that we may come out as diamonds.After all, he wants us to be his crown of glory.The dirty places are where he puts us to refine us & make us grow.We grow in valleys much more than we can on the mountain tops.Pain has the ability to build our character strong if we surrender everything in God‚Äôs mighty hands. God wouldn‚Äôt have put you in that situation without a purpose. And his plans & purpose are always to prosper you not to harm you!If you are in such a season & want a vivid picture of what God is doing in your life, do not think twice, just pick it up & read. It has been of enormous help and has blessed me immeasurably.And remember my friend, Crushing is NOT THE END!"
"El libro est√° incre√≠ble. Pero lleg√≥ en las peores condiciones, lo colocaron en una caja y ya, no ten√≠a protecci√≥n al rededor, ni pl√°stico  burbuja, etc. lleg√≥ muy sucio, con la portada manchada. Esa no es la calidad con la que Amazon envuelve los libros."
This Book is so amazing. Such a good reminder and truly spiritually awakening because sometimes when going through the process of wine making we may loose sight of the end of the process that is the new wine. This book gives us clarity that the crushing of life is not the end and that there was a purpose when He created us and that His word will not come back void. I throughly enjoyed this book and will definitely ready it again.
Loved this book and how it shows that your entire Christian life is a journey and that there will be tough times. It also gives me hope and encourages me to remain on the path because there is a beautiful life and the process may be crushing but hold on...
"J'aurai souhait√© lettre 6 √©toiles car ce livre m'a apport√© des r√©ponses.

Dieses Buch wirft einen frischen Blick auf das Leben des Autors und gibt tiefe Eindr√ºcke in biblische Weisheiten. Durch das verwendete Vokabular wird man aufmerksam gehalten und lernt etwas dazu. Dieses Buch ist f√ºr jeden Intellektuellen Christen zu emfehlen.
"Gostei muito do acabamento do livro e do seu conte√∫do, por√©m ainda n√£o parei para iniciar sua leitura, mas pelo que li na contracapa dele, me parece que ser√° um livro muito edificante para a minha vida, sem contar que vou aperfei√ßoar a minha leitura inglesa atrav√©s desse livro do Bishop T.

Phenomenal book. If you are going through something tough this is the book to read. Great perspective.
Helps to have the right perspective regarding the challenges and trials you face in life. Blessed immensely after reading the book
"Amazing read, definitely a must have for any collection. A tool to mature your faith."
"I have been following Bishop for a while but this came from another perspective, a dip into his personal challenges. I'm highly blessed and encouraged with this."
TD JAKES pours out his own life experience into this book and that‚Äôs what adds such credibility and gives us reason to be inspired to go for gold in our own crushing moments! This book is a lifetime keeper!
Excellent book!  I‚Äôve recommended it to many people!
True TD Jakes style - full on revelation and importation! I enjoyed each chapter that had detailed life experience tied into biblical truths
Amazing book
Excellent read
"I wish I‚Äôd known there was a religious angle on one page, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have bought it.  It‚Äôs a ‚Äúthank the lord for...‚Äù line that you can skip over but still, I think you can teach thankfulness without it having to be religious.  I also don‚Äôt like how much little critter was complaining. I felt almost like I was teaching my kid to complain by reading this!  I think this book is best for ages 5+.  It was a little much for my 3 year old."
"Published by Thomas Nelson it is obvious from the beginning (scripture reference of Psalm 107:1) that this particular Little Critter book is based on Christian principles. Written in first person by Little Critter, the opening page has him wishing for a scooter in the shop window rather than being thankful for the one he already has. Little Critter continues to be ungrateful, always wishing for something ""better"". Even a talk from Dad doesn't stop him.A word of caution here. If you do not like your child reading about being nasty to a sibling this might not be the book for you. When Little Sister bumps into Little Critter, causing him to drop his ice cream cone he says ""I wish I had a big brother instead of a dumb little sister like you."" Needless to say, Little Critter's mom reprimands him. The next day Little Critter is out at Grandma's farm. How did this trip help change Little Critter's attitude?This book has a tremendous lesson for all of us, not just the kids. FANTASTIC story to share with your family. Thanks, Liz"
"This one hits you over the head with its goopy message. Gone is the simple (but, truthfully, kinda deep) messaging and storytelling found in the early Little Critter books by Mayer (like ""Just Me and My Dad""). Whoever took over this enterprise does not have a gift for subtlety...or storytelling. Even at $3.99 I regret buying this dud. A tosser."
Be aware that the book content is religious (Christian) as it mentions God and his grace. I had to return it because the school I work at is multicultural and we prefer to not mention any religions as to not to exclude any other possible beliefs.
"I really like the Inspired Kids collection with Little Critter. All these books offer a moral lesson for children in a way that is easy for them to understand and refer to. The pictures as always are just beautiful. In this story, Little Critter wishes he has things other kids have or things that he thinks are better than his. He wants to go to the movies instead of having a movie night at home with his family. He wants to go to a restaurant instead of eating at home. His father tells him that a lot of people would love to have what he has and he has to be thankful for what he has. This is a good way to put things in perspective. Well, telling is not as effective as showing, so Little Critter continues to wish for more things. What I did not like was when Little Critter was mad at his sister for knocking his ice cream down and Little Critter said he wished he had a big brother instead of a dumb little sister. I did not like the use of the word ""dumb"", though I know some kids will actually say this. My daughter, being the ""little sister"" in the family, took it to heart. I think such words are unnecessary in books like this. Also, when his mom told him to say he's sorry, he did not reply or apologize to his sister.Other than that, I liked the book, but I will be editing that word from now on, though my daughter already knows it's there.Finally, Little Critter visits the farm and sees how happy and content the animals are with the food they have. So he goes home with a new perspective and even teaches his sister to be appreciative as well. That's all :) Gotta love Little Critter."
"Really good moral and explanation of how to be appreciative for what you have. Recommend it to every family with children. One part of the story talks about ""thankful rocks"". Now my daughter has her own thankful rock she found at the beach. She picked the rock herself without me even asking her. She remembered the book she read and wanted her own thankful rock."
"Gets religious on one page, which isn't really my thing, but this book is great! My 3 and 4 year olds could relate to all the wanting and wishing and understood that just like little critter they are happier when they are grateful for what they DO have rather than focusing on what they want. We made thankful rocks like in the book and keep them around the house to reference to when someone gets upset about wanting something."
"I used to have many of the Little Critter books when I was a kid (over 30 years ago) and my son's love for the collection proves that they have stood the test of time!  This book, ""Being Thankful"" is part of the Inspired Kids series, which I have just recently started buying.  In short, the moral of the story is to be grateful for and love everything that you DO have in your life and to stop focusing on what other people have that you don't.  With all of the fancy gadgets of today's world, this can be a difficult lesson to teach a child and it helps for the lesson to be reinforced by a book as kids don't always want to listen to what their parents say! In this story, Grandma and Grandpa refocus the little Critters' attention on their ""special rock,"" which helps them to stop and think about everything they are thankful to have in their lives.  Good story, great lesson!"
Teaches gratitude in a simple way. It gives an idea for parents to do with their children to remind them to be grateful. It would be fun to read the book and then follow what they do in the book with your children. The only thing I did not like is at one point little critter calls his sister dumb. The point could have been made without that and I personally just leave it out when I read it.
"I love Mercer Mayer books.  I used them for years when I was teaching.  Although this is a pre-school level book, I bought it for content/subject matter for the older kids I am now teaching.  I think they too will enjoy the book and I know they will get the message to be thankful for what they have and not always demand something new or trending."
we bought this cute portrayal of a lesson in gratitude for a thanksgiving book.  the ‚Äúthankful rock‚Äù idea has been one that my 4 yr old grasped onto and now finds thankful rocks to gift to loved ones... all her idea! some of the phrasing i didn‚Äôt love; but th message still came across clearly to my 4 yr old.
"I didn't realize this was a Critter book for older kids. I love the simpler Critter books for my toddlers. I grew up reading those as a child and I like to buy them for the holidays. This one has a lot of writing so we won't be using it for several years. My daughter doesn't have a long enough attention span for this one. Now I know not to buy the ""Inspired Kids"" books."
I'm a preschool teacher and I'm always looking for new books to read to the children in my classroom. This is a very nice book with a great message. It's a little wordy and longer than I thought it would be but the children still enjoyed it.
Exciting story about keeping a good attitude. The importance of gratitude laid out for the littlest ones to understand. This challenged my 5yo to remember to be grateful everyday!
"This book is definitely for older kids and even with that being said I think it misses the mark. Instead of showing kids how TO act, it shows them how NOT to act.Won‚Äôt be reading this to my children. Disappointing as we love the old critter books."
"As a teacher and Mom, I love this book. Teaching gratitude and thankfulness by example is a good start, but hearing the same lesson from a beloved character's perspective was helpful for my kids."
"Love the book! I didn‚Äôt, however, like how it was shipped. There was no warning on the package to not bend the package and the book came folded and bent up, basically. It was A LOT more flimsy than I thought. I love these books, though! Read them as a child and now I‚Äôm going to read them to my daughter!"
"What drew me to this book is that I loved little critter growing up so much, the book arrived in perfect condition and just as described. He does call his sister dumb, which I don't like, but you can skip over that pary, because other than that it's a great book with a good moral"
I should have paid attention and realized that this bad bible verses in it.  I wouldn't have purchased it had I known.  I just blacked out the scripture and Jeezusy stuff.  Being thankful is important - for people of any and all and no religions.
"I love the Little Critter series but cannot believe this wonderful story about being thankful for what you have then includes the following: ""I wish I had a big brother instead of a dumb little sister like you."""
This is an amazing book!!  My kids love it so much and can never get enough of it!! It is great quality too and have great stories and pictures. Would recommend them to every one!!  And great for younger kids!!
This sweet book is very useful to every kid trying to learn gratitude.The illustrations are very cute.
"Little Critter's stories are generally not very religious and I'm not very religious myself, but this story does have religious undertones, mention of God and even a mention of a passage in the Bible on the inside of the book. With that said, I didn't find it overly religious or anything and the actual story and lesson is a very important one to teach children regarding being grateful for what we have instead of what we don't."
"Super book to add to my grandkids' book collection at grandma's.  Nice story, fun illustrations, and the smart one in the book is grandma! Just the right length for a bedtime story too."
Good quality for a paperback book. I enjoy the message in this book and our toddler understands it well.
"Love how Little Critter books start with a bible verse, provide lessons and teaching moments! The world needs more of God and his teachings!"
Mercer Meyer does it again! This is a great story about valuing and having a grateful heart.
"Just heads up this is through a Christian publisher.It has a different feel then other Mercer mayor's books (we have near 50 of them).I thought it would focus on being gratefull in the moment, enjoy being alive, enjoy moments with loved ones,. And  how to appreciate those moments in a silly sorry.It was not what I expected."
"Really liking the Inspired Kids series. My daughter's a big fan of Little Critter, and I like that we have some Little Critter books with good messages in them. I may have to implement the idea of a thankful rock."
Ita a book. Little one likes finding the spider and mouse.
Easy read for new readers and it has a good story line.
I purchased this book for my girl scout troop.  This book really puts being thankful at a child's level.  We painted small thankful rocks to complete our project.  I find myself also holding on the rock when I am having a stressful day!!!
I didn't particularly care for this book but my daughter likes it so I guess that's what matters most.
This is a great book and I do like the Little Critter books. This book might be my new favorite. It shows how to be thankful and grateful in a way that young children can really respond to. I love that the Grandparents help Little Critter understand and then Little Critter turns around and helps his little sister to be thankful as well.
Have always loved these Little Critter books by Mercer Mayer.
"My 18 month old loves all the Mercer Mayer books so we bought her this one for Easter. She loves it! As far as the low rated reviews due to it being religious...if you read the description of the book, it makes that aspect of the book clear. It is based on a Psalm in the Bible so rating it low for that reason isn't fair. The only thing I didn't like is the way the main character describes his sister as ""dumb"" in the book. We blacked out the word because we don't want to expose her to language like that. Other than that it's a great book!"
"The message of this book couldn't have come at a better time. While I didn't intend to purchase a book with specific religious undertones, the primary message is perfectly communicated to my 7-year-old son who asks for everything new and interesting. Being thankful for what we have is a timeless message and Little Critter and his family are the perfect ones to convey this idea. My son asks for it almost every night!"
This is a great book!  It easily holds the attention of all three of my children and I love that they are getting a great message at the same time.  Thanks Mercer Mayer for making great reads for my little ones ~ I remember enjoying the Little Critter books when I was growing up!  This book in particular details the importance of learning to be thankful.
Cutest book! Great for little ones who are learning that they must take care of what they have and be happy for what they get.
"Great series of books to teach/explain the value of good manners and good thinking.  The whole family value system is highlighted in cute, interesting ways completely suited to the age of the young listener/reader.  Some people have complained about the use of Biblical references, but I on the other hand, am glad to see God as a part of daily life for little ones as well as older readers."
I love the message this teaches our children. Cute story line and great pictures.
Such a fun reminder for everyone to count our blessings! I took to heart as I read to my grandchild! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Great
"This is such a great book about being thankful, published recently it involves modern references to electronics and was really helpful for my little ones. Little Critter gets a ""thankful stone"" from his grandparents he gets to keep in his room or his pocket so when he sees it he can always remember he has stuff to be thankful for.  Gave my kids their own thankful rock as well, very cute!"
"Adorable story, good lesson. My 4 year old loves it!"
"My kids, that are now grown, always loved the Little Critter books. Now I buy them for their kids. Guess what? They love them too. Keeping the tradition going."
Love Mercer Mayer books! This is the best deal anywhere for these. Highly recommend.
My daughter loves these books
Loved Mercer Mayer books
What a terrific approach to learning to be grateful for what you have!  I love this book and we read it all the time!  I love that Little Critter transferred well to Kindle without shrinking down all the illustrations!
I had a little trouble getting the ebook to play.
"I like this book.  I think it made my kid who wanted me to buy everything under the sun lately, realize that he needs to be thankful for what he has not that he doesn't have the latest and greatest of everything."
Great author.  YOu can't go wrong with Little Critter.
These Lil Critter books are so wonderful especially if u do voices while reading to ur child/grandchild. I still have my son's books & it really helped him with reading in school & now my grandson loves em too & really enjoys reading & he does his own voices too to make it more funüòä
"This is a wonderful book! The theme of being thankful is always important, but especially right now during COVID. In addition, we really enjoyed the pictures, especially trying to find the hidden spider and mouse."
My Grandson loves this book! He has a lot of the Little Critter Books they are his favorite books and he can read a few of them by him self he is 5yrs Old. Nana loves them too!! Also planning on buying the few others that we still need!
"I read the reviews and thought okay, reviewers complained of the sister being called dumb in the book, but if its a book about being thankful, we could overlook that one word....but it was more of what he wanted and didn't have. I just wasn't a fan of the book and won't be giving it to our 1st grader."
My kids will love them! They love little critter books and the books came in nicely and not damaged
Great book with a great message
Love the story and the message it sends. Teaches a good lesson on being grateful for what we have.
"This book teaches a good concept about being thankful for what you have, and not focused on what you don't have. I read this to our 4 year old daughter at times when she needs to remember that."
"""Being Thankful""  could not be more spot on for my son's age group.  I love the messages that Mercer Mayer illustrates.  If you want to teach your son or daughter to value and appreciate what you have and not what you dont, this is the perfect book.  It's hard to get kids to understand certain messages but this book got through to my son."
"I love the Little Critter books. Very good story and way to present it to kids to learn being thankful. Good examples and easy to understand. Nice pictures, vibrant colors. Worth the money."
"We are in the ""I want"" stage, so this book is great to help cultivate thankfulness."
Not really in ebook format. Font too small and can‚Äôt be expanded. Was able to read it with my granddaughter and I felt the theme of the book was appropriate for 5 year old.
This is another Little Critter hit about gratitude and contentment versus coveting what we don't have - my kids love it!
Wonderful story to teach the abstract meaning of thankfulness and being thankful for what you have to young children. Also my kiddos love to find Little Critters pet mouse and spider.
love this series
Cute
"This book is a wonderful lecture of life, my girls are just 2 year and a half and they love this book, they start understanding the meaning of the story. They can not go to sleep with out me to read the story."
So cute
This book made my husband and me laugh. It all sounded so familiar. I hope that it teaches my kid a lesson. ;)
"Didn't realize it was so religious. Not terrible, but not what I thought it would be"
We love all the little Critter books. Mercer Meyer is a classic author and these books are so well priced! Makes a great gift!
Gave this book out for Thanksgiving door dash boxes for my friends and their families. Was the perfect addition.
Cute book with a good moral
Such a practical & sweet lesson about being thankful!  I read this to my day care kids. Love it!
Love it!
Love Mercer Mayer books!
Purchased this to help teach my kid about being happy with what you have and it serves the purpose. Little Critter is always a great purchase.
I've ordered several books from Mercer Mayer.  My son loves them as much as I did as a child.
These books were my favorite as a kiddo and I now enjoy reading them to my daughter!
These books are a favorite for my 5 year old grandson.
These books are favorites in our household and they all have a good message for all ages! They're always a great bedtime story.
I plan on reading this book to my preschool class. As Little Critter learns how to be thankful the children can too.
Everything was great
I love Mercer Mayer and this book. The message was perfect and I love how it's laid out for kids to understand.
My 6 year old loves all of the books in this series and I do as a parent as well.  Not only does she continue to advance with her reading but she also learns about values which is a win-win for me.
Super cute story. My kids love it.
"This book is a great look at gratitude, something most of us struggle with. It is also a great read for Thanksgiving."
"Love these for reading to the baby! I read them all the time as a kid, would be perfect for beginner readers!"
Excellent for kids!
"Great reading tool, and great lessons for children"
A nice book to teach kids about being thankful.
The Little Critters books never disappointment.

These books are so cute. Love them
A delightful way of teaching a child to be thankful.
good
We see the bratty side of Little Critter and see how his family rallies around to help change his ways.
It was a good book because it had more words than the other books. I liked it so much because it was so fun reading that book!
4 year old loves these
"Great book, fun illustrations"
Excellent books for young children! Brings the Lord into the story in a smooth way. Not overwhelming for them at all. You should purchase them all!

My daughter has really enjoyed this book. She is 3 and it has helped her understand about being thankful. I love that it connects it to the Bible.
My nephew loves the books!
My grandson loves the Little Critter books!
The children loved this one.
Great read for my Kindergarten class
"Great book, my kids love all the little critter series and always find good lessons."
Happy with purchase. Recd ahead of anticipated time.
"This lotion is GREAT!! It definitely does what u want ANy lotion to do. It gets u noticbly darker in just one use. ( at least thats how it ALWAYs does for me) wnd maintains ur tan, and takes it darker the more u use it and the more u tan. So u can lay a coule times a week and stay nice n tan OR u can tan more and get even darker..I have been purchasing this lotion for the past few years now and always re upping after im out.- trying others in between, but i Always come back to this! It smells good and works even better! ! And for the price.. cmon, its a no brainer!! Thank u black n tan!"
Great book for kids and teaches a wonderful lesson!
I ordered these for my grandchildren for Thanksgiving and we read them together.  Good message--
We love the Lil Critters.  Keep up the good work Mercer.  A re-read.
"Mercer Mayer are classic tales that touch your child's heart.  Easy for them to understand, creative in message and all around one of the best children's authors I've come across! This one, Being Thankful, is especially touching with a smather of humor."
good book
I love it!!!
My son who is 5 loves reading these books.
I bought this fir my grandsons. I believe it promotes gratitude for God and for what you have.
cute book
My 3 year old loves Little Critter. The fact that the books give him a little bit of biblical value is just the icing on the cake for us.
Very cute book.  My grandaughter loves it.
"Great book on being thankful, nice quick read for bedtime.  We will be reading this book more often during the week"
This book is good for kids as well as adults being Thankful for what we have and not wanting what other have!!!
"As always, Mercer Mayer books are entertaining and educational, teaching values and good manners! Keep them coming."
Great children's book.
LOVE LITTLE CRITTER BOOKS!
"This is an awesome, Godly children's book about being thankful for what you have & not wanting what others have!"
"Adorable little book with a sweet message!  A must have for every child, but especially for those who always want everything their friends have! If you are always looking for great books to give your Sunday School class, or young children, you will love this book!"
My son loves to read about Little Critter and all his adventures! We were happy to add this to our collection.
"Great story to read with a child, I would recommend this book to parents. A b c d e f g."
i loved the gratitude rocks as a tangible way to remind us all to be grateful for what we have.
I love how simple the message is to be thankful for what you have (even with it seems like other people have really great things). I was not happy with the inclusion of God in the story message.
"Stick with 'Just me and my dad' from the Mayer series. That's a nice one to read. 'Being Thankful' teaches a solid lesson, but I find it wordy and clunky. It is not enjoyable to read out loud, and I'm most thankful when I reach the end of this saga. Save your money and buy a thankful rock instead."
The story is not so great. I was hoping for a better solution. My daughter still loves looking at the book and searching for little critters friends on every page.
"Not a great book. Pretty disappointed because ""I was so mad"" is one of our favorite books."
"We love these books, but this one is awful. Seems like the author got super religious and the books went way downhill.Stick with the classic older little critters books and avoid these new weird ones (unless you are into the evangelical Christian thing... then you'll probably love this one)"
"Never viewed the little critter books as religious, but the last couple we have got mention God as fact."
"Wow, totally didn't realize we were grabbing one of the new religious versions of Little Critter. Gotta watch out for these ghost written ones. They are awful."
Beware secular people who want to teach their kids about being thankful- this book id about God.
"I have loved Mercer Mayer's little critter books for years and made sure we had all of them for all three of my boys. I do not care for religion in books for my children and bought this book without realizing it was a Christian book. Now I will have to be careful in the future on what little critter books I buy, if any. It's such a great story except for the fact that they make it a Christian one."
"Little Critter had an attitude, and it most definitely was not a thankful attitude. It was an ""I want this; I want that"" attitude. He wasn't satisfied with what he had: he wanted newer, better, MORE! Before we criticize we should look in the mirror and see if we don't look a little like Little Critter. How satisfied are we with what we have? Are we thankful or do we gripe and complain? Little Critter goes to visit his grandparents and comes home with a whole new attitude. How did that happen? You'll have to read to find out.This is not preachy as some claim. If you don't want to be thankful to God for what you have, fine. But that doesn't mean you have to be whining and complaining about it like Little Critter. Fact is some of us ARE thankful to Him, and we don't gripe and complain that you aren't. Why do you have to complain that we are?I recommend this to anyone who isn't offended by any reference to God. If you are, just don't read it. Sounds simple enough to me."
"Buy it to help show your kid that they should be happy for what they have, including this book!"
"Teaching a child to be thankful is a hard job. Our very nature seems to lean towards selfishness. Everything around us just inspires us to want bigger, better and more, more, more. So what's a parent to do? Send them to their grandparents of course!Come along as Little Critter makes a trip to his grandparents' farm. While he is there his very clever grandparents begin to teach them lessons on being thankful. Grandma and Grandpa gently point out that sometimes we need to do something just because it makes someone else happy.One of the objects that Grandma uses to drive home the idea of thankfulness for Little Critter is a blue thankful rock. Grandma has a green thankful rock and Grandpa has a purple thankful rock. One of the best lines from the story is spoken by Grandma and Grandpa to Little Critter.""Remember how happy the farm animals were with what they had? And how happy we can be when we decide to appreciate what we have?"" {Grandmother}I nodded. {Little Critter}Then Grandpa pulled his thankful rock from his pocket. ""That's what it means to have gratitude--to be thankful for everything in your life,"" said Grandpa. ""Sometimes when I forget, I look at my thankful rock and I praise God for His goodness and for all the things I'm thankful for--like you Little Critter!""When Little Critter arrives back home it seems that the ungrateful bug has bitten Little Sister. But Little Critter has taken his grandparents' lesson to heart and gives his little sister a red thankful rock. Don't you love it when your children learn a valuable lesson and pass it on to their younger siblings? Peer pressure can sometimes be a good thing, especially when it is coming from an older sibling.I think you and your children will love this wonderful book on thankfulness by the talented Mercer Mayer. It is a delightful way to address the topic of being content with what God has given us. Psalm 107:1 tell us to ""Thank the Lord because he is good. His love continues forever."" What a powerful statement on being thankful!I received a copy of this book to facilitate my review."
"I've been a fan of the Little Critter series since I was a child myself, but as a parent I especially love this one. In this story Little Critter learns to be thankful for what he already has rather than wish for something else. Living in a culture of constant consumption, I consider this an extremely important lesson to learn and a philosophy that I personally live by. This story makes that message easy for young children to understand by incorporating situations that they can relate to and also offers them a ""talisman"" in the form of a thankful rock. This could easily be used in real life to help confirm the message. This is a story that I will read often to my children."
"Being thankful for the things that you have is a interesting concept in children. Children tend to always want everything. As adults we see that what we have is what God wants us to have. I have to say since we don't always have, at our house, we have taught thankfulness since the very start. Our youngest just turned 2 and I am very thankful that she is already starting the ""tainshoo"" when she gets something she wants. In our house the phrase ""we can't afford it right now"" is very common thing.Little Critters Books are so great at helping teach those, well needed, lessons to our children.I received this book to read and post my honest review"

"These books are the best, they're funny and they have good morals. We love them Little critters, your a little critter."
My son loves reading this book before bed! It is a great book and is enjoyed by all! Highly Recommend!
We liked all the reminders about all the things we have and how enchanting they are and thinking about how fun they are.
"I love sharing beloved characters from my childhood with my own children. I loved as a child that Little Critter didn't always have a great attitude. Hey none of us are happy all the time! Being Thankful begins with Little Critter longing for bigger and better things. He wants those new sneakers, new scooter, and big ice cream sundae. His parents try to explain he needs to be grateful for what he has but it falls on deaf ears. A trip to his grandparents' farm is just what he needs. He gets to experience the gratefulness of the animals at the farm and his grandparents give him a little life lesson and reminder about being thankful. I liked this book very much because not only did Little Critter learn a lesson, at the end he shares it with his sister too.I received a free copy of this book in exchange for my honest review from Tommy Nelson. All opinions are my own."
My granddaughter loves all these books keep them coming thank you for writing these wonderful storiesI really appreciate the colorful pictures and the sense of humor in the stories
Easy to read. Good life lesson and even mentioned how we should thank God for all we do have. Great for young readers. I love The little Critters by Mercer Mayer!
We love the Little Critter series but I wish there was a way to tell which ones bring religious indoctrination into the story. It was mostly cute but one page mentions god and I wouldn't have bought it if I had known.
I read this to my three year old grandson and I like the lesson that everyone needs to be reminded of.
Great reminder for little ones to be thankful for what they have.  A short book with a strong message in it.
"This book is great for my little Kindergarten boy. We are trying to learn about being thankful for what we have, from stuff to people. Little Critter does a great job and conveying this concept in a book that my son loves. I received this book for free to review. All opinions are my own"
The title hit me for my young child because this generation needs to learn how to be thankful.  They get everything they want and they believe they are entitled.  But we as parents are to blame.
Totally recommend! The kids enjoyed it and there is a great message.  I would recommend it to anyone who has kids
My children love the meaning to the book. Great illustrations and describing how important it is to be thankful. We love it.
I sent the kids in my life a book every month.  I sent this and all of the kids loved it. Quick delivery and affordable.
It's really hard to teach gratitude because kids are often so self-centered.  Little Critter helped to make that lesson completely relevant to my kids.  I received this book to review. The opinions shared here are 100% mine.
gift
"A book about being thankful for the little things. Thank You Father, for everything that You have blessed us with"
My son liked this book and I liked that it taught a lesson. Would recommend it to other parents to teach thankfulness.
Love this book. Bought it for my child but I learn the lesson each time we read too
Love the story!
Mercer Mayer does good work. A great message for our kids. The stories are always cue and the art always fun.
What a Great book! It was really easy to explain being thankful for what you have I love these books.
Grand kids love it!!
fast shipping and wonderful book! thanks!
Love the critters
"cute characters, good message"
Great story with a great message! My 7 year old and my 5 year old both enjoyed it! Cute illustrations too!
RELIGIOUS! It doesn't advertise it but this is a religious book. If that isn't what you want don't get this. I wish I had known. There's no mention of it at all in the description.
"Daughter loves this book, and so do I."
Love it
Beautiful book!
"I love reading this book to my daughter at times when I think she's forgetting how lucky she has it. She really gets the message and it helps remind her to be thankful for all the good things in our life. I personally don't love how it brings up god in one line, but it's still a great story."
Mercer Mayer books always deliver a wholesome story time for children. The pictures are vivid and always hide little critters amongst the pages that children love to find. I read and cherished these books as a child and now have the joy of passing them on to my children.
I love all the Little Critter books.  I have many.  I'm extremely pleased to see they have now started writing inspirational type stories.
Love it. I can use this book as a teaching tool for my toddler.
Love these books for kids; always a great message!
Very cute and meaningful book!
Perfect condition great gift

Kids loved it and so did I! Wonderful lessons!
Such cute and short stories.

Loved these books as a child. Glad I get to share them with my children.
great book
"Just FYI - this is the BIBLE version of the Little Critter Series. We have many of the original series books, and didn't know there was a difference. Just not my cup of tea, but heads up for buyers looking for the original Little Critter Series."
As expected.
"A must-read for Christians (or anyone really) wanting to help the less fortunate whether it be in their community or across the globe. Sometimes well-intentioned people can do serious harm to the people they desire to help.  Read this book and after you finish, read ""Toxic Charity: How Churches and Charities Hurt Those They Help, And How to Reverse It "" by Lupton. These two books were paradigm changers for me."
Was exactly as described. A good condition used book.
"Great book for those who like to help people, but want to do it in a positive way so that those they are helping are also engaged."
"Book was for me, Wade's wife. I'm an adult missionary kid from Africa and thought I knew quite a bit about helping the poor. Wrong. I have learned SO much and my preconceived notions have been shaken to the core -- in a good way. I don't think anyone should go to work for any length of time in a ""majority world"" country without reading this essential resource!"
Excellent presentation of how and why traditional efforts to alleviate poverty have failed and have damaged both the donors and recipients.  Should be a required read for anyone going on a short term mission trip regardless of how close it might be to home.
Excellent book which challenges our usual methods of helping those who are materially poor. My local church did a study of this book along with the video series which prompted much discussion and opened my eyes to a different way of providing help to those in need.
A good book on the subject.  Works well for a Bible study and has enough information to fill a quarter.  Would work best for a class where participants purchase and read the book in preparation for class time.
"A must read when serving rich or poor.  Changes how you see the role of helping and attitude towards, being helped."
"A must-read for anyone working, or planning to work, in the missions field.  The book really opens your eyes to the damage that can be caused when churches, organizations, and individuals do not have the correct mindset or strategy surrounding their missions."
"A must read for anyone who is thinking about doing a missions trip/volunteer trip/humanitarian trip. Completely changed my perspective on what it means to ""help"" someone."
Every NGO should make this a required reading.
I found this book very helpful while in the midst of considering how I and the members of the church I attend can assist friends in the country of India who are helping care for the elderly in their country.
Great book which makes you think about giving in a different way.
"Very helpful info, especially works well in a small group."
"A good read helping us understand that to helping is important, but like so many things it must be completely understood."
This was life changing for me and has excellent discussion points. I read this alone but would find it excellent fodder for group discussion in church contexts.
"Clear and directive information on how to 'really' help those in need.  Would recommend to individuals, Bible study groups and Church Ministry Teams."
great
"Lots of food for thought and challenging information. Needed reading for anyone involved in mission work, abroad or in country. Not as easy to turn into action as the author makes it seem."
on time
great book deal!
Great book and information
Wonderful book.  All people in all churches should read this.
Lifechanging information!  Highly recommend!
Good read for those who have a heart for helping those in need!
I consider this book a must-read for anyone interested in helping others.
Should be required reading for all cross-cultural workers!
"It is clear, to the point, practical and brings a wealth of experience to the issue of poverty. I will recommend this to any group or individual who wants to work on poverty. More experience is available with some groups but this is an excellent starting point."
This is a great book with lots of useful ideas for dong mission work at home or in the rest of the worldl
"This publication is a ""must read"" for anyone who is serious about doing missions properly.This will be a wake up call to many who are ""doing missions"""
So challenging and helpful. May we all be better helpers
Eyeopener!
Great read and very helpful!
outstanding study on poverty alleviation from the inside out.
An eye opening experience!
"This is a wonderful read that not only poses a big problem, it offers several solutions to help us we service others in the world."
Eye opening
"a very detailed read on alleviating poverty, makes helping the poor worth while"
Great first person prospective on helping the poor...
"I had first borrowed this book from the library to read to my 5 year old at bed time. I had never heard of it before and had just picked it up by chance. As I read it to my daughter I had tears in my eyes. I have never read a children's book that brought emotions the way this one did. I immediately got on amazon and ordered it, we had to have it in our personal library. I highly recommend this. It is great for helping your child know Jesus on a different level than just a sunday morning. Also, it will spark questions about His life from your child. Awesome learning opportunities!"
Great
Very nice hard back for the price
Must have!
"My mom would read this to me multiple times while growing up, now I work with kids and young students and can recall this whole story. It is a very impactful story line! I recently just bought it for my friends baby shower for him to read. I believe it will be a story to remember and perhaps help anyone in need of a perspective of their life."
Perfect!
Love it!
"I bought this book years ago to ready to my children.  I don't know what happened to the book.  I saw it advertised on Amazon for a good price, bought it, and gave as a Christmas gift to my daughter in law and son (all grown up) to ready to their children."
Gave as a gift for nieces baptism. Beautiful story that brings me to tears and reminds me how good God is!!Disappointed in layout and presentation of this book.  It is a paperback and not recommended for the toddler/ infant stage.  There are other more expensive hard cover/ hard page versions of this book which I'd highly recommend over this one.
"This book is beautifully illustrated on high quality pages with a message that is deeply thought provoking, yet gentle. Our Christmas Eve tradition was to read it to the children around the tree before an ornament exchange and birthday cake to Jesus."
Love this book! Describes trees that have big dreams. Their dreams don't come true as they expected but God made what was meant for good into something even better than what they dreamed originally.
"I recently heard this story told on one of my favorite Christian podcasts. It brought tears to my eyes, and I immediately searched for it so that I could purchase the book. I bought several copies, and gave one as a Christmas present, to my cousin for his young children. I was overjoyed to hear that they love the book!"
"I still read this lovely story aloud to my children (now in middle school), and I still get tears in my own eyes as I read it.  We purchased the board book to be a gift; it is beautiful and makes me regret we did not have the board book edition of this book ourselves when my own children were small -- it's perfect for little hands."
"This story is a Christian allegory illustrating, in a simple, yet clear, manner, God's power to use our lives for His purposes in ways that surpass even our biggest dreams.The story begins by introducing three trees, each with its own grand dream.  As the story progresses, the trees begin to question their purposes and wonder whether their dreams will come true.  By the end, each tree realizes that not only are their dreams fulfilled, but they are fulfilled in unexpected ways.While the book may be intended for children, the story's message appeals to readers of all ages.  I purchased the board book version so that it would withstand the handling of my two toddlers.  Because the pictures are not as bright and baby-friendly as what you would find in other books, and the story is an allegory, my then 18-month-old wasn't very interested in my reading it to her.  Now that she is 2 1/2 and is familiar with stories about Jesus, she now asks questions about the pictures and listens as I explain that God created each of us for a special purpose and can use us in ways we never expected."
"I love this story! I was looking everywhere for it! And I love that it comes in board book form! I use it as an explanation of why we let Christmas trees have such a huge importance on a holiday made for Christ. The book has held up against my somewhat rough toddler, so I'd say it's made pretty well."
"Has been a favorite story of mine for 25 years. I ordered this for a baby gift and I cannot wait to give it. Such a beautiful, touching story. A sweet, simple story for a child, teen, or even an adult that is a beautiful reminder of how God uses us in ways we don't anticipate, how our plans aren't always God's plans, and how God's plans can take even the ugliest of what someone else does to us and give us exactly what we have prayed for out of it."
Such a beautiful story to read. The preschoolers were hooked and a couple of them almost cried but then there is a good ending to it. I would use it as a Christmas story book or at church for children time at Christmas. It could be made a small play.
"Excellent book.  My grands, all five of them, love it and ask me, time and again, to read it to them even though the oldest two could read it to me.  They love the book!  Perfect gift."
I had never heard or read the story. So many messages. It‚Äôs a blessing for ALL ages! I bought 6 for gifts and am getting ready to order more as gifts. The illustrations are very well done!
"The seller is incorrect about this book being useable. Being a retired kindergarten, and now grandmother, I have had books for nearly 47years and they do not look like this book. Books are meant to be cherished and taken care of.  This book is NOT satisfactory especially for the $8.34 it cost.  The seller that responded is from Rare Books and whom is on the online invoice.  Yet, the packaging is a bright green with Thrift Books all over the package.  I am not satisfied at all.!  I feel that even if I were to Lysol the entire book, it would not be satisfactory. This is upsetting because the story ‚ÄúThe Tale of Three Trees‚Äù is beautiful."
What a beautiful book my 6 year old and I love it!
Way over my 3 years head but she likes the story. I love the story. She will understand more as she gets older.
"I bought this book to read to my children, oldest age 5. This is such a wonderful book, it brought tears to my eyes. My 5 year old loves it, but it is a good book for all ages."
"A friend of mine read this to our Mom's group at Easter, and I told myself I had to get it for my kids (now 2 and 4).  I finally ordered it right before Christmas.  I absolutely LOVE this book.  I, of course, cry every time I read it.  It allows your children to ask questions about Christ and God's love for us.  It illustrates no matter what our dreams are, God knows them and will fullfill them in his own way.  What a wonderful way to teach that lesson to our children."
I already own this story and it is a family favorite. I got this one for my boyfriend's family. I hope they will love it too!
Good story and plan to give as a gift for Christmas. I have this book and thought the story would work well for a friends daughter.  Good message.
"Such a thoughtful, meaningful story! I give this book as gifts to children who are being baptized/dedicated, and I can't read it to my own kids without getting choked up!"
"We are using this story as the foundation for an Easter for Kids program this year.  The three trees each play an important part in the life of Christ, his birth, his life and miracles, and his death.  What a great way to tell the story of Easter from a unique perspective.  Aso a great reminder that God uses all of our labors, great or small, recognized or unrecognized by others, for his loving purpose.  Great book.  Have read it many times to my kids in the past."
"This is a GREAT book that really speaks of God's love.  I love reading it to my child.  The pictures are so sweet and the story is so rewarding.  Get it and read it over and over.  Especially nice for Easter, but always a perfect story.  I like to read it myself even when the kid isn't around..."
"I heard about this book on the radio and knew I had to get it. Our family sat around the living room while I read it to them this Christmas. We all loved the story. What a great book to read anytime, but especially at Christmas!"
"Wonderful story, it was in wonderful condition when I received it. No scratches, dents or tears!"
A great little book for Christmas and Easter. Delivery was fast. Great service.
Great book for your Christmas book collection.
This is a very inspiring book for teaching children about the bible.  Every parent should have a copy.  Also very inspiring for adults.
"This was introduced to me when I was a child...simple, beautifully written story that brings new perspective to the origins of Christmas. I dare you to get through it without tearing up.I purchased as a gift. Love the quality of the hardcover."
i love to give this book as a baby shower gift. all the parents i've given it to have come back to tell me they've read it to the other older kids and those kids love the book and ask for it to be read over and over. kids know the truth when they see it. i like reading it myself and bought a copy for myself.
An absolutely wonderful story. The kids in Sunday School loved it!
"This is one of the best children's books based on the bible,i have found.I plan on using at Easter for children's time."
EXCELLENT!
With out doubt this is a beautiful story . I have read it to my girls for a year and am touched every time. I bought extras to give out as gifts for others. To spread the glory of Jesus.
"this Bible without a doubt would've been a five star review for me...until I discovered all the missing scriptures out of the Bible. God's word should never to be altered nothing added, nothing taken away. In so disappointed. I can't use this Bible in good conscience. I'm so disappointed the art on this bible is beautiful and I have received so many compliments on it but thats the only thing I will say positive for it."
"I LOOVE this bible. Thick pages to highlight and take notes on, side space for notes and journaling. The red letter is perfect and I love the gold design on the pages. Exactly the Bible I was looking for!"
"This is a beautiful Bible, and there‚Äôs plenty of room to journal, but as crazy as it sounds, the font drives me so crazy I wish I had invested in a different journaling Bible. It might not bother most people, but it makes me feel a bit OCD with the little gaps in the letters. I already wrote in it or I‚Äôd return it."
"it‚Äôs so beautiful! i‚Äôm so in awe of it! very, very happy with this purchase, i can‚Äôt wait for my journey with it! :)"
"The design is perfect. The lettering on the cover is a rose gold foil. The flowers on the inside (same design front and back) is beautiful. There is also a hidden flower design on the edge of the pages. I say hidden because you can only see it if the book is open or if you look at it at an angle. I like the translation, font and room on the sides for writing. There are two ribbon page markers (light pink and a burgundy color). The only thing I would change is thicker pages considering this is a journaling Bible and is meant to be written in heavily. The pages are very thin and regular high lighters or pens would bleed through. I am using the mechanical pencils with colored lead and wax Bible highlighters."
Product came damaged. Very disappointed. Will be returning.
I love it it‚Äôs pretty and I like that it has space on side to write or doodle. But ink does go through pages and also it looks a lot more enhanced on photo looks nice and dark and when u get it it looks kinda more blue and washed out color like it‚Äôs been sitting out in the sunlight too long.
This bible is BEAUTIFUL! It‚Äôs so gorgeous. Great size too. Makes for a perfect gift or for yourself. I got a better deal buying it from here than any other website too!
"I love this bible. It has a nice feel to it, and it's super girly! The words are also a decent print. One thing I don't like is that IT doesn't have a word glossary in the back. My bible has a glossary where I can look up a word and it gives me verses that talks about that specific word. I am gifting this bible to my best friend, for her birthday who has never read the bible before. So, I would've liked for that to be in there, but overall, I love it!"
"I am so glad to have found this bible. It is so beautiful and matches my esthetic and style. I love that it has room for notes on each page and love that it has strings for page marking. I added rose gold tabs to each chapter and they hold up well on each thin page. While the pages are the standard thin bible pages, they work well with gel bible highlighters and the highlighter does not bleed through the pages.  I wish they made this bible in a KJV as there are some verses left out. Overall this is a great bible and I love how elegant and beautiful it is."
"My wife loves this bible. Easy to read, in current language and relatable ways"
Thus Bible is beautiful and I can read it very easily. I was worried about the font size but it‚Äôs perfect. My vision isn‚Äôt the greatest so I was worried but I‚Äôm truly happy with my purchase. I‚Äôm going to buy my mom one.
"This is such a beautiful bible. I love the colors, the pages and the two dividers are great! Amazing quality and design!"
Thanks for a beautiful book.. It is a nice surprise for my daughter.
I bought this as a gift and she was so excited to get it.  Wonderful quality.
"I purchased this Bible for myself and I absolutely love how the cover is so decorative, definitely my style. Anyone who sees it comments on how gorgeous it is. Plus, I love the words of Jesus are in red. Thank you for a quality bible."
Beautiful and such a wonderful gift to give a loved one. I would buy more as gifts as I love mine and bought my best friend one for Christmas. She loved it.
"I absolutely love the design, the note taking area on each page is great! It's easy to read and take with me anywhere I go."
"The best bible I have ever owned!! So gorgeous, very sturdy and I love how the pages are an off white to cream in color. I don‚Äôt like blinding white pages, so if this is an issue for you, you‚Äôll enjoy this as well. Pages are thick enough so you can‚Äôt see through and the font is 9.9 so very easy and clear to read."
"this bible is so beautiful! the pages are a little more yellow than i expected and the font can be a little distracting to some, but it‚Äôs perfect for me - highly recommend!!"
I LIKED EVERYTHING
"This Bible is stunning! The cover says, ""God is within her. She will not fall."" It's mass printed, but has a hand painted look and is designed by artist Edna Marie Esparra. The sides of the Bible are gold. The inside pages are typical of a Bible pages except it has wide margins with lines to make it easy for journaling and notetaking (no illustrations interspersed like the illustrated Bibles). The cover is smooth and shiny, with heavy cardboard (not bend-y like imitation leather Bible covers). Over time, I could see the edges of the covers getting bent or splitting over time, but that just means I should probably sew myself some kind of Bible cover or small tote to carry it in to protect those edges. It's a really, really minor issue for me with an otherwise lovely Bible that I'll be excited to use!This Bible is part of the Artisan Collection by Zondervan. There are four different covers (all different colors and different hand painted designs on each). I haven't seen those Bibles, but I'm assuming they are just as stunning as the pink floral cover. The navy succulent cover is my second favorite of the collection. Note: I got a copy of this Bible in return for me posting my honest review of the Bible."
"I selected this Bible for my wife as she is a fan of the NIV translation and I thought this attractive Bible would appeal to her. I was right. It is more than just a pretty reader‚Äôs version, though.I should mention up front that this is not a study Bible of any kind; there are no provided study notes, no cross references or anything like that. If you‚Äôre looking for a Bible that has a bunch of study aids or historical notes, this is not the Bible you want. However, what it does have is an area on every page for making notes and for writing. This is handy when you want to express your own thoughts about a passage, journal how a verse has ministered to you and more.The visual appearance of this Bible is probably the biggest selling point, and I would call it ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù in looks. The outer cover is cloth-covered cardboard and has a floral print pattern with a salmon background. The edges of the pages, though, are unique in that the flower pattern is visible in the gold edging when held at a slight angle.Opening this Bible reveals more surprises. In addition to the writing areas, the font Zondervan used for this is something they call ‚ÄúComfort Print‚Äù which I initially thought meant large print. While it is modestly larger than typical Bible print it is not large print in the typical sense; instead, the font has somewhat curvy, soft edges in spite of being a serif font and it is pleasant on the eyes. However, to me the fact that the pages are not blistering white but are instead an ivory color is what makes this Bible easy on the eyes and quite attractive, more so than the font itself.Instead of just one ribbon marker, this one has two, in two different colors. I have not seen any other Bible that has more than one and it is absolutely a welcome feature.This is a really nice Bible, geared toward women for the outward floral design and colors. It‚Äôs very distinguishable and the print is very easy on the eyes. It‚Äôs a perfect gift idea too, that is sure to be appreciated."
"This Bible is beautiful! I am writing with a 02 micron pen and there is no bleed through, and the highlighter cannot be seen at all from the other side. I love that it has 2 bookmarks and Christ‚Äôs words in red letter. So happy with it and excited to have my journaling/notes in the Bible instead of a separate notebook. The cover art (Navy floral) is stunning!"
"I got this bible for the purpose of bible journaling.  It won't work for that.  While the cover is pretty and the bible is well made and sturdy, the pages are antique yellow, so any pictures I draw and color on them will not look right.  The font is kind of weird too.  It's supposed to be an easy-read font, but I actually find it hard.  It's kind of a weird, abstract font that I find distracting.  It is also quite small.  There is quite a bit of ghosting of the print, on the pages, as well.  I do not like the antique yellow pages.  I would prefer a normal white page.The artwork down the edges of the pages is pretty.  There are nice, large, lined margins along the sides of each page.  Great for note taking or journaling (if you don't mind the yellow pages).  It's nice that there are 2 ribbon markers, each a different color, so you can mark different spots while reading or studying.Overall I give it 3 stars since it is well made and pretty and the margins and ribbon markers are nice touches.  I wouldn't recommend it though because of the page ghosting and weird, tiny print."
"This New International Version is unique in some ways.  The artsy cloth cover is nice (although I expected it to be more colorful and vibrant).  There are two ribbons included, a red and a yellow.  The paper is slightly sepia in color but the text is easy to read.  The paper is also thicker than other more expensive Bibles I have.  Jesus' own words are in red.  I love the foil gilded edges that are also subtly decorated with flowers.  Each page has about an inch and a half of on the edge for your notes.The only annoying thing is that it came in a box that is not properly protected.  The corners are  slightly mushed and it has some scratches on the gilded edge.  If this is intended as a gift, I would think twice before giving it."
"This beautiful Bible has a Victorian-style floral design on a pink cloth cover. The statement, ""God is within her, she will not fall,"" is stamped in metallic red lettering on the front. There's a floral pattern outlined in burgundy inside the front, along with a nameplate for the recipient. The pages are edged in gold and the same floral pattern is stamped onto them.  There are two ribbon bookmarks--one for the Old Testament, and one for the New.The scriptures inside are arranged in paragraph format with verse numbers. It has a nice, readable font, with the words of Christ in red. I love the lines along the outside of the text on each page which allow you to jot down comments, make notes, date a passage, mark cross references, etc. There are also several pages for notes in the back.For those just getting started studying God's word, the table of contents in front lists the books of the Bible in their actual order and alphabetically with page numbers where they start. There's an explanation of how the New International Version came to be at the front. There's a table of weights and measures at the back. There are a few cross references and footnotes on some pages, but not as many as I am used to.About the only things that are not ideal about this Bible is that the paper is thin enough to allow you to see the type from the back through the pages. I am guessing any writing or highlighting you do will show through, as well. In addition, this hard cover book is a bit heavy. The binding doesn't seem like it will last very long for someone who uses their Bible a lot.$50 isn't too bad for a specialty Bible like this. If you get it for the sale price of about $40, it's even better. This would make a nice study Bible for a young lady or an adult woman. You could give it as a graduation present, a Mother's Day gift, a birthday present, etc. Or a gal could treat herself to this classy study Bible."
"I love Bibles that allow one to either write her own thoughts or to draw something as a reminder of the verse(s) she has read.This Bible is BEAUTIFUL on the outside.  AN absolutely beautiful cover---kind of a hard back cloth.The inside was a bit of a disappoint to me.  For some, unknown, reason, I had a thought that there would be bigger spaces and places to write or draw and I thought there would be preprinted drawings throughout the Bible to color.  But,alas, I was incorrect.Oh, well.  It is still a wonderful Bible.The features of this Bible are listed above in the Book Description if you are interested in more features. And there are 1600 pages of God's Word.*This book was provided for review by BookLook*"
"There are many often widely different translations of the Bible. This is the NIV (New International Version) with a first copywrite in 1973. It does not rely only on the Bible texts used to translate the Bible in the past. It also uses other ancient versions. For example, with the Hebrew Bible, the Biblia Hebraica has marginal notations that offer variant readings found in some ancient Bibles. NIV sometimes uses these variant readings rather than the traditional text. NIV also states that it sometimes divides words differently than does the Masoretic Text, the traditional version, and this sometimes results in different meanings. The ancient Masoretic Text did not have vowels and NIV sometimes suggests using other vowels than used in other translations, resulting in a different meaning. Readings in the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Samaritan Pentateuch, and the Greek Septuagint are also sometimes used instead of the Masoretic Text. In the New Testament, the translators state that they use an ‚Äúeclectic‚Äù approach, sometimes using one ancient version and sometimes another. These differences are sometimes pointed out in notes at the bottom of the page. Modern English is preferred, as in Psalm 23, ‚ÄúThe Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing,‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúI shall not want.‚Äù"
"I love getting the opportunity to review new bibles.  There is just something about seeing God's word in a new design or in a new layout that brings a sort of freshness to His love story. I especially love seeing new journaling bibles, because I have really been wanting to take my study a bit deeper by taking notes or drawing in my bible so they make this part of my life a little bit easier.The NIV Artisan Collection Bible that Zondervan has just released is a beautiful journaling bible with  a stunning feel and look. I love that the bible itself is the NIV translation because that's the one I use the most and is the most widely used when it comes to the studies that I used in my women's Sunday school class. The cover and other little features are what caught my eye though and pulled me in.The copy that I received was the pink, hardcover edition. It it beautiful to say the least. It has a gorgeous bright pink cloth cover over hardboard and it's adorned with beautiful flowers and a reminder of God's love for you. But...when you open the bible you see all the little extras that make this an amazing gift bible for that special woman in your life.The publishers thought about all the small details that make this bible so easy to use and keep for years. In the margins of the pages there are lines for you to record your thoughts or draw pictures if you are into bible journaling. Normally with journaling bibles the print is super small, but not with this one. They even thought about making it easy for you to read because they print is a great point size and keeps you from straining your eyes. One of the other little features that I loved was the fact that there wasn't just one ribbon, but two. I know this might seem inconsequential to most, but I love being able to keep my place in two parts the bible, especially if I am studying something that has me referencing different sections, which I often do.I really enjoyed this bible and would highly recommend it for any woman who loves beauty in their life and loves to spend time in God's word. This would make a wonderful Mother's Day present as I know it would be treasured for many years.{Disclaimer: I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.}"
Accessible to children
"Absolutely LOVE my Bible! Sturdy and perfect for note-taking and drawing in the margins. The font size makes it easy to read, even with my bad eyesight. This Bible hasn't left my side since I've gotten it!!"
Please make them in other translations such as KJV! Thank you!
The cover looks worn.  And the font is too busy.  Makes reading difficult.
A beautiful Bible - the cloth over board cover with the beautiful art is so unique and beautiful.  The Bible is easy to read and I love the journaling columns.
A beautiful bible I got for my girlfriend. I added tabs and this is a forever gift.
"100% ABSOLUTELY LOVE love love love!!!! I ordered one for me and fell completely in love with it, that I had to order 2 more for family and friend!!!! They are in love as well. The binding, the cover and the pages are So wonderfully made!!!! And delivery was super fast!"

"The best ' primer ' for praying the Divine Rosary I have ever encountered after many years of daily Rosary Recitations. Having used a number ofTacts, Missles, Sunday Mass handouts etc. I converted to Mother Church over sixty (60) years ago after Catholic Instructions by members of TheSociety Of Jesus ( The Jesuits ). I still practice a zeal for Our Faith. Aside from The Sacraments, especially The Eucharist, I find personalprayer to clearly be the methodology leading to and remaining with our Savior and The Blessed Rosary is paramount. How wonderful it is to havethe beautiful PRAY THE ROSARY , the best guide have ever seen. Accordingly, I have purchased several that I am able to give to friends andrelatives---as well as to non -catholics who are deeply curious about our faith---who I have found simply LOVE this little guide book. KEEP UP THEGOOD WORK!!! Yours is a Godly profession!!"
"This is an easy to follow book with beautiful illustrations. The prayers and scripture readings are moving, inspirating, and healing."
Easy to follow.
Well done!
The booklet was beautifully done and very easy to follow. All the mysteries had lovely pictures and the prayers t were easy to follow when I lead the rosary each day. I would recomend  this book to anyone who prays the rosary.
"This book provides an excellent way to truly experience, not just ""say"" the rosary."
"I love this rosary guide.  We use it for rosary before mass. It is the perfect guide that not only includes the 4 mysteries but gives prayer intentions for each decade and scriptural meditations for each bead if you choose to use them. It is great for family rosary, too."
"simple but profound, a must carry !"
This book has scripture passages to pray along with the prayers.
Good book to have to help better understand the Rosary.  Explains the mysteries. Has pictures inside the book which helps people to have a visual.
"Very eye and heart opening as to our relationship WITH GOD. This is a good read for any believer at any stage although it requires reflection and meditation, keep pondering!"
"WITH opened my eyes to a new understanding of the love of God  and His purpose in coming to earth.  Everything has changed in my heart about Jesus and about loving others and about my value and identity. It may take a while and a second reading to assimilate what I have read,  but whatever it takes I am changing."
"I like the concept, but it doesn't grab me to keep reading. This was a book we read for a faith based business networking group"
"I really enjoyed the way this was written and how it challenged simple notions, but pushed me to think about my relationship to God differently."
This book has been missing from the library of so many believers.  We were raised in ‚Äúsystematic‚Äù views of God instead of actually living ‚Äúwith‚Äù him in all.  Can not recommend this book enough.
"This book has seriously been changing my life. For one, it has been helping me get to a root issue of something I have been working on my behavior in for over ten years. It has also been revolutionary for multiple other people I know, who have read it, and it has challenged them to have a totally different goal- God Himself. I can hardly read a few pages before I have to sit down, recognize how wrong I was, and ask for God's forgiveness, and then move forward with a changed worldview.Growing up in the FOR God culture, moving to the richest county in the United States (very FROM God) and then going to a church which was very (OVER God) - this book was revealing. Just look at my blog, http://www.AverageAdvocate.com to get an idea that I am often obsessed with mission and identity through that, which I have been working on for ages.  But it has also helped me have a clue why people whom I think would think like I do, as a Christian, still don't. I feel like it has empowered me to know how to respond when talking with other people.All to say, read it. But spend time to process it a lot, too!"
"This book will cause you to cringe at all the ways you try to manipulate or coerce God into giving you what you want at times, but it will also bring a tremendous amount of healing as you learn to really grasp the idea that God loves you. No, really. Not just as an abstract or generalized concept applying to all human beings created in His image, but intimately, personally, individually--He loves YOU and desires to be with you in relationship. As someone who has grown up knowing the Lord and often taking concepts such as God's love for granted, I found this book to be very encouraging and it helped me know the Lord much better."
I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. I thought it would just another book about how I better myself for God. But that‚Äôs not the idea behind the book at all. It‚Äôs about just being WITH God wherever you are
"I love the way how The author addresses the issue with all the postures. He started with the discussion of life under God over God, for God and from God. We were challenged to realize the right attitude or posture we should have as a Christian.This book teaches and reminds us that To live as a Christian is to live with God, to be in constant communion with God. From there we can live with faith, hope and love.This book is a real eye opener for me."
This is our favorite recent book about how God wants us to relate with him.  The writing is excellent.  He really describes different prepositional ways that we tend to relate with God in fascinating ways. It is so freeing
"Simply one of the best books I've ever read.  If you're an exhausted Christian then this should be the next thing you read.  Jesus sacrificed Himself on the cross to give us peace, rest and abundant life--not a list of rules to follow, ""quiet times"" to endure or check lists. Well written and doesn't misuse scripture to say what it doesn't say."
"I just finished reading this book. I would recommend it to anyone who has been a Christian for many years, or to someone who is new to the faith. Very helpful in seeing the bigger picture of who we are and how we relate to God."
"This book has made me aware of the pitfalls of life ""over""God, life ""under"" God, life ""from"" God and life"" for"" God.  The ultimate goal is life WITH God."
Thanks for putting into words the realities of our connection or lack thereof to God. I am inspired to move toward Him!
Skye has done a wonderful job at getting to the heart of the issue for spiritual reflection. Being one with God goes far beyond rules and regulations. Spiritual satisfaction and growth come from accepting a relationship with God through faith in His Son and His love. I highly recommend this book to anyone on a spiritual journey who is suffering from the insufficiency of meaningless religious traditions.
"This book opened my eyes to new ways to get closer and understand my faith and relationship with God. Well written, easy read, but extremely thought provoking and biblical."
"Skye takes a different approach on his new book. With, is more applicable to the everyday Christian or person seeking God. It is a refreshing look at how one relates to God, which is what the Christian life is all about, a personal relationship with Christ. A great read from an outstanding mind."
"I have been a born-again Christian for over 20 years, and have been a member of a great church that is committed to expository preaching, but I have never ""got"" life WITH God.I have lived out of each of the four postures, but this book, With, has given me a glimpse of what LIFE WITH GOD can look like.I was introduced to Skye Jethani by listening to the Phil Vischer Podcast - a group of friends who talk about life, culture, and LIFE WITH GOD."
This book helps you understand the correct way to relate to God and how we often get it wrong.  Very clear and helpful.  Paradigm shifting.
Challenged the way I think about my relationship to God. Really helped identify why we struggle so much with following Christ.
Skye addresses the 4 approaches people take in their relationship with God. But only one is biblical and a right relationship. The other approaches are idolatrous.
"Excellent book...loved it!  Very informative, couldn't put it down after the third chapter.  Many other people I know have read it also and really like this book too!"
"You ll be challenged with the way you view God. It's reminded me to live life with God taking allmy concerns, challenges throughout the day to Him . Well written."
This book is absolutely phenomenal! Every saint needs to read this book. It confirmed a lot that I have discovered lately and it also clarified some areas of confusion!
this bears reading again and again- can't give it a higher recommendation that that!
Skye is a great writer.  He can communicate deep insights using everyday expressions and examples.  He is worldly wise and spiritually rich.  The entire book will hold you but for me the last three chapters were life changing.
"Mr. Jethani very clearly shows us how we can live without fear in a ""God with us"" world. This is a theological stake in the ground. His book Futureville is a perfect sequel."
Skye Jethani carefully explains how selfish motives and consumerism often get in the way between us and God.
"This book was helpful in examining views of God, and focusing on what can hinder and hold us back. Good read, highly recommend."
This book will help anyone understand why faith is lived out in so many different styles. If your Christian walk seems unfulfilled this is a must read
"I must admit- I enjoy reading Christian non-fiction.  I have so many wonderful books!  Yet I do not value all of them the same, as some Christian non-fiction can be hit and miss.  That is why I was pleasantly surprised when With: Reimagining The Way You Relate to God sky-rocketed to the top of the list of my favorite books even before I had gone through more than a few chapters.  With addresses some concerns about Christianity that I feel often are not well-addressed or discussed in most circles.  This makes this book a novelty in some of its approach to relating to God.  The purpose of the book is to give a clearer picture of what it means to live ""with"", or ""alongside"" God- not just over, from, for and under.  The book goes into detail about what each of the postures in relation to God misunderstand about God and His nature.  I believe that this book will likely challenge you and compel you to re-evaluate the way that you relate to God.  I feel that it has brought me closer to God.  The content of the book is not complex, and neither is its message of living ""with"" God.  Yet somehow the author succeeds in creating a compelling case for why many of us miss out on some of the rewarding experience of living alongside our Creator, and how we can better understand and live out this idea.Disclosure: BookSneeze provided me with a complementary copy of With: Reimagining The Way You Relate to God by Skye Jethani in return for my honest review."
"Title: WithAuthor: Skye JetaniPublisher: Thomas NelsonDate: 2011In the first part of the book Jethani describes four common postures toward God:Life FROM God: People want God's blessings and gifts minus the interest in God himself.Life OVER God: People seek to discern proven principles and formulas for how God works. These principles and formulas can then be mastered to produce maximum benefit.Life FOR God: People are concerned with how best to serve God. God is often thought to require heroic acts of self-sacrifice and service in order to achieve significance and approval.Life UNDER God: People see God in terms of cause and effect. Obedience = blessing; disobedience = punishment. Proper moral behaviour is here thought to be the key to properly understanding and relating to God.Jethani argues that in each of these four postures, the desire for God Himself is substituted for some lesser thing: i.e. blessings, princples, mission, or morality. And while none of these ""are harmful or destructive in and of themselves"" each takes the place of knowing God. Each of the four approaches represents an attempt to figure out how God works, what God wants, and how best to respond. And so Jethani says ""fear and control are the basis for all human religion.""The second half of the book is a description of Life WITH God.""The LIFE WITH GOD posture is predicated on the view that relationship is at the core of the cosmos: God the Father with God the Son with God the Holy Spirit. And so we should not be surprised to discover that when God desired to restore his broken relationship with people, he sent his Son to dwell with us. His plan to restore his creation was not to send a list of rules and rituals to follow (LIFE UNDER GOD), nor was it the implementation of useful principles (LIFE OVER GOD). He did not send a genie to grant us our desires (LIFE FROM GOD), nor did he give us a task to accomplish (LIFE FOR GOD). Instead, God himself came to be with us - to walk with us once again as he had done in Eden in the beginning.""Jethani say that LIFE WITH GOD means treasuring God above all else. But that is only part of the picture: we also need to be united with God and experience God.In this second half, Jethani writes about Life With Faith, Life With Hope, and Life With Love.There are also two helpful appendices:Appendix A: Communing With God, which is a look at some spiritual practices.Appendix B: Discussing With Others, discussion questions for each chapter.In summary, Jethani argues, living with God (as opposed to under, over, from, or for God) is based upon the conviction that the qualities upon which the latter are predicated are temporary and will not endure. In God's new world, human beings will not constantly seek to manage, control, and manipulate relationships (with God or anyone else) in order to deal with the fear, uncertainty, and threat that dominate our current experience. In the new creation, God will be all in all, and love, not fear, will be the ultimate reality with which we have to deal. A powerful hope indeed'and one that we can anticipate and live into, as we strive to continually reimagine how we relate to God in the present.""Rather than stumbling in the darkness between forms of religion that are each under a variation of fear and control (LIFE UNDER, OVER, FROM, and FOR GOD), through Christ the lights are turned on and our attention is drawn to an entirely different vision - LIFE WITH GOD.""In short, ""WITH"" is an easy read, it is not an academic book, but it is an important reminder of what God invites us into, in an environment that often settles for far less than what is offered.I received the book With free from Thomas Nelson's BookSneeze program for my review. I was not paid to write this review."
"Insightful, Illuminating and readable are the words that I think best describe this book.  Jethani has focused on five tiny words---under, over, from, for, and with---to illustrate the different ways most of us relate to God.  Brilliant idea, I think.The writing is clear, thoughtful, and even touching from time to time.  He does not leaving you hanging with no recommendations for change and does go on in an appendix to give the reader a few ideas that he found helpful.  Nothing new there; we know what needs to happen, but a reminder certainly isn't out of order.You will find yourself identifying people you know, stages that you may have gone through, or even find yourself in the midst of now.  This book explains one of the major reasons for burn-out and disillusionment among Christians.I liked the inclusion of Loyola's examen and the brief explanation of that practice.  Made much more sense and is doable in Jethani's version.There is also a study guide for private or group study.  Good questions there.The negatives?  The chapter from  must have hit a bit too close to home maybe, but the tone changes and I found myself getting angry at the author.  Or it might just be me.  You'll have to decide for yourself.I do recommend this book.  Read it.  Don't put down for later, like I did.  You will regret that when you do finally pick it up to read.This book was provided to me by Thomas Nelson from the BookSneeze site for my review."
"God created humanity to live and rule with him, but because of our fear and our desire to control, we attempt to relate to God in other ways, according to Skye Jethani in this book. If we are living life with God, then God becomes the goal of our life; if we are attempting to relate to him in one of the other ways, then we are trying to use God to help us achieve other goals. The author identifies four other ways of relating to God:* When we try to use God to supply our material desires, we are living life ""from"" God.* When we try to secure blessings and avoid calamity in return for obeying God's commands we are living life ""under"" God.* When we try to run our lives without God or according to principles instead of in reliance on God, we are living life ""over"" God.* When we see our value as being defined by how much we accomplish in the way of Christian mission, we are living life ""for"" God.For the most part I found the author's analysis insightful and helpful. Some of the false ways of relating to God are so prevalent that they seem to be authentic, but when examined closely they turn out to be ways of trying to deal with fear or control our circumstances. However, I think the author went too far in taking a swipe at Andy Stanley for recommending the use of some secular leadership principles in churches. In my view the sin of trying to live life ""over"" God occurs when someone relies on principles as a substitute for relying on God. I believe that there is no necessary inconsistency between using principles and living life with God. I agree that the Bible exists to draw us into relationship with God and not as a self-help manual, but it is impossible to deny that the Bible contains many principles in the Proverbs, Sermon on the Mount and many other places.I also think that the author may have overstated the case against living life ""for"" God. Someone who is truly living life with God will be engaged in God's mission. That mission work sometimes flows out of pure love for God and it sometimes happens out of a sense of obligation. The author happily quotes Mother Teresa but fails to mention that she spent most of her life in a spiritual desert struggling to reignite her relationship with God.Notwithstanding these issues, I found the book to be challenging and well worth reading. I received a free digital copy from BookSneeze, but would have been happy to pay the full price."
"This was a really good book.  It attacks the misconceptions that we have about the Christian life.  Each of these misconceptions that Jethani talks about has some element of truth, but ultimately falls short of how a Christian is supposed to live their life--with God, not under, over, for, from, or for God.  Sometimes, I find myself drifting more towards a life for God.  As Christians, we are called to serve God and to glorify His name, but our ultimate goal is not God's mission, but God Himself.  The most important thing is our relationship with Him.  Yes, we have morality, a heavenly mission, theology, and blessings from God.  But we can't put these good things in a position above God Himself.  Because then they are idols and we are rebelling against God.  Jethani believes that most American churches try to convert people from living life from God to living life for God--consumer to producer (Jethani compares it to the prodigal son (from God) and his older brother (for God).  Many times, we fail to see that the older brother is just as wrong as the younger.  Our main goal is living life with our heavenly Father.  That is the deepest satisfaction that we will ever experience.  I would recommend this book to every Christian.  It is a wake-up call for the church.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze¬Æ.com <[...]¬Æ.com> book review bloggers program.

"With: Reimagining the Way You Relate to God, the new book by Skye Jethani, senior editor of Leadership Journal and an ordained minister, is one of those books that's simply profound or profoundly simple, depending on how you look at it. Jethani's premise is that there are four common religious postures toward God that Christians uncritically assume, and that in assuming these postures we miss relationship, the one posture that matters most.""Each of the four popular postures has a different way of seeing the universe. LIFE UNDER GOD sees the world as governed by the capricious will of God. LIFE OVER GOD places immutable natural laws at the center. LIFE FROM GOD assumes the world orbits around the self and its desires. And LIFE FOR GOD sees a divine mission at the core of all things... The LIFE WITH GOD posture is predicated on the view that relationship is at the core of the cosmos: God the Father with God the Son with God the Holy Spirit. And so we should not be surprised to discover that when God desired to restore his broken relationship with people, he sent his Son to dwell with us.""Most Christian ministries, Jethani argues, focus most of their energies trying to move people from one preferred posture to another -- under, over, from or for God -- rather than truly inviting people into relationship with God. He puts his finger on two culprits that lead us to embrace these postures and forfeit the opportunity to truly experience life with God:""Fear and control are the basis for all human religions. From this common beginning the paths diverge dramatically, splinter, multiply, and finally terminate in different places. But each one is an attempt to overcome suffering, fear, and death by exerting control over natural, and sometimes supernatural, forces... [The four postures] apply equally to religious paths other than Christianity. Each of these ways of relating to God is also an attempt to mitigate our fears through exerting control. But the problem... is that they all fail to deliver on this promise. The reason, simply put, is that seeking control is not the solution to the human condition but is part of the problem.""For my part, the religious posture towards which I'm prone is life for God, believing that God calls me and calls us to be doers, to be reweaving, wherever we are, a bit of the fabric of shalom that has come undone as a result of the Fall. And I do believe that to be true. But if taken exclusively it costs us something. Whatever the emphasis, it seems to me that life for God is particularly pervasive within church circles, and is all the more insidious because it's dressed up as godliness when it's really little more than busyness, which is hardly a virtue.So I'm grateful for this book, for shining the light on our unexamined postures. I think that Christians of all stripes will find themselves in these pages, recognizing the posture(s) to which they're prone. As for me, I'm reminded that yes we're called to be doers, but first, we're invited to be with, trusting that with God in control we have nothing to fear.[...]"
"How do you relate to God?Is He the Great commander giving us laws to live by or one we feel we are obligated to serve? Is He the Almighty Genie in the sky?I know in my heart what I am supposed to believe about God, but find myself many times operating with an entirely different set of images that affect my relationship with the Lord.With - Reimaging the Way you Relate to God is a new book by Skye Jethani. The tag line intrigued me:  ""Stop living your life under, over, from, and for God and start living in communion with Him.""Jethani describes five postures that Christians often take toward God because of the way they view Him. He writes a chapter on the four most common ways: under, over, from, and for.""Life under God sees the world as governed by the capricious will of God. Life over God places immutable natural laws at the center. Life from God assumes the world orbits around the self and its desires. And life for God sees a divine mission a the core of all things.""The second half of the book expands on living WITH God, which builds on our relationship with God as the foundation. Whereas the other approaches use God in some manner, life WITH God, the goal, our deepest desire is God.A weakness in the book is when Jethani expands living WITH God section, it is more theoretical than useful. He adds on an appendix at the end on how to implement this concept more as an afterthought. Most readers I would think would like more of the practical applications earlier in the book.I would recommend this easy to read book that is full of stories and quotes as a great way to spark conversations within a small group about relating to God. In the back of the book there are discussion questions that would benefit a small group.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze book review bloggers program.

"Skye Jethani's With: Reimagining The Way You Relate to God was my first book through the BookSneeze review program, and I'm honestly glad I found the program and this book on it. You see, this is one of the more mind blowing books I've ever read - which is saying something, considering I've read books such as Ted Dekker's Circle Series and most books Bill Myers has put out.If you want to quit reading this review now, I'll leave you with this: READ THIS BOOK. You will NOT regret it.Some details:Mr. Jethani - an editor of a leading Christian magazine - uses the first half of the book to talk about the four basic ways most of us relate to God:Life UNDER God is basically what I call ""Talibaptists"", though Mr. Jethani never gets CLOSE to using that word. These people believe that we must live life strictly by the Bible and that if we don't, we're doomed.Life OVER God essentially uses the Bible as a divine ""how to"" manual, nothing more, nothing less. These are the people that keep the ""self help"" authors in business.Life FROM God sees God as a divine bank account that can never run out. This is the consumer culture variant of Christianity.Life FOR God sees life as a mission. These people will go to Outer Mongolia at the drop of a hat - and still miss the point.In each of the first four chapters, Mr. Jethani delves into each of these first four ways of relating to God, and shows both their strengths (yes, they have them), and their critical weaknesses.In the remainder of the book, Mr. Jethani describes a life WITH God, what it looks like, and why it is the epitome of a Biblical understanding of our relationship to God. While I've tweeted a lot of amazing quotes from this book, you'll just have to read it to see them for yourself, as well as the remaining treasure trove I simply couldn't tweet out for many reasons.In my Kindle edition, the appendices began at roughly 80% or so, and included both a discussion on some ""how to pray"" techniques as well as a brief discussion guide for the book. Overall, the only weakness that I saw - though it was a bit glaring - was that when I hit the appendices, I was still looking for a more succinct summation chapter than the one we got.Overall, a VERY strong book, and I would give it a 5/5 without any hesitation at all.Now time for some legalese:Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the [...] book review bloggers program.

"There are many different ways that people choose to relate to God. Even in Christianity the way a person carries out their relationship with God will vary from person to person.  I don't think this is the way that God intended for His relationship with us to work. He made a garden so that He could walk with us, and we went and screwed that one up. Then He gave His life for us on the cross so that our sins wouldn't keep us from being able to walk with Him. All throughout the Bible we see a theme of God wanting to be amongst His chosen people. God wants to do life WITH us. This idea of doing life WITH God is the whole premise of Skye Jethani's book WITH. Jethani's discusses that five main ways that Christians choose to approach how they relate to God. We align ourselves to God choosing these various prepositions and that becomes our philosophy. Sadly, it would seem that the majority choose to do life For God, Under God, Over God, and From God, rather than with Him, as He truly intended and desires. There is so much pain and turmoil in the world today, and the lives of Christians are no exception, but in most cases this is because we have a wrong perception of who God really is, and how we are to relate with Him. In relationship WITH Him is the only place that we will find unwavering faith, unrelenting hope, and unconditional love. Every Christian is meant to live life with this three things overflowing within them, yet how many actual do? I know that I don't. While reading Jethani's book I decided that I want to truly live my life with God. In no other way will I find any sense of meaning, purpose, or fulfillment. Only in being with God can I be who He created me to be because I was created to be with Him. I definitely would recommend this book to anyone."
"In the book With: Reimagining the Way You Relate to God, Skye Jethani aims to point Christians into to ideal relationship with God - starting with the preposition we use in relation with Him.  The author first points out how life under, over, for, and from God all fall short of the best relationship God would have with us.  In these chapters, most readers will probably find at least a portion of their spiritual posture before the Lord.Jethani continues, however, and explains both why and how we can walk with God in life.  Arguing that God is not superstition to be appeased, a puppet to be controlled, a taskmaster, nor a celestial Santa Claus, we are shown the relationship God wants for us. The author takes care explaining each position - as well as why each doesn't measure up, before jumping into an explaination of life with God.  I found the illustrations to be helpful, as well as the examples of each position.Overall I enjoyed this book, however I was a little uncomfortable with the last section.  After explaining why we shouldn't just do things for God, Jethani gives the readers a list of ways live out the with.  While I find application points helpful, this section of the book could be seen as ritualistic - presisely what the author is trying to stear his readers away from.Now for the legal portion of the review:Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze¬Æ.com [...] book review bloggers program.

"I received an advance copy of this book from the publisher for the purpose of review.With is a thoughtful look at what life looks like in five different ways of relating to God. Life from God, Life under God, Life over God, Life for God, and Life with God. Jethani seeks to help Christians understand why so few experience the life of freedom in Christ.Skye does a good job illustrating each way of relating to God. The author brings out both examples and principles from the Bible to assist in explaining the problems, benefits, and results of each way of relating to God. However, I grew weary of looking at these. From the beginning of the book it is clear that ""life with God"" is the ideal relationship. Once I understood what the other ways of relating looked like and how they fell short of the abundant life in Christ, I wanted only to be more encouraged to know what a life with God looks like. The first half of the book could have been halved and the latter half doubled. Also, while the writing is clear, it lacks passion. I longed to get excited with Jethani about the life with God. Instead I felt a bit like I was reading a textbook. Overall the book was good, but I would only recommend it to those who enjoy classroom type reading."
"Skye Jethani has broken down our relationships with God.  According to him, most people are in one of these categories:Life Under God, Life Over God, Life From God and Life For God.He explains each of these different ways that we commune with God throughout his book.  Jethani also includes illustrations that he has come up with to help those who learn visually and they are added to help you learn yourself or explain to someone else.One of my favorite quotes that are on the book is by Margaret Feinberg, the author of Spiritual Rhythm.  She says:  You can't read this book and not see yourself and others differently!There are some points in this book that I am not sure that I agree with.  And I will admit that there were some times when I was confused on the point that was being made.The book includes Appendix A and B with some very useful information in those sections!  Appendix A is written on communing with God.  Appendix B is a discussion section that includes questions for you to discuss with others in a group setting or with a friend.  You could also discuss those questions with yourself for further growth if you don't have another person to read it with!I received this book for free from Booksneeze.com in exchange for my own opinions."
"Jaded by an industry inundated with oversimplified expressions of the Christian life, and being unfamiliar with Jethani's work, I received With: Reimagining the Way You Relate to God with more than a few hesitations. Contrary to what I thought would be my initial sentiment (that this would be yet another published rendition of a pastor-wanna-be-author's latest preaching series), I was drawn in after only a few paragraphs through which Jethani displayed a convincingly thoughtful grasp of the human condition and the philosophy of religion. ""With"" is one of five postures Jethani contends that humans assume when relating to God - from, for, under, and over being the other four. In short, Jethani explains that each posture, excepting ""with,"" is merely an elaborate expression of control, which he describes is humanity's attempt to displace fear and suffering - two forces that, when combined with control, are the foundations of all human religions, so Jethani poses. ""With,"" for Jethani, is the only posture that ultimately extricates fear (with love), provides meaning for suffering, and retools control into faith, a combination of experiences that also answers questions regarding our identity.I thoroughly appreciate Jethani's ability to write unpretentiously about human behavior as it is influenced and informed by religious experiences. As I did, most readers will see in Jethani's postures a sobering reflection of themselves and their communities while realizing the wounding potential of displacing God in favor one's self, natural law, religious principles, or even a divine religious mission as is often the case in many fervent Christian communities. Beyond the thesis of his book, Jethani is an articulate writer, able to engage his audience with respect and humility. He refrains from shtick, his analogies are not overbearing, he is semantically precise and able to stay on track. Overall, With is a well-written and responsible interpretation of the human experience through a Biblical lens - one through which readers are invited to view relationship with God in a way that counteracts our tendencies to scheme against fear and suffering in ways that are controlling and manipulative.Recommended for anyone looking for something meatier from the ""Christian Living"" section.I received this book free from the publisher through the  () book review bloggers program.

"I read most of Jethani's ""With"" in one sitting, and for me that's something.Jethani describes five postures that Christians often take toward God because of the way they view him.  Life UNDER God sees God as a fickle creator who will bless or curse us depending on if we have followed his set of rules.  Life OVER God follows the thought of the Enlightenment that says that the universe runs on set laws, so life must as well.  As long as we follow some formula, we can have a great Christian life- no God needed.  Life FROM God is the attitude that God is solely our provider, a commodity which has its value in what we get from it.  Life FOR God, while looking very admirable, is seeking significance from service toward him, and the ""mission"" becomes more important than God himself.The last posture is Life WITH God.  We should desire God not for his use to us, but for who he is.  As a Christian, ""With"" helped me identify problems in my way of relating to God, but it also gives a very clear presentation of what Christianity should look like that non-Christians need to hear.I received a free copy of this book from Booksneeze.com and am not required in any way to write a favorable review."
"Jethani wants his readers to experience life with God, but first he has to clear the field of four insufficient ways people relate to God. Some people see God as a giver of rules and rituals to follow (LIFE UNDER GOD), or the provider of useful principles to observe (LIFE OVER GOD), or as a genie to grant us our desires (LIFE FROM GOD), or as a commander sending us forth to accomplish a mission (LIFE FOR GOD). Each of these ways of relating to God has its place, of course (we are to ask God to meet our needs and God does send us into service, for example). But UNDER, OVER, FROM, and FOR--none of these prepositions alone can adequately define the relationship to God we're meant to have as well as the preposition ""with."" It's LIFE WITH GOD that we're being called into. Readers will immediately see themselves in one of the four inadequate ways of relating to God (mine was ""LIFE FOR GOD""), and will remember again that there is more to discover. (My copy of With was provided by the publisher through my membership in BookSneeze)"
"I highly recommend this book. My advice: Buy it! Read the first chapter, and if it speaks to you commit to reading the whole thing. If it doesn't, put it on a shelf and come back to it in a couple of years!I was so excited to get to the ""Life WITH God"" part of the book! The resources in the appendix were very helpful."
"One of the more formative books in my faith journey. At a time when I was wrestling with certain aspects of God ‚Äì¬†the book was a catalyst to bring the phrase ""God With Us"" from an idea in my head to a truth and understanding in my heart and spirit. It was a total paradigm shift from me living FOR God to living WITH Him. Another powerful piece was the Danger-Fear-Control cycle I had seen many times in my life, in very subtle but debilitating ways. I've read it 3-4 times and would recommend highly recommend it to anyone else."
"It will show you how we are supposed to be in constant prayer with God and that we shouldn't just think of God as a get out hell free card.  In the beginning the author tells you about 4 different people and how their relationship with God is, 1 person believe since she worships God that nothing bad should ever happen to her, another believe that she shouldn't go to medical school and become a missionary because that is what God would want. He explains about the 5 different relationships anyone can have with God (Life over God, Life under God, Life from God, Life for God and Life WITH God). This book will have you examining your relationship and how to grow a better relationship with Him. I truly believe everyone should read it! Also, at the end of the book the author gives questions so you can ask yourself or do a study group and have discussions. I received this book from BookSneeze, I was NOT required to give a positive review."
"Skye Jethani presents a view of five postures that allow people to live lives near God.  According to Jethani, four of these postures permeate the Christian life.  Jethani believes the fifth posture to be what God desires in relationships with humans.Life Under God and Life Over God, the first two of these postures, are rooted in the same behaviors but have different motivations.  The first compels us that if we follow God's rules, we will be blessed.  The second states that if we control God by following his rules, we can get what we want.Life From God and Life For God also possess similar characteristics (This is the reason most churches try to move people between these two types of life to experience God).  Life from God recognizes that we get all of our life from him and so we should serve him.  Life for God says that  we should live our lives for God because of what he has done for us.Life with God means that we begin to treasure just being with God more than we can use Him to get (pg 110).  I think this book completely boils down to attitude.  What kind of attitude do I have toward God?  How am I living with Him?My issue with this book...I did not like or dis-like this book.  I am just confused by it.  Jethani uses prose that is hard to understand and difficult to decipher.  His basic premise requires us to look at heart motivations (which is good) but discounts a growth process.  We do not necessarily need a reimagining as much as we need to grow up.  When we come to God, our perceptions of Him say more about us than they do about Him.  As we read Scripture and grow, we realize that God is bigger than we think.I really cannot recommend this book to anyone who has recently come to their faith.  As someone who loves discipling people, I had such high hopes that were never realized in this book."
"Clearly written for the non-theologian, this book is a real gem! I now understand why God created me to live WITH Him in constant communion and how fear melts away replaced by Faith, Hope, and Love. I also got a clearer understanding of why many people get lost in the rules of ""religion"" and live a fear based life or chuck God out of their lives. Principles include Life under God, Life over God, Life from God, Life For God, and Life with God. I highly recommend this book and am going to buy several copies for family and friends."
"I never heard of this author until a friend recommended this book. I must say, this a pretty astounding book to stumble across.The basic premise of the book is that there are five ""postures"" of life in relationship to God: Life over God, life under God, life from God, life for God, and life with God. He details everything wrong with religion (including Christianity) with the first four prepositions in relation to God:1) Life over God is an attempt to make life controllable - follow certain principles and God will automatically bless you. ""The mystery and wonder of the world is lost as God is abandoned in favor of proven formulas and controllable outcomes."" The ""Church is a business"" mentality fits nicely into Life over God. 2) Life under God ""sees God in simple cause-and-effect terms - we obey his commands and he blesses our lives, our families, or nation."" Just find what God wants and do it so God will do good things for us. 3) Life from God is essentially an interest in God only to gain benefits from Him, not God Himself. How God can bless me is the first concern. Health and Wealth/Prosperity Teachers view God like this. 4)Life for God is a posture bent on serving God in some way, working hard for him and being ""expended accomplishing great things in God's service."" God himself is lost for the sake of the work.The book points out the flaws in making these four postures the primary postures in life toward God, and advocates for the fifth posture - life with God. Adam and Eve were created to be with God, but the fall severed this. Then the whole story from Genesis to Revelation is God reconciling humankind back to being with Him as companions again. Jesus died and resurrected for us that we may be with him. Revelation ends with God dwelling with his people forever. Life with God is the point.Positives:The fundamental premise of the book is so appealing: God wants a relationship with us. This isn't something a posse of postmoderns cooked up; it's a very ancient, biblical idea. It is amazing how frequently ""with"" and God are coupled together in the Bible. I noticed this little preposition more in my Bible reading since starting this book, and God ""with"" people is definitely very common.At one point in the book, Skye spends some time on the ""New Atheists,"" writing that they're really attacking these other religious postures, but refuse to grapple with the idea that God desires to be with us. Many objections to the Christian way and oddities in the Bible are given a hearty rejoinder when you have this perspective (as I'm finding from reading The Christian Delusion alongside With, but that's for another day).So many parts of this book are just beautiful. I loved the chapter ""Life with Hope."" He brings out the ancient imagery of the sea representing darkness, chaos, and evil -- then how God demonstrated His power over these forces, whether by saving Noah's family from the flood or opening up the Red Sea for the people of Israel.This book is more than about the various postures people have toward God and the one you should have. It is a book about what God is like. It portrays God as an incredibly Grand Character, whose love is big, whose desire for a real friendship with us is deep, who is the kind of friend we really need. And when you see what an incredible Being God really is, the correct posture - with God - is easier to slip into.Negatives:I think he left out some qualifiers in discussing the various postures. Some of them are clearly found in the Scripture - people are to live lives for God (2 Corinthians 5.15), and under God (1Peter 5.6). Those are completely valid prepositions to describe human relationship with God. Yes, God's goal may be ""life with God,"" but this is accomplished to its fullest by living our life on purpose for God, submitting under God, etc. I wish Skye made this clearer.For example: the ""Life over God"" people's focus on principles. He criticized the view that if we follow xyz principles found in the Bible, God will automatically bless us. He contends the Bible is NOT a book of mere principles. Skye is right, but the Bible does contain principles! Cursory reading of Deuteronomy, Proverbs, and Pslams reveals this. Principles aren't bad. The problem becomes when we make it all about principles and not about God. God has ordained reality to be a certain way, and many principles are generally true even when practiced by pagans. For instance, the Bible contains principles for a strong family. The early Roman Republic didn't have the Bible but still gained a great and strong empire, in part because they so happened to follow good family principles.Also, there's repetition and a great bit of overlap between the four postures. A lot of times the chapter on ""Life over God"" sounded a lot like the chapter on ""life from God."" But this is not a big deal. He's using these phrases as a simple but powerful teaching tool, and there is a good bit of overlap in these concepts anyway.Last, some parts really could have used more interaction with the biblical text. For instance, he has a marvelous section on how eternal life's experience starts now, not when we die. He could have looked at John 5.24 or 11.25, or at least put it in parenthesis to back it up.But in the end, I highly recommend reading it. It's a book you will want to read."
"The book is titled ""With: Reimagining the Way You Relate to God"" and it's written by Skye Jethani. I didn't know anything about the book. I assumed it was about how we relate to God in every situation, which happens to be correct...However, the book goes deeper than that. Jethani first dissects four ways we typically view God: ""Life Under God"", ""Life Over God"", ""Life From God"", and ""Life For God"". This foundation accounts for 74 pages, which is roughly half of the book (excluding appendices). After that, the rest of the book is dedicated to ""Life With God"".Jethani goes into great detail of events that have shaped our culture and how it's affected how we view God. I appreciated that Jethani was able to use relatively current examples -- some as new as 2010. The book remained balanced by including historical examples as well.It was the extreme level of detail that I have criticism. I felt that the author was just trying to fill pages. The overall layout was very solid, but the underlying examples seemed scattered.I feel that the author could have conveyed the same message by choosing less, but related, examples. Most people may actually like the level that Jethani has gone into, and someday I may appreciate it as well. Even though the book was short it seemed to have taken longer to read that expected.I rate this book at 3 out of 5 stars, since it is relevant and contains useful information to restore us to a better relationship with God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This book has the potential to be on available on store bookshelves for years to come."
"If you've been raised in an American Christian household, this book explains familiar attitudes that try to control God but leave us feeling empty because fear is still the basis for belief in Him (just don't want to go to hell/just want Gods blessings & not a curse...).  I never read a book so compelling as to drive me to read the Bible with expectation & see God/communion with Him in a new way."
"Worth a read for everyone in the church today. It's not new thoughts, but the author does a great job of articulating them and effectively calls out the alternatives to true pursuit of the father. These are put together with clear examples.Compelling quick read."
"With: Reimagining the Way You Relate to God By Skye JethaniThis book raises important issues about how we relate to God, but does not address them well.I think that the example of the Roman tomb is interesting but I am not sure what the point is.I did not see the point about Mark, a pastor who reads business books.I also did not see the point about Karen, the woman who wants to go to medical school.The story of the eunuchs, I also did not understand.I would expect more biblical references.My rating is 3 stars of 5.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the [...] book review bloggers program.

Very good book and give a good perspective of how We interact with God
Paradigm-shifting
A very thought provoking book; very readable with excellent examples of how one relates to God.  Highly recommended.
"Religion comes from Greek terms meaning ""reconnection."" Appropriately, all faiths have a final end of connecting with whatever god they teach about.  Christianity is no different except how that reconnection takes place.  The full testimony of the Bible, from cover to cover, is about the work of God, through his Son Jesus Christ, to redeem the world that, lost in sin, is completely unable to find that reconciliation alone.In his book titled simply With, Skye Jethani challenges the way that many even in Christianity attempt to establish a relationship with God that is not in line with the story in the Bible.  He describes these alternative, and what he assesses as ineffective, methods to seek for God and finally offers the solution for a relationship with God.Finding relationship over, from, and for God are all self-centered ways to have a relationship.  Jethani suggests that each of these begins with a person trying to find significance from God or get their needs met by God.  In many ways, even though it often involves the best of intentions (especially in efforts to live for God), it becomes more about what we can get out of the relationship.Likewise, (and this next point I have issue with) he also thinks that a life under God is a wrong way of going about it.  The way he describes it, I agree with Jethani, but his discussion is fully inadequate.  He suggests what I would describe as a life lived under the law, not under God.  It would be a tragedy for anyone to think that our faith is about living by the rules so that God will be pleased.  Christianity is nearly the opposite: Jesus came to fulfill the law because we are fully incapable of doing so.  By his work we are saved not only because we are forgiven, but because God accepts Jesus' righteous life in place of our own.  Essentially when God looks at us he sees his Son.Even though we are not responsible for it, God's Law is to be followed.  While as Christians we do not live under the burden of the law, we are still called to live a moral and righteous life.  This righteousness of our own making can never be perfect, but it is a sure sign that the Holy Spirit is alive and active in our regeneration.  We do live under God, not under his law.As I read each chapter and learned what Jethani thinks about living life under God, over God, from God, and for God, I began to get nervous about what he would say about living a life with God.  Unfortunately, what I found in the final chapter was not at all what I have described here as the essential truths of Christianity.With, according to Skye Jethani, involves as series of meditative and mystical practices including lectio divina, which is essentially Bible fishing alone and in a comfy chair in hopes that some sort of enlightenment will come. The problem with mystical practice is that it encourages one to find God within and develops a different set of criteria for relationship with God apart from the work of Christ.  I have no doubt that some will object to my position, commenting that this kind of practice does not take the place of Christ's work, but supplements to a more full ""experience"" of God.I must, then, say that I have come back from that practice, which seemed so enticing but ended up leading down a road of despair and confusion.  Instead of living a life with God, this practice quickly becomes a life built in effort to live under, over, or even from God as the individual tries to find this amazing experience that is at times felt, but does not offer the reality or fulfillment that was promised.God came in human flesh to be with us.  He left his throne to have a relationship with us.  He lived in our sinful world to be with us.  He stood under temptation to be with us.  Jesus became sin even though he knew no sin to be with us.  He willingly laid down his life so that he could be with us.  Christ resurrected from the dead to be with us.  He send the Holy Spirit to dwell with us.  What more could we possibly do?Rest in the finished work of Christ.  And respond by living in the light of his love, which cannot possibly leave you the same."
One of the best books I have read in a long time.
"A beautiful little book.  Easy to read, comfortable, thoughtful and deep but so clearly written.  Anne Lindbergh had a remarkable way of relating.  I ordered 8 copies and gave them to my dearest friends and family members.  After 50 years, it still has so much to offer for anyone, but especially for women.  I think every young woman starting out in life could benefit, and you could easily read it in a weekend, or even a long, lovely, lazy day."
"I have had my copy since the early 80's, this book is timeless. With renewed interest,  I bought several copies for friends after reading The Aviators Wife, A book about the Lindbergh's.  Giving one to a bride who is having a beach themed wedding.  Love the introspect about relationships and family."
"Your experience with this book will be like everything else in life - it depends on the attitude you bring. I think most people will find this book full of profound meditations on what it means to be an American woman, most still as true today as they were when she wrote them in 1955. This is one of those books that you can read over again at different ages and stages in your life and find totally new gems that you missed before.I picked this up after reading¬†

  
The Aviator's Wife: A Novel









  
  
    
  , because I wanted to know more about Anne Morrow Lindbergh, who was perpetually in the shadow of her famous husband."
"""Patience, patience and patience is what the sea teaches"" What a poetical expression An enlarged photograph of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Lindbergh is placed at a photo store in Karuizawa. Karuizawa is one of the most luxury summer resort in Japan. Ms. Anne Morrow Lindbergh's photo image seems to fit this essays."
"This is a book you want to keep and re-read over and over again. Ms. Lindbergh uses seashells to illustrate life-long experiences, very relative to our lives today, to symbolize feelings and understanding of our emotions. It's a quick read but one you'll ponder over for days and weeks."
This book was recommended to me and I am glad they did! It was a great read and reminds you to stop and slow down. Would recommend for any women who are stretched thin.
The book is not what I wanted. Plus I do not find instructions on how to return the digital book. Very frustrarting.
This is one of those books that speak to your heart for a lifetime. I have it in hardcover but wanted to carry it on Kindle wherever I go.
"It's remarkable how relevant and timely a book written over 60 years ago can be today. Through simple analogies using seashells as metaphors for life, the author provides us with a design for living that reverberates in me every time I re-read the book, which I do several times a year."
Read The Aviator's Wife first which tells the entire story of Anne Morrow Lindbergh and talks about her writing this book. Then reading this will make more sense and inspire awe in that she can speak so well of what marriage is about when you know how difficult her marriage was.  I think she was way ahead of her time.
A perfect little book for morning meditation. Many women would identify with the need for space to regroup thoughts and revive your spirit.
I got this as a gift for a co-worker.  This is a book you can re-read as it has so many wonderful views and ways to look at life and how to be happy within yourself and maintain balance in all areas without being preachy.
"Loved it. Author really got into the minds of women with her imagery of the sea and its surrounding objects ( sand, shells, tides, etc.)'published in 1955, the author established her own legacy as a writer independent of her famous husband, Charles Lindberg. It now sits on my cherished books/authors shelf in my house."
"I have read this book over 5x times and every single time I see something in the book in a completely different perspective. The way this book is written, gives me a sense of calmness and harmony.  I've made a conscious effort to gift this book to all the most important women of my life."
Loved this book‚Äîtold many family and friends to read it!
"I related to several points or ""shells"" in this book. I have felt the need to simplify for some time now. As a career woman I also feel the pressures of taking on more of the outer strengths of males. I can also recognize that I need to create more and spend more time just replenishing so I have enough in my cup to give away to others without depleting myself to exhaustion. This book was writer when my mother was a child but the words are still relevant for women today."
"This is a great book for all women of all ages. Even though it was written many years ago, her writing and her ideas stand the test of time!!"
Bought these as gifts and they worked great.
Written over 50 years ago and still relevant today for both men and women to read. She was literally a forward thinking person.
"What a beautiful book! Anne Morrow Lindbergh has truly captured the essence of simplicity. As our lives grow increasingly more busy every day, this book is truly a gem that reminds us of the beauty and the peace that comes when we pause and allow our hearts and our souls time to breathe. This book is an easy ready and not very long, but each chapter is a soothing respite for a busy soul. I've given this book as a gift and recommended it to many others. A favorite!"
Wonderful book for busy women. Great beach read and/or gift for a bridal shower!
I loved this book. It‚Äôs timeless and I love how it connects life to the beach. Would highly recommend.
AS DESCRIBED
I found many sentences that could have been written today. Here we are 60 years later and this book still speaks to the issues men and women face. We are no closer to the answers. The questions are still with us. A brilliant summary of the problems faced in modern life. No cure but a program to live by.
A beautiful book - particularly for those who love to be at the sea!
Waterstained cover and jacket.  Jacket ragged and dirty.
"I read the Aviator's Wife first and loved this story about Anne Lindbergh. I ordered this book and I've taken the time to read a few pages at a time to savory the book. It's very short and an easy read so you could finish it quickly if you wanted. I like imagining Anne on Captiva Island off the coast of Florida, isolated and reflecting on her life as she wrote. Really enjoyed the book."
"Love this story, where it takes me while reading,, extra special being written the year I was born, meaningful gift for dear childhood friends turning 65 this year!"
"When I left home for college in 1978, my mother gave me a copy of this book.  Some twenty years before, her mother gave her a copy of Anne Morrow Lindbergh's sweet musings of life as a woman.  A few years ago, I bought a copy of Gift From the Sea to give to my own daughter who was leaving home for the first time.  That this book speaks to multi-generations is part of its allure.  People from my mother's generation will recall the Lindbergh's public tragedy of a kidnapped and murdered son.  Although AML doesn't speak of this in her book, the knowledge of this awful event and what it must have meant to the author colored my perspective as a reader, adding to my respect for her essays.  Gift from the Sea has become a legacy in my family; someday I hope to give copies to my grandchildren."
"There are a gazillion books out there on how to find yourself, follow your bliss, and cope with midlife crisis, but none more succinct or more profound than this slim and elegant volume.  Each chapter is lovingly structured according to a particular species of shell, and the result is a beautifully observed prose poem about the evolution of the female psyche.  With its compact size and attractive cover art, it makes a particularly charming gift."
Timeless. Thought provoking read. Wonderful book to share or gift.
I purchased this book for a gift. It was received in a timely manner & good condition as described!
We live in Flirida and it was written in the 1950s
"A lovely story, she really paints a picture in my mind as I read it. Sometimes it feels like I am on the beach with her! I have read it a dozen times. I love this book. It's a comfortable classic in my collection that I return to again and again."
"I first listened to this book on CD and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  It is pretty much just the musings of a wife and mother about her life and relationship with her family.  She talks about her need for alone time, simplification of her life, and her marriage.  I read it quite a while ago and I still reflect upon insights from the book.  I would highly recommend that everyone take a chance to read this book.  It's not long, but it is truly a gem."
Great read ! I bet it's a great re-read as well!Very appropriate for women and men too.... hard to believe how long ago the book was written!
"I enjoyed this very much.  Anne Morrow Lindbergh wrote this back in 1955 but was just as relevant now as it was then.  Very insightful.  I had just read The Aviators Wife by Melanie Benjamin which chronicled Anne Morrow Lindbergh's life as Charles Lindbergh's wife. Anne wrote this while away from her family and all it's challenges. She was a remarkable woman who survived tragedy, trial and tremendous responsibility."
"So we'll written , I love the analogy between the shells and the stages of our lives, all women should read this"
Easy read. Still relevant!
Beautiful book... beautiful story... beautiful condition... thank you. Will definitely order from you again.
Bought this used and was very happy with the condition of the book!  Will order more used books.  The story really speeks to older women and everyone in our club liked the book.
"Because of the era in which it was written, the language is a little stiff, but the messages are timeless."
"This book was fantastic and heart-warming. I look at my future and desire to have children with some hesitation, but after reading this I have hope for myself."
"As a seventy five year old woman the book clarified the present journey I am on.  A look back at the past, an intermingling of the past with the present and future, a great grounding book.  I will read the book many times I am sure."
"Very good book!  It's deep but in a simple, easy to understand way.  It's great for moms especially.  I am planning on ordering more copies to give as gifts for my mom and mother in law."
After reading The Aviator's Wife I decided to read more about Anne Lindbergh. The book is ver well written by a lovely interesting and smart lady who lived through a terribly tragedy.
This is my go-to!
Love the thoughtful insights in this book.
just okay - a little boring for me
"Good book - fairly deep, but easy to get through"
Gift from the Sea was indeed a gifted reading. Enjoyed the flow of thought process and related to it with my own life. Some amazing thoughts woke me up to re think about my life and relationship with my spouse at 65. Would recommend this reading to all women.
"Like the gentle, rocking sea -- this book gently opens your mind with each ""wave"" of insight from the author, wider and wider until you feel like you've ridden the tide of wisdom and have obtained some true secrets of life -- though oddly they feel like they've been with you all along and this book just reminded you of their existence.I loved this book because of its imagery through words and the delicate touch of the author to balance hard truths with beautiful surroundings to arrive at some very valuable life lessons. Would highly recommend this!"
"If you want to give yourself a gift this is the book. It is so relaxing,good feeling to open and reopen this book and read on for as long as it takes."
"No thank you, I prefer not to write a review. I think it is a must read for every woman"
"Anne Morrow Lindbergh was a legend before her time.  This book is a gift, I have my own copy that is well read and worn.  Love it"
Love this book
"This is a short, well written and thought provoking book. It's a good read for yourself or a good gift for another woman who is growing up or going through a change such as getting married or having children."
One of the best books I have ever read. My mother gave me my first copy and I have read the book again and again every few years. Have given the book numerous times as a gift.
"So timeless (even after 50 years) that I kept my own and bought five more for my daughters and my friends.  So much wisdom in such a small book.  Why wasn't this advice in the ""instructions"" on what life would deliver?"
"My Mother loved Sanibel and this book.  This fall we spent 5 days on Sanibel and there was an article on the 50th anniversary of this book.  That inspired me to get it.  It is a wonderful, thought provoking book on life. You won't be disappointed if you read it."
Bravo!  It has many important messages for women and very relatable today. I hope more women and men take a day or days to read itThank you
"Beautifully written. Lovely,period."
Terrible
beautiful story!
Very Comtemplative and written after the Lindbergh kidnapping about how Anne went to the sea and pondered the meaning of each shell to help her heal after losing her baby. I highly recommend this book.
I found it ok only because the insights were available elsewhere. interesting use of shell shapes to focus her thoughts.
A very nice book. Good to have it. Make me feel calm to read it. Worth buying
Gifts of the sea has been an annual read ever since it came out  I have given this book to many women over the years and it was nice to replace my last one with an anniversary edition.
This will always be a treasured book....
Read this book several years ago when it first came out and it is as valuable today as it was then one of the books you will read several times over the years.
"When I received the book, I was a little dissapointed. It is really small. However, when I started reading, it was great. I love the sea, and therefore loved the connection of shells to her stories. A lovely, quick read."
Best book ever!!! Something you can read every year!!!
This book awakened me to the real nature of women. I am a man who was really not in touch.  Ann Morrow Lindburgh has made such an eloquant way to describe the inner makings of the feminine that makes it easy to read with much appreciation.
Best from mother's with children at home...serene.
bought several of these for my beach friends
I try to read this book every year.  I also try to make sure that everyone I know reads it too.  Finding this copy on Amazon.com helped me get the perfect gift for a friend.
Wonderfully written. A delight to read
One of my favorite books.  She wrote this book over sixty years ago and it is still relevant.A lovely way to describe the years of our lives. This is a book to give to other women as a gift.
"Gift from the Sea is timeless, it's for men as well as women, and it's inspiring. I read the book every time I go to the beach...take a deep breathe and just BE there."
Purchased a copy for both my daughter and me.  A classic book.
This is a good book if you are interested in making good choices about dating and how to avoid the traps and heart break that are out there. Would recommend it
great book
The pages were printed upside down and the bleed marks are showing on most of the pages.
"I loved everything about the book it was very timely for me and helped me to realize that it was ok to say no, Limitations are acceptable after all we ourselves cannot be everything to everybody. 5 Stars"
I've read the other boundaries book; this helps me understand how they relate specifically in dating. It was very helpful.Love his books!
"All of the ""boundaries"" books are great and will teach you how to protect your heart. Recommend!"
read it years ago and got it for our granddaugher
Excellent book
This book was recommended to me by my friend and pastors wife. She read it before she was married and said it was a great book to read.
Life changer!!
The way it's meant to be!
None
This is an excellent book!
This book was an absolute blessing to my life!! I have bought additional copies for my friends and family members. I highly recommend this book.
Everyone would benefit from reading this book.
This book opened my eyes to the need if having self respect and boundaries especially in the dating world . No matter how old you may be
Very nice book...
Excellent
"Self help book to healing my own brokenness, as well as insight to growing healthy relationships.  How I can hold strong to my values with firm boundaries."
"I think the book show us the ideals which we should be aiming for. Sadly, in reality there are always more women than men in churches, and it's hard meet single guys at church."
All young or older people can learn a lot about setting boundaries in dating.  Very good principles and highly recommended for people who are dating.
This book offered great advice and it really made you look into your own life and habits and how to change the bad to good in a positive way
Greats book for singles. Well written. Easy to read with very practical & insightful advice. A good Christian psychological perspective.
"I find this book to have great advice, with easy to follow discussion as well as practical tips and examples that can be easily applied."
I bought it to provide my daughter with some structure other than Dad's words.  After working through the book with her I realized it was written for me too!  18-56 all inclusive!
Enjoyed this book immensely. Will refer to it a lot to keep myself on track with key principles in dating.
Great book...very useful info. Very resourceful! Knowledge that can applied to everyday situations or circumstances. I recommend this book to everyone!
"Good read , I enjoyed it"
"This has great information on how to ""kick the tires"" when you are dating.  Instead of just schmoozing someone, Cloud encourages you to know yourself and check out the other person's reactions to who you are.  Investing emotionally in a relationship is risky business.  Cloud helps you look for the signs that indicate the person your are dating will treat your heart well."
Dating is a great thing if done right. This was an incredibly thorough book on Christian dating. So many practical relational concepts in each chapter.
It has lots of good common since ideas that are easy to understand & follow. I would recommend to anyone over 17.
"Very thoughtful, insightful. In an age where personal responsibility and accountability is fading, this brings it back to self-respect and raising the bar. Thank you!"
"This book was filled with good, godly advice. It is geared towards adults already in the dating scene, not really for teenagers or people not dating presently. Nonetheless, the wide range of topics and relevant examples make it a good read."
this book is amazing! it took my attention since I started reading it. If you are a christian girl on the dating ages you definitely want to read this.
This book is a must read for all Chrisitian singles who are dating for marriage. The insight and forsight will absolutely change the trajectory of your dating life. I'm considering purchasing more as holiday gifts.
Awesome book!
Loved it! Very helpful at understanding the necessary boundaries and limits to making a successful dating relationship. A good read
Great read for anyone dating or even a long term relationship. Gives some great insight on making the right choices and setting boundaries on yourself and others.
It's an awesome book!! Highly recommend to anyone thinking of dating or who is already dating.
"Absolutely fantastic book that has made me completely change how I look at potential dates. I've already recommended it to so many people, and I would suggest you take the opportunity to learn about yourself as well!"
Loved it! Great condition and I can't wait to read it!
"It is a great book, every single person needs to read it."
"This book was life changing.  Coming out of an abusive situation which led to a divorce, I knew I needed help if I were ever to marry again!  I figured that it was best to figure out why the abuse happened, as well as what I had done wrong in my choice of mate.  This book was SO insightful that I wish it had been in print before my first marriage.As it happens, I got into a dating relationship much sooner than I had expected.  I had figured that I needed at LEAST 2 years to regroup before even planning to begin dating again.  ""Fate"" had other plans.  I got into a very bizarre and abusive dating relationship with a man who was unlike anyone I had ever known in that he manipulated me, lied, and had the gall to accuse me of trying to control him!  Soon I began to feel those awful, trapped feelings from before.I kept trying to step back and just slow things down (since he wanted to date me AND someone else at the same time and I happen to think one should be patient enough to date only one person at a time for the sake of other people's feelings).  Part of the reason it felt so exhausting was the way he would talk about really wanting to marry me and then in the next breath tell me about a date he planned with the other gal he was just starting to see.  When I challenged him about the hypocrisy and cruelty of playing with my feelings, he would accuse me of being controlling.  When I tried to just be ""coffee friends"" until he decided how he felt about the other gal, he would accuse me of being controlling and not wanting the best for his son and himself.  God had to finally wrest him away from me by having him dump me without telling me and then find out in a month or so that he was planning to marry yet a different gal in 4 months.  Praise God for His mercy AND for THIS BOOK!After the fact I read this book and it was like a bolt of lightning sending me back to reality.  NO, it hadn't been wrong for me to tell him how I only felt comfortable dating one person at a time and only dating people who felt the same way.  YES, I had been right to be bothered by the ""little"" lies he told me about his whereabouts.  And YES, I was really wrong to have felt so desperate that I was so unattractive and getting old so fast (at 44--LOL) that I was not taking the time to think things through and to insist on an equal footing in our relationship.I have given a copy of this book to several people, including to my own handsome but single sons:)My story has a happy ending in that several months after the end of that nutty relationship I met a very honest, polite, considerate, generous, kind, affectionate, hard working man who just adores me:)  It was a whirlwind romance, but the RIGHT kind.  We are coming up on our 4th wedding anniversary and the 5th anniversary of our first email and first date.  God is good and this book is the kind of great advice one would hope to get from BOTH one's mother and father (if one were smart enough to LISTEN to them--LOL).I recommend this as essential, insightful reading for guys and gals from age 12 to age 100!  If you follow these guidelines I can almost guarentee that you will NEVER get yourself into another abusive relationship.  Just make sure that YOU are the same kind of person that the book discusses so that you may bless your date as well as he/she may bless you!  Happy dating:)This is ALSO a great book for picking out your friends!  These authors have written several other great books such as Changes That Heal, Boundaries, Boundaries in Marriage, Boundaries With Children, and a book which I think is called 12 Things That Can Drive You Crazy.  God bless you!"
Very helpful  book! It really makes you think.Great advice.
The book boundaries changed my life and this book has some good ideas to consider.  I have it helpful in my life.
Good book with great advice!
We read this book in our singles ministry book club. Great book to read with other ladies. I love it.
"Wonderful book, easy to read & will make you crack up each chapter!"
"This book has kept me on track and is well worth reading.  Not just for singles, but couples also.  I would love to see it taught in schools!"
I'm recently widowed and a friend recomened it to me however the content seamed to repete itself over & over
Beautiful and well put together book for teen girls! Love it
Easy read for my 10 year old
Both of my teen daughters (13 and 16) love this Bible. It really has helped them study and understand it.
Great for my 11 year old daughter.
This was a Christmas present for our granddaughter. She loved it.
My preteen LOVES this bible! She‚Äôs learning so much and is really studying the Word.
Got this bible for my 11yr old daughter. Very easy to understand.
See review as pink fields life app. study Bible.
In Love
"This bible is great for my daughter. She is 10, almost 11 and everything in it is totally relatable to her."
Great bible for my girls
"My daughter love her Bible, very detail, great for studies"
Great for young women
Bought this book for my daughter and she loves it.
My 11 year old daughter loves this Bible.  I often find it sitting on her nightstand so I know she reads it frequently before bed.  She even thanked me for buying it for her.  The cover is beautiful.
It's such an awesome bible for a young girl. My 13 year old loves it. It's definitely worth every penny!!!
"Beautiful, easy to read bible for my niece."
Great looking Bible!
Absolutely wonderful Bible for girls
Love this bible!
"Amazing , I love this bible , it‚Äôs very nice , the cover is super cute , love this for at home reading , not easy to take to church though for it‚Äôs a bit bulkier so I bring my other bible !!!"
"This bible is easy to use. It has been just what I needed to dive back into reading the Word. I am able to read/look at the scripture for what it is, yet write notes that make it easier for me to understand. I love it!"
"Pages are thicker than most Bibles but still fairly thin. Good amount of space for doodles, pictures, notes, or journaling."
"These Bibles are perfect. Great size, pages, space for writing, and sturdy. I paint on the covers and these Bibles work great for me and always come in great shape."
Received this the other day it is very beautifully done and very good quality shipping was amazing as usual
Exactly what I was looking for.  Lots of room to take notes and space to be creative.  Definitely can personalize this Bible.  I love it.
I recently started going to church and this bible journal has been wonderful . Definitely worth the money I spent . It makes it easier to take notes while in church . The only downfall I can say is that the words are a tiny bit small and the pages are a little thin. Other then that this bible is great!
"Wife gifted this to a new neighbor, very nice design!"
"Absolutely love this Bible! Nice size, font is big enough to read, and nice margins to write or draw in!"
"Pretty cover, great space for writing, fast shipping."
Gives me a good overview
Best study ever
"Great study bible, reasonably priced"
I thought it too hard to understand.I'm really disappointed  because I want to learn what some of the original words were before they were translated.
"too complicated, i returned this item."
Just what I wanted.
ok
I have enjoyed this Bible. It helps really get the meaning of some words in Hebrew that would ordinarily be undiscovered by just reading the usual versions.
Good bible.
This was purchased for a friend as a birthday present. They absolutely loved it!
"I find myself calmer, able to think more clearly, and most importantly, closer to God after reading this book and putting the suggested practices to use. I‚Äôm amazed at how practical, reasonable, and attainable yet powerful the practices are. Some of the ideas that struck a chord with me were to seek real restoration in God-gifted things such as outdoor beauty. . instead of a short term ‚Äòfix‚Äô from say for example, too many drinks or sugar. I‚Äôve never ever regretted taking a walk. Too many drinks and sugar though? That‚Äôs another story.  The daily intentional pause and prayer has given me spiritual connectedness I‚Äôve never experienced. The accompanying app is masterfully executed in its beautiful scenes, music, and John‚Äôs calming voice in prayer. The book is extremely well written, with theological support for the practices; it is interjected with stories that exhibit relatable honesty, humor, and tragedy. It‚Äôs a great accompaniment with you for a vacation or travel read, or at-home to wind-down."
"As someone that spends a lot of time thinking, researching, and writing about the topics of restoring mental and emotional margin, I've noticed a big gap in recent published books. And that is the Biblical lens of restoration. I'm all for the digital declutters and practices of stillness, but unless it's driving you toward conversation with God, it's not bringing about ultimate transformation which happens on a heart level.John not only pulls together the research behind our anxiety inducing age of smartphones and the unforgiving pace of life we demand on living. He points us back to a life of communion with God, quieting our hearts and letting the presence and beauty of God restore our souls in a tumultuous time of human history."
Have enjoyed a ton until statement we have to love God more and it is our actions that gain his love. That God's love literally conditional. Dangerous
"I had an advanced copy so I was able to go through Get Your Life Back a couple of months ago. Putting in practice several things contained in the book has made a world of difference for me. For instance, the one minute pause has helped me refocus before stepping into situations where I need to bring myself in line with what God‚Äôs thoughts are for the thing I‚Äôm about to enter. Benevolent detachment is helping me learn that everything is not on my shoulders. And those are just two of many life giving principles that John gives in the pages of this excellent book. It‚Äôs a must read if you are fried and need some space in your soul."
This book is packed full of wisdom and practical ways to not be ruled by the world.  This book will reorient you to a better way to live.  It will awaken you to how the world and all the noise out there has easily distracted us from what is most important and reorient you to where you can have the most impact.  I highly recommend this book to the soul that is weary/burdened/drowning from all the daily assaults of the world.  Your soul will thank you!
"I received the book yesterday and spent my morning through the first few chapters and am already feeling better. Seriously, we all need someone to give us permission to slow down and there are not many people out there I trust to be honest and tell the truth - no matter what. You gotta love this guy  - He writes without the normal filters of 21st Century writers. He is a truth teller and believe me on this .... His new book, Get Your Life Back, tells the truth, the honest truth and nothing but the truth - about our lives in this world and how to take back control of our time! I hope you'll invest some time in the book and then pass the truth on to your friends. Let's all slow down a bit! Ken"
"I love the practicality of John Eldredge's new book, ""Get Your Life Back"".  I can ""do"" these daily and see/feel its impact quickly.  Pick up this book if you are looking for answers.  You won't regret it!!!!!!"
"I found this book to be so practical in how to calm myself and focus on the things that matter.  Eldredge provides very practical ideas and practices to drawing closer to God, and toward enhancing our bond, our union with God.  The idea of benevolent detachment is profound - purposefully placing the people and issues in our life in God's hands.  To truly let go of the anxieties and free us to allow God to work through all those issues in our life.  The ""Pause"" app associated with this book is also incredibly practical; I use this daily to bring more balance in my life and develop a deeper relationship with our loving God.  The practices are helping better establish a more balanced rhythm in my life."
"Since first not sure what was expecting, but was expecting more than a trite litany against how wired we have become. The world has changed: some for the good, some for the bad, but returning to the good old days isn't a viable or even appealing solution to probably anyone under 65. I say this as someone turning 50. My summary of the book: slow down, notice God more, be more intentional with your daily faith practices. It is comical how the book ends - with advertisements for his podcasts, app, and DVD series."
"I wanted to love this book, I really did. But it was so disappointing.A few common sense points drawn out with descriptions and antidotes.  Shut off your phone, blah blah.....enjoy beauty blah blah.....stuff we ALL strive for.  I expected way more oomph and inspiration.Not one Single ‚Äúa-ha‚Äù moment in the book.Sigh."
"Oh my what a book. In a time of hurry, hurry, hurry John gives us practical tools to slow down! Enjoy our creation, build relationships, and reignite our passion and union with God.So refreshing to know it‚Äôs ok to be refreshed by the presence of God. It‚Äôs got to be a priority to get back to our first love. Highly recommend as a part of your arsenal - REST."
"In a time where the world is in Chaos. This book brings the reader back into getting their heart back . How to slow down and not allow the businesses of this world to control them. To reset their life the way God meant their life to be , in the growing uneasiness of this world."
Once again John has caught me right when I needed it. ‚ÄúMy soul just can‚Äôt do life at the speed of smartphones. ‚Äú Our world needs this book to remind us of what we were created to be.
A great book that is needed - it delivers on its promise and the storytelling and insights as always are wonderful!
This book was a really good read and brings a fair amount of insight.
"This book is an enormous life-saver, it's so enormously helpful and practical. In this day and age we live in where so much of ""life"" is competing for our attention every second of the day, this book is a lifeline, and it will change your life if you let it.Get the book, read it slowly...start to practice the helpful tools that John describes so wonderfully in his new book."
"Like all of John's books, it's well-paced, deep yet approachable, and refreshing at a soul-level."

"John Eldredge‚Äôs latest book is a timely message in a chaotic world. It puts into words what I have been experiencing and provided helpful, doable tools to reclaim my life. His message is kind and life giving."
Life changing book. Just what we all need to hear with simple steps to truly get your life back.
"Take time to read this book.... highlight, read again.... focus on the Lord!"
"Simple practices that allow you to hear your soul, connect with the Lord, find gratitude and grace. I have shared with many friends."
This book is designed to set our set our fears at ease and prevent distractions from taking over our life.  Wow do we need this now!  Thank God for this book
This book is just what we need in the lives we all lead at breakneck speed. I can not recommend this book more or the Pause app that is FREE and the perfect companion to these lessons.
"I love John‚Äôs books, and this one touched my soul as well, getting my heart, soul, and mind back on Jesus.  I know you will find it healing as well."

"Amazing book, highly recommended! Really makes you think about life‚Äôs distractions and gives you real tools to restore God‚Äôs peace. Another outstanding work by John Eldredge."
Much needed read for anyone who is feeling haggard from the pace of our culture. I have extended this book with the Pause app that helps implement the practices in the book.
"Right on time every time, a phrase often heard in Christendom...yet spot on pertaining to this great easy refreshing read. THANK YOU  Mr Eldredge!"
Got what I wanted.
Love this book immediately. I have been dreaming of a vacation in a convent away from this crazy world.
Love this book. Easy read.
"A rescue from the madness of the world.  Refreshing, helpful and practical."

Great price for a great book!
I loved reading this book. John does such a great job of helping people practically take care is their souls.

John always speaks to life challenges facing us today in a clear manner.  Biblical teaching we can use!
Loving the one minute pause. And the practices John teaches. There is life in this book. Thank you John for your dedication and open heart.
"This is a life Changing book! John has done it again, he‚Äôs tapped into the Fathers heart and relayed what he‚Äôs found the last year for himself so simply for the rest of us to gain from. The idea of taking a Pause at different times of the day and letting it all go into the hands of Jesus isn‚Äôt new. Jesus said to cast all your cares on him, but John does such a great job explaining what that looks like and how to do it. The practical knowledge in this book is worth its weight in gold. He‚Äôs right, we do live in a gnarly  time to be alive, and we are so pressed on every side to push ourselves to the limit of every possibility. We need margin, to Learn to say NO more and just let God take all our stress and worries , every one and everything and only give us back what He intended for us to have.  We carry around so much we were never created to carry. Thank you John for writing this so desperately needed book."
Love reading books to pass the time. This is a rating for the seller not the book itself. Thank you.
Great info
The book was ok I felt it was more fiction than I thought
Just what I was looking for.
Great information.  Very in depth.
I like it.
"Good read, but the number of typos in this edition draws you out some."
Absolutely fascinating.
It came faster than I thought it would...perfect condition...an awesome read as well.
The product was timely delivered. Very good condition.
"The book is fine...see other good reviews. The audio version does sound, as another reviewer said, that it's read by a stoner. He puts too much dramatic sounding emphasis into what should be read like an educational book. I feel like he should be saying ""duuude"" before reading a sentence....like read by Tommy Chong or something with some stupid echo effects. Seriously destracts from the content and doesn't make it sound like the scholarly work it should be. Yay book, boo narrator."
"I purchased the Kindle version and am so very happy I did. What a great resource, blending scripture and footnotes into these ancient texts. I highly recommend this version. I have a couple other books on the Book of Enoch, but this one proved to be the most useful for me. It's interesting that the Book of Enoch, though referenced through the scripture, is omitted from the Bible. Reading ancient texts really affirms the teaching in scripture and provides background information that helps to put scripture in context."
"Information is well documented, compared with Book of Enoch and the Bible, and easy to follow.  Highly recommend this book."
Disliked. Quoted other sources
Bad
Exactly as advertised. Quick turnaround. Good quality.
Just got this two days ago. My wife wanted this after we saw a documentary on Giants
"Shipped fast and arrived earlier. Great read, love it."
Great book
I thought it was a book of giant's  the title is very misleading. It's  the book of Enoch.
"I have been reading the Encouragement for today devotions for over a year and have always been inspired by the stories shared by Lysa TerKeurst. I do believe God prompted me to read this book and I am SO glad I did. This book has been such a blessing. It was engaging, practical, and so inspiring. I am so blessed."
I'm currently a part of a Online Bible Study and this is out book. I'm enjoying it! I would recommend the read
"Lysa, you rock!  I couldn't put this book down!  What a blessing it was to read this great book! Thanks!"
I knew before digging into this book that God is all I need. Reading this book ALL I want to do is shout out loud YES LORD!!
"Lysa speaks to your heart, mind, and soul, all at once!"
"I highly recommend this book to any woman wanting to follow God! She is an amazing writer, I love everything of hers that I've read so far."
"This book takes simple biblical truths and drives them deep. Lysa's writing is clear and peppered with true to life illustrations which makes it true, interesting, serious, and fun! Taking time to meditate on the Bible verses and ponder the application questions at the end of each chapter was well worth the time invested."
great!
great book
"Lysa is an awesome writer and the study has been so down to earth, every day real."
"I have finished listening to What Happens When Women Say Yes to God by Lysa TerKeurst.My thoughts: I am familiar with the author because of Proverbs 31 Ministries and also I have read some of her other books.  I enjoyed the message of this book and appreciated the examples shared from her own life of how God has blessed her for her obedience to Him.  I liked that she included examples of times when she did and other times when she did not obey.  She has a good message in this book to encourage women to radical obedience to God. I did not give this more stars because of the narrator I guess.  Several times I wondered if her tone and inflection was giving the message that the author intended.  It just felt like she was bragging or had an attitude or something in some parts regarding what she had done, the choices she had made, or the blessings she received.  I don't know if I would have felt that way if it had been read by the author or I had read the book version myself; however, at times I felt this voice distracted from the author's true intent and message. Thank you to christianaudio Reviewers Program for providing this audio book for my review."
"This book is amazing, I know that it was inspired by God.  It done to me heart."
"Wow! What a powerhouse! I couldn't put this book down.  I re-read it a second time and took time for prayer and the bible study at the end of each chapter.  Lysa gives so much insight to transforming to ""Radically Obedient"".  I also love her down-to-earth approach to life and sense of humor!  She had me laughing out loud at how the ""good"" forks seem to disappear from her kitchen!  Mine too!  This is a thoroughly great read and will be a continual source of advice for me.  I highly recommend this book if you want the steps to take your relationship with God to a higher level.  I said Yes!!"
"This is a review of the audiobook version of What Happens When Women Say Yes to God.In some ways I feel that it is unfair of me to write a review of this book at all, because I found the voice of the person reading this book to be quite grating on my ears and rather annoying. Because the author did not read her own book, I am not sure if the tone that the book was read in accurately portrays the tone the author was trying to get across, but in my opinion this book was read in a very whiney tone, which distracted me from being able to enjoy the book very much.That said, what you'll find in this book is primarily the author's retelling of times when she heard that still small voice directing her to do something that didn't immediately make sense. When she acted on faith and followed these directions, she saw blessings, not only to herself but also and especially to others. She felt that God was telling her to do certain things, and when she followed through she saw a lot of positive come out from those decisions.What I got out of this book is that the author is using stories from her life and experiences to encourage women to step out on faith and act in obedience when they hear God telling them to do something. However, because of the whininess of the voice I was listening to, I did not find this book particularly encouraging, and I found it very difficult to pay attention to what was being said. I would imagine that I might have enjoyed this book more if I had read it myself, rather than listened to the audiobook version. In some ways I'm not sure I can really give an accurate review of the content of the book, because I don't know what kind of experience I would have gotten out of it if it had been read in a more friendly and less complain-y tone.I received a free audiobook copy of When Women Say Yes to God from christianaudio in exchange for my honest review.[...]"
book was good but I have read better books on this subject
"I love how this study takes you to a different place with God than other books I've read. I'd recommend it, for self or group!"
THIS WAS A AWESOME AND INSPIRING BOOK .I AM TRULY BIESSED TO HAVE READ WHEN WOMEN SAY YES TO GOD ...
"This book inspires you to want to be close to God, to hear His voice, and to obey Him.  A great challenge!"
"Loved Loved Loved this book,,, the bible study part was a little difficult for me, but I have totally recommended this book to my daughters and friends....Angela McLaughlin,"
Love this book and study.
"Thanks to Netflix, it seems like right now in January 2019, every woman and many men in America are ‚Äútidying up.‚Äù I read Marie Kondo‚Äôs book The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up when it first came out.  I thought that it was interesting read and that she had some good ideas, but since she‚Äôs Japanese, it felt very Japanese and honestly, I had a hard time relating to all of her suggestions because I simply don‚Äôt have the time to dump all of the clothes that belong to me in a pile and sort through them, plus my one and two year old would ‚Äúhelp‚Äù by moving my piles around.Now I‚Äôve read a TON of cleaning and organizational books since I became a wife and mother.  I kept hoping that some book would have the magic sauce that would allow me to spend minimal time on cleaning my house and doing things more enjoyable like giving the cat a bath.  So, when I say that I found THE book for me that helped me approach my house in a completely different way, I know of which I speak.Decluttering at the Speed of Life by Dana K. White is fantastic.  I summed up my impression of the book on Instagram a couple of months ago like this; ‚ÄúI just finished this book.  It‚Äôs one of the best books on home management I‚Äôve read in a while.  @aslobcomesclean is super funny.  She‚Äôs been there, done that, had three shirts and learned how to get rid of two of them.  I highly recommend it!‚Äù.  I‚Äôm not kidding when I say that Decluttering at the Speed of Life is one of the best books I‚Äôve read on home management.  She comes from the American way of thinking that we need more, more, more so she knows all about the guilt about letting things go.  Kondo tries to address this by having people say thank you to items as you let them go, but White gets to the underlying psychological issues that Americans have towards keeping everything.Americans are drowning in stuff, I was drowning in stuff and I didn‚Äôt really realize it, I really thought I could organize my overwhelming amounts of random stuff, but she makes it clear you can‚Äôt.  White talks about the idea of containers and this was paradigm altering for me.  Containers are only meant to hold so many things and a house is a type of container.  We can‚Äôt get mad at the container when it won‚Äôt shut because there‚Äôs too much stuff, and we can‚Äôt be upset when our house is messy all the time because there are too many items in it.  We can‚Äôt organize our way out of too much stuff, we can only start to get rid of it.  White is gentle, but firm that we need to start getting rid of stuff and she gives you a plan that doesn‚Äôt seem so overwhelming like putting all your clothes in a pile and getting decision fatigue.I‚Äôve given away at least three, maybe four copies of Decluttering at the Speed of Life and I can‚Äôt say enough good things about it.  If you‚Äôve been inspired to declutter and tidy up, I HIGHLY recommend Decluttering at the Speed of Life by Dana K. White."
"Hello, I‚Äôm Pam, and I‚Äôm a slob.I have to qualify this to say that I‚Äôve been married to a neat freak for 36 year, so my slob factor has been contained ‚Äì but not squelched! Dana speaks to me even though my house isn‚Äôt really that messy.Dana does have a few things that she repeats. But, to me, that‚Äôs a good thing because sometimes (all the time?), I need to hear things a few times before they sink in.This is not an organization book. It is a deslobification book. When the house isn‚Äôt drowning in too many things, the organization will follow. Really!Dana discusses getting the clutter out of every area in your house. That sounds like a project that would take a dedicated week or month. But her system (that she has perfected from experience after experience) allows this to happen in what she calls ‚Äúawkward pauses‚Äù in your real life. You can get the clutter out in the small chunks of time that happen while you‚Äôre waiting for the load of laundry to finish. Or in between times you pick up your kids from different schools.The first time you read that you are supposed to carry one thing, right then, to the place it belongs, your heart, brain, and body will rebel. You will say, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not practical. I‚Äôll be carrying things back and forth all day! It only makes sense to make a pile of things that belong in the master bedroom all at once and then carry it there. It‚Äôs so inefficient to carry one thing to the place it belongs!!‚Äù Well, Dana explains why it is so much better to carry that one thing, right then, to where it belongs. (Spoiler ‚Äì it keeps you from making a bigger mess while you‚Äôre disorganizing because you know once you get a pile of things that don‚Äôt belong in the kitchen, the doorbell will ring! She explains it a lot better than I can.)This isn‚Äôt a book that promises once you ‚Äúdeslobify‚Äù, your house will never be messy again. That would require magic (or at least a total brain transplant for me). It does promise to give you tools to allow you to manage your house when life happens. That‚Äôs good enough for me.***I pre-ordered this book, and also got to read an advance copy as a member of the launch team.***"
"I. Love. This. Book.  It was easy and quick to read and kept my attention throughout the book. That is important to me as I can be easily distracted.  The hard thing about sticking to reading this book is that it will make you want to get up and go declutter!I just learned of Dana K. White four months ago. I quickly related to everything that she said.  I felt like I finally found someone who really understands me!  I‚Äôm not the horrible person I had been believing I was.  I just didn‚Äôt know how to manage my stuff!  I have felt like a failure when it comes to housekeeping my entire life.  I am 58 years old.  My stinking thinking is now changing and I feel hopeful!Dana takes you step by step, room by room, and makes it easy!  In fact, the first rule is to do the easy stuff first ‚Äî trash!  Why did I never think of that myself?  Then you go to the next easy thing.  I can do that!  And things start looking better. I have now learned that ‚Äúless is better‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt have to do it perfectly for it to be better.Dana does have a sense of humor but in this book you will also see a serious and compassionate side.  I appreciated that as much as the humor.I pre-ordered this book, but also got to read an advance copy as a member of the launch team.  I plan to get the audio version as well.  Dana is fun to listen to.Thank you, Dana, for the opportunity to read this book and for the encouragement that you give to so many!!  I‚Äôm so glad I found you!"
"This is THE DECLUTTERING BOOK FOR ME. I started to highlight and found myself highlighting the whole damn book!Having read Dana‚Äôs first book How to Manage Your Home Without Losing Your Mind, I immediately pre-ordered her Decluttering book, because that is by far my biggest problem. Luckily, after pre-ordering & paying full price, I got an advance copy of the book. Admittedly, I did worry that a lot of it would entail repeats from the first book, without much new info. PUT THAT CONCERN TO REST.While there is a little repetition, I found this much more in line with what I really need ‚Äì from the reasons for the clutter to the ways to attack it, Dana really speaks to my specific problems.Having just started my cleanup, I‚Äôm still at the 1st Visibility Station, but I‚Äôve finished the Easy Trash and Duh-Clutter, without anxiety or coming to a dead halt ‚Äì that‚Äôs 2 major steps for me. Now I‚Äôm gearing up to answer the 2 Declutter Questions and then pray I can tackle the Container Concept.Had a little trouble with the Donate Duplicates I Don‚Äôt Need, until a Light Bulb Moment: I need to stop storing stuff I can‚Äôt find anyway and let the Store store it for me. New concept of a Store! It‚Äôs easier & faster to hop in the car and go to the store, where things are stored logically, than try to find things at my house. Even if I must pay full price (gulp ‚Äì Light Bulb #2) it‚Äôs cheaper than wasting money on a whole bunch of On Sale Junk, then forgetting I have it‚Ä¶or beating myself up & the frustration of searching for hours because I can‚Äôt remember where I put it.Maybe I can master the Container Concept after all. Yes, there is Hope for me and my mess house. Thank you, Dana.One Last Note: Dana‚Äôs humor is great ‚Äì not too cutesy, totally appropriate and makes the lessons oh, so palatable. If you‚Äôre even a little bit slob, a cluttered mess or just need help clearing out one area ‚Äì this is a great book for you. (less)"
"Let me begin by saying that I ADORE Dana and her blog. I even pre-ordered this book. I had a very hard time getting through it and was surprised to find I was disappointed with the content. This is a first for me, because I'm usually a big fan of her material. However in this book, she took the approach of using the same few decluttering steps and applying them to every room of the home. That's it. The same steps, just different rooms. It was a real stretch to make a book out of these steps. It was as if she needed material for a new book and decided to focus on this, but it was just too narrow of a topic, so she ended up repeating herself. . .and being reduntant. . .and saying the same thing twice. You get the idea. Before she starts repeating the steps (over and over and over) she does warn the reader that she is going to do this, but this approach makes for a tedious book. At least, it did for me.Even though this particular book wasn't my favorite, I love Dana's blog and podcasts. For that reason alone, I don't regret purchasing her book. I appreciate so much the time and effort that she puts into her work that I wanted to support her. I just hope she considers using a broader topic for her next book."
"This book, along with Dana's first book, has had a dramatic impact on my daily life. I am still in the process of decluttering, but I am slowly taking control of my home. Dana's two decluttering questions are simple and help take the emotion out of decision making. This book takes you step by step through each room of your home. For me, it has helped me get past the overwhelming feeling of looking at an overly cluttered space and just start working! I have gone from overwhelming spaces and stuffed closets--to finding empty drawers and having my living spaces actually clean on a regular basis. I've gotten rid of so many things and I'm making the space we have much more livable. Dana talks about Decluttering Momentum and it's so true! Once you start, it's easier to keep going. I highly recommend this book to help you get started!"
"Not since ""Pigpen to Paradise"" have I read a book that has helped me more.  I have read almost every book on organizing over the last 45 years, and this is the first book to really help me!  The problem has not been my needing to buy more pretty containers and shelving units, or to have a bigger house with more closets, but to get rid of what I have kept for ""Past Me"" and ""Future Me"" so that there is room for what I need (and can find) for my life right now.  I don't have to wait for a week off to declutter--I can walk in a room and start with only a few minutes and make progress--and I have been!  Dana's writing is a delight--she has come up with some of the most brilliant ways to declutter.  Seriously, I plan to never buy another organizing book--THIS IS IT!  A very motivating book from someone who has been there!!  (P.S. Also, read her 1st book, ""How To Manage Your Home Without Losing Your Mind"" and her blog ""A Slob Comes Clean"".  Excellent tips on real life living!)"
Procrasticlutter. Container concept. Clutter threshold. You will learn a whole new vocabulary from Dana White! This book is one of the few books on organizing and decluttering that has actually been useful for me. This book is highly readable and very relatable. I highly recommend this book! Please mark if you find my review helpful. Thank you so much!
"*I preordered this book, but also got to read an advance copy as part of the launch team.*I am still reading this book, but so far am loving it - here's why:1. I have followed Dana White's blog for a couple of months and her podcast for a couple years now, so a lot of the mindset ideas aren't new. That said, I still connect to many of them in a deep way. And it is so vital for me to hear again and again - because changing the way I think and perceive the world around me takes time. And it takes effort. And it takes intentionality on my part - intentionality as I immerse myself in materials that help me to change my mindset. And this book is one of those materials for me.Some parts I connected to:""When I tried to declutter, I examined each item, attempting to assess its value to my current life, my family‚Äôs current life, and our future life as a whole. I analyzed the importance of each and every item, trying to predict how much I‚Äôd use it if I kept it or how much regret I‚Äôd feel if I purged it.""Yep. Definitely have done that. And felt so frustrated at how draining it is to go through, item by item, trying to assess that value before deciding whether I can possibly live without it.""I can successfully not see a mess, even a fairly horrific one, until the doorbell rings. But, strangely, I do see clear spaces. Clear spaces make me happy every time I walk past them, and that is the biggest reason I have to follow the Visibility Rule.""So true! It's amazing how easy it is to ignore the messes. And yet, when it's clean, it feels so good!""Every time I decluttered kids‚Äô clothing, I ended up with an entire bed covered in piles. And no one could help me because I was the only one who understood my nuanced system...Worst of all, my effort often made my home look worse. Piles and stacks sat in the open, waiting for their Ideal Decluttering Method to happen.""And once again, it's like she's lived my life.2. Also, I love Dana's humor. Here are some examples of parts that made me smile, or even laugh out loud:""Some data is real, but most is experiential...Unless I specifically say where I got that number, I probably made it up...I taught theatre arts, so numbers mostly serve as dramatic effect for me.""""Here‚Äôs how it works. The only supplies you need to start decluttering are a black trash bag (black, so people living in your house won‚Äôt be able to see what‚Äôs inside and suddenly remember why they totally need it), a donatable Donate Box (the box itself has to leave the house along with the stuff inside), and your feet (in most cases, attached to the ends of your legs).""3. Finally - and most importantly - her tips just make sense. They are practical. And they actually help me get stuff out of my home.""The decision became, ‚ÄúDo I like this more than that?‚Äù Favorite things got first dibs at container space. Things I liked (but weren‚Äôt favorites) could totally stay, guilt-free, as long as there was space. Things that didn‚Äôt have a current purpose or need didn‚Äôt get to stay, and I didn‚Äôt even feel bad about that. There simply wasn‚Äôt space.""""Shouldn‚Äôt I use my decluttering energy on real decluttering instead of on these tedious daily things?Yes, except this daily stuff is clutter because you haven‚Äôt been dealing with it daily. If you dive into the tough decluttering stuff and ignore the procrasticlutter, you‚Äôll feel like your efforts were wasted even though you worked all day. The room will still look messy.""""Here‚Äôs the thing I‚Äôve realized as I have decided to use things instead of store them: once I use things, I use them up, and then the pain of decluttering isn‚Äôt so harsh.""Like I said above, I haven't finished the book yet. But I would still wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who has felt like they've tried to declutter, tried to organize, tried to get their home looking presentable, and just haven't felt like their efforts have made a lasting difference."
"This book should be called ‚ÄúClean Your House at the Speed of Life‚Äù not Declutter. To me, clutter is too many belongings tucked away in closets, cupboards and cabinets. Not a messy house that you don‚Äôt want to clean. My house is already clean, I just need to minimize and simplify. Wrong book for those like me."
Life changing book.  You'd have to read it to understand.  I went from not wanting to have people over to feeling like if someone stopped by it'd be okay.  I'm able to actually make decluttering and organizing difference without making a bigger mess and the changes last because of the steps and advice she gives.  A lady on YouTube recommend it and I was at the point of trying anything.  I was angry and overwhelmed because I spent all my time cleaning and mad when I had to immediately clean again.  I have 5 kids and a husband so a lot of people and a lot of things.
"I normally detest these kind of ""just do it this way"" books, because they just don't fit me.  But this one is different.  Dana makes it totally doable in a painless,  simple way.  I find myself looking at some small area of my house,  visualize her message, and in 10 minutes I'm done.  What a great feeling!  I am so glad she wrote this book!"
Excellent! This book is a guide that somehow knows all of my arguments for keeping stuff that actually needs to go. I have gotten more done following these guidelines than with any of the others that I have used (which is basically any of them from this popular category published in the past 15+ years). Somehow the author knows exactly where my stumbling blocks will be and helps prepare strategies to help me actually get stuff out of the house. Would also recommend  How to Manage your Home Without Losing Your Mind.
"I am 82 years old and I am cleaning up a 10 room house that I have lived in since 1971  It was overwhelming especially since I came from a home where clutter was normal.  This book is wonderful!  The author tells me how to do it without any garbage.  So now I look at the job with a very new perspective.  And it works!  I have hope again.  It has banished my depression as I look at piles of newspapers and magazines on the kitchen table.  Now I know how to deal with them.  This is a wonderful book by a wonderful person.  (Yes, I know.  Too many wonderful's but they belong.)  Buy the book and see.  You do need your own copy.  I think mine will get worn out with wear but I will keep it until it has been memorized."
"I never thought my house would be able to look like it does. Im a working mom with two kids and have adhd and am awful at keeping house. This ladies strategies work. And a lot of why it works is because she breaks down the mental barriers and brain blocks I‚Äôve set up for myself that I didn‚Äôt even realize were stopping me from getting started or making progress. I listened on audible AND have the physical book so I can refer back to certain sections. I recommend this book because it worked for me and the way my brain works, unlike other strategies and methods. It‚Äôs still a work in progress and probably always will be, but I‚Äôve gotten my home to a point where I‚Äôm no longer afraid if someone comes to my house on short notice."
"Dana is so relatable, I found myself bursting out in laughter about how accurately she describes what happens as I try to sort through clutter. I chuckled as she suggested starting with the easy stuff, like, for example, that item you've always hated. She provides a 5 step system for sorting through clutter and not making a bigger mess that can be used in any space. I love her definition of clutter and acknowledgement that different people have very different levels of stuff they can handle. I have made a lot of progress with my own clutter over the last few years. Her suggestions helped me make a few lingering decisions I was struggling with. Also, I now have a framework that I think will work for helping my children sort through their things without the angst of previous attempts."
"I have read so many organizing books. I have wondered why maintaining a tidy house seems so easy for everybody else. None of it made sense until now. If I explained the concepts in this book out loud, you would say ""duh."" But I just really needed to read them in black and white."
"I love both of Dana K. White's books on decluttering and keeping your house clean. You get know harsh judgement and no expectation of perfection. Just simple ways to declutter without feeling overwhelmed. Dana is up front that this has been a problem for her and she is also a work in progress, but she has come up with so many helpful ideas. And she is so funny that you feel laugh and know that you are not alone in the struggle. If you are a person who just doesn't see the clutter until it is overwhelming this is the book for you. I especially recommend it for people with ADD who struggle with organization. It really helps."
You know that choking feeling of overwhelm? I ordered this book because things got a little backed up and out of hand over here this summer. Stacks. My stacks. Summer is my usual declutter and prep for the new homeschool year time. It didn‚Äôt happen. And homeschool started back and life went on and...Then the practical tips in this book sunk in. This book helped me realize I can do this in small chunks of time. I took things to be donated- including cardboard boxes that were taking up garage space. And y‚Äôall it is SO freeing to get rid of clutter and clothes that five children have outgrown. I feel much better! (I‚Äôm going to suggest my children read it. Life skills!) Thanks so much Dana
"I have really enjoyed this book! I am not someone who struggles with massive amounts of clutter but I do love to clean and organize and declutter and am always looking for new tips, tricks, and ideas. My biggest take away from this book is the ‚Äúcontainer concept‚Äù ... the container sets the limit on what you can keek ... the author elaborates, but if you read the book you‚Äôll get it. It‚Äôs a great book and the author is funny! I really enjoyed it and would recommend it. I also really like how the author lets you know up front this is not an organizing book or a decorating book. It‚Äôs a book to help you declutter and get rid of your excess stuff! The author approaches decluttering in a very straightforward and logical way and it‚Äôs the system that SHE created for herself and what had worked for her. A whole new mindset and method for decluttering. Definitely worth the read."
"I've read so many organizing, tidying, and decluttering books and none have quite spoken to me the way this one has. From the very first pages, I felt the author was a kindred spirit -- it was almost uncanny how she described my house, my situation... my bookshelves, my closets, and my craft room.  While it may seem a bit repetitive at times, it isn't so much repetitive as it is reinforcing the importance of certain steps and questions that are paramount to success.  I am so motivated, and I feel like, with time, I can take back my house and my space, thanks to this book."
"I've never been able to make as much progress in decluttering my house as I have by using Dana's strategies. Often I thought I was beyond help because no matter how many books I read on ""organizing"", it never helped. By the way, this is not a book about organizing. It's about decluttering, which turned out to be what I needed to do! If anyone thinks this is not a good book, it might be because they don't have the same problems/personality traits that we ""slobs"" have. If you've beat yourself up & felt hopeless & overwhelmed about the state of your house, give this book a try."
I can completely identify with her thought processes! It was perfect for my way of thinking and doing. Marie Condo is great and it helped a lot but this is actually much more relatable for me. She is real and her life and process of getting rid of things is much easier for me. How to declutter as you go and she relates all the same and angst I feel to get rid of things. Thank you Dana! I‚Äôm doing my garage right now and I needed the refresher and boost to get rid of more stuff!
"I needed a no-nonsense book that would help me with my clutter issues. I didn't want any cheesy pop-psychology stuff about holding items to my head and deciding if they fed my spirit or whatever. I needed realistic, sensible advice about dealing with stuff like the real world big girl I'm supposed to be.If you want a decluttering book that will ultimately help cosign the excuses you have for keeping stuff you don't really need, this isn't the one. The good news is there are plenty of decluttering books out there like that, so have at it. If you want to actually get in there and get things done in a no-nonsense way with a pleasant dose of humor, this book is a good choice."
This book is entertaining and her method is brilliant for those who are completely overwhelmed with clutter.  My parents are borderline hoarders and I am looking for help.  This is the approach that I think could actually help them have a breakthrough.  I‚Äôm hopeful!  Author is witty and SO real.  She has a forgiving attitude towards those who struggle because she does herself.  Unique advice.  Thank you this is a blessing to have found.
"An easy an interesting read with some good suggestions and thinking of decluttering as I hadn't thought of it before. Thinking about your house as a container that can only comfortably hold so much and keeping only what fits and makes living comfortable.  Now I have to start implementing these ideas, keeping in mind only keeping favorite things to simplify tossing out.  A lot of good ideas in the book."
"If you are looking for strategies to finally rid your space of constant clutter, this book is for you! Not only does Dana White offer a step-by-step process for ""deslobification,"" she also offers it up in a way that seems doable and takes everyday life into account. Whether you're a young parent overrun with kid stuff, and adult child helping a parent declutter before downsizing, or anything in between, this book is the kick in the pants you need to start getting rid of that needless STUFF that surrounds you.I read a publisher's advanced reader copy of this book and have given my honest review."
"Although often repetitive, that's what some of us need! In the back of my head, I felt I really knew most of this ... but sometimes you need to hear it from someone else for it to ink in! I could absolutely identify with many of Dana White 's stories. At times I thought she'd bring spying on me (joke)! I loved her witty style and feel more equipped to start decluttering TOMORROW!"
"Great book when you get passed the ''grim"" subject matter.  I'm putting what I learned in practice.  Already gave some keepsakes to my sons and participating in a neighborhood garage sale this weekend as well as made a haul to Goodwill.  I just don't want my sons to go through what I did when my parents passed.....seeing items which I'm sure meant something to them, but not to any of us.... so sad."
"I literally can‚Äôt say enough good things about this book! I originally got it because I have a few hoarding friends and family members that refuse to help themselves or read self-help books,  so I wanted to read this and keep tips and tricks in my back pocket if they ask me for advice. I ended up really decluttering the hidden spaces in my house and every bag that left, made me feel free and airy. I couldn‚Äôt believe how easy the process was once Dana explained her steps. I will be recommending this book to many, and sharing what I‚Äôve learned as well."
"I first read this book online.through Amazon...I started applying what I was learning right away....at the start of Covid 2020...I think the best thing I can say about this book  is that it is easy to read, follow, and apply...not only that, butas I have ""slipped"" back into an old habit or two...I ordered the soft cover book to have here at home...No more excuses!!  Buy it, read it, DO it!!"
"If the thought of getting rid of your clutter is overwhelming, this is the book for you. I love the method of decluttering outlined I these pages, truly allowing for whatever time we're able to squeeze in as our crazy lives don't always fit injury a neat schedule. Embrace the chaos of life and follow this method to take the clutter we tend to collect. The book gets repetitive, but it needs to be."
"I have read Dana‚Äôs blog ‚ÄúA Slob Comes Clean‚Äù, listen to her podcasts, read her first book ‚ÄúHow to Manage Your Home without Losing Your Mind‚Äù and just finished this one. Let me just say thank you, Dana, for all your hard work and honesty.  Your deslobification journey and hard earned expertise have helped so many including myself. I‚Äôm probably more of a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person by your definition, but you‚Äôve opened my eyes to things that I‚Äôd never considered. I always had issues with laundry and keeping sentimental clutter. After having my son I felt as though I was always miles behind in cleaning. My mother was the kind of woman who always had a meticulously clean home with everything in its place, a magazine-worthy home. When it came to mine, I found myself shoving neatly packed containers filled with items I had forgotten about years before but couldn‚Äôt seem to part with deep into my closets and sheds. You‚Äôve helped me understand that just going through a box can open my eyes and realize that I‚Äôve been holding on to an empty box packed inside of a box and exactly one item. Now we display our truly sentimental items and everything else is straight out of the door as soon as possible.Thank you again Dana. Your books, blog, and podcast are a true gift to the world."
"A.big.help for.clutter butts.like.myself. unfortunately, no.Samantha ""wiggle-your-nose"".magic.incantations though. You still have to work at it. And I am still working...ENDLESSLY!!!!....at it. For people like me, every little bit helps.and.this was.one of those hands up. Her youtube videos.help too, but I like the book too."
"I really love this book. I'm still reading it but I bought it at the right time...right when I needed it. A friend shared it on facebook a couple of weeks ago so I decided to buy it for my kindle immediately.I started decluttering out of necessity before I read the book and I feel like she gets me. Her solutions and ideas that worked for her make so much sense. This book was written for me! I see myself reading this book over and over again...when I need it. I'm currently working on my home office right now and it feels good to just throw it out or donate. Thank you, Dana!"
"Just like Dana, I've had a lifetime struggle with clutter. I've ready many other books about decluttering, organizing, etc. None have gotten to the heart of the matter like this one has. As I was reading this book, it felt like she knew me better than I knew myself. I'm ready, in fact already started, to get rid of the stuff that gets in the way of living my life. Dana, thank you for baring your cluttered soul to help other like-minded individuals live the life they were meant to live (and enjoy)."
"I've purchased WAY too many self help books over the years and never read as far as the second chapter on most of them. I read this cover to cover (skipped a couple chapters that did not apply), read a chapter - go work on a declutter project - read a chapter - go work ... this is SUCH a motivator.  I had a copy, lost it, bought it when needed it again later lol. Got clutter? Get this."
"This is the most life-changing book I have ever read. I could never quite get on board with some other organizing guru‚Äôs methods, but Dana White‚Äôs way of explaining and describing things is so right-on. I realized I‚Äôm a project person too...this has helped me in so many ways! I can‚Äôt even detail how helpful this book was for me ‚Äî and I also bought the audio book!"
"Feel like she is here beside me.....but even better, wish she were my friend who lives next door!  I have read other decluttering books, listened to bloggers, etc and have not been as excited to change my ways!Only one-third thru the book but feel ready to tackle the most dreaded of jobs....purging!  Well written, easily understood and capable of relating and actually following her theories/rules."
"I like how Dana tells stories you can relate to. Also, describes the How and Why the container method works. Very encouraging, I don't want to give it all away. It is a great book to read or listen to while decluttering.I love the ""Just Declutter"" Action over intention and woulda-shoulda-coulda-"" DID"" shirts too!"
"Looking for something different, this was not it"
"Doable, realistic strategies for making progress, coupled with a fun, conversational tone. Highly recommended!"
"A really practical, no-nonsense useful book.  It is going to make a difference in my life.  Many thanks to Dana"
Love the solutions and methods mentioned in the book. So helpful. I‚Äôve been following bits and pieces while reading the book and things are changing in my home even while I‚Äôm a mostly overwhelmed housewife/mom of 2/breastfeeding mom/entrepreneur/architect.
Very helpful!  Haven' finished reading it yet.
Good insight and sense of humor
"So entertaining, motivating and helpful! I have 7 children and found this book so helpful in me finding a way to keep my house under control and clean!"
This book is Realistic and kept me laughing. I have moments of personal epiphanies. I‚Äôve bought her other book and have purchased this as gifts now!
Practical step-by-step-by-step advice on decluttering. Not on cleaning or maintaining a good-enough clean (that's in her most excellent first book.) A guide to achieving more by working toward less WITHOUT making a bigger mess in the process.
Loved this book. Reading it over and over keeps me on track. Dana is wonderful--understanding and funny.
"SUMMARY:Stuff. Everyone has it, everyone struggles with it. With homes filled to the brims with items and needing help with this crazy dilemma, author Dana White has stepped in to help with her new book, Decluttering At The Speed of Life. Not complicated, easy to follow, enjoyable to read, and full of simple decluttering ideas, this book takes the dread out of decluttering. Coming from personal experience and acting as a mentor and coach, the author tackles the emotional and physical challenges by going room-to-room with a positive mindset.A PENNY FOR MY THOUGHTS:Having picked up this book and browsed it at the library, I knew I had to have my own copy to read thoroughly. Understanding that life is busy and can get in the way of even the best intentions, Decluttering At The Speed of Life accounts for those distractions while also working through other decluttering difficulties. Making the process very easy and straight-forward, reading this book will encourage you to purge the unnecessary from your home while creating a more peaceful, healthy and productive lifestyle.RATING:5 (out of 5) pennies*I received a complimentary copy of Decluttering At The Speed of Life From BookLook Bloggers For my honest review*"
"I'm not going to lie, I went into this book not ready to take it seriously - it was more like mild curiosity (and it was free to borrow with my Prime so I figured 'why not?'). Although I absolutely knew I needed to declutter, I arrogantly thought there was NO way a book was gonna convince me to let go of enough of my stuff to make any real difference.I. Was. SO WRONG.I started out skimming through the book and somewhere about halfway through, a particular paragraph struck a chord in me. Soon after I started the book over to read it word for word. I made it through the first few chapters and felt so inspired, I immediately began decluttering. I've now spent the last several days doing massive purges; I literally filled my husbands truck bed with donations and I'm but a few boxes shy of having a second full truck load. Every time I'd get overwhelmed or unsure or indecisive, I'd stop and read some more and this would always light my fire again.Dana writes in such way that it honestly felt more like a conversation rather than reading a book. I felt encouraged, understood, validated, and celebrated during my entire decluttering process, yet it was just me and this book. Decluttering momentum is no joke!I was NOT expecting this spontaneous read to spur a life changing week but here I am, feeling so much lighter and with a completely altered perspective of my home and its contents."
"Just finished this book and I‚Äôm dying to tackle my house/closets/cabinets!! (I‚Äôll wait till morning when kids are awake and at school though.) So many excellent tips and different perspectives that I‚Äôd never considered are within these pages. Dana‚Äôs writing flows nicely and feels like she‚Äôs one of your best friends, not someone belittling the fact that your house is cluttered. Her method to decluttering is broken down in a way that makes it very easy to follow. If I keep the book in the forefront of my brain and repeat her steps to myself while going through closets and shelves, I have no doubt I will be much more successful than i have been in the past!Thank you for the advice, Dana!!I was given a copy of this book by the publisher. The review is my honest opinion."
"This book was written for me; at least, that is how it felt. On every page, Dana K White said something that spoke to me. From the never-ending cleaning (I call it chasing the mess around), having supplies on hand for every eventuality, to the accumulation of crafting materials, the eBay inventory, the inability to have company on short notice. I was hooked before I was through the introduction.The container concept! It seems so simple, and how did I not figure this out myself? In the week since I've read the book, I have cleared out 2 kitchen cabinets plus a hutch, my entire bedroom closet, and donated 2 trunk-loads along with a couple of boxes that are headed to the consignment store.Thank you Dana for writing this book. The title of this review may be misleading though. I fully intend to read How To Manage Your Home Without Losing Your Mind."
"Decluttering at the Speed of Life: Winning Your Never-ending Battle with Stuff by Dana K. White is a very down-to-earth and realistic look at how the clutter gets into our homes, why it stays there and why it is so hard to get rid of.There are chapters for each room of the house, plus chapters on dealing with the clutter of your kids, spouse and senior parents. Ms. White offers four simple steps to deal with clutter. The first is ""trash."" Pick up, bag up and immediately throw away the trash. That is the easiest clutter. The next easiest clutter is the ""easy stuff"", which is stuff that has a home but isn't in it. Like the pen that is in the bathroom. The third category is the ""duh clutter"", like ""duh, I hate yellow, so why do I have three yellow shirts?"" The fourth category is the most difficult. It is the part where you ask two questions. Where would I look for it? and ""If I needed this item, would it occur to me that I already had one?""After that, there are a few more things. Make it fit. Your house is your container. Each room is a sub-container. A drawer, bin or shelf is a sub-sub container. Once you fill the designated spot, that is all you get to keep.What I liked the most was the chapter about dream clutter. So you always had dreams of making your own beeswax candles (or whatevers). But the candle supplies have been in a box for 14 years. Pass on the dream to someone else. I also enjoyed the chapter about the hassle factor. So maybe you think you want to make money off your clutter. So you're going to list every hank of yarn or baby item or kitchen tool on Ebay. You're going to drop off at the consignment shops and yard sale the rest. Yeah, right. She advocates donating because it has a low hassle factor and you can call a place to pick it all up for you. So you barely have to do anything. She does understand those who do need to reap some of their investments back, though.I didn't find any negatives about this book. I received a free copy of it from the publisher."
I really enjoyed this helpful work on decluttering. Ms. White shares great tips and specific rules that help in the process. I‚Äôd love to share the questions but then others might decide they don‚Äôt need to get the book. The book read easily and the method of questioning makes great sense.The suggestions/guides are shared with experience and humor.The first weekend I got my husband to help me clean a room that was a real mess. We filled a large bag with trash and two boxes of giveaway items. That was just the visibility level so there is still more to do but it was a big improvement.I am guilty of buying items I like but not using them...because I like them. An example is candles. Now I have boxes and cabinets with lovely candles that I don‚Äôt use. So I have to decide to use them up or donate them if I want to clear that space.I have also been implementing the tips during my Christmas gift organizing. I have pulled gifts that I won‚Äôt ever give to anyone (either expired or outgrown) and put many in a donate box. Some I have put in a box for future giving but I made a list so I won‚Äôt forget what I have.My husband and I want to downsize our house but first we need to declutter our belongings! This book will help. It is nice that the implementation can be small as that is all the time I have had‚Ä¶ but it has helped. Even five minutes a day can make a difference. I recommend this to people who want to declutter their places and lives.Source: NetGalley 2018.  My rating 4.5.
"I followed the rules in my living room and it's completely clean. Not presentably clean, not ""good enough."" Like the whole room is done. That stupid pass-thru to the kitchen that collects junk on its ledge - clear. The cabinet behind the sofa where my husband loves to set important papers for reasons I will never understand - clear. No laundry, no dishes, that stack of old board games with missing pieces - outta here. Usually I get this room ""decent"" and just sigh at the seemingly never ending piles. These methods are ""duh"" for most people but some of us just operate differently. And having someone explain it in such a way that my weird brain gets it is amazing. I realize now that my house ISN'T as bad I thought. To be sure it doesn't look great, but I realize now how to deal with it all and it doesn't seem nearly as daunting."
"Book Review: Decluttering at the Speed of Life: Winning Your Never-Ending Battle with Stuff by Dana K. WhiteI call myself a neat freak, but I also feel that I could do with a lot less stuff in my house. Working full-time and having family obligations does not leave much time to declutter and start decorating rooms with a theme, so I was hoping this book would give me some ideas how I can clean up my house without needing to set aside time for projects etc.The book does deliver on the basic promise that decluttering does not need to be a major undertaking that requires time set aside on weekends, but can happen as part of everyday life.  So for me this book was an excellent read.One thing I like is that the author instills humor into the book. While the book is in general a hoe-to guide to clean up your act and your house, it is done so in an entertaining way that makes reading not boring, but something you actually enjoy to do. Which is important because I normally would not read a book in this subject since I also think that I do not have time to declutter to begin with. So after having started on this book, I made short mental notes about what to do in the breaks that I would otherwise sit around and drink coffee or wipe the kitchen counter for the 15th time that day. I use these breaks to declutter. If I see an old box in the pantry that I moved for the umpteenth time, I now take it and trash it. If it did not get used for the last year and the expiration date is way in the past, remove it. Same for clothing; I have in the past moved blouses around and around - still neatly hanging them in the closet, but now I have a second hamper in the bathroom for just these items that are intended for the donation door at the thrift store.When I have more time, such as an hour, I actually tackle a closet in the kids room or a closet in the office and come prepared with plastic bag in hand. This gives me a reasonable timeframe to get something done and still does not require me to set too much time aside.As you can see, the book is already paying off for me and I am sure it will pay off for most readers. Decluttering, I found, has another benefit. Now that I am removing items from the house, I also am very careful what is being bought. I do not want to reclutter my house and then have to go through the decluttering process again.Disclaimer: I received a free book in exchange for an honest review. The opinion expressed is solely my own and has not been influenced by any third party."
"Dana‚Äôs book is easy to understand and the ideas she gives are fairly easy to apply to my, what currently feels like, everyday decluttering life. Kids toys and my clothes are my biggest issues and her advice is so simple yet practical. I not only learned a lot, but I enjoyed reading this. This is not a dry, boring ‚Äúhow to‚Äù book. Dana‚Äôs fun personality comes off of the pages. I recommend this book and will be referring back to it as I continue my decluttering journey."
"The ""deslobification"" idea just resonated with me. It sounded funny but I could relate to that! If you are ready to get the trash out of your home, enjoy the stuff in your home that you love and finally donate those things that you are just storing...for who knows when...then you will probably enjoy reading this book as much as I did!! The process worked for me, quicker that I imagined! Now my home is cleaner, I know where things are because they belong in specific places in my home and I have less stuff to take care of. Thank you Dana! You really understand how to share what you learned!! I am so glad your book deals with the whole house, not just organizing parts within my home!!"
"This book is like a writing assignment where the instructor requested a 2,000 word essay and the student only wrote 200 words but managed to drag it out so it was exactly 2,000 words.  After the author drolls on and on repeating the same thing she then starts writing about how to help your friends declutter.  But wait, that's not all.  We then go into chapters helping your family declutter repeating the same old thing. In summary, the declutter concept is useful, the presentation is long and drawn out."
"I recently had the opportunity to review her new book, ‚ÄúDecluttering at the Speed of Life‚Äù and let me just say, it is the perfect companion to any Spring cleaning mission. In her typical style, Dana keeps your interest while informing you of the best ways to declutter your home and keep it decluttered. She goes into so much more than surface level wiping and mopping, she addresses heart issues behind why we keep junk.In the second part of the book, you‚Äôll see a lot more practicality. I love how she broke each chapter up by room and gives readers a detailed list of what to do. It‚Äôs sort of like you have Dana White holding your hand through the entire process. I‚Äôm using this book as my literal Spring cleaning bestie, going room by room decluttering. So far, it is going better than ever!As I read this book, I find myself craving space. It feels good to just get rid of all the things! This book was the kick in the pants that I needed to bring a little more minimalism to my life. If you‚Äôre looking for realistic, quick, decluttering systems, you‚Äôre going to want to add this book to your bookshelf."
"Wow! I've just finished my first read (and I intend to re-read), but I am surprised by how much this book affected me. I have followed Dana's blog and podcast for quite some time, so I already know I like her voice and perspective, but this book was particularly insightful about the emotional trials that come along with all the other challenges associated with decluttering, for yourself or with others.If, like me, you are already familiar with Dana's podcast and blog, I will begin by saying that the major concepts here won't be new to you (particularly the life-altering ""container concept""). But she delves deep and adds more detail, more information, and more answers to questions that may have barely formed in your mind previously. I loved it! It really got me moving and building decluttering momentum, and simplified a process I was over-complicating in my brain!And, if you have her first book (how to manage your home without losing your mind), be assured that this is not a rehashing. It is an excellent companion to the other, and the reading and implementation of strategies from both books will definitely be of benefit to anyone who struggles with a feeling overwhelm when looking around their home. However, you do not have to have previously experienced any other work to find benefit in Decluttering at the Speed of Life.I was lucky enough to receive an ARC of this book in exchange for my honest review, and I would unreservedly recommend it to others who struggle with mess /clutter / stuffocation."
"I too, am a slob. I like to think that I could have a clean house if I wanted too. But the truth is I consistently make choices that lead to a messy house. 30+ books on how to clean your house, make an organizing plan, keep your garage clean, include your spouse and children in your cleaning plan, haven't made a dent in our clutter.This book doesn't give me a decluttering strategy. It doesn't tell me how to think about my stuff. It shows me how to change my thinking about my living space. *lightbulb moment* If my stuff won't fit into my container -don't buy a new container- let the stuff go. Simple. Powerful. Freeing.Yesterday I took my girls to their room with a trash bag and a box and we decluttered for 30 minutes. We walked away with a bag full of trash, a fully visible floor, a dresser with all the drawers closed and neatly made beds. They didn't donate anything (the almost overflowing closet, shelves and drawers can be retackled later) but they willing threw away school papers and coloring pages that littered their room. I call that progress. Not perfect but better.If you want a book that will challenge you to change the way you look at storing your stuff so that you can have the house you've always wanted this is it! This book will not give you a perfect house but the questions Dana gives you to ask about your stuff will give you the freedom to make your home cleaner. I'm buying a second copy so I can loan it out!"
"For the last few years, I've been on a mission that I call 'Simplify'.  This generic term covers all aspects of my life, but one of the primary ways has been a decluttering of my living space.  I came across this title in my Prime Free reading options this month and I thought I'd see if there was more I could be doing  or do it more efficiently in my ongoing pursuit of simplication through decluttering.I really enjoyed the author's approach to the subject matter.  She approaches this as a mental state of being- a decision that change must take place- and warns of the hardships ahead of parting company with 'treasures', but then she leaves the esoteric behind to provide a solid winning formula.How do I know its solid?  Well, (pats self on the back) I was already doing most of that with out the snazzy labels and steps and it was working.  Okay, so I was doing a lot of it, but yes! Yippee! Woohoo! There were indeed some additional, practical steps and tips that I had not considered incorporating or that made some of the agony go away.Without giving away the spoilery stuff (the actual formula- Decluttering at the Speed of Life), I'll say that she approaches her house in a layer approach:  Daily Stuff, Clutter, and Cleaning.  This book addresses that second layer of Clutter.  Her formula involves a four-step process and is designed for any space and any amount of time frame so its flexible for each person's unique situation.She suggests starting with the 'visible' and 'living areas' of the home first.  This means where guests will see and where people do most of their living and are hampered by clutter.  Her approach is simple- deal with the least agonizing (like trash or daily drop pile stuff) and working up to the big decision stuff.  It's easiest in the living space rooms that guests see.  Then progress to bedrooms, closets, and storage.  Hobby or Craft or game rooms that are the most likely to be turned into dumping areas.Incidentally, I thought a tip that was helpful about decluttering a space is to first determine it's function like in those guest/office/hobby rooms that end up catch-alls because the space hasn't been defined (and this makes it hard to oust the clutter because it has no set primary purpose).She also carefully says not to deal with 'dream' clutter until the last.  I thought this was interesting because I figured it would be best to clear a space and move to the next space.  But, then I got it.  Dream clutter is the toughest to let go of.  It's best to start with the easiest to toss or donate and then get used to the idea and get used to the wonderful feel of functional space before heading into emotional attachment territory.That leads me to say that she deals with our struggles with guilt when it comes to holding onto stuff.  This can be pantry items because we feel guilty tossing food or clothes when someone may be going without.  She kept bringing it back to 'will you eat it or wear it NOW?' No?  then get rid of it.  Leaving it on your shelf or in your closet is not doing that nameless needing person any good.  Use the guilt to shop to intentionally meet actual needs and bring home less next time.She also covers the guilt of keeping something put away that was gifted by a good friend or relation when you don't really like it and/or don't ever use it.  Aunt Susie made those pot holders to be used.  Grandma Anna is gone and won't know that you passed on her turkey platter because you prefer the one you bought.  And, I saw myself doing 'x, y, z' rather than what your true reality is.  Yep!  This area was my big epiphany one.She also addressed the Useful vs Actually Using issue which is another weak spot for me.  If there isn't space and it isn't in immediate use then it must be donated.  Freeing the space to use the things you actually use is more important than keeping tons of extra on the outside chance it will someday find use.  This also led to the understanding of cutting clutter off before it even comes inside the door by not buying bulk or because its on sale for future potential use, but only if it will, in fact, be used.Then, after going over her method and steps and how to address different types of household spaces, she went over how to deal with other's clutter.  This was: friends, kids, older family, spouses, moving, and clearing out the home of someone gone.  I found the reminders of how to navigate the complications of helping others to be where I hit pay dirt because I do share my living space with others and I have been asked to come help others or help clear out for others.Through and through, this was practical and helpful.  She has another book about getting organized around the house that sounded like it was a good pairing to go with this one.  She also has a blog that might also be helpful.  My takeaway is a sense of renewed motivation and plans for working at my goal smarter and not harder."
"I laughed and I cryed my way through this book.  I saw myself on every page.  But, most important of all, I found the encouragement I needed to start letting go of years and years, and piles and piles of ""stuff"" that was stealing my living space and my happiness.  I found the desire to declutter my apartment and my mind of ""things"" that have robbed me of joy and self-esteem since childhood.Thank you so much for for sharing your story and your methods with me.  You gave me hope!"
"This book totally clicked for me, because the focus was on her 'container' concept. Maybe this is common sense to a typical tidy person, but I am hoarder lite. I was way too trapped by picking up cute and cheap/ on sale items that might be useful someday, for future projects. I felt better having things on-hand, just in case.  I never gave any thought to where I would put it, or if I had the space for it at home. I just figured it would go somewhere... hence clutter.The mind shift is to think of your whole home as containers- you can keep whatever you like (there is no emphasis on justifying why to keep or discard something), BUT it must fit into any given container and be easily accessible.  This is about learning limits (because you should not just think of adding more storage units) I am good at shoving and piling things compactly, but then never being able to get to the bottom or easily open something. I typically forget what is placed where.Sure there are similarities to Marie Kondo's:  take it out all at once, throw everything on the bed method- in that you do need to see what exactly you own. But she recommends doing this one item at at time, as soon as you touch something, decide if it's trash/ donation/ and then put it away to wherever makes sense for you. So when normal life interrupts you, you're never stuck with some huge pile that may take quite some time to sort out.This book solely focuses on de-cluttering, and she goes room by room. She does not try to offer organizing tips- the goal is to declutter and decrease so that it will naturally be easier to organize (Similar to Kondo's ideas. Take away first before you try to organize what you truly want to keep). Generally, you will force yourself to see/ touch all you exactly own and deal with it one item at a time."
I love the way this lady thinks! I'm already reaping the benefits of her approach and the effects are already spilling over into other areas of my life and home. It's not my first rodeo with decluttering either. I may actually be able to be done with decluttering AS A PROJECT THAT'S ALWAYS HANGING OVER MY HEAD at some point and just have it be a normal part of regular life like doing dishes or vacuuming. I LOVE the way Dana takes the emotion and angst out of it. Can't say enough good things about this book. Love her YouTube videos too! Decluttering videos I actually ENJOY and feel better after watching than before. Thank you Dana.
"**I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.**Unless you are already living the life of a complete minimalist, chances are you have a clutter situation somewhere in your house. This is your guidebook for working your way out. Dana is funny, sympathetic, and just bossy enough. Her method is easy and practical, because it works, no matter how much time you have to devote to decluttering. Got 5 minutes? Great! Throw away trash. It'll make a difference. Got half an hour? Perfect! Take all those random things that have been hanging out on the kitchen counter to the places you'd look for them first. Visible improvement! Got a weekend? Tackle those mystery boxes in the garage or attic one at a time. Decluttering at the Speed of Life also covers the potential minefield subject of helping others deal with their clutter. Dana treats this with true sensitivity that will be an invaluable help to those who are decluttering with kids, aging relatives, or struggling friends. *I received and read an advanced copy from the publisher.*"
"I couldn't put the book down.  The simplicity struck a nerve in every way.  Simple, repetitive ( in a good way for remembering,) with real life situations and feelings, Dana makes the act of living with less less daunting in our materialistic world.  You would think we should all know this.  The words outlined a way to declutter and live with less that is really doable and easier than I thought possible.  It gives me the confidence that my home can be more livable and a happier environment without a lot of hassle and money.  Thanks for the encouragement and means to make living with others and things a little more enjoyable."
I found this very inspirational and full of worthy nuggets.
"This book allowed me to see a different side of Tyler Perry. I gained understanding and encouragement to pursuit your dreams. Keep God first , turn around and enjoy the view."
This book was very inspirational to me. It inspired me to never give up on my dreams. Keep pushing through as he did.
I enjoyed the way he so openly and lovingly explained his own experiences.
"I was pleasantly surprised at how much scripture was included in this book. I will recommend it to my friends, both believers and non-believers. It would make a good study, too, as each chapter includes questions (at the end)."
Reflected on many things while reading and sharing with others.
"I‚Äôd recommend this book to everyone who‚Äôs had it rough in life. This book taught me never to give up on my dreams, but mostly the ‚ÄúTree of life‚Äù analogy made me realize how important are ‚Äúroots‚Äù people in my life, from now on I will cherish them and love them because I am nothing without them. I‚Äôm glad I bought this book, thank you.üôè"
I like the way he started out with his live as a child and how to overcome  something by reading verses in the bible.
This is an excellent and enjoyable read! It is heart warming and uplifting.
I enjoyed his interview with Joel Osteen which inspired me to get the book.  I am not done reading it yet but I do like the positivity of it.
Awesome inspirational read
"Uplifting, honest and thought provoking"
Very good read
I love Tyler Perry! The was very enlightening and a great read.
Small little book packed with wisdom!
I love the book. The book was very inspirational.
Purchased as a gift for family members and myself.  We truly enjoyed reading this book.
N/A
XMAS gift.
Very happy with the book. It was like new.
"We love this book! My 18 month old asks to read it every night. It‚Äôs simple, models a simple and honest prayer, and the book itself is sturdy with thick flaps that a toddler can‚Äôt tear off. We love it so much that we gift at every baby shower we go to."
"I really like this book. It is well made, and my two year old and I read it every night before bed. I will say, though, I don't really like the ""Thank you for the food I eat, but I still don't like the taste of beets."" line. All of the other lines aren't funny, and I would have preferred something that didn't take away from the gratitude expressed about the food. Overall, it's a sweet book, though."
Cute and simple. My nine-month-old loves turning the pages and lifting the flaps. Beautiful message about being thankful/reflective and giving praise to God.
We read this nearly every night before bed. It's just the right length to keep my 9 month old's attention when she's sleepy and about ready to nod off for the night. She also really likes the flaps. I love the artwork and how the words flow. It's also nice that the children are somewhat diverse. This isn't a boy book or a girl book or a black book or a white book. It's a children of God book.
"We love this book, read it nightly. It has a great message. The flaps are easy for my 16 month old to lift (and thick enough to not rip)"
"My 22 month old son loves this book.  We're using it to introduce the concept of prayer at bedtime.  It's short and simple, and like all Cottage Press board books I have purchased, a very sturdy and durable lift-a-flap story.  We have to change the words for the part that says ""...but I still don't like the taste of beets,"" because my son absolutely loves beets.  It's a little strange that we have this expectation that kids won't or can't like certain types of foods.  Overall, though, a cute little book to incorporate at bedtime.  Five stars."
"This book is adorable.  The message, the drawings, even the cute little lift-the-flaps.  The reason I gave it only 3 stars is that the binding broke the very first day.  Our toddler was not being unusually rough on it, but it tore.  And because the binding is so strange, we were unable to repair it."
I got this book to read to my one year old and two year old about God. I want to start introducing to them who God is and what he created. This book is perfect for that my two year old is quickly getting the concept. I Read it to them every day before bed. I have been making it a routine that they get exited for it :)
"It was super cute up until, ""Thank you for the food I eat...but I still don't like the taste of beet."" I don't believe in suggesting or teaching negative associations with any food/vegetable.  I find it a real shame that they couldn't find something else to finish this rhyme.  Returning it."
"I've been on the lookout for Christian chunky, flap books for my son and this is THE ONE! I love this little book and my son does too. It's a nice book to read before he goes to bed and he really likes lifting the flaps. It's also very sturdy! My son is very hard on books. We have many books that have been duct taped back together. But not this one! This one is made very well and has a good story."
Cute little book
Awesome for a 1 year old
Easy to read. Fun loving book
So cute!
"I would have given this a 5 star, but the book was damaged on the henge m"
Great price! Love these books!
Bought for grandson‚Äôs baptism.
Adorable little book with a simple message of gratitude.
Nice thick flaps made to last
The pictures are adorable!!
"A little pricy, but it was worth it! My child and I both love the book and it is very durable!"
Beautiful book
"If you're looking for a book that will truly relieve your pain in life and bring you closer to God, this tome is a must-have to your library. Read the first chapter in a Kindle sample to see what I mean."
Loved It!!!Its a must read for those who struggle with the need to always please others.
Great book to learn with.
"If you are a people pleaser or a person that has a hard time saying no, this is the book for you.  it can help you on your journey to learn the fear of the Lord."
This is a great book! It challenged me a lot!
"Great book. Especially the last few chapters. One of those books where the title makes you understand the book almost immediately but you reading the book helps you see it played out. One of my favorite parts is the rejection of the 5 Love Languages and subtly seeing people as things to fill your needs. Remember, we are to need less and love more."
Great book
i love this book. It really challenged me to think differently about pride and relationships. I have recommended it several times and have seen several lives changed from it.
Exactly what I ordered and fast delivery. Thank you.
Regularly recommended at Reigning Grace Counseling Center especially to those struggling with Fear of Man.
This is a very readable book!  I would definitely recommend it to any Christian who wants to mature as a believer by learning to get their eyes off of self and unto God.
"This book is killin' it! So good. Really rich truths from the Bible about the causes and origins of fear-of-man and the solution. So simple, but profound."
What a refreshing book! It makes us look at how we truly don't think God can do anything. The author reminds us that God does everything! HE is sovereign !  Great book!
A must read!
Best book I've read on codependency
Thank you!!!
An excellent book to help you learn the fear of God over the fear of man.  It changed my life.
"This book is an eye opener for those of us who gotten the order for life completely flip flopped.  Not only does it open your eyes, but lovingly guides you to a right perspective on Who should be big in your life. Hint: it is not people.  This book will free you from self imposed or other imposed bondage."
Very helpful insights into how I have allowed others to influence me.
Be ready to be rocked!
Made me do a lot of sould searching.  Wish I had read it years ago.  Lot of scripture to reinforce what was said.
This book has really helped me to understand co-dependency from a Christian viewpoint and find a healthy solution.  I'm thankful I read it.
Great book.People are harmless next to the Almighty.
"A person I trust recommended Welch's book, and I found it offered many insights into life. I have often made people bigger than God in my life, and the book has helped me identify where I do that and how to stop. Making people bigger than God is a ""bigger"" sin than we realize, having a negative impact on our lives in many ways. For me, it's made me an anxious people pleaser, easily intimidated. The book points me to God's word, which gives me courage. I am thankful for Welch and his words of wisdom."
It fits the online description exactly. I would recommend this to friends and family. The book cover and pages are in good condition.
So important to remember WHO is important!
I learned so much from this book.  It helped me realize how sslfish and prideful i can be. Dr. Welch shows you how to love God most and be in awe of him ...then love people.  I thought he had some wonderful insights
I really needed to read this!  It's awesome!
Anyone who is honest will find this topic relevant in their life.  Welch exposes our tendency to be trapped into pleasing people instead of pleasing God.  I have purchased 6 copies of this book to give away in the last 5 months and I will give away more in the next year.
Wonderful book.
"This book revolutionizes how counseling should be done. It emphasizes hurts, hangups and habits and Edward Welch describes how people come from a 'leaky cup' and looking for some self fulfillment. This is for any Christian who is growing in their walk for God, counselors and even those that need to be counseled. For me I especially needed this book. A friend of mine recommended it to me. I struggled with a 'habit' 'addiction' and overcoming the shame and guilt and really overcoming it completely. This book really revolutionized my thinking into fearing God, serving and loving others and not using people for my means or find ways to gratify the flesh but to glorify God. In the end it's about the Glory of God and how he gets it all. He can do the impossible and use impossible people to do it with. In fact with my job I will be doing lots of pastoral counseling while at the same time needing counseling for myself. It is helping me move on. To seek the Lord, fear him, serve him, and love others. His book title fits it completely- ""When people are Big and God is Small"" that's exactly what most of the Human race is doing right now. This book also helps us overcome peer pressure, fear of man, and our own short comings as we grow in our walk with the Lord to all believers. A highly recommended book."
"I'll have to admit, I was a little leery of this book from the title - peer pressure, codependency - come on, another Christian psycho-babble book?  But I read it since a friend was reading it and I'll admit - I was wrong.  When People Are Big is an outstanding book that has something to say about the self-centered psychology of Freud and Maslow - it's all focused on the wrong thing: man.  Welch, himself a Ph.D. recipient in counseling psychology chooses to focus on God's Word as the source of truth and understanding regarding the nature of man.  His basic concept is that man is created to bring glory to God and in saying this notes that God has designed us with certain ""needs"" or ""desires"" that are to be fulfilled by God Himself.  The problem arises, according to Welch, when we replace the proverbial God-shaped vacuum in our lives with temporal things of this world that are not only unable to satisfy our longings, but in fact prohibit God from being able to!  As man turns to self for ""actualitization,"" he finds that his highest purpose doesn't really supply meaning or significance.  Only in a proper relationship with God through the sanctifying work of Christ on the cross can man truly understand his true nature and true self.Ultimately, Welch argues, the problem with man is low esteem for his Creator.  If we truly lived before an Audience of One, Welch believes that many of our daily ""problems"" would be solved with a proper perspective - we would see ourselves in a proper light and we would see that we are not the source of that light, but created to be the reflectors of it to others.  One of the great paradoxes of the Christian life is truly understanding ourselves - totally depraved and unworthy of salvation, yet by the grace of God we are made into heirs to the throne clothed with the righteousness of Christ Himself!  The key, Welch states, is our ability to realize that this transformation from rags to riches is not based upon who we are or what we can accomplish, but rather on the work of a Holy and Merciful God.This is a great book for every Christian today - we all have problems and trials we face, we all have people that we give too much power over our lives, we all need a greater appreciation for and understanding of the majesty of God.  Welch concludes that if we could just understand what Scripture is seeking to show us, that our lives would be radically transformed - not only a saving grace would be ours, but a sanctifying grace that would overflow into the lives of those around us - even those we despise and dislike!  Francis Schaeffer wrote a classic little book titled The Mark of a Christian and in it claims that the world will know we are Christians by our love for each other - Welch agrees with this sentiment and helps us understand why we haven't arrived at this place yet!"
"'The law is wonderful in that it reveals the holy character of God.' p 110This book presents the regretful truth of fallen man.'Therefore we cannot rightly say, 'My God is not a God of judgment and anger; my God is a God of love.' Such thinking makes it almost impossible to grow in the fear of the Lord. It suggests that sin only saddens God rather than offends Him.' p 103'There was a time in my own life when I would practice the presence of God; then, when I felt His presence, I would pray. All went well, until the day I didn't feel His presence.' p 83'The emphasis on self-esteem also contributes to the fear of man. For example, even though most self-esteem books indicate that it is something you can develop by yourself, almost all the books also say that one of the best ways to raise your self-esteem is to achieve some successes (which are then compared to what others do) or to surround yourself with people who affirm you (which leaves you dependent on their opinion).' p 75This would be my first choice book to work through in a small Bible study group. Not only does Edward T Welch succeed in challenging our faulty 'Dr Phil' views, but he re-addresses our low view of God, in a practical and pastoral way. The subject matter is interrelated with our steadfastness and faithfulness, all of whom could benefit by reading this wonderful book.'This is a time when you must be controlled by the truth of God more than your own feelings. God's Word, not feelings, is our standard. To be driven by your fluctuating sense of well-being may seem spiritual, but it is wrong. It exalts our interpretation above God's.' p 170 'Such thinking is based on the unbiblical assumption that our works can either keep us away from God or move us toward Him. It is a denial of grace itself.' p 69"
"Do you fear people? Do you control your actions based on what others have done or may do to you, or may think of you? Do you respond either in terror (major or minor) or great affection?  If you answered yes, you're an idolater. ""Our problem is that we need [others] (for ourselves) more than we love them (for the glory of God)."" (p. 19)In this book about the consequences of big people and a small God, there are answers. Because the fear of man doesn't manifest itself in the same way for everyone, Welch writes about the different symptoms we may experience. Among them, a push for self-esteem, shame, compromise, neediness, worldliness, and a feelings-oriented worldview.But, as promised, there are answers. Or, rather, there is an Answer. The point of counseling philosophy - secular or sacred - is to offer a diagnostic system of redemption. ""Here's your problem...here's how the problem can be resolved/fixed/cured/healed...Please go and live in happiness now."" What Welch offer is not a system of redemption, but rather our Redeemer.""If you have ever walked about giant redwoods, you will never be overwhelmed by the size of a dogwood tree. Or if you have been through a hurricane, a spring rain is nothing to fear. If you have been in the presence of the almighty God, everything that once controlled you suddenly has less power."" (119)The answer? Know God, and grow in the fear of Him. As we see God for who He really is, we will see ourselves (and other people) for who we all are: ""someone completely dependent on Him."" ""Self-serving needs are not meant to be satisfied; they are meant to be put to death...We love not because people have psychological deficits; we love because God first loved us. The image of God in us is not about psychological need..."" (163)Welch compassionately reveals the depths and subtleties of our sin, but he doesn't leave us hanging. He provides us with a beautiful picture of the only Answer we need: Know your God. Always be growing in your knowledge of Him. He is a redwood not among dogwoods, but among blades of grass, and when once you understand that in Christ, His gaze is not one of wrath or condemnation, but of love and grace, you will realize that ""this is the gaze that transforms. It will expel the fear of man and be a blessing for all God's people.' (239)"
"Welch has written a gem on the need for us to realize how great God really is and how we need to stop fearing other people so much!The focus of Welch's book is to have a greater healthy fear of God to the point that other people have less power and control over our lives.The points Welch describes in his book include:1.  The fear of God is the best treatment for the fear of man.2.  Jesus was not a people-pleaser.3.  Having more fear of man than God is idolatry.4.  When we fear God we think of ourselves less.5.  When we spend more time with God, opinions of ourselves and what others think of us matter less.6.  We should love people more and need them less (only God can truly provide for our needs).7.  We love others because God first loved us.8.  When God is reduced to our feelings, He becomes less awesome to us while people become larger.The ""fear of God"" may be defined as having a healthy reverence for God - He loves us and does not want us to be so afraid of Him that we are scared of having a personal relationship with Him.Read the book and be encouraged to be more concerned about what God thinks and less concerned about what other people think!"
"This is a great read for every Christian. Do you ever fight the problem of trying to do things that please people? Do you worry about what others think of you? Is your life filled with service projects or volunteer opportunities to enhance the view of who you are in the public eye?Why do we as humans do this? Why do we seek to please people and not God?This book does a great job of reminding us that it is God whom we serve. It is God who matters most in our lives and we should be most concerned with how HE views us, not how people view us.This book, I believe, is a must read for all college students before the enter the everyday work world. Learn how to Please GOD before you worry about how to please a boss, a spouse, your pastor, your friends, your parents, etc.You will not be disappointed with this book.Enjoy!"
"This is a book that many will probably offend many. Before God in His mercy saved me, I was heavily involved in 12-step groups such as Adult Children of Alcoholics and bought into the victim mentality, never taking responsibility for my own behaviors, which were and sometimes still are sinful to the core. I was abused as a child and grew up in an alcoholic home. While, I indeed was a victim, for many years I always lumped all my behaviors into one ball, confusing my own sinfulness with the sin others had committed on me. I was self centered and extremely self absorbed. All of the worldly therapy and numerous meetings and groups did was keep me stuck, giving me a false sense of security, that was actually pride. The bible teaches us throughout it's pages that we live to glorify God. Psalm 16:8-9 summarizes this when it says ""I have set the Lord before me; because He is at my right hand I shall not be shaken. Therefore my heart is glad, and my whole being rejoices; my flesh also dwells secure"". As I look back over my life and the traumatic events, I can take comfort in a sovereign God. Sure, I don't fully understand why He allowed things to occur, but we live in a fallen world, and we all are fallen and in need of a Savior. If you looking for a book that is a mixed bag of pop psychology and philosophy and empty deceit, with a few bible verses thrown in for a good appearance, this is not the book for you. But, if you want a book with sound theology that is thoroughly biblical, this is an awesome book."
"""Fear of man is such a part of our human fabric that we should check for a pulse if someone denies it."" (pp. 17).  Do I have your attention now?  At our church's recent seminar on ""How to Share Your Faith"" the topic of fear came up as a main reason we don't share the Gospel more often.  Since the Bible says that our hearts tend to turn all good things into idols, it should come as no surprise that the primary way we do this is with other people.  And this idol impacts us in countless ways!  From the back cover:  ""Pride, oversensitivity, defensiveness, avoidance of others, easy embarrassment, people pleasing, needing approval...You'll be surprised to learn how the fear of others controls you--and what you can do about it.""This is more than a self-help book - it is a theology book that reminds us of who God is, who we are, and how that relationship is supposed to look and impact all of our other relationships.  Ed Welch is a counselor, but he is also a theologian, and he combines the two to really examine our hearts and our Lord.  And his goal is not to dismiss your fears, but to place them in context.  ""If you have ever walked among giant redwoods, you will never be overwhelmed by the size of a dogwood tree.  Or if you have been through a hurricane, a spring rain is nothing to fear.  If you have been in the presence of the almighty God, everything that once controlled you suddenly has less power."" (pp. 119).  Knowing and fearing our God, exposes and cuts away the roots of our fears.  Understanding our idols (people), show us how they don't deliver what we ask of them:""People are our cherished idols.  We worship them, hoping they will take care of us, hoping they will give us what we feel we need.  What we really need are biblical shapes and identities for other people.  Then instead of needing other people to fill our desires, we can love people for the sake of God's glory and fulfill the purpose for which we were created."" (pp. 182).The book is broken down into two parts.  Part I is titled ""How and Why We Fear Others"" and  Part II is ""Overcoming the Fear of Others"".  His analysis of our hearts, our fears and the solutions to these issues are Biblical and Christ-centered through and through.  It is readable and practical.  It is helpful and hopeful!  This is one of the most important books I have read in my walk with the Savior, and I urge you to read it as well!  What have you got to lose - except the fears that bind you and rob you of your joy?"
"The book ""when People is Big and God is Small"" was in good conditions as the seller described. there was honesty in this description and it is in very good conditions!"
"This book hits on the head how easy it is to fear man and to look to other people for our worth. Our spouses, our friends, our kids - we have needs we expect them to meet and when they don't, our self-esteem can bounce all over place.But that's not the way God intended. We are to look to Him to have all our needs met, with our biggest responsiblity to others being to love and serve and not to look to them (others) to be fulfilled.It's a hard way of thinking to change. Who of us hasn't placed an emotional need on someone we love? It almost seems unhuman to be able to go our entire lives with no need of being validated by another person.But with God as our Father, His validation is the only we should need. I agree, but how to get to that place?This book is deep - sometimes to the point of becoming too many words. There were parts I got a lot out of and it's certainly convicting.My question is: How is it possible to live with no regard of what other people think of you and to have feelings of steel that don't get hurt when slighted? Haven't figured that one out!"
"Welch's book is a different view of the world that attempts to bring God to the forefront of our minds and lets the world's condemnation of us fall away.  Welch's central premise is that the the world in which we live wants to elevate itself above our conception and relationship with God, and that in order to restore a real healthy psychology God needs to loom large in our lives.  Our relationship with God, governed by a holy fear of the Lord, ought to take precedence over the desires and and fears of this world.  It is a great book and offers a revitalizing change of perspective on our relationship with God and the world."
"This book has a solid thesis: many of the problems we have with peer pressure, the fear of man, controlling or being controlled by others, and the like all have to do with fearing man rather than fearing God. I found the way Welch unpacks this idea a little tedious; each chapter seemed to restate the main idea and apply it with little difference.The second half of the book is more helpful. Welch gives several positive biblical examples of what the fear of the Lord looks like, and why we should strive to have it replace the fear of man in our hearts. His continuum of terror to worship shows the different forms our fear of God should take as we grow in our knowledge of him--the fear is never removed, but it matures into a healthy, reverential fear of the holy God who has befriended us in Christ. His paradigm of loving people rather than needing them, of seeking to serve others rather than having them serve our own purposes, is a good corrective to the self-centered pop psychology we are inundated with in the West.Welch's book is a good biblical antidote to peer pressure, codependency and the fear of man. With a proper understanding of who God is and the resulting fear of him, we have no need to fear men. Instead we can love and serve them the way God intends. This book is a great resource both for personal growth and as a reference for counseling."
"This book helps those who have trouble breaking free from the bondage of people-pleasing,caring more about what people think than necessary. Takes the reader to the spiritual bankrupcy of this kind of living, exploring Scriptures from the Bible. It was helpful to get to the basis of what causes this weakness in us, and how to replace it with living for God alone."
"... the book is as much about the theology of interdependence as it is about the psychology of overcoming codependent self-centeredness. Weaving a tapestry of Scripture, Welch builds a firm orthodoxy which embraces a healthy fear of God over the (always spiritually and sometimes physically) deadly fear of man.The applications for this book are wide-reaching. Yes, those of us who struggle with issues of codependency will find resources to help us begin the process of refocusing, turning our attention away from our selves and toward the Creator. However, I am convinced that ""normal"" people, trapped in the consumerist malaise of twenty-first century Christianity will discover the Biblical truth of interdependence in Christ which flies in the face of so much of today's prosperity-based pop theology. This book can change your life... and it can change your church as well, I think."
"Welch does an excellent job connecting with readers. He walks step-by-step through identifying ""fear of man"" and taking practical measures to replace this fear with a healthy fear of God. Challenging, convicting, and based solidly on Scripture."
"The author; Welch, does a wonderful job of presenting clear biblical examples, and good present day cases of fear, anxiety, etc.  this book helps remind us that the fear of man must never trump the fear of God.  Very insightful, and biblically sound.  I highly recommend this book for both the counselor and those looking for counsel in dealing with peer pressure, codependency and the fear of man."
"Welch writes clearly, insightfully, and biblically.  The content is of utmost relevance to our age.  Not only does he make his point clear, but he leads the reader to life-changing application of truth.  Every Christian  counselor, paricularly every God-fearing pastor who attempts to meet the  ""self-esteem"" needs of his flock, should read this book.  He  would do well to have an extra copy available to hand to counselees.As  a counselor and one who has struggled personally with self-worth, I have  found nothing as helpful or biblical as this book."
Excellent book. Great perspectives and wisdom for those that think people are bigger then they are!!  God is big and everyone else is small!
"Wonderful book on rediscovering the importance of God in our lives. God's approval should be enough. The question we should be asking at the end of the day is ""Was God pleased with me today?"" If people were pleased with us then count it as a bonus but not the focus.If you are a people-pleaser then I recommend this book to you. It will help open your eyes to why our relationship with God is suffering because of our relationship with people."
Heard a ton about this book. Finally went through it and I'm so glad I did. Only regret is that I hadn't read it sooner in my life. A must read! Thank you Edward Welch for your work on this.
It's a great little giant!  This book allows you quick access to supportive scripture.  I've used it many times and it helps.  The Word of the Lord is Light in the dark and this book just puts some powerful passages together in one convenient location.  Awesome!
A Blessing!  Very Powerful!
Best purchase ever!!! Helps you to remember your power through the word and strength through Christ !
Again  love Joyce Meyer. Memorizing and speaking God's Word has been such a help fit me
Arrived in great shape and in excellent condition. Great book
good
"Great ""little"", but powerful, book by one of my favorite people. Addresses, categorically, life issues with scripture to back up God's promises and help. Glad I bought it."
This book is my go to while on the go on my purse. I love the way its broken up into specific categories and give a helpful scriptures. I plan to get more for family and friends.
Wish I had this book many years ago.  I would recommend to everyone and anyone.
Loved it everyone should have this..and speak the word
"This books contains bible passages that are under certain topics like Faith , Trust etc. If you do not want to spend the time looking in the bible for things like that  , this is the book to get. But it does not in any way compare to the wisdom you could obtain searching for passages on your own. It makes a nice present or companion while travelling."
Joyce has compiled a list of scriptures for just about any situation we could face with an index to take you to the right section.
Great book that helps you personalize scriptural affirmations.  It's organized by topic and contains a lot of useful information.
This is the perfect vehicle for getting a quick biblical fix! Thank you.
Period.
was some what disappointed
Great book from a great seller
Great book! Written well! I got more out of the introduction than anything! Would recommend this book! This book reveals how important our words are and the power in them!... whether a Christian or not!
"Ice actually had this book for a while. I love it. I ordered this one as a partial birthday gift for my mother because what better gift can you give than to assist someone in having a positive christlike attitude... Came packaged with other things I had ordered the only Thing I can say is that it was not individually wrapped in plastic like all of the other books i ordered but there seems to be no damage so, no harm no foul. Over all I highly recommend this book. It has an index in the front where you simply look up a feeling of thought and it gives you a scripture to speak out over that situation/feeling, etc. Great tool for all Christians... Or anyone for that matter."
Fingertip scripture for special problems - super Joyce as always!!!
I literally read this everyday..my book is falling apart. Excellent.
"Sometimes we struggle with life events that mere words cannot help. This books shows you how to pray God's word back to him for whatever you are facing. And if friends and relatives are ill or facing crises, this little book will help you pray for their specific needs using the power of God's word!"
Very good book love it
It is a wonderful tool and easy to use.  I am amazed how easy it is to feel good with just a few scriptures.
Carry it with me all the time!  Thanks Joyce for putting it all together in a small and durable presentation form.
"üëçüëç a good read, great advice and suggestions.  I think every Christian should read this author at least once  great book"
This is great to use for personal affirmations. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a reference to keep handy.
You can't go wrong with any of Joyce Meyer's books.  Bought this for the Kindle app so I have it whenever and wherever I want it.
Great!
This was a gift for my Sister. She was so happy to receive it. Thank you so much for getting it to her in record speed.
this is the best book I use it as a scripture prayer guide.
This is one of Joyce. Meyers best books its smiple everyday bible verses that help with everything. If your new in christ or Coming back home its a must have book.also if your trying to learn bible verse awesome book to start with.
Wonderful book
"This is a wonderful book. For anyone searching for certain scriptures, that cover certain topics.....this book is for you.  It is very helpful, and this is now my second purchase."
I enjoy reading Joyce Meyer books.  This book is very helpful.
Love this book...must read
"The seller did a good job, no complaints."
Great
This book is a wonderful book to use during meditation or just to pray. I have used this book for many years and just started to recommend it to members of our church.
I pull this book out on my phone to pray and fellowship with Jesus. I think it is well put together and a great read.
I am a Joyce Meyer fan. So the only thing I can say it‚Äôs great
"This book really helped me see how fear must not have the final ""say."" It helped me to see that I need to not give in to my fear or make excuses because I am afraid. This is a must read book."
Was a gift
Love this book! This writing has helped me develop so much.
A good book to curl up with and connect to your spirituality while learning a thing or two!
Awesome book.
Just another good book by Joyce Meyer.  Arrived on time.
Great read
Good buy
Just like all of her books. Excellent.
"I read this book to my five-year-old grandson and he asked for me to read it to him two more times. Each time he had lots of questions about individual saints, patron saints, which saints did what, etc. He loved it, as did his three year old brother. I loved the book as well as the conversations it started. Highly recommend it."
Easy to read aloud. My granddaughter loved it.
This book is such a wonderful written book. It is very informative about saints & it is written so children understand it
A great book by an awesome author!
"Sometimes sanctity seems out of reach to both adults and children. How could we ever be like those holy people we see in statues or holy cards and read about in books? In I‚Äôm a Saint in the Making, Lisa Hendey offers a gentle introduction to what it means to be a saint and how children can live a life of sanctity in their daily lives.Hendey begins by explaining what it is that makes a person a saint. Saints are heroes whose superpowers include ‚Äúcourage, peacemaking, hope, faith, and love.‚Äù Each saint is unique, but they all set good examples for others and made prayer a priority in their lives.Hendey then introduces readers to some official Church saints, taking care to represent various cultures and ethnicities. The last half of the book focuses on what children can do to become a saint. ‚ÄúIn small ways, every day, we have the chance to share God‚Äôs love with everyone we meet.‚Äù Hendey emphasizes the importance of prayer, caring for our own bodies, caring for the environment, and practicing the corporal works of mercy. She also reminds children that when they make a mistake and are ‚Äúmean, impatient, or unkind‚Äù they should ask God for forgiveness.I‚Äôm a Saint in the Making is a lovely book to share with the children in your family or with a religious education class. The illustrations by Katie Broussard are colorful and charming. This book can help remind all of us that we are called to be saints and can choose to follow the road to sanctity in the choices we make every day."
"This children's book has a message for grownups as well as kids: saints are superheroes, and we are called by God to be heroes too. Every saint is both a role model and a prayer champion, Lisa maintains, and in language simple enough for kids (without ever talking down to them) she demonstrates how they can strive for both those goals in their everyday lives. A wonderful variety of saints, from the days of the early Church through modern times, is represented. Illustrations are fun, inclusive, and engaging, and include many wonderful details about the saints discussed in the book. (Advance copy provided by author)"
"We share stories of saints with our children and hold them up as models of virtue, but Lisa Hendey‚Äôs new picture book, illustrated by Katie Broussard, fills a practical purpose in translating hagiographies and simplified saint stories into actions that children can take right now to become saints themselves. Even this middle-aged mom took away a couple of new insights on living a life of virtue worthy of spending eternity in heaven. I highly recommend I‚Äôm a Saint in the Making for every Catholic child‚Äôs bookshelf.(I received a review copy from the publisher. Opinions are my own.)"
"The wonderful Lisa Hendey has written another winner here. I‚Äôm a Saint in the Making is a bright and entertaining picture book that is packed full of information and ideas.  Each time I read through this book, I discover something new and interesting that I didn‚Äôt notice before.  Paraclete Press has produced this impressive book that is sure to be a favourite for children, teachers and parents.  There are so many details to discover and discuss with children."
Lisa read her story on a ZOOM meeting yesterday to my 2nd grade religious education class.  Each child had received a copy of the book as a gift from the parish for Reconciliation.  She tells the story with great enthusiasm and explains better than I can how we are saints-in-the-making.  The children loved the hidden images of saints in the illustrations and could relate to being role models and prayer champions.  I loved her examples and explanations and highly recommend this for children - as well as adults.
"I‚Äôm a Saint in the Making is a phenomenal work for young children. Author Lisa Hendey expertly shows the vastness of the Communion of Saints, while inspiring young people to fulfill their own mission of sainthood. Beautifully illustrated, the book is a treasure which would be a welcome addition to your family library."
Just finished reading this book and it is so packed full of valuable information and tidbits to improve your everyday life. I highly recommend this book.
I love the cover details This book is a book that everyone need to read. Life changing. This book you would want all your family to read.
The author is a gift from God! This book is life changing

Excellent!  Every thinking person should read this book.
well done
Amir Tsarfati walks the reader through a variety of prophecies regarding the end times in clear language.  This is a great explanation for anyone interested in what is now clearly the soon-to-be-experienced future.  Get ready!  It is coming.
Awesome
Read now to be Saved from the Tribulation
This is an easy to read book that accurately describes end time events.  I highly recommend reading it to help your understanding of coming events.
I'd highly recommend this one
What an amazing book. Amir is a amazing writer
Great book and I love Amir‚Äôs humor in his writing!  Highly recommend!
"Enjoyed reading this book and his first book.  Looking forward to the third in Jan. 2021, IF, we are not raptured first!!!  Come Lord Jesus!!!"
Amir takes us on a Journey of knowing what it will be like in the last days and is full of wisdom and love.
"I have lost count of how many times I have read The Last Hour, and  how many of his You Tube teachings I have studied for how many times -- and every time I learn something new.  I have just finished reading this book my first time, and I know I shall be rereading it, many times, and I am sure that each time I again shall see something new, learn something new.  I am so blessed to be able to have the joy of looking toward to what is a new experience each time.  I know God put Amir Tsarfati here at this time, inspired him to guide us through these troubled times-to shine the light God gives him to light up the treacherous path that we must walk to be able to bring joy to the LORD.  Lord I thank You for these provisions, and for Amir Tsarfati! Continue to guide him so that he can guide us."
Amir Tsarfati is an excellent Bible teacher with incredible insight as a Messianic Jew and citizen of Israel. This book provides an exciting Biblical worldview of prophecy unfolding before our very eyes.  Highly recommend!  Come Lord Jesus!
I so enjoyed reading and being reassured of my belief.  I would highly recommend this book for believers and non believers.  I like how Amir references scripture to back up his teaching.  This book and The Last Hour left me with great hope and anticipation of our Lord Jesus Christ coming to rapture us home.  EVEN SO COME LORD JESUS.
Highly recommend this book
Most informative!
My favorite author delivered again.  Must read!  And definitely worth it
My book arrived in perfect condition and the service was very excellent and efficient.  Thank you!
"I have followed Amir and 'Behold Israel' on social media for several months. His videos on how current events were predicted in Bible Prophesy thousands of years ago have enabled me to make sense of the unprecedented events of 2020. and read his earlier book 'The Last Hour'. 'The Day Approaching' did not disappoint and is every bit as good as the other book. Amir Tsarfati is a Messianic Jew, with lots of knowledge about the culture in which the Bible was written and is the best Biblical Prophesy author I have ever read."
"Bought with the study guide too to study during lockdown!,not disappointed, very informative, knowledgeable and trustworthy writing, not least because its backed up by Scripture!"
"The author‚Äôs transparency and vulnerability to dive deep into the depths of friendships is an honesty of which I connected. The book, as a whole inspires others to not sit in wounds of friendship and rehearse pain and hurt repeatedly but to dare to be courageous and charge the friendship territory time and time again with more understanding of ourselves, our needs, and the needs of others. I will be recommending this book for years to come because it challenges change and fosters hope. I give this a 5 star rating, no questions asked!"
"I've had the honor of reading this book multiple times and can say in full honesty that I have talked about ti in every single one of my friendships. My stronghold were confronted, walls broken down, revelations had and truth spoken to my heart through Andi's words. Her words are truthful, raw, honest and convicting in the most beautiful way. The book is broken down into two sections with the first about confronting ourselves and the second about practical ways to cultivate healthy relationships. She also defines what biblical, healthy relationships look like. I want to give this book to every single person in my life. My biggest suggestion is to read it with friends- we are not meant to do relationships alone."
Andi‚Äôs motherly no nonsense comprehensive approach to writing this book challenges the reader to raise the friendship bar in every relationship including the relationship we have with our mothers and with ourselves. This book is best read reflectively and prayerfully and then to be kept handy as a friendship manual as needed.
"From the very first chapter, Andi takes us on a vulnerable journey deep into the many layers of friendship. Through her personal stories of how she walked through her own past wounds and healing, Andi empowers us to look inward, get honest with ourselves and work through our own mess to face our pain head on! You'll laugh and most definitely cry reading this book, but most of all, you‚Äôll be inspired through Andi's journey with a renewed HOPE for healthy friendships in the future! This book truly is a beautiful roadmap to healing that will pave the way for us all to experience beautiful, authentic friendships."
"A Long Obedience in the Same Direction is essentially a companion to the Psalms of Assent (120-134). This is my second sojourn into with Dr. Peterson, my first being ‚ÄúRun with the Horses‚Äù.  The book is a solid read from a man who has an obvious love of God, people and language. To these ends, Dr. Peterson is consistently warm, wise and thoughtfully prosaic, and his books seem to work best for me when read in conjunction with the scriptures in question.  He adroitly finds the both the beauty and application in each psalm and its place in the overall continuity God desires for His children.As a human being, the Psalms speak very personally to me, and my life has been more personally transformed by passages/verses memorized from the Psalms than any other book. That being written, the only restriction Peterson faces here is that Psalmist often revert to more boiler plate Hebrew, which makes the Psalms awesomely accessible but sometimes more humanly valuable than valuable literature. And Peterson seems to be at his best when his material is arguably a bit more substantial, like Jeremiah. Nonetheless, I always look forward to reading the scriptures alongside Dr. Peterson, as he help keep my eyes on the horizons of God.  I can reccomend this book without reservation."
"If you find inspiration in The Message, this book will be mind-expanding for you. Peterson uses the Songs of Ascent (Psalms 120-134) as a lunching pad for exploring the trials and triumphs of the Hebrews in ways that play directly into our lives today. I can't wait to put this book to work as a small group study."
"This book is a reflection on the Psalms of Ascent (120-134). Peterson wrote this book over 20 years ago, but it is interesting to see how much of what he was writing about then has not changed. There are things he writes about that I have seen or experienced and thought they were unique to the last 5-10 years or so, but clearly that is not true.This is a reprint and has a newer epilogue at the back. I think if I were leading a book discussion on this book I would start with this and then go back to the beginning.The title really says what this book (and these Psalms) are about. Interestingly enough the title is actually a line from Nietzsche (who was not a Christian) and Peterson ends his epilogue with an interesting anecdote about using Nietzsche in his title.While this book is not necessarily my favorite Peterson book, I would still recommend it to anyone."
"Eugene is like a spirit twin of mine. His prose is so visual and gentle, deep and contemplative, refined and simple, artistic and captivating. I read Run With the Horses first, which was incredible. This was just as good. I'm thankful for his ministry and faithfulness to communicate the radical love of God through Christ in his writings. On to his next work for me. Maybe Kingfishers."
"I'm tempted to leave a lower star review but that's just because the content is challenging. Not because it's difficult to read, but because it keeps me looking at myself and my actions. Pushing me to grow and change. To maintain a long obedience in the same direction."
"That's the hard part, Right? I've gone through rededication, re-baptism, re-consecration many times in a long life, until finally in 2009 my life collapsed into utter ruin. After a long struggle with humiliation, false pride, and hopelessness, I was finally humble enough to try reaching out to (no definition) whatever that was that was out there asking:- Please help me, help me, I cannot live life on my own... And He came, the Great Shepherd, and rescued me. This time I knew my life literally depended on ""getting it right""... this time...  After 4 years, I was not very happy with how things were going, I was ill and in a lot of crippling pain and was close to being completely invalid. On the internet I ran across a community of friendly folks who seemed mostly Christian and who maintained thoughtful discussion of issue of the day and gradually gave me space and validation to participate. One concerned and discerning person recommended this book as a powerful guide to a sustainable discipleship.  This book is not a fiction. This book is a wise guide to living an awake, aware, loving, giving life. Here is not theory and theology, but a scripturally based guide on how practically to submit to the re-formation of my life by God. Also what to look for as signs of God's work in me. For instance:-  ""Joy is not a requirement of Christian discipleship, it a Consequence. It is not what we have to acquire in order to experience life in Christ; it is what comes to us when we are walking in the way of faith and obedience.""  I found it also useful as a guide to being enlightened by reading scripture for myself, not because I had to but because scripture is full of God's message to His created people on how to live. This a bedside book. A book to dip into daily to help keep refreshed on The Path. A reminder to not let this or that slip by without conscious review---Do I really want to foster That in my life?There are 16 chapters, 2 through16 could be in almost any order because it is more like a catalogue of elements , not a chronological set of prescriptions. Joy, Repentance, Hope, Perseverance are some headings to the concise but thorough chapters.  There is a general tone of serenity and peace which I found helpful to calm my anxieties and fears. An en-courage-ing book."
"His view of life through the word of God is so much more than we normally expect it to be. We are children and life with God is delightful when we see everything through His eyes. This can only happen when we read His word and are surrendered to His Son. We have the peace that, no matter what we are going through, God's got this!"
This Petersen classic is timeless and it's called back to the Psalms as a way of life and worship. I desire to be the hungry one praying and reading scripture as described in these pages and I am stirred by these words to go forward trusting Christ and his news.
"Eugene Peterson's deep engagement with the psalms of ascent marked the beginning of his journey translating The Message. His deep pastoral wisdom is summed up both in the act of translating the text of Scripture for his people. Both the text and his people require and get his careful attention, so they have a chance at least for God's Word to get under their skin and into their hearts. As readers, who join this ascent, sing, pray, and mediate on the psalms with them, we find ourselves seeking God's presence and blessing with them."
"Peterson helps us see the pathway of discipleship not as a rigorous, screw up your willpower call, but one that is rooted in real life, real living, and a real relationship with the Lord.  Yes, there is pain and even blood, sweat, and tears, but is a journey to be enjoyed and taken at a grace-inspired pace."
I have not finished the book yet but am slowly absorbing new thoughts.  Eugene Peterson has a way of looking at many facets of a subject.I am 82 years old and agree that a lifetime following Jesus is a Long Obedience in the Same Direction.
"Great shape, love the book!"
This book is the single best tool for surviving a crisis!  The wisdom and style of writing by Dr. Peterson is easy to read and reread as the truth is always needed and this book delivers encouragement!
"The book came in good time, and I'm using it along with the Bible study devotional Eugene Peterson wrote. It's a good study for anyone wanting to strengthen his/her walk with God and ""finish strong"" in life."
"I find myself returning to Peterson's text again and again. He's clear, thoughtful, challenging, and calls us all to pursue our faith more deeply."
"Someone gave me this book, I in turn gave it to someone else.  I bought another copy, gave that one away but had to purchase another one for myself.  This is the kind of book you just can't keep to yourself.  I read it daily along with Spurgeon's morning and evening, it's just that good and relevant."
It is a much needed book for Christians in today's society.
Cannot say enough good things about this book. Such a good read for seeking Christians as well as old-timer like me.
"This book is a classic.  Everything Eugene Peterson writes speaks to me in terms I can easily understand.  This book is no exception.  If you are serious about your Discipleship to Jesus, read this book!"
"Still reading this book, but disappointed with Peterson's economic view in Chapter 10 on Happiness (Psalm 128).  The author asserts that ""Too much of the world's happiness depends on taking from one to satisfy another.  To increase my standard of living, people in another part of the world must lower theirs.""  This zero-sum view of economics fails to grasp there is no finite economic pie from which everyone must share.  Christianity is probably most responsible for helping those in need worldwide, including feeding the hungry.  There is nothing wrong with encouraging people to be even more charitable, but to suggest that the cause of world hunger is greedy, materialistic Christians?  Free market capitalism combined with a compassionate Christian worldview that all people are created in God's image seems the best hope to raise everyone's standard of living."

  ¬†A few things...1) I was a little worried this book would be too similar to either Angie Smith‚Äôs ‚ÄúSeamless‚Äù or ‚ÄúMatchless‚Äù Bible studies. I was sorely mistaken. This book dove deeper into the theological aspects of the Bible than I expected. I‚Äôve been doing and teaching Bible study for years and every single chapter brought a fresh perspective.2) Angie‚Äôs HUMOR and RELATABILITY seamlessly brought this historical, hard-to-understand, super serious book into language and perspective that either a new Bible reader OR a super seasoned church go-er could relate to and understand.Angie‚Äôs writing style takes the lame ‚Äústudy‚Äù portion of ‚ÄúBible study‚Äù OUT of Bible study. You can almost hear her sarcasm and laughter as you read her words. For me, books where you feel a conversation with the author are the BEST type of books.I learned a lot and smiled throughout the whole book.Well done, Angie, well done."
"Update may 2021:I really wanted to finish this book, so I picked it up and plugged on.I am glad that I did.I still feel that her writing style isn‚Äôt for me and that I am probably not her target audience.However, I did end up enjoying the book overall and it did give me some insight to each book of the Bible in a flyover kind of way! It helped me understand a bit more about what is going on when I open a book of the Bible and not feel so lost.I could have done without so much of the joking type of commentary, but I see how some people would really enjoy the light hearted way she explains things.Original review:Ok...Admittedly I am only part way through the book. I haven‚Äôt finished it. I‚Äôll update when I do.However, I find myself frustrated with this book and I don‚Äôt know if I can finish it, but I‚Äôll try.Angie promises to make the Bible make sense.I grew up in church and I‚Äôve been around and in the Word my entire life, but I still struggle with linking things or seeing the Bible as a ‚Äúseamless‚Äù story. I was excited for this book because I thought it would finally lay out the facts in an easy to understand way.So far, the book is written more like a joke-y, comedy bit about girlfriends at lunch talking about the Bible.I am lacking the facts and hard evidence laid out in an easy to understand way that I am craving.Angie tells you a little bit about the Bible‚Äôs events in between jokes about her college boyfriends and the time her dad almost spanked her with a lot of girl-talk promises of the meaty details of the Bible to come. (Ex: This is like, so important. You‚Äôll see.. believe me! This is important and you‚Äôll, like, totally get it soon! As we read on it will totally make sense. Trust me!)And then totally fails to deliver on those promises as she jokes more and goes off on tangents about her own life.I hate writing a ‚Äúbad‚Äù review or being a Karen....I just felt like the book fell short on its promises and I‚Äôm not learning more about the Bible...I‚Äôm just  learning more about Angie‚Äôs life and sense of humor with some Bible facts mixed in.Anyhow...if I can finish it, I‚Äôll update!"
"The IDEA of this book and the content that is promoted was very intriguing for me. However, I could not get through to the biblical ‚Äúmeat‚Äù because it is mostly the ramblings of the author. As a reader, it felt 20% Biblical, 80% superficially related rambling."
Author spends half the text inserting comments I guess she thinks are funny and cute.  They are distracting / boring / irritating. / wasting my timeThere are much better biooks  to get overview of bible
"I have every book of Angie Smith's on my shelf. She has a way of drawing the reader into her own story immediately. Her transparency and honesty flow through the pages of every one of her books and this new book - Woven, is no exception. As a long time Christian it is hard to admit that I have never read the Bible from cover to cover. I started a new plan this past January that will change that and this book couldn't have come at a better time! If you have ever felt intimidated by the Bible (raises hand) then this book is for you. If you have ever thought that you have too many questions or too many doubts (raises hand again) then this book is for you. Angie has had those too and she uses the pages of Woven to walk you through some of those common, and not so familiar stories to show you how they are all connected. How this God of the universe has been drawing us towards Him for all time. I have purchased several copies already to give as gifts to my friends and family. You don't have to fully understand the Bible to read this book. But when you do, you will start to have those ""ah-ha"" moments and those pages that once seemed daunting will suddenly come alive! Get this book today!"
"I love this book! It goes through the full story of the Bible and focuses on the metanarrative of scripture, the thread of God‚Äôs love and plan from Genesis to Revelation. This book reminded me of the old saying ‚Äúnot seeing the forest from the trees‚Äù because people can sometimes focus on particular sections of the Bible and miss the larger story. I think this book does a wonderful job focusing on the big story. It‚Äôs great for new/young believers to learn God‚Äôs big story and it‚Äôs great for longtime believers. And Angie‚Äôs down to earth writing and humor make it an easy read. I think it‚Äôs a must read!"
"I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH!  I had never read anything of Angie Smith's before and didn't know what to expect, but my friend did a study of hers and highly recommended it.  I bought it at a bookstore, and the next week I started reading.  Once I started, I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN.In short, she tells how the Bible is one seamless story.  In addition, Angie is HILARIOUS!  As a female reader, I can totally relate to her and I appreciate her fun antidotes.  It makes me laugh and understand things better.  It reads like I'm having a fun chat with a friend at a coffee shop and we're laughing about all the crazy things the OT people did.She does a great job of seamlessly having Jesus WOVEN (pun intended there people) throughout the book, because that is exactly the reflection of the Bible.I recommended this book to our women's ministry team, and we're now going to read through it as women this summer.  I'm so excited!"
"I‚Äôm about half way through the book and don‚Äôt plan to finish it. I bought this book to read in hopes that it may be something I could utilize when mentoring newer Christians. This is not a book that would be helpful for that.This book does not deliver what it advertises. This book is more of a story of the life of the author with a few Biblical facts sprinkled in. Her poor-tasting sense of humor takes away from the events of the Bible thats she‚Äôs attempting to write about.For anyone wanting to really understand the Bible, read the Bible along with a book that‚Äôs more Biblically sound. I would not recommend this book."
"From the first paragraph, I could hear Angie talking to me.  I devoured this book.  As soon as my journal arrives, I will begin reading again and dig deep into The Word to follow the threads.Angie Smith does a fabulous job of taking the threads of various pieces of the Bible and highlighting how they weave with the next piece until you reach the end and see the full Bible has Woven together to tell the complete story of Christ in every page.I recommend this book to the new Christian, the ‚Äúbeen there, done that‚Äù, as well as to those who are curious what it all means.Woven is a must have for every library!"
"I love Angie Smith.""What Women Fear"" - A-Mazing.Listening to her at the IF:Gathering - Incredible.Her ""Seamless"" and ""Matchless"" Bible Studies - Fantastic.""Woven"" - Yikes.It's like... I don't even know.The extra two cents in every. single. paragraph. is beyond distracting.Her telling readers to go away if they already know what the Bible says is troubling.There were a few statements she presented as facts that I questioned. Were they true, or were they just an opinion? I wish I would have marked them to look up later, I can't bring myself to read through the first third of the book again to find them. And that's all the further I got. A third of the way through the book. I was hoping to give it to a new Christian, but with all the excess commentary, I decided not to. Which was huge because I normally love Angie Smith's writing and speaking. I'm thoroughly disappointed."
"Oh my GOODNESS!!  Angie Smith has written a book that takes you through the Bible in a non-overwhelming way and adds humor that comes through clearly in her writing.  Even though I grew up in church, I still learned so much!Angie walks through the Bible‚Äîpointing out things that most of us miss‚Äîand shows how Jesus fits in all the old stories like Noah and Moses and Adam and Eve.  Best of all, she does it all in an utterly charming way that left me smiling at the end of the chapters.Whether you know a little or a lot about the old Bible stories, you‚Äôll walk away seeing Jesus in a new way after reading this book!"
"Although a little redundant of the Seamless Bible Study, I find it a WONDERFUL addition to biblical knowledge. I have both the physical book and the audible book so I can swap between reading and listening.This book has given me so much more of an understanding of the Bible as a whole, especially the Old Testament which I had previously dismissed routinely as ‚Äújust lineage‚Äù.Angie has written in such a relatable way and has helped light a fire for God in my heart, yet again! Loved this book!"
"I really enjoyed reading Woven. Not only did Angie work to tie the gospel together from Genesis to Revelation, she was able to show the influence of Old Testament characters in the New Testament. She also tied in God‚Äôs prophesies to His people from Genesis to the early church in Acts. I wish she had spent more time in the books after Acts rather than quick summary paragraphs. I have and will continue to recommend this book to friends, both new Christians and seasoned Christians. It‚Äôs a great read!"
"I thought I already knew the seamless story of the Bible, having grown up in church my whole life and hearing all of the famous Bible stories. But this book opened my eyes to so many things that I hadn‚Äôt heard pieced together before.This is also be a great read for anyone who has no experience reading the Bible at all. She breaks things down to make it easier to understand, and also adds in what I call her ‚ÄúAngie flare‚Äù ‚Äî her casual, sarcastic attitude ‚Äî which adds humor into the story. I totally recommend this for everyone."
"Highly recommend!! I am halfway through this book and already plan to read again and again. (Next time I will write down notes). This book is packed with information and really helps to understand all the family lineage and nations that are discussed in the Bible. I have heard Bible stories my whole life and know the gist of most of the stories but this book puts them all in order and gives all the details on how those major stories came about. From creation, to the flood, to Moses parting the waters and so on! The author does a great job of throwing in humor and explanation that the reader can relate to. It‚Äôs an easy read!"
"I love this book! Angie Smith has a special gift when it comes to helping you look at  more the Bible differently. As one story, not a bunch of disjointed things put together in one book. For me, the way Angie explains the Bible, infusing her special brand of humor, actually helps better put together the prophecies and where they are fulfilled, and makes me feel closer to God then ever before. It‚Äôs very special."
"Excellent overview of the Bible as a whole, showing the big picture behind the book as a whole while also diving into the details in places. I like how the author helps us see the books of the Bible in order they were written snd points out their unique elements. Then add to that the authors humor and sarcasm and it makes for an entertaining educational read that whets your appetite to dig into Gods Word."
"Not what I expected. For me, too much personal commentary that was distracting and uncomfortable."
"This book was fantastic. I have read the Bible but to have a helicopter view of how the books are written, by whom and how the story is connected made reading the Bible so much fun again. Sngieis hilarious and speaks so plainly and keeps you engaged. If you're a new Christian you will be given a road map to read the Bible but even if you've been a believer for a long time you will have a renewed understanding and love for the Word."
"Read through page 153. If you are looking for a serious and thoughtful book about the Bible this is not it. Very ambitious to sum up the Bible and the story of God, it‚Äôs people and Jesus Christ to 269. It was like chewing on bubble gum. Good at first but loses substance very quickly. Sticking to Jen Wilkin, she is truly a studied and knowledgeable Bible teacher. Angie Smith tries too hard to be relevant by inserting her comments, and just bastardizes the Bible."
"I was expecting an informative, interesting, hopefully read a book book. What I got was this entertaining book filled with bits of laughter and some tears. I‚Äôve never understood the Bible so well and have never had the urge to pick up my Bible like I do now. I love the references sprinkled throughout and the relatable words of encouragement."
"Hands down the best book I have ever read for helping you understand the Bible as a story.  Angie Smith is hilarious and witty and keeps you entertained while learning the historical narrative of the Bible. I am almost finished and had to jump on here and let you guys know that this book is worth the read!! Once you know the plan that God set forth in motion from the very beginning of time for you and for me, you will be forever amazed at the love of Jesus. This book will inspire you to get to know the ONE who died so that you could have eternal life with Him. I am so thankful to finally understand the Bible as a whole story because it changes EVERYTHING!!!"
"Angie Smith is my GIRL so I‚Äôm so pumped about this book. Funny, witty, genuine. This book is the perfect complement to her study Seamless. Whether you are a Bible scholar or you‚Äôre picking up a Bible for the first time, I HIGHLY suggest you get this book AND Seamless!!!!! You won‚Äôt regret it!!!!!"
"Once again Angie has done it.  She walks you through the entire Bible in a way that you can not only understand but you feel like it just happened.  66 books by 40 authors and somehow she helps me understand all of them more and more each time.  Beautifully written with of course some ""Angie"" moments wrapped in!"
"Angie has a beautiful way of sharing the Word, her heart for Jesus & adding in some humor all in this one package called Woven. Whether you are a new believer or a seasoned believer, this book will encourage you with fresh understanding of how God‚Äôs story has been woven throughout history. The Bible can be confusing & sometimes we get lost in the timelines & lineage, but Angie puts it all in perspective to show how & why God has woven these people & places together to tell His magnificent story."
"Angie Smith‚Äôs new book, Woven, does not disappoint.  As in the name of the book, God‚Äôs continuos story is Woven throughout these pages. Angie‚Äôs words allows us, the reader, the ability to see the Bible as a continuous, well connected story. Angie has the ability to bring the God breathed book to life. I‚Äôm so thankful to be able to share this beautiful book with my friends and family."
"I absolutely loved this book. Angie Smith has done a wonderful job of ‚Äúweaving‚Äù all the books of the Bible into one ‚Äúseamless‚Äù story. If you‚Äôve studied her book, Seamless, this is a way more in depth study. I can‚Äôt say enough how much I enjoyed this book."
"A perfect book for a new believer, a long time believe, and anyone in between. Angie Smith does a fantastic job laying out the Bible as one woven (hehe) story where it is so easy to understand and makes referencing those stories in the Bible much more approachable of a task. I‚Äôve already bought it for 3 people and have recommended it to many more."
Love Angie‚Äôs books to help ease the understanding of the Bible. Angie has a way with ordinary words to simplify in depth coverage of the many books making up God‚Äôs word. She tells a ‚Äústory‚Äù.
Our bible study group is only on chapter 6 but I love it. The author has a wonderful sense of humor and great insight to the bible history.  Look forward to reading more of her studies.
"Angie does it again!!! Her wit mixed with Bible knowledge is such a treat - makes me want to hang out with her in real life. This is a great book for anyone new to The Bible but also those (like myself) who have known about The Bible their whole life but never took a deep dive - Angie makes it fun, exciting and engaging!! Highly recommend."
Can be used or personal or group study. For the person who knows nothing about the Bible and those who consider themselves knowledgeable. Good and easy read! Who wouldn't like Angie Smith.
It gives you an overview of the Bible. It would be beneficial for someone wanting to understand the Bible in a simpler form. The Sutherland encourages readers to go back and read the Bible afterwards with a better understanding.  I enjoyed it.
Woven is the perfect place to obtain a deeper understanding of the Bible. Whether you're a brand new learner or a long time reader there is something for you in here. Angie is a phenomenal teller of Bible stories. Doing so in a way that will captivate and entertain. It is the perfect book for private personal study or a group study.
I love Everything Angie Smith! She has a special talent of explaining the books in the Bible. I learn something new everytime!! 5 plus stars
"The timeline and explanation of the Bible context is great. However, the writers style is very distracting. Every time I felt I was learning something there was another story plugged in of her personal life. It was very difficult to get through at times."
I adore Angie Smith‚Äôs writing style. I really connect to how she approached teaching the stories of the Bible. I‚Äôd recommend woven to anyone who wants an understanding of the Bible. I‚Äôve completed her Seamless and Matchless Bible studies and Woven completes the trio.
I love this book. It helps you connect the different books of the Bible together. It would be great for any level of biblical knowledge.
Read this book & watch ‚ÄúThe Chosen‚Äù !!!! That‚Äôs the best advice I can give any believer out there right now!
"As usual, Angie Smith has written a book I will return to again and again. After doing her Bible study, Seamless, 3 times, Ihave been waiting impatiently for Woven. She makes the Bible relatable, tangible and oh so real. She has a gift with words and the Word. My favorite Christian author has given us another gift. Read it and then go back and read her entire library. She doesn't disappoint!"
"Angie Smith has a way with words. She draws you in and keeps you constantly hanging on for more. Her ability to explain and connect pivotal points in the Bible is like no other that I‚Äôve read. This book (and many of her others) have been turning points for me and my relationship with Jesus. I love getting to know Him more, and Angie helps with this in such a unique way."
"Another great book by Angie Smith! I love how she walks you through the Bible in an easy to understand way, but shows the complexity of Gods purpose in how everything He put into action so seamlessly ties together. I also enjoyed Angie‚Äôs humor and personal stories she added in. Definitely a book I‚Äôll be recommending to my family and friends! You won‚Äôt regret giving this book a read!"
Great read so far. I haven't finished yet but I'm expecting it to be good.
Feels like your best friend is telling you a story...which happens to be the most important story
I loved Angi‚Äôs character and sense of humor to tell things and really connect the Old Testament with the New Testament. I absolutely loved it and would recommend it to everyone! She made things more understandable like I never have had told to me before!
Can not have given this a higher recommendation. I have lent this out 3 times now and all have loved it .
"Angie Smith knows how to bring it all together. The Bible‚Äôs 66 books all come together in Woven, as one story. What a great companion to God‚Äôs Word."
This book was awesome in piecing all the parts of the Bible together. She is a very entertaining Author and I‚Äôve already ordered another one of her books!
"Everything you need to know, in a condensed version."
"This book was written for me. I needed a simple explanation, guide, map, story of the Bible. Well written, made me laugh at times and helped me understand the parts of the Bible I have read or learned in Sunday school."
"The beautiful writing and WISDOM of Angie Smith in Woven has changed my life and my ability to see the Bible as one whole story! Angie makes the Bible makes sense for everyone as well as relatable and so so funny. If you want someone to feel like they can grasp the Bible, this book is for them!"
Love this book & author!!
Angie Smith is wonderful!!!
I read seamless when was in awe of how easy to understand Angie Smith makes the Bible for me. When I heard about Woven I HAD to get it and it did not disappoint! It‚Äôs amazing!! Angie did it again. I‚Äôve actually ordered more books for my daughters!
"Angie Smith writes so beautifully! After doing the Seamless Bible Study, I look at the Bible in a whole new way! Never did I realize how the Bible is one big story. When she came out with Woven I knew I had to read it and it was AMAZING!! A true page turner!"
To much of her own stories for me. She rambles on and on.I really liked her other books but this one is not a good read. I have done Jen Wilkin God of Creation and learned so much about the Bible! No fluff just real bible study.
This book was a great fly over of the story of Gods love for people. Angie Smith was able to honor the big love of God ways that helped understand time lines and culture of when the books were written
This book is great. It's an easy read and I can't put it down.
Love love love this book what more can I say just brings everything together about the Bible to where it is easier to understand highly recommend.
FINALLY I'm beginning to understand how all the pieces of the Bible fit together to make one cohesive account.
"I definitely got a better understanding of the old testament,  but 2 other people read it after me, and agreed that the writer put too many extra ""funnies"" in. Otherwise, it was a helpful book"
One of my favorite authors.  She is authentic in her faith walk and makes it feel like you are sitting having coffee with her
This book is a must read! So easy to follow and have loved being a part of women‚Äôs Bible study with this book..
I love the way this author writes and thinks!  I will be buying her other books.
I really appreciated how Angie connected the Old Testament with the New!  I needed these reminders !  Thank you for writing this book!
Angie Smith is so down to earth and easy to understand. She is smart and has a wonderful ‚ù§Ô∏è
This book puts the cookies on the bottom shelf for all to reach what the Bible is saying!
This is amazing book üìñ
Great read and easy to understand!
I have really enjoyed this book. It's so easy to relate to the author.
Great book. Especially for new beliefs to grasp the flow of the Bible.
"Excellent book weaving co,nold and new testaments together"
Love Angie Smith!
"I read through the Bible every year - but I'm a reader who is often challenged with comprehension due to mind wandering or distractions.  This book appealed to me for that reason - to tie the whole story of God's love and plan for us to the many different stories of the Bible, as woven together.  Angie Smith makes the journey enjoyable and easy to understand.  I'd be quick to recommend or give this book to new believers or someone trying to just figure out what the Bible is all about.  The only down side for me was the off-beat, sometimes cheesy humor.  But - I get it, it broke up the challenging and difficult things, places, people that can be hard for us to relate to and for some it will be what keeps them going to get through the whole woven story.  That would be my only drawback and otherwise I thoroughly enjoyed reading through and getting fresh perspective in connecting all of the dots - many I already knew, but I got to see them in a fresh way.  It was kind of like flying over the by drone to see the whole landscape of God's Word at once.  I received an advance copy courtesy of Netgalley with no obligation for a positive review - and enjoyed it so much I also bought the book to own."
"I wasn‚Äôt familiar with Angie Smith before this book, but her warm, open style of writing drew me in from the very first pages, inviting me to explore with her and dive deeper into the Big Story of Scripture. Love for God and others drips from the pages, welcoming friends old and new into the study of God‚Äôs word without pretense. Her words draw me in and make me eager to see more of the vision she has uncovered. Angie has a way with words and an understanding of Scripture that will be a blessing to all!  She acknowledges the challenging mysteries, but stands on what can be known, embracing the truths of Scripture in all their beauty. She casually weaves in deep truths of Scripture that are far too often overlooked, clearly opening up the Scriptures to us. What a gift! (She‚Äôs kinda punny too, which is fun!) Highly recommend this book!NetGalley loaned me a digital copy of this book for an honest review."
"I fortunately was able to read an early copy... and Angie Smith did not disappoint. Her careful study of the scriptures was translated beautifully into Woven in a way that demonstrates the meta-narrative of the Bible. Of course, an Angie Smith book or study wouldn‚Äôt be complete without her unique sense of humor threaded in... but also her empathy, compassion... and true love for Jesus. I‚Äôve just completed Seamless with my small young adult women group at church... they keep asking if their next surprise is to meet Angie Smith! It‚Äôs because she meets people with the written & spoken word right where they are and pours out light and love. She shows how loving Jesus, and being loved by Jesus is real. I cannot bring Angie to them in the flesh, but I plan to gift them all a copy of this book to celebrate completion of their first adult Bible study. Woven is the perfect first book especially for the young women I mentor."
"Angie Smith writes with humor and heart.  As you read her book, it reads as if you are chatting with a friend.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because the Bible is unlike any other book in all the world.... It‚Äôs a library of books. It‚Äôs made up of historical accounts and spiritual instruction and handwritten letters and‚Äîjust some outright beautiful writing‚Äîprophecy, poetry, praise songs, personal conversations.‚Äù‚ÄúThe books of the Bible are not entirely in order... Who is up to the task of reading a sixty-six-volume set (of anything!) and keeping up with all the information, all the characters‚Äô lives, getting all the details down right, and synthesizing it perfectly? Without any help?‚ÄùOne of my favorite Bible study that I have went through in my women‚Äôs ministry was Seamless. I still have it on my shelf and would gladly enroll in it again. Then this book came along and it is just as great as Seamless.Angie does an amazing job of telling the Bible as a story. Reading the Bible in its entirety can be daunting and disjointed at times. Angie helps any new or seasoned Bible reader put all the pieces together to help it flow where you can see the big picture. The prophecies and how they are fulfilled helped me bring these stories a new perspective.Many thanks to Angie Smith and B&H Publishing for this advanced copy and allowing me to review this book."
"Run, don‚Äôt walk, to get your copy of Angie Smith‚Äôs newest release, Woven. Whether you‚Äôre new to the Bible or well versed, this read will take you on a journey like no other. For the new believer, this book will be such a helpmate for you. Angie lays it all out: timelines, maps, connections, relationships, and order. She‚Äôs done so much work to eliminate stress for you when taking on the Bible. Not only does she teach the truth, but she does it in a such a way that you never feel bogged down with information. Instead, you feel like you‚Äôre making a friend‚Ä¶the kind of friend that makes your snort with laughter at her snarky side notes, while absorbing all this amazing insight into Scripture. Taking on Scripture with a big picture view will make such a difference.For those well versed in the Bible, this is still a read that will not disappoint. I was constantly at awe at the new information I found in each chapter. Admittedly, I struggle connecting different books together and seeing the bigger picture in some of the smaller books. I so admire someone who can not only make those connections, but make practiced believers feel at awe at the insights shared. Insights that I‚Äôve missed in my many visits in the word. I also find it a bonus that these amazing revelations are peppered with self-deprecating humor that will keep you laughing and highlighting like crazy. I have long been a Christ follower; however, I was continually amazed at the new (dare I say) threads Angie brought into focus.Angie writes about many stories from the bible, but her theme remains the same: This is God‚Äôs story. A story that He has lovingly woven His Son into throughout. Even more, our names will be forever woven into this story‚Ä¶because of Christ and His never-ending love for us."
"In reading other reviews, I understand how Angie Smith‚Äôs humor doesn‚Äôt appeal to everyone. I bought this book after loving a couple of her Bible studies because her sense of humor is just what I need to lighten things up when the world becomes a little overwhelming and the Bible messages get lost in the mess. I‚Äôve read most of the Bible out of order, in group Bible studies through the years. This book truly ‚Äúwove‚Äù it all together. The Bible isn‚Äôt written in true chronological order, but it still builds on itself. With Angie‚Äôs humor thrown in, it did feel like chatting with a girlfriend and I, personally, liked that. I‚Äôm not sure I could‚Äôve gotten through a dry summary of the Bible. This book gave brief snippets of every book of the Bible and how they all relate to each other. It encouraged deeper reading on our own. It probably wouldn‚Äôt appeal to biblical scholars who already know it all, but I don‚Äôt think that was her target audience. I recommend it to people new to the faith, or for those of us who want a little lighter tread into the serious issues of the Bible. Either way, the message remains the same."
"I have loved Angie Smith's writing since her blog back in the day. I have read many of her other books since then, but I think this one would have to be my favorite.First of all, the macrame on the cover is textured! (Isn't this cover gorgeous?). Also, this book delivers exactly what the tagline says: understanding the Bible as one seamless story. This book is great for believers and non-believers as it goes through an overview of many famous Bible stories and characters (and some less famous ones) and shows how it points to the cross. Lent is the perfect time to read Woven. And, it reads like Angie Smith is sitting down over a cup of coffee with you telling you the story, not a heavy theology textbook."
I just got through reading angie Smith‚Äòs new book woven as a young adult I did not know anything about the Bible I didn‚Äôt go to church wasn‚Äôt raised in church so as I was attending church I had no idea what anybody was talking about as I read Angie‚Äòs new book and how she is weaves in the throughout the book she it helps you navigate through the Bible as you‚Äôre reading it you like oh wait I think I know that oh wait I think I know that is just a blessing that somebody has finally come out with a book for new Christians to be able to read and not get so overwhelmed that I don‚Äôt know who any of these people are in the Bible as she‚Äôs walking us through it it is been a true blessing to have stumbled  upon this book
There are similarities between Matchless and Woven as they are both reviewing and digging into the Bible in a chronological manner. Reading the Bible in this way gives you a much better understanding of how the Old Testament and the New Testament are woven together. Woven goes a bit deeper than Matchless. Angie gives a more intimate look at herself but still brings her delightful humor and realistic nature to this book. You won't regret getting this book!
"I love reading books by Angie Smith. Seamless & Matchless were 2 of my favorites but, Woven is by far my favorite now. Angie brought us deeper this time & still made me laugh. I had so many aha moments! I‚Äôm no stranger to my Bible, I‚Äôve read it cover to cover many times but, Angie shines a bright light weaving everything together. I love reading my Bible & Woven made that even better. Thank you Angie Smith for listening to the Holy Spirit."
"I love Angie‚Äôs work, she is so relatable and down to earth! I have done both of her studies and read 3 of her books, they are all amazing! Angie‚Äôs style of writing is perfect for all levels, whether a new Christian like myself or a seasoned vet. Some content in other books that I‚Äôve read was so frustrating to me because the writing is geared towards those that already have a sturdy knowledge base so I felt defeated from the start. Angie‚Äôs work is different and I have read her books and studies with a combination of new Christians and Christians who we‚Äôre grown in the church and we all enjoyed it and took something away from the study! I can‚Äôt say enough about this book and the author. I give it a 100 out of 10 stars (no that‚Äôs not a typo, she is just that good!). BUY THE BOOK, READ THE BOOK, GIFT THE BOOK!!"
"I really enjoyed Woven by Angie Smith! She's brings the Bible to life in an incredibly humorous and relatable way! The book is easy to read and breaks down complicated portions of scripture to be better understood. Great resource for those who aren't sure about the Bible, how to read it, or what makes portions significant. Only four stars because I wish there has been a bibliography."
"This woman is so incredibly talented at making the Bible accessible and understandable to women of all ages. Using the gift God gave her, she paints such a beautiful picture of the Bible. She balances scripture interpretation so well with real life application. We've done her past study, Seamless, together as a Bible study, and though I've had the pleasure of reading this one, I really can't wait to do it together with my same college age group of girls. It's amazing."
"I loved every second of reading this book. It is a wonderful study tool for people of all experience levels. The Bible as a whole can be very intimidating, so if you're looking for something to simplify the whole story, this is the perfect book. In addition, even if you've been reading the Bible your whole life, Angie offers a fresh perspective that I had never considered. I love her views on Peter and Paul. You absolutely need to read this book!"
"I recently started another study about the life of Jesus, also by Angie. As I was reading I realized there was some background knowledge I needed to better understand his story. Mainly from the old testament.  About the same time, I saw this book and got an advanced copy. I love how Angie explains everything so simply so I am not caught up in the scholar of the bible but in the stories and how the bible is woven together. She uses her wit and humor to make studying the bible enjoyable and not so daunting."
"I love to read, and this is one book that you must add to your collection.  I have read all of Angie Smith's books and bible studies and this one, BY FAR, is the best!!!  Angie will take you on a narrative journey through the Bible and she will bring together both the Old and New Testament right before your eyes.  Angie has a gift for telling a story so that you actually feel as it is happening ""right before your eyes"" and it is one of her best gifts!  Prepare to laugh, shed a tear, and be amazed as you go on this amazing of the world's most amazing story ever told.  Most importantly. you will feel as if you are sharing a cup of coffee with your best friend, all the while you will be somehow be growing in your own personal relationship with God.  Enjoy!!!"
"After doing the Seamless Bible study, I fell in love with Angie Smith and her writing. I was so excited to read Woven and it did not disappoint. Setup in a chapter book form, it feels like you‚Äôre sitting over coffee listening to a friend talk about the Bible. Angie connected stories and cleared up timelines that I had been curious about in a beautiful way that didn‚Äôt feel overwhelming. At many points, I pulled out my Bible to reread chapters and books that I had previously just skimmed. This book is for everyone whether you‚Äôve read your Bible cover to cover or you‚Äôve never really read it at all. Not related to the context, but the cover of the book is beautiful."
"Reading Angie Smith‚Äôs Woven is like sitting down and having a cup of coffee with a girlfriend while leaning in for a really good story. As a new believer, I completed Angie‚Äôs Seamless Bible study and her new release Woven is the perfect follow up, getting deeper into the Word. She writes with love and wit, humor and compassion, relating what we read to our lives today. Woven is for anyone that feels overwhelmed by the Bible and anyone who wants to dive deeper into the Word, discovering how each book ‚Äúweaves‚Äù together into one story. She explains the Bible in a way that resonates while pointing out the themes, connections, and subtleties that I never would have realized on my own.I highly recommend!"
"Can I just say that my appreciation for this book can't be put into words? I've tried to read the Bible countless times, only to get lost and confused by the verbiage. Woven breaks it down into common sense for those of us who need it. I cant thank Angie enough for writing this book, it's truly opened my head and heart to my faith in Jesus. Thank you, Angie Smith...write more!"
"This latest book by Angie Smith was even better than her previous books, Matchless and Seamless. Her writing style is so relatable and accessable for any and all readers. Angie has an ability to make you feel like you are sitting in her living room while she shares stories and truths from the Bible.  I was concerned this book was going down a path of similarity to Seamless but was pleasantly surprised at the depth and differences.  This book surprisingly was for those new to the bible as well as those who have been studying it for years. I was intrigued at the many new insights gained with each chapter!  Woven is an amazing study to do with others or even to tear through on your own as you watch His Story come alive in new ways."
"Angie Smith, Woven, is a book written for everyone to learn the stories in the Bible from beginning to end.  Woven starts in Geneisis and highlights  the lineage of all the people and how they connect throughout the Bible to Revelation.  Dig deep into the birth of Jesus and his life up to crucifixion, and his resurrection.  Angie does such an awesome job of keeping your interest as you learn and desire to dig in more to your Bible.  A must read!!"
"Angie has a way of bringing out the highlights of every part of the Bible whether you have read the Bible 200 times or never all the way through(like me). She encourages you, she teaches you, she has you laughing all the while you are seeing the true picture of Jesus and His importance before, during, and after He has departed the Earth. Such a magnificent read and I would recommend to anyone wanting to know the Bible as one whole story not many books just thrown together to make one book."
"I can‚Äôt recommend this book highly enough! Angie Smith has become one of my ‚Äúmust-read‚Äù authors. I love her writing style. It feels like I‚Äôm sitting across the kitchen table from her drinking coffee and talking about Jesus. She is warm, inviting and funny. I giggled my way through her book. But I also had many tears because this book reminds me of why I‚Äôm a Christian. Her words make me fall more in love with Jesus. I‚Äôve been a Christian for a long time and I learned a ton. I love how each book of the Bible fits together and Angie‚Äôs timeline of events is so helpful. If you sometimes struggle with understanding the Bible, Woven is an invaluable resource. Get it NOW!"
What an incredible book! I have gone through Seamless and Matchless and reference/review through them often. I was so excited to get Woven in to get reading and hoped it would be filled with even more detail than the Bible studies. I was not disappointed at all! Angie has such an incredible way with words that truly resonates and gets to the heart level. I cannot recommend this book enough and I‚Äôm so excited to read through it again!
"I love love love this book! I don‚Äôt want to put it down. The way Angie writes is hilarious & insightful. I have all of her studies & wondered if this would just be a repeat of the Seamless study, but it goes much deeper & is just brilliantly written. Wonderful book!"
"Get your copy now! Don't wait! After doing the Seamless and Matchless study, I was concerned that Woven would be a lot of repeats. But God! This book was a great story of the weaving of God's word. It will be one of those books I keep handy to refer back to often. I've grown up reading the Bible but have a hard time retaining and understanding all the intricacies. This book helped so much to pull some things together! Loved it. Fixing to read it again in the hard copy version... Highlighter and pen in hand! üíú"
"No matter where you are in your relationship or experiences with God, this book is for you! Not only is Angie H I L A R I O U S, she makes approaching the Bible with confidence feel attainable. I laughed out loud and wiped away tears as I read Woven. While pulling you in to her own stories, Angie presents the Bible in such a clear and engaging way.  You will not regret this purchase and you won't be able to put it down!"
"When I first ordered this I thought it would be similar to Seamless bible study- which I loved!  And while they do go together in the fact that they tell the story of the bible as one, this book digs much deeper.  Angie makes learning about the bible fun!  I love how you can see her humor come through.  For sure recommend this to anyone that wants to learn more about the bible.  I have a group that we do study's together and we are thinking of do this as a ""book club""  and although I have read it I would read it again and again."
Totally recommend this book to anyone who is looking for answers and guidance from the Bible. This book is for the seasoned Christian and for the new believer. Angie Smith‚Äôs ability to relate a book that was written thousands of years ago to our lives today is so smooth. She is an incredible writer and allows God to use her talents for deepening the knowledge of others. Buy this book!
This book is one for everyone - whether you have studied the Word of God for years or have never looked at a Bible.  Angie‚Äôs easy to understand explanations - while deep in value - will draw you into the story of the Bible like never before.  It‚Äôs one of those books that will be grabbed often and dog-eared from use!  Thanks Angie for once again pouring out your heart.
I have read every one of Angie‚Äôs books and Bible studies and Woven does not disappoint! Angie writes with humor and passion that pulls you right in. You can feel her love for Jesus through her words.This book depicts the Bible as the stories within The Story that so beautifully show God‚Äôs redemption plan.Let Angie take you on this journey and grow your love of Jesus through your new love of His Story.
"You will love this book! The Bible can be hard to read but this book makes it easy, fun and relatable! It will make you want to read and keep reading your Bible!"
"Grasping the big picture of the Bible is an essential foundation of understanding, interpreting, and applying Scripture. Angie gives a wonderful introduction to that concept in Woven."
"I've read many books by Angie Smith and each one has become special to me. Woven is no exception. It doesn't matter if you've never opened the Bible or you've read the Bible from cover to cover 100 times, Woven puts the pieces together in a simple and meaningful way. Don't pass this one up. Once you read it, you'll want to share it with everyone."
"I have done Seamless from Angie and when I found out this book was being released, I knew I had to buy it! Love how this book paints the picture of the Bible being one big complete story! Great for women in all different stages in their faith!"
"Angie both hilariously and skillfully details the storyline of Scripture in a way that will clarify the reader's understanding of what is going on and when as they read. This book is for both the brand new believer and the seasoned veteran, and it's sure to make you laugh, show you things you missed in the text, and point you to Jesus."
"Angie Smith has once again helped me fall in love with the Old Testament in her new book Woven. She is a captivating author who draws you in with humor, knowledge and clarity. She is real and her writing makes it easy for all to understand. This book would be a fabulous read for a new believer, but also is insightful for those who have been reading the Bible for years. I would highly recommend this book!"
"Angie Smith‚Äôs books are always amazing and Woven is no exception. She seamlessly weaves the story of the Bible as one story. This book is different than Seamless because it‚Äôs a chapter book that stands independently without videos or as a Bible study. I highly encourage anyone and everyone to read any Angie Smith books, but especially this one üíõ"
"If you loved Seamless, you'll love Woven. It's the chapter book version with more content! Not only does Angie do an amazing job of teaching the bible as one story, her writing is like sitting down with a friend.  She's so relatable and it draws you in.  I am so excited to read this next month with my small group!"
"This book is so good!!! Angie‚Äôs writing is very relatable and she makes the Bible easy to understand. If the Bible has ever seemed too complex for you, get this book!! She breaks it down and by the end of the book, you‚Äôll feel like you can not only digest it but that you can also tell others about it. Read it!!"
"This book is simply amazing. I have been a fan of Angie Smith‚Äôs writing for a long time now, and I absolutely love her voice. She breaks down the Bible in such a meaningful way. I had to force myself to put it down so I wouldn‚Äôt read it all in one sitting."
I love the way the Angie helps us to realize the Bible is a story that is a gift from God. Through Woven she helps us understand how the stories are tied together.
"Woven is a beautiful book helping the reader to understand the Bible as a whole story of God‚Äôs redemptive plan. It is a book I know I will comeBack to again and again. I have enjoyed everything I‚Äôve read by this author, and Woven did not disappoint!"
"Wow. All I can say is wow! This was amazing. I learned so many new things from this book, even after doing the Seamless and Matchless studies. And what I loved the most, is that it‚Äôs a great book for new and old believers alike. Highly, highly recommend!!"
"As with everything I read from Angie I loved Woven. She writes as if you are sitting right beside her. It‚Äôs hard for me to read the Bible but reading her books, like Woven, I can actually understand the Bible more. Thank you Angie."
This book is awesome! If you are just starting to read the Bible please get this book! She has a way of explaining the Bible is an easy to understand non intimidating way!  I have learned so much from Angie Smith‚Äôs books this one is exceptional!!!
"A Must Read!It is so amazing reading this book how the Bible is completely tied together. I've read many parts of the Bible but never realized how ""woven"" Jesus' story is throughout the Old and New Testaments!"
I love the way Angie teaches about the bible in her own way. I have learned about stuff I overlooked when I would read the Bible. Thank you Angie.
Angie‚Äôs writing is so relatable and really helps me to understand how Gods words flow together as a story. An easy read that draws you closer on every page üíú
"Angie has this way of writing where you feel like you are sitting across the table from her with a cup of coffee. She is wildly funny, which makes this book such an easy read. But, it's not a fluff read by any means. She is really walking us through the Bible in a way that we can understand-- with a bit of her humor thrown in and I love that. This isn't a stuffy Bible book."
"My daughter ordered this book for me and she hit the nail on the head. I have now found a new author that I like regarding Christian topics. This author is hilariously funny at times and I find myself laughing until tears come to my eyes. I also find myself crying because as well as being informative, she can be so poignant at times. I laughed I cried I learned from this book and I will read it again down the road because I enjoy it so much. I know I will learn something new every time because it is jam packed with information. Beautifully written."
"""Not only is the Bible one story, it‚Äôs a story you are now a part of.""I really enjoy reading books/studies by Angie Smith. She is funny and light hearted, but there is also plenty of content to digest. My firsts experience with Angie Smith was her Bible study, Seamless. If you have not read that study, I highly recommend going through it. You will see the same theme in her newest book, Woven. In this book, Smith teaches that the Bible is one big story, from Genesis to Revelation. We often do not realize that there is such a connection between the Old and New Testament. When you are reading about all of the laws of animal sacrifice and how to live and worship in Leviticus, it is sometimes hard to imagine how any of that is relevant now. However, when we see the Bible as one big love story from God to us, with Jesus as the central character, it all comes together in such a beautiful way. You will see these connections being made and explained, and more, as you read Woven.The book starts out in Genesis, and works through each book of the Bible in order. I enjoyed reading the summary of each book, along with the humor and personal connections that were included. Even though this is a summary of a huge and complex book, Smith's style of writing is easy and engaging. It feels like you are just chatting with a friend over coffee, as you discuss the Bible and how all of those stories come together. I love reading and studying the Bible! It is my passion and something I spend a lot of my free time on, and this book has helped improve my study time. It allowed me to see a bigger picture of how everything fits together.‚ÄúGod has woven himself into his Word and into his people, and the best way for us to follow that thread is to begin tugging on it.‚ÄùI received a digital copy of this book from the publisher, in return for an honest review. All opinions are my own."
"Este libro fue inspirado por Dios. Pude sentir la presencia del Esp√≠ritu Santo cuando lo le√≠a. Espero que pueda hacer un cambio en tu vida, como lo esta haciendo en mi. Dios siga usando mas al Pastor Harrigan. Bendiciones!"

Est√© siervo de Dios explica de manera muy sencilla los grandes misterios de la oraci√≥n. Para m√≠ la oraci√≥n es como un mundo en el que como bien el expresa muy pocos cristianos conocen y se pierden de tantas bendiciones por conformarse con oraciones simples cuando podemos obtener grandes victorias crecer en el esp√≠ritu si le dedicamos m√°s tiempo a cultivar la oraci√≥n. Estoy deseosa de poder leer sus otros libros pero a√∫n no los he podido conseguir aqu√≠. Dios bendiga al Pastor Juan Carlos Harrigan.

"Sientes el poder de Dios desde que lo est√°s leyendo, y desde el segundo d√≠a El Se√±or me levanto a las 2:45 a orar y fue maravilloso, no hay d√≠a que llegue tarde a su cita de despertarmeüôèüèª Dios bendiga la vida del Pastor Harrigan y su familia üôèüèª"

"Fue un despertar, me hizo ver un mundo de bendiciones que estoy perdiendo (dejando en la mesa) simplemente por no orar de madrugada. A veces es repetitivo pero el coraz√≥n del libro es poderoso."
Este libro ne ha ayudado a aprender a orar de madrugada y a experimentar cosas que antes no las sabia. Me ha ense√±ado a ver lo sobrenatural de Dios y A crecer espiritualmente cada dia mas. Me ha ayudado a conocer un Dios inmenso y profundo. Bendigo la vida del pastor por inspirar a muchas personas asi como yo a buscar cada dia mas del padre!
"The Power To Pray At Dawn is a powerful book. I read this book knowing that I couldn't read Spanish. The Holy Spirit helped me read it and God gave me the strength and knowledge to read it. I was impressed with myself; the words were easy to read. I stumbled over saying a few words. Thank the Lord for giving me the opportunity to read and understand it. I will share it with other people, so that they are blessed. This book is a blessing from God to me in my Spiritual life. May God continue to bless Pastor Juan Carlos Harrigan for his ministry and family."

tres satisfaite
"I just received my NKJV MacArthur Study Bible and it is simply beautiful! Before you even open the box, just the weight of it while holding it in your hands tells you that the contents must be amazing. The natural leather cover, the edge-lined bindings and the readability of the 2K/Denmark typeface are all outstanding.I‚Äôve already spent several hours going through the massive material I‚Äôm holding and it is truly a wonderful piece of instruction offering every tool imaginable to aid in the study of God‚Äôs Word. This Bible is definitely designed for the serious student of Scripture.I have only two issues though immediately understand one of them, and that being that the verses read through like the NASB instead of starting on a new line. But this Bible is so thick, I can see why it was done so. Second, the words of Jesus are not in red which will take a little adjustment, though I am familiar enough with the Bible that this isn‚Äôt a big hurdle. Other than those two minor quibbles, I‚Äôm very very satisfied!"
"Excellent Bible!!  The only reason I couldn‚Äôt give a five star rating is that it doesn‚Äôt have our Lord Jesus‚Äôs words in red.  I personally believed his words are so significant, that EVERY bible should be red letter editions.Especially for the new Christian, or even unbelievers, that by simply thumbing through the word, they would be drawn to His words.God Bless!!"
This is an complete and accurate study Bible. As is the binding is outstanding as is the paper. I just wish it could have red letter edition.
"Absolutely pleased with this Bible. It is immediately apparent a tremendous amount of careful...critical thought even...went into considering its design and development everything from the page layouts, the paper choice, the font type, size, and color, and arrangement. I have many Bibles...this is the one I use when I want ""serious time"" alone to meditate on Scripture. John MacArthur's expository style comes through strongly in the notes, another feature I really appreciate. There is a movement among some publishers to start again making super quality Bibles. I, for one, am glad to see it."
"I received this bible in the mail last night and it‚Äôs everything I expected to be! It‚Äôs definitely something I needed as a new believer. I used to be caught up in the charismatic church, taking scriptures out of context often. So this bible is great for me because it literally breaks down the Bible verse by verse. Highly recommend. I purchased this and also a bible carrying case as well and the combo is perfect. Can‚Äôt say enough good things about it!"
"The notes are numerous but add a great deal of context that consistently enriches my Bible study. I can appreciate the Thumb indexing for quickly passing chapter to chapter. I have admired John Macarthur's ministry from his GTY sermons, so I knew that this work represented years of study and preaching being shared across the entire Bible. Finally, I can also appreciate the work that went into additional materials such as how to approach studying the Bible systematically and charts.I am impressed with how readable the small text is (even in the footnotes). I recommend this Bible without reservation to anyone who is looking to take their analysis of scripture to another level. May God bless John Macarthur and his ministry. He is empowering numerous men and women of God to spend more time with the Word and reap the fruit of that with work like this. To God be the glory!"
I have the original hard cover First Editition MacArthur Study Bible also. This Second Edition is really beautiful. It has more notes than the First Edition !
"I read somewhere someone had bought the Kindle edition and was having trouble getting around in the book. With the Kindle paperwhite tap at the top while the book is open. Type in the word you are looking for in the search box. The Kindle will bring up all the words related or take you to the table of contents. If this is the first time doing a search on the book, the Kindle will first index the book and then a search is possible.This has helped me greatly with all my books on the Kindle."
"This is an absolutely gorgeous Bible.  The font is crisp and very readable, the paper is first rate.  The leather is soft and supple and smells wonderful.  What a treasure!"
"The leather work is absolutely phenomenal!The quality is completely obvious, and the work will surely stand the test of time.I almost don‚Äôt want to use it mark it, but I will!Absolute work of craftsmanship!"
"I needed a new bible and wanted a good study bible. This one is a bit heavy and I had to buy a cover to be able to carry it, but it has proved to be good with excellent notes and cross references. and some corrections from the KJV into the NKJV.I just wish they could have translated it from Hebrew for Matthew, which the Jews have. It clears up several more transcription errors that crept from the correct Hebrew thru Aramaic thru Greek and into English."
"I have 10+ study bibles. I recently got this pastor‚Äôs bible and it is by far the best. I‚Äôve ordered 12 more to give as gifts. I want to order more to give when I‚Äôm witnessing to people and they don‚Äôt have a bible, so that will be soon I hope. Maybe I can get some wholesale."
Awesome Bible but mine came with glue stains. When you pay almost 200 you hope that the product that comes is high quality
"An amazing study Bible. I really, really like that the relevant study notes are on the same page with the passages I am reading. I've had other study Bibles that had very brief study references, and some that made me jump all around..... I'm kind of ADHD and those styles make it difficult for me to stay on point. I really like the layout of this Bible because all of the notes are on the same page as the passages. Makes it a bit thick, about 2 1/3 to 3 inches, but has great introduction to each chapter, along with historical setting and timeline. Beautiful cover and binding and easy to read font."
I‚Äôm very thankful for this study Bible! I can tell a lot of time and effort was put into the introductions and commentaries etc. It has been extremely helpful to me!
"Not sure what happened to this bible. The pages are cut in a slant, and the pages are see through.  What a huge disappointment for such a beautifully written book."
"I like how the verses' commentary seems thorough and understandable, though not all verses have a commentary. Many commentaries require one to have a dictionary present to understand - not this study Bible. I would highly recommend this Bible for any believer, regardless of where they are in their walk. It would also make an excellent gift for a young student serious about improving understanding and moving to the next level."
"A magnifying glass would be nice, seems the print is much smaller than anticipated."
Unfortunately EASY PRINT was not large enough to be seen with my poor vision.  I returned it and got a LARGE PRINT to fill my needs.
"This Bible was used and came in perfect shape! The only mark is on the outside text block. Nothing that would effect the usage or quality of the Bible. It came early than expected which made it very nice. The print is smaller than I like, but that‚Äôs why I wear readers ü§ì Don‚Äôt hesitate to buy from them, I know I will !"
"This is probably THE BEST study Bible out there! I got it for myself and can't stop reading it! If you want a study Bible that explains things in a literal, historical, gramatical way, get this Bible! There are a lot of more liberal Bibles out there, but this is not one of them! :-)"
A person that has a great love for the truth will but an item like this. There is and never will be a greater book available for the betterment and salvation for mankind period. If you truly want your life to improve and get much better and if you want to renew your mind you simply must read this book every single day. I guarantee it.
I really enjoy the layout of this bible by John MacArthur. I like tabs and the concordance and each chapters are well explained and great reference. This bible is great read if your look for awesome bible to help further your walk with Christ.
A great resource/study bible
"It‚Äôs a great bible from a great teacher of the word. A wealth of information and everything in-between. No need to think twice you will gain knowledge and understanding from buying it, great study bible."
I love the study notes of this Bible that help me to gain a deeper understanding of God‚Äôs Word. I absolutely love that there is a ribbon divider to save a specific page for both the Old and New Testament
This is a tremendous resource to help you learn who the Lord is. It will strengthen your faith and I could not recommend it more highly. John MacAruthur is a blessing. What are you waiting for? Buy it now! You won't regret it! It is made with quality in mind.
I would give it 5 stars but MacArthur won't sell a KJV version.  The content is very good
"Wonderful addition to the Bible collection - wonderful quality, T. Nelson did a fantastic job.  I very much enjoy Dr. J. Mac's work and his love for the Word of God.  I would encourage this as a valuable study tool as you dive deep into the Scriptures."
Not even into the actual Bible and at the Title:  How to study the Bible (Page xxi) a whole section came out.  I will be returning this Bible.  What a shame.
We bought this as a wedding gift for a friend. Neither are Christians. Hope they read it at least once. Hope they don't use it as firestarter.
I like the size and lettering and most of all the notes. It's a wonderful Bible and the quality seems really good so far. I like the feel of how soft the leather is and the lay out of the scripture and the notes. I would definitely purchase this again and I'm really happy that is as advertised
"We love this study and scripture. Its beautiful, concise and impactful. MacArthur is strictly biblical and is such and encouraging model."
I love this bible.  Perfect for self bible study.  Before I would have all kinds of books and commentaries flooding my desk space.  This bible takes that need away.  Line by line commentary is top notch and the comfort print is on point.  Soft goat skin leather red dye and gold bling on the edges of the paper ‚ÄúBoom‚Äù.  Only problem was the Bible came with the backing unglued twice but Amazon was top notch in remedying the problem.
the text was so small I couldn't read it without a magnifying glass and I don't wear reading glasses.
"Such a really nice Bible, the paper is really good, has 2 ribbons, the layout is really good."
"Bought this for my father, who has a shaky faith at best. He seemed to like it though, and God willing he'll coke around. Great quality Bible, great references and notes by Johnny Mac."
"I've been searching for the truth, in reference to the most accurate bible and a true bible believing Christian  church available.  Beginning in 1978 I was ""Born from Above""  The MacArthur  study bible  is the best bible to study the ""Word"" that I have found."
No one is better at explaining the Bible than Dr John MacArthur!! Great Bible aid!!
Really Amazed on the work put into this study bible. I‚Äôm really looking forward to studying and understanding the word of God.
Excellent Quality.....very sharp Bible!
Book came in excellent condition except im missing pages 15 through 78! How does this even happen!? Now im trying to figure out how to get a new book from a order 5 months old.
Good study Bible
"love this Bible. Has great notes in understanding scriptures. The only problem I have, is the words are very small to read. So if you don't like reading small print.. I wouldn't recommend."
Great study Bible- we can all benefit from MacArthur's many years of extensive Bible study and research!
Great bible lots of great insights from a biblical scholar. This has opened my eyes to words of the lord clearly and in context.
Do not hesitate buy it. If you ever needed help connecting pieces of God's word together or figuring out what parts of the world where the Bible took place this is it. Great quality easy to use and read.
Clear Biblical teaching. Excellent study tool to help learn more of God‚Äôs Word.
Great product. I would recommend it to anyone.
Awesome bible
"Loved the usual content of this author as usual with added extras the earlier additions don't have, but the print is too small."
Ordered for my Husband.
Nice!
A very nice edition of the scriptures with MacArthur's helpful notes. I consider this Bible a must for serious students and teachers of the Word.
"Beautiful Bible, and the fact thatJohn MacArthur wrote all thestudy notes/commentary notes makes this a Bible I'll treasure !!"
Best study Bible I've ever used. I BOUGHT another for my son.
"Excellent bible for studying deeper into Gods word. I purchased this Bible for a friend , and him and his wife truly enjoy it so far ."
Excellent
Print not large enough and study notes are too vague
It was ripped and dirty and old and look old.
"[LIKES]-9 point Comfort Print font (with turquoise headings)-Premium Brown Goatskin Leather cover-Sewn binding with a reinforced seam-Perimeter stitching on cover-Leather lined inside cover-Decorative ribs on spine-Premium 39 GSM paper is the best-Gold gilt line on the inside of cover-Art gilt pages (light red under gold)-Three really nice wide satin ribbons[POSSIBLE DISLIKES]-Ribbon colors (red-brown-turquoise) may not be everyone‚Äôs color preferences-Brown Goatskin is the only color/leather option in this Premier edition-No index tabs are available in the Premier edition[MY OPINION]The MacArthur Study Bible has been the best all-around study Bible money can buy for a long time. For many years I have wanted Thomas Nelson publishers to make a premium edition of this in the NKJV. Over 2 decades and 2 million sales later they finally decided to make the upgrades that this popular Bible deserved...A fully redesigned second edition with improved fonts and page layouts as well as updated commentary notes. Plus, a larger selection of maps and charts and diagrams according to the publisher‚Äôs description. In my opinion, this was long overdue. The good news is that it was well worth the wait because they accomplished something that was indeed worthy of this treasured resource. If you want to upgrade from your current MacArthur Study Bible to a new one that is built for a lifetime then this is the only one you want to buy! The art gilding on the page edges is a subtle red under gold which looks great with the beautiful light to medium brown goatskin cover. I will say that the red under the gold is very light compared to the darker red sometimes used in other high end editions I've seen. But this is standard for Thomas Nelson‚Äôs premier editions so I simply mention it in case your expectations are for a dark red color. Regardless, this is basically the most luxurious MSB they have ever made in the NKJV. I fully agree with another online reviewer who said: ""This study Bible is everything the publisher's description states. It is beautiful inside and out!"" Get one while you can because some of the most expensive Study Bibles like this are not always kept in production for long!"
"This Bible is incredible. It is the classic MacArthur Study Bible, but has been updated with notes and more maps/charts. There's 25,000 notes; 190 charts, tables, and diagrams; a systematic theology outline; 72,000 cross references; full concordance; harmony of the gospels; index to biblical doctrines. Each of the books of the Bible have solid introductions (about 1-3 pages). One of the best features of the introductions are the ""interpretive challenges"" of each book.‚Ä¢In terms of the quality, this edition is a massive step up from the old Premier bibles from @thomasnelson. This edition utilizes a high quality brown goatskin (feels like a Schuyler) that is perimeter stitched, and edge-lined. The ribbons are the same quality used on Schuylers and Allans. The paper is 39gm, which is some of the thickest paper currently on the market.‚Ä¢This Bible, like the other second edition premiers coming out, is a dream to hold and to use. the quality is top-notch. I can't fault the quality and design in any way. My only critique is with the NKJV Comfort Font, which isn't my favorite, but gets the job done. Other than that, this Bible is a dream. **bible graciously provided by Thomas Nelson for an honest review"
I have this Bible in the first edition but I really wanted the second edition for the added study notes! I purchased this through ChristianBook.com and is well worth a look! If you‚Äôre looking for a study Bible that really helps to understand those sometimes difficult passages than this is for you!
"Finally, a decent bible translation in a book printed to be readable by folks like me with less than great eyesight. The NKJV, MacArthur Study Bible, 2nd Edition is just that.The New King James Version translation is reported to be good by many scholars and easy to understand.  The type is large, readable and easy on the eyes. The paper is easy to turn but is not so thin as to almost fly over by itself. Of course, all of this comes at a cost and I‚Äôm not just thinking of the $30 price.The MacArthur Study Bible is big and heavy. Really big and heavy. Perhaps it would have been preferable to make this into separate volumes for the Old and New Testaments. In addition, while the scripture text is large and readable, the same is not true of the commentary. It is placed at the bottom of the relevant page making it easy to reference while reading the chapter. However, the text is printed in a tiny 9-point or less font."
"Many, many good things to like about this study Bible:-  Chronology of Old Testament Patriarchs and Judges (helps the reader better understand the time frame of a particular person or book of the Bible).-  Ample number of charts and maps describing various topics in the Bible.-  Chronology of the Old Testament Kings and Prophets.-  Index of doctrines covered in the Bible.-  Good introductory information on each book (author, date, theme, purpose, setting, etc.).-  Detailed concordance.-  Many, many study notes for several Bible verses that interpret and provoke thought.Look forward to many futures uses of this Bible for personal, small group, and other Bible study.  Recommended."
"I love the NKJV of the Bible. For me, it has the poetry of the KJV and the readability of current English. The addition of Dr. John MacArthur's insights is especially helpful when studying. I love to read through the passage of Scripture without other insights but occasionally I get stuck on a verse or phrase. Dr. MacArthur is a pastor and theologian I trust and appreciate the depth of his wisdom. I find it is very helpful in understanding the overall passage. This is a great study Bible. It is larger and heavier than most non-study Bibles, thanks to the commentary, but I love it for my daily devotions."
I was disappointed to see the amount of damage this book had upon arrival. The protective sleeve was ripped and crinkled and the cover is bent with deep gashes along the bottom. I just expected the book to come package better to avoid this immense damage considering the actual cost. Now as far as the book goes there is a vast amount of information and while I'm not super religious I thought a book like this would be helpful. It is helpful to an extent but I believe its more for someone who is very familiar with the bible and the lords word overall.  I still look forward to going through the book although the pace will probably be much slower than anticipated.
"This is an excellent study Bible that will give you additional understanding of what the scriptures mean. This enhancement of knowledge may be very beneficial for your life.The cover is a nice blue cloth with a stiff board that should wear well over time. The printing and commentary are easy to read and structured well.Interpretations of scriptures are different depending on varied views, but this study Bible is done well if this is the one you believe to be truth."
"This is my first-ever study Bible and I am very impressed with the depth of its content.  John MacArthur is a great theologian but yet able to explain Scripture very simply and clearly.  The cross-referencing is probably my favorite part. It's fascinating and exciting to see how the Scriptures connect and support each other across the whole Bible.  In a recent college Bible course, I learned about studying the Bible in context with the who/what/when/where/why/how questions and this study Bible is an excellent resource to assist in answering these questions."
"We ordered this with the idea of giving it to my mother in law who is both a big fan of the word of God and John MacArthur. We knew she would love the study notes by him and his way of explaining complex bible issues. The one challenge with this bible is that it is really large and heavy, we fear too heavy for our mother in law to enjoy."
"Pastor John MacArthur has an ability to study Gods Word and break it down and apply it. There are so many people out there who pick and choose parts of the Bible they like and don't like. But, John MacArthur does his best to teach ""the whole counsel"" of the Word of God. In this Bible Pastor John gives great teaching and practical insight that is applicable to all believers. I hope you will gain greater insight into the Word as you read the Bible and follow along with Pastor MacArthurs teaching/commentary."
"I collect a variety of religious texts, so this was a good addition to my collection. I like that it is NKJV, so it is a little easier to understand than KJV. The footnotes and speaker notes help provide some clarity on meaning and context, but like all others, are just the opinions of one man reading it."
"I think the first thing to consider is which translation you want. A lot of that depends on the what translation your local church goes with. After that, I like a good study Bible that has lots of good information. There are lots of pages where there are more notes than Bible on a page! This has lots of great info. It's very conservative which I don't mind. It's a good study Bible. Even though it's a bigger Bible, the font is pretty small because of all the info on each page."
"MacArthur is a trusted pastor and I enjoy anything with his name on it. The print is easy to read and the book is made of great quality materials. I now have two different translations of this study Bible, it‚Äôs great to be able to go back and forth between the translations to have a better understanding and his notes are amazing! I highly recommend this study Bible."
"THE CONTENT IS AMAZING, these study notes are second to none. My problem is the new layout of the notes. This edition went from two columns to three columns with no dividing lines and it makes the pages seem very busy. The font size is good, easy to read. I also like that they have included two ribbons, red and blue, which helps a lot."
"Very nice overall quality. The layout and study notes of course make this a ‚Äúsuperthick‚Äù bible, so it's not best for taking on the go. Keep it as your at-home version, where you have space to lay it open for review. The print size was fine for me and the paper is substantial enough to take light notes and dry highlighter."
"This is a nice Bible, the font is a little smaller then I was hoping but I can easily read it. I am pleased with the care that was taken in putting this together and the commentary."
This is a great Bible with lots of great study Bible features that are especially helpful for new believers or those that have not studied the Bible extensively.
Are the Jesus‚Äôs words in red???? In this bible
"I was worried about my 71 year old eyes being able to read this extraordinary Bible. I‚Äôm nearsighted with a cataract soon to be removed, and have astigmatism. I‚Äôm not having issues reading  the Bible or the commentary. I just remove my glasses. The font used is amazing and the headings an eye soothing turquoise blue.  I‚Äôve never experienced such a comprehensive, easy to understand layout/introduction  preceding each book of the Bible. I used to believe that the Bible will speak for itself to my soul because it is a living thing; however, it is a blessing to be able to have my questions answered about historical and language explained without doing an Internet search all the time.I‚Äôm a member of an Independent Baptist church community which uses KJV only. While I‚Äôm not a Bible scholar, I haven‚Äôt found the NKJV to deviate that much. Other members of my church are seeking out John MacArthur resources as well because he doesn‚Äôt equivocate on Biblical principles to dance to our culture‚Äôs ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù of right and wrong.God bless you all as you decide if you should purchase this version. Merry Christmas!"
