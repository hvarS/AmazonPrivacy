Review
"I read this book recently and it is timeless. Be prepared to be frightened as you come to realize that Satan and demonic possession is as real today as it was two millennia ago. Take comfort in the fact that our only Savior, Jesus, is stronger. As you read one becomes aware of the real war that rages in the spiritual realm and the steps we can take in defense. This is a war for the human heart fought with truth versus lies. Let us arm ourselves with truth and wisdom."
"Christian resident doctor, Rebecca Brown, unwittingly did her residency at a hospital located in a hotbed town of a large satanic cult. Because of her strength in Christian faith, she because a target of their wrath. Instead of being chased out by this coven, Rebecca managed to grab their high priestess, Elaine, and convert Elaine to Jesus.Really important look at satanism through a different lens. A woman who entered true satanism by choice rather than by birth and another woman who saw it all unfold. Heavy on the Christian perspective, but proof that Jesus actually is the right answer and solution. Disappointing to all of us dedicated to misunderstanding and deconstructing authentic Christianity.Almost every ex-satanist will say, the target of their hate and the person they spend most of their energy debunking is Jesus and his authentic Christian followers. Never Buddha. Never Krishna. Never Muhammad. Never any Hindu gods. Jesus is always their threat. What does this tell us?"
"I first read He Came to Set the Captives Free about two years ago. It was recommended to me by multiple Christian friends on separate occasions. I believe in the reality of evil. I also believe in spiritual warfare. I saw the number of high-star reviews on Amazon and figured it was worth a read. The author professes to be Christian and to care about the spiritual well-being of others. Despite a bad gut feeling about the book, I purchased the it and decided to investigate further. I felt that if this was the author’s testimony, I needed to take it seriously.As I read, some of the story felt so horrific that I questioned whether it was truth of fiction. However, the author's use of Bible verses to back up and validate her experiences, led me to question my own judgment. Who was I to question her experience? At times, the evil conveyed was so atrocious, I wanted to stop reading the book all-together. My own stubbornness and curiosity propelled me until I finished reading it.But the effect was trauma. I didn't want to think of anything demonically or Satanically-related after reading the book, much less engage the author's version of ""spiritual warfare.""I attempted to read a snippet of the book about a year ago and it still had the same effect, same horrible gut feeling. I debated throwing the book away or reselling it used. Then I debated whether I could resell it with a clear conscience. I decided to keep it, good or bad, as a memento in my spiritual journey.Now with a couple years' distance after my first-read, further research led me to information suggesting that the author and her books are a complete hoax.For me, I felt the whole experience with this book to have been a hard lesson in discernment."
"This books opens your mind to what may or may not be going on in our society today.  It makes you wonder whom you may be sitting next to working with and what may be gong on in an operation.  I always explain to people put GOD FIRST!.  I will not fight without the Holy Spirit.  If you think you may be strong enough to fight demons alone, God Bless.  I hide behind my sword and shield.  God's Holy Word.  The readings are an eye opener."
"This book gives you the impression that it's overwhelming and almost impossible to defeat satan and his tactics. Rather than encouraging who we are in Christ and the authority we have over the enemy of our souls; it leaves you feeling defeated. The author states that it took years and years of deliverance for the demons to leave ""Elaine"".  Deliverance had to be done again and again before the ""house was swept clean"".  I find no scripture that supports that."
My prayer life increased and was taken to another level after reading this book.  It confirms what you already know about spiritual warfare and principalities and opens your eyes to what you did not know.
This book is terrific! Makes you really think!
"I'm sorry but this book is not reflective of God's heart nor should it be read by believers in Jesus Christ. This book is a drama (albeit non-fiction) written to shock believers by giving them a glimpse into a very dark world of the occult under the guise of being a manual for how to survive such evil. First of all, we are not supposed to focus on the demonic evil that has been perpetrated on humanity and the pages of this book leave images in your mind that are difficult to 'un-see'. We are supposed to focus on our jobs as believers in what Christ has done to give us ALL authority over this evil. Flooding your 'eye gate' with images that are painted throughout this book is damaging to the soul in ways too numerous to mention. You're better off finding a book on spiritual warfare that emphasizes the authority Christ bought and paid for when he spoiled the principalities and powers of the dark world. I have to admit I did not finish the book as I was so vexed by it I mailed it straight back to A for a full refund."
"If you're into spiritual warfare and want to know how the Devil really works, you should get it.As a warning... Be prepared! Pray and fast."
"Let me start off by saying this. The author was not kidding when she starts off by saying that this is the hardest book you will ever read. It most certainly was. I finished this whole entire book within 24 hours of receiving it. The first half of the book goes into a deep perspective of Satanism and the many gut wrenching facts. It opens your eyes to the real evil existing in our world. If your a sensitive person like me you’ll have to take small breaks from reading because it can get overwhelming. However, if you feel the call to spiritual warfare (which I believe all christians are) then I recommend this book. with lots of prayers for strength and God’s peace before bedtime was able to get through it. The unseen world is no joke and only through Christ and guidance of the Holy Spirit are we to successfully fight back against the enemy. This book gave me insight and boldness to come against any fiery darts of the devil. It teaches you to put on the full armor of God. I walk away from this book with a heart of GRATITUDE that we serve such an amazing Father. We are all His children. God bless you."
"This is an excellent book and confirms much of what I have heard from those who have dealt with the occult. Not everyone is able to accept what is written within this book because they have been taught that they should not suffer. That is not what Jesus said. If you are serious about your walk with God and what it takes to be a Christian, understand you will encounter spiritual warfare on some level. This book helps the reader understand what we as Christians are up against and how to combat it. We serve a supernatural God and our weapon's of warfare are supernatural. Don't be caught off guard, get this book and take it seriously because satan and his kingdom of darkness is very serious about dragging you to hell for all eternity."
"Dr. Brown speaks the Truth. We are under spiritual warfare and most haven't a clue. Most would not want to understand this and continue muddling though life with scales on their eyes. For those of us who for various reasons cannot do that her books on how to gird up and stand in the power of Jesus is just about the last place to find how to do it. Because, the churches sure don't teach it. This is her first book. It's priceless. There are some video clips of her on YouTube. She was the real deal. I'm buying more of her books to give to others.Dr. Rebecca Brown went home to our Savior this past June. She devoted her life to Jesus."
"This book is inconsistent, the author says that Elaine was delivered by all demons when her pastor join in prayer, but then later on it says she still had demons. I don't believe this book to be true, I think is information gather from other sources. It even mentions a demon they saw named legion and that one mention is in the bible (the same demon Jesus cast out). I pray and the holy spirit guided me to send it back. Not a Christian book."
"Again and again, I praised the Lord while I was reading this book.This book, together with Rebecca Brown's 3 more books, has given me a lot of valuable information beyond what I had already known from other authors, but I would say Rebecca Brown's books were the best out of the 15 books I bought about spiritual warfares.Her books are packed with a lot of valuable information, covering so many things that I had never paid attention to.I highly recommend this book and her 3 other books."
This book is MIND blowing! In one day I’m halfway through the book. It really prompts you to pray more and know the word of God for yourself. It makes you want to draw closer to God because of the wickedness that fills this land. Thank you are Rebecca Brown!!!
"Every Christian needs this book to see a little more of the darkness that is surprisingly around us. I’ve learned more truth in this than my church. Guys come on, we’ve been lied to forever! I read this book in 2 days! I couldn’t put it down if I wanted too. The ways of the deceiver was way too eye opening because I lived seen and heard lies, I was ready to see the truth. It glorifies God, not Satan. Yes an ex satanist wrote it, and thank GOD SHE DID! praise God and I thank Isaiah saldivar for recommending it! I will tell you this, satan DID NOT want me to read it. Just like her introduction stated. And I almost didn’t. The thought that ran through my mind was “maybe satan is using her to tell lies to deter us from the truth, maybe satan WAS using her?” And I think God told me, “just as he introduction, satan doesn’t want you to read it and see his deceitfulness”.GOOD READ TO OPEN YOUR EYES JUST HOW NASTY AND SLY THE DEVIL IS, and how loving and just our Heavenly Father is!How far are you willing to go for Jesus?! ❤️"
I appreciate this book as it has a lot of information and scriptures that I can pray about and motivates me to seek GOD more about spiritual warfare and communicates the need for us to really know Jesus personally these days too and rely on the Holy Spirit to give us discernment and wisdom especially in the times we are living in.
"I absolutely love this book!!!  I just went through some of what these ladies went through, the harassment from satanist, & this book is an eye opener to what I Really went through!! I wish I had this book 6 months ago!!  Thank you sooo much for this read!! I’m ready to order the next one!!!"
"This book exposes the pitfalls of the occult and the dangerous doorways it opens to the spirit world.  It is a MUST READ for every Christian to understand how the spirit realm seduces and traps many, especially Ch 13 “Doorways “.  After I read this book I felt a stronger understanding of how to better protect myself, my friends, my family and my home.  We are in a spiritual battle daily.  Any Christian who doesn’t understand that has not read the Bible.  We must Armor Up, go forward without the spirit of fear, and be about our Father’s business!  Its harvest time and each soul we can steal back from Satan is a celebration to come in Heaven!!  Thank you Dr. Rebecca Brown for your faith, your teachings  and your spiritual warfare."
This book is definetly one I will never forget. I like how it includes scriptural references as well as other books to help better understand whats going on. It is a game changer for any believer in Christ and a great subject for study. Once you read it there is nobgoing back... in a good way 🙃😎
"Thankful to dr Rebecca brown and Elaine for their sacrifice to get this book out. A must read for those interested in the satanic cult in America that’s only growing, and to get a better understanding on spiritual warfare. This book helped me quite a lot in understanding my own brother who transmogrified in my living room the other day in a deep trance cursing me in broad daylight — his eyeballs changed from pit black to hazel-green like a muslim … with slitted pupils like a dragon … the myth, the rumor, the folklore. An illuminati reptilian! He also was able to erase the church logo sticker on my cars bumper and turn it into a white eerie tombstone. I now know I am NOT crazy thanks to Elaines detailed and graphic account of the brotherhood and the things these Harry Potter people are capable of. Like stopping bullets w their contracts w satan, and lighting uo candles from several feet away. Cool… if only they weren’t murderers, cannibals, live human sacrifices, pedophiles…on their way to hell, there already in the spirit while the devil controls their body is the true phenomenon. But they are too unconscious always in a trance to know that the devil is a great liar, a thief, a murderer, a Sadducee, extremely religious with his cold love and blatant hatred. Telling everybody they’re the greatest. What a crackhead, may Satan die and may the captives be set free. Not just some of Zion, but all of us this time, Lord — even among the brotherhood. Please save my brother who never knew any better, too enchanted by magic and sorcery and fear & violence feels like love in his bosom to that man. Dunno how that happened when he comes out of a long lineage of born again believers, preachers, elders. They always pick one out of a family of believers, the church of Satan. Thank you Elaine for escaping the death cult. Thank You Lord for her incredible example to us all, along w Dr Brown who suffered greatly even tho she was raised by righteous parents who set a great example of Jesus. And she always prayed and became a nurse to set the captives free. What women of sacrifice, she was labeled crazy so she would write this book someday. Because of this book, I who am also labeled crazy am utterly convinced I’m not crazy at all. The Brotherhood is real and they’re powerful beyond imagination. I felt way less alone reading this. Thank You Lord I felt like You wrote this for me T_T it’s a great read for every born again believer over 18.May they Rest In Peace."
"Sitting in my living room I heard the sweet soft voice of Jesus instruct me to go to the Family Christian Bookstore because there was a book He wanted me to purchase.  Once I got there I was lead by God the Holy Spirit to exactly He Came to Set the Captives Free by Dr. Rebecca Brown.  I walked up to the counter to purchase it and all the electrical power went out.  In a calm voice the manager asked, ""Are you purchasing one of Dr. Brown's books?""  I replied that I was.  He said, ""The power will be on soon.""  Upon completion of reading it I then again heard the Lord's soft gentle voice, ""I'm bringing you together.""  He did exactly that.  I have visited her and Daniel and they me and my family often.  Six months ago Rebecca went home to be with her Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, while reading her Bible.  I miss her terribly.  Up until the time of her death she remained in service to Jesus Christ in setting the captives free.  Jesus tells us in His holy Bible that, ""My children die of lack of knowledge. Hosea 4:6."""
Satan does not want you to read this book. It is one of four. Read all four of her books if you want to go from milk to meat. The church has failed us in giving us the tools to fight satan. Her books equip and empower even the faint-hearted.
The satanic kingdom is real! No fairytales.
Superbly written.  I was able to turn this into a personal Bible Study. Thank you Lord for deliverance!
"It's a real eye opener for anyone, Christ loving or not.  Read it and decide for yourself.  If you don't learn from it, you're just lost.  Share and let others learn what is really going on!"
AMAZING AMAZING BOOK!!! Words can not say how much this book is such a great read. So much you don’t realize until I read this book and everything my grandmother taught me growing up about spiritual warfare this Dr. Confirms it and goes into details and breaks it down and backs it up with scripture which is important to me. I absolutely love her testimony and obedience to the lord I wish I could thank her for writing this book and sharing such important information. All glory goes to G-d almighty!!
I read maybe 3/4 of the book before I decided to stop reading. I respect what the writer is trying to convey. But she also Contradict herself at the same time. I am a very spiritual person. Not religious. Some of the things she has written is her  OPINION about spiritually. Because meditation and being able to tap in to our own gifts has nothing to do with demonic anything. It was a sack of piss by the 14th chapter. Which is what lead me to throw the book to the ground. It’s good for entertainment if you need a laugh.
"If you're looking for an insight into the occult then this is the book you need. I've had my copy since the very late 1980's, I bought this one for a friend and she says that she's really learning a lot from it just as I did when I first read it. And I still use all of Rebecca's books for reference when I have a question about something."
As A Christian who has done Spiritual warfare this book is total fiction. I through it in the trash.
"I absolutely love this book! I although I was attacked from demonic forces reading this book, I prayed through it. This book will teach you how to fight spiritually, know if someone has a demon, what the occult does and how they attack the vulnerable, and most importantly expose Satan and his lies.  If you're not ready to enter the battlefield and commit your entire life to Jesus then don't get this book."
"A very powerful book by Rebecca Brown, and of course, my 3rd or 2nd reading, and this makes 4 or 5 now.  I lost the first book, but had to buy another one, so I could pass it on to others to read!!!"
"Great book!  The writer, I like.  I read this book years ago.  Have a nurse friend I purchased this book for as tend to happen.... She read 2 pages and put the book down...  She is quick to read some smut tho..... Welp, I believe she will read fully one day."
I was stuck on this book. Rebecca brown is very descriptive. Also a lot of these things she tell occur quite often but no one notices. Just saying its a deep book
"I like the fact that Man is a Spirit andSoul( mind, will, emotions) lives in a body(physical realm) at death he moves into the eternal realm!!"
"Amazing book that opens your eyes about how devil is destroying this world, and trying to take as many souls as he possibly can with him by lying to people. A must read!"
This was an incredible book about the worship of Satan and demonic control.  The author clearly wants people to become equipped in battling demonic forces.
"At first I was scared to read this book bc of comments but I bind the spirit of fear and read it. While reading it I felt fine, a lot of stuff in the book I already knew.  It definitely opened up my eyes more to the spiritual realm and how to fight back. I liked how there was a lot of scripture references in the book."
"WARNING: This will be one of the hardest books you have ever tried to read on Warfare.Plead the blood, put on the full armor and remember He came to Set the Captives Free🙌#defundthedemonic"
This is my second purchase of this book and I got it for someone else who needed. The book is to valuable to lend out. The information in this book could save many lives.
A must  read!
This is a great guide into managing your spiritual life.You must read your Bible along with this book and use it to make sure you’re being guided in the right direction for your life.
Great expose on the medical field and spiritual warfare
Every Righteous Prayer Warrior and Righteous Intercessor should read and study this book guided by the Holy Spirit of God.
"Astounding look into the life of occult around us all. A first class look at the devil and the way the minions operate. A must read. Hold on to your hat, grab a snack and indulge."
Very very very interesting.  Definitely a digestible book.
This book is eye opening and should be passed along to everyone you know.
Very helpful information that the adversary does not want us to know. The victory belongs to the Lord! Thank You Jesus!
"This is a must to all to read and urgently, even though the first print was in 1992 the story written in it still up to date. please acquire your copy and buy an extra to give to a friend or family member.God bless you"
"Shocking, eye opening and insightful.  Know the enemy, and know your authority through Jesus."
This book is interesting for sure. It opens your eyes to things most of us don't think about.
Great book. One of the best books I have ever read
I truly enjoyed reading this book! I thank God for both Elaine and Rebecca's life and testimony. I learned so much while reading this book. I'm almost afraid to own an animal now. Definitely an eye opener!!!!!!
"Very spiritually awakening, I learned so much from this book and my spiritual knowledge has increased. There are some points in the book in which I don't agree with the author. I personally agreed with about 90% of what the book said, but this is more of a personal opinion more than anything. I would recommend this book definitely."
One of the best books I have ever read.
"To anyone who don't believe there is evil, read this book. I was amazed at the things that were detailed in the book. If there is good, there is evil. If you need confirmation, get this book. Eye opener."
Good reading truth and I clearly understood what I read.
Amazing story. Great information. Must read and then pass along to someone who is struggling or just curious about the spirit world and spiritual warfare.
"This is one of the most informative books out side of the bible that I have EVER read!!!  The first couple of chapters had me literally scared to the point that I put it down and never planned to ever pick it up to read it ever again.  Really!!!!  Just the thought of this really being someone's experience had me petrified, but a few years later I felt compelled to read this book. Of course I had to pray first before I even opened the book and then again every time I picked it up to continue reading where I left off.  It opened my mind to an entire different world that most would surely label as fiction, however I am not convinced that it is something that should be ignored!  I believe that it is in fact real and that we need to surely believe in other's experiences even if it seems stranger than fiction.  I would suggest that you read this book with an open mind and judge for yourself.  And even though I would surely like to dismiss this as fiction, I truly can't, not with the what if thought lingering in the back of my mind.  Happy Reading!  & God Bless You!"
Please get this book. It is wonderful and a must read book. Everything in the book helps you understand how the other world (as in spiritual world) works.
"This book is very popular amongst the Christian community and for every good reasons, it is powerful and meaningful and very well written. Also arrives on time and in good condition and is a great price on Amazon."
Can’t put this book down! A lot of truth
"It is a very thought provoking book. It heightened my awareness of the spiritual world around us. It made me take Ephesians 6 more seriously.  It helped me see the power of our prayers and standing in the gap.  I was very moved by the story.  I can't say I ""love"" it because it left me with a lot more questions than answers.  I wish there was a way I could contact the author."
This book is powerful for every believer to read.
The best book I’ve ever read
"This book is one if not the most edifying book I’ve read besides the WORD. Whether you choose to get this book or not, read and obey the WORD OF GOD, nothing complicated."
This was bought as gift.
Love the author. The book helps one gain insight into the supernatural world.
"I loved the book! It teaches you how to learn to fight the kingdom of darkness. We are in a war, we better know the enemies tactics"
He came to set the Captives Free indeed..it teaches you so much.. especially when you’re coming from the dark world 🌎..
"This book was first introduced to me right after I received Jesus as my Lord and savior. What a read for a new Christian..but absolutely necessary. My Grandmother used to tell me "" If you want to make those original cookies, you need to know the counterfeit when you see them, and taste them"" This book does just that on a spiritual level!"
It is a must read in spiritual warfare.
This book may seem a bit far fetched to the average person but very little of the book was dull.
If you are tired of feeling defeated this book will open your eyes to alot of things that goes on in the spiritual and even in the natural.
"Highly recommend, pray before reading and ask the Holy Spirit to open your mind and don’t let the enemy put negative thoughts."
I think this is the first book that ever mentioned the Illuminati
Quality
Amazing book and testimonies!!! This really opened my eyes to the level of spiritual warfare we are dealing with. Incredible revelations. MUST READ
Awesome book. I’ve learned so much from this book— it’s definitely an eye opener! Definitely recommend to all the Christians. There’s a lot I didn’t know before and it has taught me to see things as I should.
Enjoyed this book & I learned a lot
"A very thorough and informative read on spiritual warfare. I believe that Christians need to be aware and to have an understanding of this very topic. We are in a spiritual battle and to be able to fight, we need to understand the enemy. As the bible says, my people perish because of a lack of knowledge. I would highly recommend this book, to Christians called to do spiritual warfare and also for those wanting to do deliverance ministries."
"This book will change your life!! God Bless you Rebecca! You have truly opened my eyes. Not only opened them, you have given me a better understanding of the Bible. Now when I read The Word, I am able to fully understand what our Father is referring too! We are in a spiritual warfare. Thank you again. Continue writing more :) Everyone in this world should read your book! This world would be a better place, if they did!"
I liked this so much I sent it to my grand daughter. I kept asking the Lord which book was the one that instilled a deeper walk with you and my initial belief in the spiritual things I was experiencing. Thank you!
Oh my goodness very powerful
great book recommend every one to read!
"I am soooo happy that I bought this book , I think every true Christian should have it.  I finished reading it and now I am reading it again. It is clear,  I like the fact that all the Bible references are explained. I was standing up against  the satanist in my church .  I got beaten in a plot right in the church until i passed out and I had to be in the hospital for 5 days. The police came but I refused to continue with the court lawsuit, because I realized it is a too big fight for me.  I  left it in the Hands of the Lord. I was searching for answers that s when my Lord sent me to this site and i ended up reading reviews about  this book that I never knew about . I can't put it down down almost all my questions are answered, the only thing is that I was hoping that Dr. Brown would put an email or a way for us to contact her if we have questions, but there is none.  Great book do not hesitate to buy it.  Love you allDoris"
May give you a different opinion about the afterlife.  Think this over now!!
"It beckons spiritual excellence by illuminating the severity of spiritual warfare, and most importantly, it enforces your identity in Christ by the victory and freedom Jesus secured for us in death, burial, and resurrection. The darkness can be crippling, but when the reader realizes the power is on OUR side as Christians, it is truly liberating!"
👌🏾
"I've traveled the world and the U.S. is the best because Christianity is so much stronger here than anywhere else. A lot of the things that are written here have happened to us, and I'm so glad that Rebecca Brown, who I had the pleasure of meeting in Lubbock, has written such a strong book. The body of Christ should read it and learn that we are at war! So everyone get busy sharing the gospel."
Really good book.
This was a very good book. I walked away with a totally different perception  of the spirits of darkness.
"An exceptionally written resource of paramount importance! I read it in 2 weeks, than passed it along to a dear friend in need!"
"if you have a doubt about anything in it,  pray and test it with the Holy Bible scriptures,  Jesus love you"
Must read
"As a Christian, I admit I wasn't taught much of the reality of the spirit world. This book sheds light on the powers of darkness and how to be aware of its operation in our own lives. I no longer feel as if I have to take some things ""lying down."""
"My little cousin really enjoyed reading this book. How ever it gets to you. There is alot of stuff in this book that should not be read by anyone under 16. This book really makes you think and hallucinate A LOT! so be mindful of who your buying this book for. It a great book though, just be mindful. You dont wanna mess someone thought process up."
Must read for all christians looking to better understand spiritual warfare.
"Revealing, True and A Eye Opener!!! for those who really are serious about really winning Lost Soul and no that this is not fiction or a hoax.  If you in Deliverance Ministry I highly recommend this book because it insightful, informational and back of by God words to use against the enemy and to Dress yourself with the Armor of God daily"
Wow ! This books so good you can't put it down !!!!
Wow. Kind of freaky.
"Matthew -12:24 But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, ""It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons.""The Pharisees spent so much of their time discrediting JESUS CHRIST himself, how much more you and me or REBECCA BROWN for that matter.Ask yourself this question What harm can this book do to the believer? Let me share with you How a supernatural Encounter actually lead me to this author !!!Glory to God!!. My friend was dealing with spiritual attacks every night so he purchased this book to see if it will help him. When I visited my friend I saw this book, I asked him about the author and He pulled up a short sermon by the author on YouTube. She was talking about deliverance and she mentioned ""how there was one common mistake made by many pastors when delivering someone from demonic oppression"" she said in that YouTube clip that God gave her that revelation after much prayer. Little did I know that, her revelation was going to bring complete deliverance to my friend through me. During that same week I went to a prayer meeting with my friend and a few prayer warriors. During our prayers there was a demonic spirit that showed up like the movie Exorcist. Until that day I was completely unaware of how real the devil is. During the whole episode, it was brought into my remembrance the six minute clip by RECECCA BROWN and the REVELATION about deliverance that she mention.I began to stand upon that REVELATION and the name of JESUS and to my surprise...it worked just as she had thought it in that six minute clip. And from that day my faith has increased in the area of deliverance and my friend was SET FREE FROM DEMONIC TORMENT!!!Seeing how God was able to use REBECCA BROWN so wonderfully to influence my life and set my friend free, I finally decided to get her book. I read all the negative/positive reviews but God had already defined to me who REBECCA BROWN was, she is a vessel that God used to increase my faith by bringing fourth complete deliverance through a simple REVELATION. !!!Glory to God!!!"
This book is very interesting and has a lot of insight on both Christianity and satanism witchcraft
Skipped the first part of the book. It seemed to be a little too much dark to get to the light. Still reading. I have found some interesting points to consider.
this book was so good. wow all i can say about this book
"I glorify and magnify God, the keeper of my soul. I praise the Lord for helping me to finish reading this book. The writer said you will  get sleepy,I pray others will buy this book."
Great book!
Very helpful book. Do not perish for a lack of knowledge. Must read.
This book is not for the every day reader. This book is definitely for those who are spiritually planted in God. This book teaches you how satan can destroy your life. Please be aware and very cautious when reading this book. It is not for entertainment purposes.
Very interesting
I love this book. It has great value to me because I am learning how strong we are in Christ to fight back against the enemy.
This was an Amazing book!
I love this book.  It has helped me identify different entities that I have dealt with.  Dr. Brown  backs up her beliefs with scriptures that can help you  close doors that we open without being aware of opening them.  This is a good read as well as a good point of reference.
I learned a lot from reading it! I just don’t know much about the Bible.
"I have read this book before in Portuguese, the book is good and I like the author Rebecca Brown, she is definitely a woman of God, so I like the books she writes."
"It is an interesting book, I have read some of the negative reviews.  This book is about what the author went though to help out one of her patient, and the challenges of delivering her through prayer."
Satan is a liar. Great book
This book was so helpful in my understanding of the battle that I have been in do to family sins.  Thank you
"I have read this book twice but and many accounts I have experienced but I noticed one thingI could never keep this book! After reading it and being so focused and concernted about the other dark kingdom. In having a discussion with my Bishop and other Christians, My Bishop, went into heavy detail about the awesome power of the kingdom of God that overpowers, and is more interesting and brilliant and powerful than the defeated devil and his kingdom.So I do appreciate, her testimony and she has exposed a lot of truth, but as we read in the bible, even when the disciples marvelled at how demons were cast out in Jesus name,  Christ instanteously refocused their minds i Luke 10:17-20:And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name. 18And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. 19Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you. 20Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heavenSo, just a pointer that is interesting read, but now I focus more on ministry, healing, prayer, deliverance and most important, being led by the Spirit and having my mind RENEWED in the Word of God."
This book does give specific information not found in other books.  Some survivors don't like these books but they don't work through renouncing prayers either.  I just know where the resources are.  Plus I feel these people have been through horrible abuse and they are very intelligent.
"You don't get such teaching, testimony, or even scriptural references as such was in this book from the church. I thank God he lead me to it's pages that I may learn how to truly resist Satan, and fight the good fight of faith in the army of the Lord. God bless you Rebecca !"
Love this book such insight to the World no one wants to talk about.
Excellent book that is a must read!
A very good book. Very deep. Unless you have been around spiritual warfare you may have difficulty with it. This is real life experiences.
"This book is a vital part of every Christian Warrior's library!  The story will keep you captivated, and the information included are worth their weight in gold.  All of her books should be read by the serious follower of the Lord Jesus Christ."
Every believer should read this book!
Lots of information to ponder on.
"YOU REALLY NEED TO BE IN FASTING IN THIS BOOK TO READ IT,"
Great book if you like to read about the satanist things with the intention of focusing in  helping people that come from this world and want to be Jesus Christ followers
It was such a powerful book. God is good all the time! Praise the king! God bless you all !
Very educational product
3rd copy.  Purchased 2 copies for family.
"I know understand so much more about things I've only wondered about. If you're caught up in something that's bigger than you, something that you just can't beat, or get rid of...this books helps with that."
A must read!
This book is a must read for those prayer warriors. It's important to know what you are warring against. Be strong In The Lord and the power of his might! Awesome and powerful read!
Glory to God!!!
Good book
I have learned A lot from this book A lot of notes to take. I recommend this to Christian's and none Christian's it WILL change your life. God Bless!!
"Eye-opening, great resource, and perspective changing read!"
This is one of my all time favorite books. The author is a herione of mine. Very inspirational!
Very informative
Great book
It is perfect. Thanks.
"This is an interesting book to read to know the testimony of what the author know about what is out there spiritually and how one can get alerted to the outside world. The book is perfect with not tears and wears, just very ok."
"Great book, I have it in paperback as well.  It is a hard read, but a good read.  A must read for spiritual leaders."
Perfect conditions. The book is amazing and mind blowing. It opened up my eyes to the world around us all.
This was my first book on spiritual warfare. I borrowed my mother in law's copy. I had to buy my own copy to use as a reference. This book is a must read for those who need a guidebook on what to do. She opens your eyes to the schemes and shrewdness of the devil. I enjoyed reading the situations they were in since you can be prepared for what happens when you are doing the work of the true and living God. Her book explains the works of the devil and what he does to hinders Christians and the church. We need to be equipped in order to fight. We need to take the time to understand the schemes the devil uses.
Excellent
"I highly recommend this book, for the christian who may be going through of have experienced some of the things that the author has experienced in standing for the Kingdom of God."
This book was really good and it really put things into perspective in my life. The book left me yearning to learn more and how I can be of service in the kingdom
I had this book before and refer it to someone else. This is a good read and its intense. This is definitely an eye opener. Now I am repurchasing this book because I wanted to replace it. This is a keeper.  Thanks for getting it to me in a timely manner. Your service was great.
Everyone should read this as a believer
I am not normally a book reader... but I could not put this book down... stayed up all night lol
"This book was a good read, it exposed the satanic world, and teaches you about spiritual warfare. I would recommend this book to anyone."
"This book is very controversial! Some people complain about how fake it is, but there is one thing that cannot be disputed- satan wants to recruit you and will do anything to get you, but God is stronger and more powerful! And with him you can overcome any situation!"
"I've read this book many times and I always get more out of it every time, don't listen to the critics this is a powerful book and will help you in your walk with the Lord."
This book has a lot of a different opinions about it. But I encourage anybody who believes in the Supernatural realm against the spirit world in the human world to read this
This book may be one of the better books I have read by author Rebecca Brown.  Her thoughts and ideas were very clear and well written.
Everything oh my goodness....  every believer needs to read this book amen
love it
This book has blessed me in ways unimaginable. Very informative. Please purchase if you want to understand spiritual warfare. Awesomeness!
I have read this book twice and will read it again and again because of its engaging warfare battles. It is a must read for those who battle in arenas of the demonic realms.
Don't read it right before bed!!!!
Great literature. ..opened my eyes to the wickedness of the world of darkness .thanks Dr Brown
"My great Aunt requested that I read this book, it's the first book I've read since I graduated nursing school. I found this book to be very interesting and answered many of my questions and left me with many more. I am amazed and still in much shock with the knowledge I've gained. I have recommended this book to friends and colleagues including including doctors who work on my floor. THANK You for sharing your experience and knowledge."
I had this book in my library and lent it to someone. Never got it back so I purchased another one. This time online via e-book. Good resource to learn how to Set the Captives Free.
Great book
Arrived well
Perfect condition
Pleased with my order.  Product was as described and delivered in timely manner -- packaged well.
This book is both a great deal and a great opportunity to grow up spiritually. Thanks Amazon for the business.
Personal
Read some but not all.  liked that which I read.
Great!
This is an amazing eye opener that I recommend that everyone reads.
Very informative information
Amazing quality loved it!
Great read!!!!! Good stuff!!!! Great way to expose the enemy!!!
Awesome!
"This is n excellently written testament to the wickedness and evil that is shrouded in secrecy. Christians need to learn about the enemy, and related spiritual self-defense."
"This is a great book also, read this first before reading Prepare For War. This is about Spiritual Warfare as well. As everything I get through Amazon, I was very pleased with it."
Great read!
"you can learn a lot about yourself and other by reading this book, each chapter is outlined with instruction on fighting the good fight of faith. and knowing you as well as other will and is set free from what ever is holding you back."
This book is riveting. Not for the imature ones who claim to be believers of Christ Jesus. I love this tool that the author has put forth for us to use.
"Truly an eye opener, to Jesus be the glory forever! May God cover His people as we go through this life."
This book is life
This book really unleashes the spiritual world in a way that I've never known. I am so glad the Lord allowed me to find this book.
Superfast delivery and wonderful experience
Awesome book
the book was and very good condition
"This should be required reading for all the saints, if we only understood spiritual warfare up close and personal, we would live wiser and as if we serve a mighty God!  Well, this book does just that, it brings us up close and personal with spiritual warfare, exposing the works of darkness, and giving us understanding of how demonic activity works in the supernatural.

It’s a gift for a family.
"The first book I read by Dr Brown was Unbroken Curses. At first I was sceptical. But after reading all her her books I must say that her experience and insights have given me an new dimension into a Christian's life.  We are engaged in a warfare. And the greatest asset the enemy has is our ignorance. Hosea says that ""My people are lost for ignorance"". Rebbeca Brown's books help us to understand more deeply what the scriptures say. Indeed, nothing she claims is unssubtantiated by scripture.  I live in Malaysia where the spiritual warfare is real.I find the book an important weapon in fighting ignorance."
Still freading
Very interesting.
This book was in new condition. It exceedid my expectations. And arrive ahead of schedule. Thanks!
A very fulfilling book on how God always win with a faithful individual. Everyone should take time to read this book.
"This book was eye opening. Honestly, I read it years ago, but this time I understood it. I enjoyed learning the victory that I have in the name of Jesus and by the blood of Jesus despite the efforts of the enemy.It also clearly outlined some of the enemy's tactics and why we are ignorant to some of them. It debunked many ideas that I have had and believed all my life.The honesty of the authors, even in relation to their failures was very instructive for me.He came to set the captured free!"
An eye-opener into the world of demon-possession and demonic control.  Full of practical advice on how to handle someone who has experienced demon possession.
WOW!!!! is ALL i CAN SAY. read AND ABSOLUTELY STAY PRAYED UP!!!
"Pretty intense. Although as a Christian they're are some things I don't necessarily agree with. She seems a little  too ""legalistic""for me in the areas of practicing karate or yoga. It's a pretty good book otherwise. Definitely things that can and probably do happen in this crazy world. I'd STILL recommend this book to anyone believer our non believer. I'd give it five stars if she would have left out the but about yoga and martial arts... to me her comments about them are pretty asinine, as both yoga AND karate are ways to keep your body limber, lean and healthy."
"This book is a must read for every person on this planet.Ignorant victims are being attacked everyday by the forces of darkness,and they don't have a clue how to fight back without the knowledge in this book."
Great book for those who want to understand a little more about spiritual warfare
"Love it love it and love it, read over 20 years ago and bought again. It is worth the read and an eye opener for all those called by His purpose of warfare and intercession."
Good insights especially into the Indiana Great White Brotherhood the strongest satanic state of them all.
Love all her book.  Will buy some more
Just read it.
great book
"Interesting book I believe is being written as non fiction about a woman called Elanie who claimed to be possessed at birth by deamons and was a witch of black majic and one of the seven brides of Satan.She said she worked in a hospital and prayed over sick people that they would die. Also that they committed human sacrifice in the United States 8 times a year every year and Judges,Police,and Politicians were involved and they ate their vitims of whom were the homeless and children for greater demonic powers."
"This book is amazing. Excellent condition, and mind blowing insight on the truth. Truly I've been blessed!"
"This is an account of bringing a Satanist high priestess (one of the 6 brides of Satan in the U.S) from out of Satan's control into the loving Kingdom of God. It is a manual used by police on dealing with the murdering groups of Satanists, but is a much stronger manual of how those who truly belong to Jesus can take authority over Satan by using the power of Jesus' name to release, protect, and rescue those deceived and held in bondage by Satan.If you realize that Satan doesn't really love you, but wants to destroy you and that Jesus' blood will redeem you and he will protect you.......Read This Book! It will give you the tools to overcome in the power of Jesus' name.As a Christian this book will spur you to action to take back what Jesus has paid for on the cross and realize we serve a powerful God."
"For those seeking enlightenment of what's really going on behind the scenes, I recommend this book.  I will keep this book and often go back to read highlighted parts again and use as a reference."
Amazing....I should have gotten it sooner.
very interesting book.
Great Book!
Learned so much from this book. I am so very blessed by it. Read it! Read it! Read it! :)
"I enjoyed reading this book. I was afraid to read the book, so I prayed. I started reading the book and while I read it, I reflected back on my life and knew that even though I walked a christian path, I still lived a double-minded life. The more I read the book, the more I repented my sins to God, and I'm thankful that he has forgiven me. Also, I made a vow to live for God, to live a ""holy and godly life"" as he would want us to do. Furthermore, I chose to pick up my sword and fight back evil, not only for myself but for others as well.I urge those who love the Lord and have accepted Him, to pick up their swords and put on their armor and fight back. It is written in Hosea 4:6 ""My people perish because of lack of knowledge."" I would encourage you to read 1John 2:16-17. Be Blessed and live for God."
its a scary read
This is a must have book for any Christian.It is very informational.Full of wisdom.
Really good purchasing for church library
"The Bible quotes that we are not unaware of the enemy's tactics, but after reading this, I'm afraid we are!"
great
"I have read this book many times in my life. It got me everytime. Every teen, yound adult, and adult should read this. It is still a book Ill never forget!"
Very enlightening.
This book has changed my prayer life. It's such powerful book you can't read it quickly. You absorb each chapter.
An eye opener.  Truly a page turner.  Very informative and chilling.  Rebecca Brown has written a fabulous book for people interested in the spiritual realm.
"I HAVE READ THIS BOOK MANY TIMES, NOT ALWAYS THE WHOLE BOOK.  I ADMIT THE FIRST TIME IT WAS HARD TO READ.  I FOUND WHEN I PRAYED FIRST IT WAS EASIER TO RECEIVE WHAT WAS WRITTEN AND APPLY IT TO MY LIFE.  AS I HAVE MATURED IN MY FAITH MY UNDERSTANDING HAS IMPROVED AND BEEN ENLIGHTENED.  WE ARE DAILY IN A BATTLE WITH OUR ENEMIES AND THE GOOD NEWS WE ALWAY ARE VICTORIOUS IF WE OBEY GODS INSTRUCTION AND HE DESTROYS HIM WHEN WE ARE IN HIS WILL."
Wow! Every Christian should read this book! Very eye-opening!
Jeus Christ is LORD!!! HE ALWAYS WINS .. GLORY HALLELUJAH!!!
"Be strong in scripture before you read this.  I would not recommend this for children, young adults in the Lord.You need to be educated in scripture to make your own judgments.I probably would not recommend this book-it is really ""deep."""
Thank God for this book... now I know I am not crazy!!
Powerful book!!!
It is a very Interesting and eye opening book. Enjoyable
Execellent book
Perfect book.
Must read. This book open my eyes and it has really aid in my continous journey to find Jesus.
A Lil wet smudge but great shape
Book is interesting
interesting read on insight what goes on in this world that people don't have a clue what goes on.
kind of dark
"I love this book. i have read it before and needs to get it in the hands of more people, if they are to understand spiritual warfare, and the realm of the spirit."
"This book divulges the truth in the warfare that most Christians are ignorant of and unaware. The word of God is very transparent and when we make excuses to continue to not abide in the Lord's word, the end result is chaos. Praise God for the truth and for His word. Anyone who tries to attack and discredit the author are obviously under the influence of the demonic realm because the devil is a liar and does not want the average Christian to know the truth on how he operates here. If you are a believer in the bible from front to back and you have a relationship with Jesus Christ you will know that the truth is in the author and you will know the truth- PERIOD. For those that are influenced by others negative comments, they need to seek the truth through His word and seek the Lord. Having experienced the occult, and having experienced the supernatural realm, reading this book and other spiritual warfare books continue to minister to me so that I can continue to fight the good fight.Keep pressing on- Fight the Good fight.[...]"
I love the teaching & have shared this with others
Satisfied with product & quick delivery
Not for the weak and feint hearted but very real and true to expose the powers of darkness.  Awesome read and will definitely apply the concepts.
Must read !
Loved it. Wonderful Information...
It was full of more information than I thought. I suggest every Christian to get and read it. Get yours today!
"I enjoyed reading this book so far...still have to finish it though.  This book talks directly about Satan and demons and the doorways in which they come into our spirit. But the book is about so much more too...it is interesting what happened to her.  At first I was skeptical about her story, but I know that the Devil comes to kill, steal, and destroy.  Brown uses the word of God to reinterate her points with clarity. Lastly, I would note that the person reading the book should be grounded in the word of God themselves"
"Awesome! very informative, I would recomend to anyone who wants to learn more about the spiritual realm"
I would do business with this merchant again.
incredible book a must have in your library
The matter material you discover while reading this book is great for spiritual warfareI do recommend this book to all of my friends
"This is such a great book. So much wisdom and knowledge. Every Christian needs to read this book, it really opens your eyes to the spiritual world."
Good
"every person who states , what is wrong with the world & people. They would understand better by reading this book,  & be more apt to pick up a Bible , repent & get closer to God, & ask for direction & protection."
Eye opening book not for the weak
Added this book to my Best Five Books Ever
Thank You!
"Wow! I never imagined such things, people, entities, etc. exist...definitely a book everyone should read."
Wow! The book was a real eye opener.  A lot to think about. Never read anything like this ever. !
This book is an eye opener!
Everyone should read.  I couldn't put it down.
product was in great shape.
Great book
Jennifer
"I'm so thankful that God led me to read this book.  It has forever changed me and the knowledge I gained from reading this book is invaluable.  Thank you Jesus for your truth, power and anointing!"
"I love it, yes it met my expectation"
Well worth the time. I couldn't put this one down.
Ordered Feb. 17. Received Feb. 21
The things that I have read in this book aren't anything that I have learned in Church. I pray the God gives me guidance to understand it.
This entire series is POWERFUL!  Must know tools for life.
Beyond my expectation
This book is very informative. It goes into detail of the satanic forces that we have to battle. I highly recommend this book
I read this book and shared it with everyone around me. I thank God I had the opportunity to read this book and finishing it.If you are a Christian who is seeking for spiritual growth also purchase the books Rebecca recommends (*the spiritual man) also check out her ministry (harvest warriors) aswell as the YouTube preaching that she gives on being a humble servant of GodBlessed be the name of the Lord . God bless everyone  in Jesus name ^_^
This book is excellent goes in depth and the Holy Spirit brings you much revelation as you read. Truly a God given
This book is a must read for all believers!!!
I love reading this book.
Exactly what was expected. Amazing book on the power of God.  Story about someone who was a high priestess in the satanic church becoming saved.
"Amazing book. Lots of info that can help prepare you against satans attacks and give you a better understanding of the stuff that really goes on behind closed doors. Before AND during you're reading, stay steady in prayer because its a dark book. But as long as you keep your armor on. highly recommend this book."
"I wouldn't recommend this for everyone... although it should he read by all, not everyone could handle it. This book is a lot to take in but I believe in every bit of it!! I love all the scriptural references!!  Excellent book!"
Thanks God for giving me this opportunity. .we all should know the real spiritual field and battle. This book give me hope and more love to my God..King of Kings Jesús Christ
"Opens your mind to the spirit world of things. e.g. When Jesus Christ died we never saw the spirit side of what took place as in when he went to hell etc, but in this book we see the spirit side of how witches work."
"Written for those who have experience with the occult, this book is helpful for all Christians. For those never involved with the occult it gives an idea of the darkness and depravity of sin; while also providing Spirit filled testimony of just how deep, how wide, how high the love of Christ is able to abound in an individual life fully surrendered to Him."
"With a Doctorate in Biblical Studies, I know of no place in the Scriptures where we are told that there are no longer demons among us or that the devil doesn't influence things in this world. Dr Brown's account of her first hand experience battling against demonic forces is riveting. Her book gives us a first hand look at the evil powers among us and offers somewhat of an explanation as to why some people can commit the heinous acts that they do - seemingly devoid of any feelings of remorse. I highly recommend this book to any that want to expand their knowledge of the spiritual battle that is taking place here on earth."
Awesome book
Wow! This is a remarkable read for an Christian wanting to understand what  spiritual warfare is and how to be successful in Christ. Thank you Rebecca for sharing your experience so that others can learn. May God bless you and your family!
Great job.  Came timely and looked just as tho it were new.  Special surprise to see it was signed by the author.
"I read this book many years ago. This is the first time I have found it anywhere for sale. It takes a certain kind of courage to finish reading this book, but it is well worth it."
This type of things do happen and more than people chose to believe. I think it is a great book because it gives us a glimpse of the other side. We can not be ignorant because were born into war. Yes the occult has power but the real and true power only come from Jesus Christ. They are possessed by demons BUT we are possessed by the Holy Spirit  ( Acts 1:8) and they may have power BUT we have authority over all power of the enemy ( Luke 10:19).
the challenges in demonic beings and the love and power of God is real.  I enjoyed the book but it was also scary for me.  It can be intimidating.
"A must read book for  every mature  believer in Christ , I am grateful that my Pastor is walking us through it. I would recommend reader to go through this book with a person who have good understanding of deliverance or group."
Great experience
"Very good, but not for those with a lame heart.The scriptures cited were very very helping.If it's a part of personal battle, this is a very grandious battle."
"quick shipping, received book today..5 stars"
"I was tremendously blessed by Dr. Brown's innocent boldness and by her transparency. She was willing to risk looking 'crazy' and weird in order to help her readers achieve the victory over the demonic realm, by exposing how the dominion of darkness operates.  I praise God for trusting Dr. Brown with this assignment.  My prayer life will never be the same!"
One of the best book i have read.
Great book and insight into the occult world and Jesus remedy against it. It's a must read.
awesome
An excellent and eye-opening book to spiritual warfare!!A Must Read!!
"To all my true Christian trying to follow Christ, do not purchase this book. This book was recommended to me by a friend and my spiritual eyes were not open at the time. Research this author before you purchase the book. She is a complete fraud and has been for many years but her books keeps on selling. I wish I would have looked her up instead of just going off reviews. Please research the author before you buy."
Very good book
I am thoroughly enjoying this book
I was a bit a suspicious of some of the writer's claims but after speaking with people that's experience some of the same illustrations im now convinced that Rebecca Brown is not a fraud as sum ppl accused her to be. Overall its a good book.
This is an intense piece of literature. I would recommend this book only for the mature and if you are serious about deliverance.
Amazing! Very informative. I learned so much from this book. Every Christian thinking if going into deliverance should read this book.
THIS WAS A WONDERFUL READ . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR THOSE WHO IS IN A SPIRITUAL WAR.
This book changed my life and all the things I would commonly mistake and pass off as nothing. Highly recommended.
"This book was very enlightening as far as Satanist's activities and how they affect the average person who is totally unaware of demonic activities among us.  The authors are not writers so the book does seem to attempt to cover too many bases, the layout is poorly structured, and the run-on sentences and grammar errors abound.  However, with a subject such as this what counts is the CONTENT --- not presentation.  Having said that, I'd recommend this to anyone who is SERIOUS about learning about demonic activities and how to combat Satan and Satanists in spiritual warfare."
A MUST READ!!!
One of the most powerful books I have read in a while. Open your eyes to the unseen enemy. Build awareness and is a life changer. Brings on a revelation to things that we take for granted.
A book that dives deep into the spiritual war that goes on for our souls.
"This was an amazing testimony of someone that had TRUE battles to be fought. I believe we need to read with a kind heart, boldness and understanding that this subject is REAL and you need to take it seriously."
I find this book very insightful.  It takes the time to explain to you what the true state of affairs is in our current time and helps to equip you for the real war that we are in !
"Many people will struggle with this book because it's contents might seem to be beyond belief. For me, it was exactly what I needed to read right now and confirmed my own experiences in spiritual warfare as well as leading satanists to Jesus.There is some doctrine that I am not 100% convinced about (which may well be my own stuff God is working on) but have no doubt that the heart of the author is in the right place.This is not a book for kids or teenagers in my opinion because of how graphic some of the contents are.Very revealing into the world of satanism."
Eye opening
I have never been exposed to any of what she has and I pray to God I never ever willBecause of this I find it hard to believe that such evil exists.... But it obviously does..
MUST READ FOR ANY BIBLE BELIEVER THAT ENGAGES IN SPIRITUAL WARFARE
Good book
Fantastic read for anyone interested in spiritual warfare! Lord's blessings :)
"I had this book before but could not get access to it.  So, I purchased another one for my on personal use.."
A must read !
Absolutely amazing and eye opening for a believer in the Lord who knew much of the information presented on this book already. I was still able to learn so much more and get details to lot of things I didn't understand. All the stories and testimonies used in the book are fantastic on helping to understand how the enemy works and even in most cases why the enemy is able to continue working against the Lord's people. This is one that needs to be read over and over again. Great book.
I feel like this book had things that I needed to know about life and the unseen things around me. I believe that I learned things that no one was ever going totell me even if they knew. I thank Dr Brown and all the people who participatedin this story for their input.
"Excellent, highly recommend !!!"
"I learned a lot. Although I disagree with the statement that 'all Rock music' is of the devil. That's like saying every policeman is corrupt. It's the lyrical content that either speaks life openly or poetically, or it's opposite. one needs discernment when it comes to the arts, not just a generalization. This book is a must for Christians however, there really is a war on."
Most of Rebecca's books are very good and packed with info.  This book is no different.  I love her style and the way she writes.  it is easy to understand.
Book is in excellent Condition
This is a powerful book. Must read it's full of amazing info.
Great book
Very truthful book realistic if YOU like the paranormal activities then this book is for you becareful reading .. .
Everybody should read this book. We are in a world of so called christians but don't realize we might be involved in a lot of demonics after you read this book. The Bible says there is only one God and i am afraid after reading this book our community might be involved in thinks they are not aware off.
We have the Victory through Jesus! This book was very helpful to me be I have experienced some of these things and thought I was crazy. Now I know a little more by of these ladies willing to tell their story. Be ready to battle just to read the book.
This book was amazing.  I recommend this book to people who want to serve the Lord and help other's to come to know Christ.  Eye opener.  God is real and so is the devil.
Amazing writer but I advise you to do some research about Rebecca Brown's life before buying her book.
"I haven’t finished the book yet. Make sure your pray and do spiritual warfare before reading this book. It can cause some fear if you’re not used to the reading about satanic rituals and the occult. There are DEEP revelations inside this book. It gives a closer look into what happens in the spiritual world and gives new meaning to “...for we wrestle not against flesh and blood... but principalities, powers, rulers of darkness, and spiritual wickedness in high places...”. We do not fear because God’s power is greater than all. But we are not to be “ignorant of his (Satan) devices...”"
Great book second time reading it🙌🏾
This book is Gods love letter to every servent of satan on this earth and it is Gods wake up letter to all his servents on this earth. A modern classic that still after sooo many years totally rocks its reader to the core. Its unlike any other book ive found. It is a league of its own.
"This is a book about spiritual warfare.  I believe it is entirely true, from my own personal experiences. I recommend this book to seasoned (salted) Christians, not for new christians.  I would also recommend to any involved in the occult that want out. It is down to earth and straight forward."
Very good book I highly recommend  it .
"This book has opened me up to a lot of things I was/am experiencing spiritually. The good Lord, Jesus Christ, is with us always! He is faithful to his children. I shall wait and call upon the Lord all the days of my life. I highly recommend this book to any Christian wanting/preparing/is serving our Lord Jesus Christ.To God be the Glory!"
I liked it... Good condition
I thought this a very interesting book.  It's normally not the kind of book I am interested in.  But it makes me wonder more about what is really out there.
Everyone involved in Spiritual Warfare MUST read this book. It is the Believer's manual for Spiritual Warfare. The devil is exposed...
Wow!! I thank God for you!!! Awesome book!! I enjoyed read and at times could not put it down! I found myself having conversations about the book. It opened up my understandng even the more!!! Theirs nothing to dislike about the book! I have already recommended to some of my friends.
"This book has truth in it, however; I don't think everything that the Author wrote about actually happened. I bought this book to get an insight on the occult and how it functions, and various other things. The author has done a lot of research on various things in this book, but I don't think her encounter is 100 percent true. Its a good read though."
More of the gritty details of spiritual warfare and deliverance which I hadn't heard much of prior to reading this great book.  The truth is worse than any horror film.
Exceptional book my eyes were open to a lot and now I know what to pray for and my home will be a better place. This is a must read for Christians and non Christian.
"Don't let the cover scare you, or if it does just tell that fear to shut up and get this book! This book gives you insight on the world that you might not see and some see.  It will explain why things happen! Must read"
"Powerful book I'm very pleased with it, no fear against evilness, all by the bible teaching guidance. Thanks"
Man what a blessing. I have too been hit hard is some spiritual areas growing up to now and know this is the ministry the Lord has called me into. Everything in this book confirmed everything plus more! Praise God for all of you and His many blessings with allowing this book to be out!
I read this story a few years back and ordered it to read again and share with my daughters.  It arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  Thank you
This book is a wonderful handbook for every spirit-filled Christian.  It opened my eyes about the dark side (The kingdom of Satan) and gives tools to use against the evil forces that are always pestering us.  It enabled me to help others come out of bondage and oppression and be FREE in Jesus!  Parts of it are scarey but the power in us (Jesus) is far greater that the power of the evil one and his ugly friends!  Jesus reigns!
I did not feel that the title really matched up with the book.  Is this being presented  as fact or fiction....it was never made clear. I would think poorly written fiction.......ouch
"I thought I knew a lot growing up as a Christian, but WOW, did now know the battles going on in the Spirit world that we don't see.  Makes me very, Very thankfull that I have Jesus Christ on my side ..... every minute !"
"This book helps open ones eyes to just his severe our spiritual battle is. Our enemy, Satan, is on his job to steal, kill, and destroy all mankind, and we must be aware and stay on guard to properly fight against him. Thank God for the precious blood of Jesus! In the DND, we win! Amen."
My husband loves this book and has read it more than once!
"This book is for every believer who truly believes and understands that there is a constant spiritual battle taking place all around them. It offers insight, weapons for warfare; all backed up by scripture. It is powerful, yet a must have for those who want to learn how to not only effectively fight, but triumph over these battles."
"It has been a month and a half and Amazon is asking me to write a review, problem is that this book has still not arrived...... There is no option to contact the seller or anything else so hopefully they will get this review and read it. I wish there was a better way to contact the seller, but I still have not yet gotten my book....."
I thought being a Christian meant being a victim. Now I know it means being an overcomer. This book made me aware of so many things. And it helped me to become more aware of what is going on around me.
This is a required reading for any Christian who does not believe in the devil and how the devil works in normal human beings! A must read!
"I cant put this book down...I have had many questions about these things for years in my own life that have occured, and God has confirmed each one of them.....I recommend this book for anyone in this ministry, or going into it or just for answers and confirmation"
"Not what I remembered, wouldn't recommend."
I read this book 28 years ago. I loaned my copy and never got it back. So I bought another ....
"This is an excellent book, from having discernment of spirits I can easily see the truth in all of this. This book is a powerful tool to help wake up Christians to the powers of the devil and the deception and infiltration of Christian Churches. There is a LOT of good knowledge in this book."
"My first day reading the book, it cause me fall asleep.  Upon reading the reminder written by the author, I have to commit my reading time to God before reading the book.  So, this is the most challenging book I ever read in my life.  I could understand that the devils are unhappy because the book enriches my spiritual knowledge about spiritual warfare and only the name of Jesus of Nazareth and through Jesus Blood victory could be achieved over all kinds of evil spirit. Please have a copy of the book as your spiritual guided book in this spiritual world. Amen!"
This was intense and NOT for kids.  Definitely an adult read and adult subject matter in the context of Christianity.  You will have to pray about this book as you read it.  It's an eye opener.
"Wake up people!  This is not fiction, this book will immediately grab your attention and teach you things everyone should know!"
"I really wanted this book to be good.  I read Doreen Irvine's ""From witchcraft to Christ,"" which was wonderful.  I had hoped ""He came to set the captives free,"" would be equally wonderful.  WRONG. As a Christian I was looking for a credible and honest account.  This woman is either completely crazy, a crook, or perhaps both.If you're looking for a similar book, please search for Doreen Irvine,  ""From witchcraft to Christ.""  I highly recommend it but whatever you do, don't buy Rebecca Brown's book--it's nonsense."
I have read all of Rebecca's books and I highly recommend them. This book draws you into a deeper relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ and makes you aware of Satan's tactics. Her books reveal to the reader how deeply God loves all people and that all can be forgiven no matter what you have done.Bethany K. ScanlonAuthor of Born of the Spirit and Redeeming Catholics
"It's a very good book I read a bit of it since I had one, I loaned it to some one and never got it back so I had to get me another one."
"Great book! Many people will not have the courage to read this, but those who can the truth will set them free."
"Frightening, sobering, much insight into the spirit realm."
This is an excellent in depth book that lets the reader know how Satan works.  I have personally spoken to the author and she is wonderful.
"In her fascinating memoir, Brown describes how ""Werewolves, zombies, vampires and other wer animals do exist. I have seen many of them...I have never found anything in writing that is accurate about them except in the ancient Satanic writings kept in the vaults of the main Satanic mansion in the hills of California...I suspect that during the Tribulation they will greatly increase in number and be openly used by Satan for discipline."" Later, she adds that ""The blood of Jesus is so powerful, and His work on the cross so complete, that even the werewolves can be saved if they want to be.""I read this book when I was fifteen and believed it. I spent my high school years worrying that actual(non-sparkly)vampires were out there, that I might be demon possessed and not even know it, that the world was full of witches who wanted to ritually murder me (or worse, make me do yoga). It kind of messed me up. But I'll give it three stars, because now I find it hilarious."
As I read this book it made me look at my own life and examine myself.  Satan is very real.  Please get a copy of this book and read it.
This book really touched my soul. It took me a while to get through it but she explains why. Praise be to GOD!
I read this book many years ago.  I wish I had paid closer attention.  I have recently purchased several copies and given them away as gifts to people struggling with Spiritual Warfare.
Book received in great shape
I am recomending other people for to buy it online. So they can enjoy it as much as i am.
This is a very in depth look at the satanic world and about many things the body of Christ have denied ever existing. I believe this a great book to begin to introduce anyone to the world of deliverance and its importance in today's church.
This shows that any one can be free of anything if their desire is strong enough and they have the help of a true and dedicated mentor.
"Don't read this book if you are a baby Christian.  This book has a great amount of detail when it comes to witchcraft, and other things of the occult.  It is excellent if you need prayer for warfare."
This book is so powerful and I have recommended it to everyone. If you want to gain more knowledge about the enemy this is the book!
Definitely worth the read. I learnt quite a lot am equipped to understand how the Devil operates. I thank God for Rebbeca and Elaine. The Lord bless you more and more.
"Written with much sensationalism and to the point that no, I do not even believe it -- though I wanted to. I actually dislike the book very much. It makes it seem as if the power of Jesus' Name is not as powerful as it really is."
"This book was a very good learning tool for me. I would recommend this book to growing Christians and curious satinists , the content opened my eyes more to the supernatural experiences I have dealt with in ministry and helps prepare me for the future. I also only take in information that reflect the bible and this book does that the whole way through."
Good book. Seem fiction.
An informative book by Rebecca Brown
"This book has a lot of information. I suggest reading this book and looking at the bible for more in formation because some of the parts are unclear by just reading the book alone. In general, I love this book gives me inspiration."
when you read this book you realize that the things we think are soooooooo important are really UNIMPORTANT. we should care for others as well as our self.
Very insight full. Wonderful book. This was my second read! You should def get this book. It teaches alot and it tells you what's really happening in this world.
Such a testimony of God's love and faithfulness!!! It really stirred me and taught me about my authority in Christ!!!
This book is a great book to read for anyone desiring a true walk with Christ or trying to get out of the occult. This will definitely be a help to you understanding the spirit realm. She is a very accurate and true author. Please read this if you dare to love the Lord!
"THis book will open up a new world to the truly called of God to go into deliverence. But, do not tread where you are not called."
Some far fetched things in here. Very interesting book but I'm still searching to see how truthful everything is. Read with caution but it's very intense
"The book opened my eyes to the reality of the world I live in.  I prayed that God would open my spiritual heart, mind, & soul as I read the book.  I wanted to get something out of the book... more than a note here and there.  I wanted to be changed for the better... to be aware of my spiritual surroundings.... God did just that.  Thanx Ms. Rebecca Brown, for having the courage to write & publish such a book in a politically correct & easily offended world.  Thanx for obeying God... thanx for touching my heart through this book.... I was chilled and fearful at first, but prayer & faith in God changed my fear into understanding, & hunger for God's wisdom & love.  You will be changed once you read this book... have your Bible nearby to cross reference the scriptures Ms. Brown has in her book so that you can know & read for yourself & not simply take Ms. Brown's word for it. Once you learn Ms. Brown is being honest, you'll want to know more, & seek out her other books."
"i watched or read or used the item.  You can look at my ""star"" review.  I have nothing else to say about the product.Am I thew only one who resents having to type x number of characters and I have to Headline my review. Why does Amazon force their customers to serve them???"
"Spot on...valuable information, and Scripturally sound.  I have read this over and over and glean many useful nuggets each time."
But disturbing to know what the enemy can do to secretly destroy churches. I wouldn't recommend for the faint of heart as it does contain some very disturbing descriptions and adult content.
I would definitely recommend this book to all my Christian friends. Very helpful in understanding how our enemy satan operates but glory to God and our Lord Jesus Christ the enemy is defeated.
This is a good book to have in your library.  It explains what to do when you are under attack by demons.
"Thank You for providing this product, at such a great price.  I will be looking forward to doing business with you again."
"I kept hearing about this book from friends of mine, so I broke down and purchased it! I'm soooo glad I did! This book will help your walk with God, and will help you identify the enemy's tactics with much more discernment. This book will give you solid understanding on the methods and effects of witchcraft and its operation, especially in America (as opposed to Africa or Australia, or anywhere else where witches try to hide).I used the knowledge in this book to cast out many demons who were wrecking the life of friends and people in my church. We must study and show our selves approved, and this testimony given in this book will help you tremendously in your quest to be a better minister. Even if you're not into being a minister of Jesus Christ (and you should be), this book manages to be fast moving and entertaining on top of all of the knowledge it provides."
Evan though I believe in the devil I think she used her imagination a bit.
"Rebecca Brown is remarkable!  She not only gives you insight of the spiritual world that is around us, but she teaches people how to pray and do warfare!  I'd highly reccommend this book."
Excellent book.  I enjoyed it.
I couldn't put the book down but it was pretty scary. Everyone should read this book and see what is going on in the world.
"If I could give this book a -10 star rating, I would. I bought it because there is supposed to be an urban legend based upon it, one that says satan gets so angry about the supposed 'information' in the book that strange things start happening in the home and life of the reader. The result is supposed to be that you don't finish reading the book. That's probably the only true thing I've heard about it - I couldn't finish it, but not for supernatural reasons.It's poorly written for one thing, and is loaded with cruddy punctuation and misspelled words. If the author is a former doctor, shouldn't she know how to spell a simple word like 'breathe' (a word she repeatedly left the last letter out of)? The grammar and writing style are ridiculous as well, giving the impression that the author feels she had to dumb it down so that everyone else would get it. The tone of the text is insulting.However, if the style and grammar rate a 9 out of ten on the reekometer, the storyline itself measures approximately 105. The author seems to have been cashing in on the SRA hoax of the early and mid eighties, but knows about this much <----> about either satanism or witchcraft.For instance, satanism doesn't actually deifySatan, according to Anton LaVey's book ""The Satanic Bible"", Satan is the figure chosen to focus upon because he represents the exact polar opposite of all things taught and believed by christians. Satanism is actually indulgence and worship of the self. Also, in that same book LaVey forbids the harm of children and animals during ritual. They may be present because their energy is strong and pure, but they must not be harmed, yet the author claims that ritual sacrifice of children goes on all the time.The author also seems to have no real grasp of the theology behind Pagan beliefs, either, or she would know that Satanism and Pagan religions are two completely different things. Satanism focuses on the self, while Pagan religions are both Goddess/God (though which depends on the Tradition, some honor both, while some worship a single God or Goddess) and nature based, with an emphasis on positive energy and personal spiritual expression.All that aside, the BS factor of this book is off the charts. Not only does the author want us to believe that there are Satanic cults manipulating christians in their own churches and that they run hospitals and skin and eat babies, she also wants the reader to believe that her friend Elaine has had sex with Satan and with demons, was punished for disobedience to Satan four times by being afflicted with cancer, and that when witches have important meetings werewolves show up to protect us.Yes. Werewolves.This book is insulting to the collective intelligence of all who read it, paranoid, ridiculous and poorly written.Do yourself a favor and don't bother."
"My sister had this book on her shelf for a while and, every time I passed by it, there was something that tugged at me.  I asked about it, and she said that she felt similarly, but she dared not read it.  At that time, I was beginning to learn about deliverance and exorcism because I had an experience that left me with great curiosity. At first glance, the cover seems to tell much, but in the pages to follow, a vast hidden world appears.  Although the author has been criticized by some as being some sort of a fluke, the information provided by this book and its subsequent tome, opened my eyes to what others dare not mention.  Are you ready for a hard reality check?  Are you willing to know the WHOLE truth?  Here it is."
"If you want to know the truth about witchcraft, this is a good starting place.  It can be rather disturbing when you realize that this stuff goes on all around us.  Good book."
This book is not for Christians. There are actual words used in here to call on demons by name. We must be wise to know that we speaking these words can call these entities to you. After reading the first few chapters of this book I deleted it from my Kindle content. If I'd owned a print copy I would have thrown it away.
"This is an awsome book. I dont remember reading a book more than twice, this deffinatly is one that stands out. It delivers, and I thank God for it."
"I highly recommend this book, ""He Came to Set the Captives Free"", by Rebecca Brown, MD.  She is not only knowledgeable in the field of ""Deliverance"", i.e. seeing people set free from life-destroying bondages, but, she has the writing skills to lead one down the path to freedom with an easiily understood writing style."
Eye opening
I loved it leaned a lot
Awesome book. Anointed by God. A must read  for every believer
"If there is any truth or quality in this book, I wasn't able to find it.  A friend recommended this to me.  Not sure why.  In my opinion, the author is not playing with a full deck.  I have nothing good to say about this book."
"In chapter 20 under the heading ""familiar objects"", Rebecca instructs the reader to destroy any Rosaries or objects that have been used in the practice of Catholicism. Is she suggesting that the Catholic Church is in league with the devil? Therefore, as a Catholic, I simply can't recommend this book."
Received this order in perfect condition but it was in the Spanish language instead of English. I don't read or understand Spanish.
"Very gripping, eye opening about the things that are going in in every social aspect of life here in the U.S. and all over the world. Satan is alive and very active, but his time is almost through!"
It was recommended to me but I didn't care for it.
Sounds like religious jumbo-jumbo to me.
"I was enjoying this novel until the unbiblical portions began to surface.  The belief in ware wolves and vampires and intimate details about Satan plus suggesting a Christian is able to be possessed is not what the Bible claims. Sure she gives Bible verses but when people give a revelation not found in the Bible then you've lost all credibility and the story goes south.1 Peter 1 : 20 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.One must go straight to the word for backing rather than personal revelatory experiences or something one claims is of God.Sad by this because I truly think some things did happen according to scripture but intimate details of Satan is beyond the word.Be sober be vigilant."
Look into Rebecca Brown's reliability before considering this purchase.
"I lend this book to my son, because he read while he was in jail, and asked for my copy. I now got mine back because my own notes are in their!"
"Great price, quick delivery, good read."
"If you are going to read this, then you must read from page 4 to page 82 non-stop."
I don't care if she is a doctor or not. this is so way out I find it hard to believe. It was sordid and horrifying and ugly. Threw it out and you should too  if you have the urge to buy this waste of paper.
"1st chapter good.  But then it becomes a read of how a woman became a Satanist ver batom, meaning you read the words declaring evil as lord.  I think it is a really wrong read for any Christian even BLarson.  Who cares.  Maybe a unbeliever could benefit but no need to go through exacts!  Just say I was not born again and I swallowed the power trip and ego boost.  If lead by Holy Spirit to share with individual, do only what He says to do.  No ad lib for glorification sake.  Please hear me, Satan does ride in on the wind and the words we speak.  I am constantly correcting own negative words and thoughts.  In this day and age, I even find my self thinking opposites to gospel.  I know it is divination working in the air from someone.  I stop it immediately and I plead the blood over my thoughts and I make sure I pronounce my words according to truth as to who is God/Jesus and who is not.  Blessings to all who read this.  God loves you enough to allow His only Son to hang for your/mine transgressions.  It's Aok if we truly repent. But do not return for any reason.  Life can be good even for a poor person that has total access to God's throne.  I'm richer than man could ever make me, but man is who will help bring God into my life on earth and others more to the point.  We all fall short but HE is able to deliver us till death do we part or NOT... I'm goen up myself...how about U...."
"However, we all know what the road to hell is paved with. Having studied demonology for close to half a century, some of the absolute truths in regard to those negativities have been overlooked by the author. Half truths mixed with scripture to back up the authors opinion clearly indicates to me that perhaps she is in need of an exorcism herself. She is frightening to me because she is completely wrong about so very much. Specifically about living souls astrally projecting and doing harm to the living flesh of their victims. Only demons can do that. Also nothing, absolutely nothing a demon states can be believed. Satan is the father of lies. This woman is being manipulated by the demons to their, not her, end. I'm sad she doesn't consider checking out what the Roman Catholics have spent centuries learning."
Just a story...no facts to back up the story...fiction
This person is deluded.  That part that said she was sick and dying and The Lord was not able to heal her because of the Satanists having they're hold on her and only the intercession of her pastor saved her.  God had no one above Him and the devil can not overpower Him.  Won't waste my time reading any further piece of trash written to influence weak minded oeopke
it was really confusing to understand. i didn't know what she was talking about half the time. i wished the message was more clear
"This book literally unleashes demons. Dr. Brown (who lost her license in the 80s) even states so in the Forward. I've read this book two times (12 years apart) and both times, I've had the same bad warfare experiences. It took me that long to figure out what happened. I am not the only person I know that this has happened to. I have to wonder if this book isn't a tool for evil disguised as a tool for good. Jesus says that his yoke is easy and His burden is light- all this book manifests are problems, evil manifestations and manipulated scriptures (such as not to fast and to respect demons). PLEASE DO NOT READ. Your life will become very difficult and scary without reason. Jesus wants us to be free, not going through warfare for no reason but to undo what curse a book has unleashed. If you own it, burn it."
Totally fabricated
This book was suggested to me and all I can say is WOW. It asnwered so many of the things I felt was true but others would think I'm crazy. I loaned it to someone and they lost it and I will be bnuying another copy. This is a must read.
I found this book to be out of this world much the writings of a  confused or delusional mind. After reading the book I looked into the author who has a strange life and perhaps problems with reality.  I cannot recommend this book to anyone.
Creepy ass book!!!
The book was an older edition and took forever to arrive
"This book has changed my life. Some of these things in this book may seem far fetch but they are true. Witchcraft and the satanic occult are running rampant in this world. Sister Brown says that she is not perfect and she had to count the cost for writing this book. It's a shame that we have so many passive christians that don't believe eveything in the bible. I myself have had witchcraft come against my family and I. Sister Brown gives her  testimonies and tells the truth about God's ministry taking patients and time to minister to souls. I am born again and it's 18 years since I have received the gift of the Holy Spirit. The last 16 year of my salvation I have been attacked in my body by witchcraft. The doctors could find nothing wrong with me. I would feel extremly fatigued, I could'nt think nor comprehend the simply things of school especially when it came to bible study. When I would have a situation in my life and God would come and help me I would get happy and the devil and demons would come and attack me. They even tried to kill me! As I was driving my eyes closed without me knowing it. If anyone reads this and say ah, she needed some sleep, this is not so. I was well awake when I got into the car for my 15 minute commute home. All of this witchcraft come about in my country of Jamaica. My mother was to be a sacrifice but, my grandfather changed his mind. Thus bringing a curse on the family. Finally, after I read this book and her book of unbroken curses God set me on my way for deliverance. This stronghold in my life was allowed by God, so that as now being delivered I can deliver those with strongholds in their lives. Thank you sister Brown."
"Much like Mike Warnke's book ""The Satan Seller"" the stories in this book has been discredited. This book was part of the embarrassing ""Satanic Panic"" that took the evangelical protestant world by storm in the 80's and 90's.  Most of the people instrumental in sparking the movement were ultimately proven to be passing off completely fabricated stories as actual accounts, lying, and deceiving people, and otherwise capitalizing on the public's fear in order to sell books (as well as records and concert tickets with the case of Warnke).Rebecca Brown (born Ruth Irene Bailey) is the author of ""He Came to Set the Captives Free"" and ""Prepare For War"", both notoriously fraudulent tales about somebody named Elaine (Edna Elaine Moses) she had supposedly rescued from Satanism. Both books were published by Chick Publications and used by Jack Chick as source material for some of his own tracts about the occult.Brown's work is filled with absurdities, such as claiming that Native American reservations are cursed with demons along with accounts of werewolves, human sacrifice, and sex orgies.If you are interested in knowing more about Brown's veracity and research exposing her falsehoods, do a search for an article (by a christian writer and researcher) called ""The Bizarre Case of Dr. Rebecca Brown"" by John Baskette. Also look for work by Christian authors Bob and Gretchen Passantino, who have done similar research on folks like Rebecca Brown, Mike Warnke, and  Lauren Stratford (Laurel Rose Willson)."
"I was given this book to read by a Christian spiritual mentor when we were called to preach, rescue those in the satanic cult, witches covens. The very first page you are WARNED to pray very hard before picking up this book each time and I must tell you, it's true. I could write a book on the effects of this book in my life and ministry but allow me to preface with this: This book will change your prayer life, will make you a prayer warrior in Spiritual Warfare. Will open your eyes to the evils of Halloween, zodiacs, eastern philosophy and make known the spirit realm that is absolutely real. We must educate ourselves about our enemy, little s- satan and operate in the Spirit, not the flesh in order to defeat the devil - BY THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST - always pray , go to battle in the name of Jesus Christ who defeated death and the devil. Soak yourself in the washing of the water of the world and praise our Father who is worthy, so worthy.. do this daily.. We are in the last days of the Church age. Our enemy is emboldened thus we must BOLDLY declare the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.. Read this book, know your enemy."
"I first tried to read this book about 5-6 yrs ago and about halfway through I just couldn't continue. I completely lost interest! My husband read it and said that was the devil trying to keep me from finishing it. I shrugged it off and forgot about it. Then last year I rededicated my life to Christ and not long ago decided to give it a second chance. This time I finished it and throughout the entire book I prayed for discernment about whether it was true or not. My overwhelming feeling was that it was inspired by God because in no way did the author ever give Satan power over her. She constantly reiterates that with the spoken name of Jesus there is deliverance from the devil's attempts to kill and destroy the body and mind. I believe too many Christians of today prefer to believe it isn't as serious as she makes it sound, when in reality I believe if we caught a glimpse into the actual spiritual realm we wouldn't be able to handle it. We are protected by God when we surrender our lives to Him, but I think it is important that we not live in fear but instead ask Him to use us to help deliver others from the devil's grasp. Whether Rebecca Brown is a kook or sent by God, I believe her books are inspired to help us battle the demon world. When I read about the state of Indiana declaring her mentally unstable and revoking her medical license it actually lent credibility to her belief that she would lose everything in the fight against evil. Look how many people discredited her because of the many exposés written about her? Seems to me like the devil won to a certain extent. But anyone with the Holy Spirit guiding their life shouldn't fear reading her books. He will guide you into all truth!"
"Believers in all that is good, wholesome and Divine, do not read this book or bring it into your houses.  This book will play tricks on your mind and disrupt your spirit. It happened to me years ago when I foolishly accepted the gift of this book from a ""Christian.'By tying this book to a Christian confession, unsuspecting people are getting their first taste of witchcraft and satanism.  This is not a Christian book, it is simply a ploy to plant occultic things into your mind. I had nightmares, insomnia, hallucinations and life-disrupting fear from reading this book. I didn't know how to stop it, despite prayer and Bible reading. My pastor asked if I still had the book in the house. I said yes and he said to throw it away. That is the only way I got free of the effects of this book. I believe the book itself to be a negative talisman. Do not have it around.  While it's been years since I've read this, but yesterday and watching a film on the type of supernatural episodes and beings this author presents in this book, and how they are used in occultic rituals and worship, I was reminded to warn people against it. Even if you have it in digital form, delete it."
"I read this many years ago. I loved it and have told many people about it.  Beware; it says in the begining and it's TRUE.  So many things tried to prevent me from finishing this book. It is probably one of the shorter books in my list but it took me months to finish. Don't let that fool you of it's truth and power.With the world the way it is today, what I read so many years ago makes 100% sense now. I mean I believed it back then but today.........God help us is all I can finish with."
"I read this book when I went to Bible College 20 years back. The stories in this book are completely nonsense. I pastored in pentecostal churches for a long time and I know a fake when I read one.It's great for fiction, but please do not take any word of this book as real.Come on, guys...there are no werewolves running around protecting witches. Come on. Really? Seriously."
"Just as the title says this book is based on Spiritual Warfare, Man vs Demons and our Lord and Savior Jesus being the deliverer. I've owned the book since in the late '80s that was the 11th printing ISBN:0-937958-25-5. Being a paperback book it did not stay long intact and eventually came apart with many pages unstuck. One day i.e a few years ago a cousin of mine asked me if I can lend the book to her and I did lend it to her. After about three months she returned the book, but to my surprise she had the book hard covered and properly done, for that I was very grateful and she told me she did it just because I was very kind to lend it to her. Thank you Sandora I appreciate it very much.Rebecca Brown M.D. the author of this book is in this particular hospital working and she grew up being a Christian knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and have to come up against the most spiritual vicious attack by Demonic powers from Satan and his fallen angels.Just like our very own society where we have all types of people of different classes; poor, rich, middle class, alcoholics, drug addicts, smokers, vagrants etc, its the same way in the spiritual world of Satan and his fallen angels you have Priestly demons, drunkard demons, smoking demons etc of different levels and rank. This book really exposes Satan and his Demons to the extent that the everyday person reading this book will say ""This cannot be so"" they won't believe it not unless you've gotten to the place where you have a personal experience yourself. Thats why I can relate to this book and believe what Rebecca wrote in such details and exposing Satan.The book is particularly based on a young girl who Rebecca gave an alias name Elaine and the experiences she had while attending to her in the hospital and also praying for her and Satan and his demons constant attack on Rebecca and Elaine. It also shows how God sends his host of angels encamped around there home and protecting them from the onslaught of the enemy. These are things that I personally know about and can relate with it. Just like in the days of Elijah when the Syrian army came upon Elijah and Gehazi was very scared and Elijah told the Lord to open the lad's eye so he can see in the spiritual realm and saw the host of heaven surround the enemy ready to destroy them (the Syrian army) at a moments notice.I'd recommend this book for all readers whether or not they want to believe thats there choice. Reading this book will have you so captivated that it will have you wanting to read out the entire book and want you to read the book again and again."
"Just as the title says this book is based on Spiritual Warfare, Man vs Demons and our Lord and Savior Jesus being the deliverer. I've owned the book since in the late '80s that was the 11th printing ISBN:0-937958-25-5. Being a paperback book it did not stay long intact and eventually came apart with many pages unstuck. One day i.e a few years ago a cousin of mine asked me if I can lend the book to her and I did lend it to her. After about three months she returned the book, but to my surprise she had the book hard covered and properly done, for that I was very grateful and she told me she did it just because I was very kind to lend it to her. Thank you Sandora I appreciate it very much.Rebecca Brown M.D. the author of this book is in this particular hospital working and she grew up being a Christian knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and have to come up against the most spiritual vicious attack by Demonic powers from Satan and his fallen angels.Just like our very own society where we have all types of people of different classes; poor, rich, middle class, alcoholics, drug addicts, smokers, vagrants etc, its the same way in the spiritual world of Satan and his fallen angels you have Priestly demons, drunkard demons, smoking demons etc of different levels and rank.

"Don’t listen to the negative reviews.. they either were not spiritually ready to know the reality that satan tries really hard to conceal or are those working for the enemy in order for the truth to not reach many. I recommend to be fully with Christ if you do not want to be easily attacked and led astray. This book is easily digestible to true Christians that already know or suspect evil works of the enemy. This book will confirm all the weird things you hear on the news of kidnappings, plotted murders..and weird unexplainable things that happen in every day life..Big eye and mind opener! You want some of the truth, get this book. In order to attack the enemy we must know what we are dealing with. No time for lukewarm Christians. It’s time for God’s true army to rise!"

Thank you Sandora I appreciate it very much.Rebecca Brown M.D. the author of this book is in this particular hospital working and she grew up being a Christian knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and have to come up against the most spiritual vicious attack by Demonic powers from Satan and his fallen angels.Just like our very own society where we have all types of people of different classes; poor, rich, middle class, alcoholics, drug addicts, smokers, vagrants etc, its the same way in the spiritual world of Satan and his fallen angels you have Priestly demons, drunkard demons, smoking demons etc of different levels and rank. This book really exposes Satan and his Demons to the extent that the everyday person reading this book will say ""This cannot be so"" they won't believe it not unless you've gotten to the place where you have a personal experience yourself. Thats why I can relate to this book and believe what Rebecca wrote in such details and exposing Satan.The book is particularly based on a young girl who Rebecca gave an alias name Elaine and the experiences she had while attending to her in the hospital and also praying for her and Satan and his demons constant attack on Rebecca and Elaine. It also shows how God sends his host of angels encamped around there home and protecting them from the onslaught of the enemy. These are things that I personally know about and can relate with it. Just like in the days of Elijah when the Syrian army came upon Elijah and Gehazi was very scared and Elijah told the Lord to open the lad's eye so he can see in the spiritual realm and saw the host of heaven surround the enemy ready to destroy them (the Syrian army) at a moments notice.I'd recommend this book for all readers whether or not they want to believe thats there choice. Reading this book will have you so captivated that it will have you wanting to read out the entire book and want you to read the book again and again."
"Just as the title says this book is based on Spiritual Warfare, Man vs Demons and our Lord and Savior Jesus being the deliverer.

Slander and hate speech against my religion. This book is a fallacy and should be placed in the fiction category until the author can show proof of the false and outlandish claims represented within it.
"If you do the research on the author, you will find a lot of disturbing information on her. This book was a fun read but introduced a lot of controversial and unorthodox ways to ""combat evil"". Honestly this book gave MORE focus to evil and made God seem weak and even powerless at times."
"JESUS IS LORD OVER ALL. I read this book more than 23 years ago as a young newly saved Christian in Kenya.. As I am reading these old brown papers now at age 65 living in Norway, I still feel the power of God over Satan. We cannot compare God to anyone! I have ordered 10 copies to my prayer group of women. This is a MUST read please, please. Get this knowledge. Hosea 4:6 says, My people are suffering for lack of knowledge .......We have power over the evil one, Satan, by the power in the name of Jesus Christ. His blood was not poured for nothing. There is power in it."
"I want to start of by saying that I know about the Satanic world VERY well.  My grandmothers on both sides of my family were witches.  One was used to find missing people by the Massachusetts police as well as individuals for missing persons.  My grandmother was able to ""see"" where the person was and let the authorities know.  My mother raised me into the Satanic world as well.  I did spells, potions, had my ""protective"" talismans etc.  I was able to conjure demons and ""control"" them (I use the quotes because a human controlling a demon is a lie from the devil - we cannot control them, they control us), cast spells, hurt people, summon the dead etc.  I've seen the spiritual world, I've spoken to the devil himself and there are certain things which ring true in people that have experienced this lifestyle.  This book is dead-on about the horrible lies that the devil tells you; the dark-filled and fear ridden nights; the ability to see the spirits/demons.  Anyone that denies the facts of this book either has no knowledge of the spirit world or is lying to misguide about its authenticity.  Praise God for the people that wouldn't give up on me and prayed daily for my salvation.  The Lord heard their prayers and I was saved - accepted Jesus as my Savior.  It was only as a Christian that I learned what true power truly is.. and that is God!  Only God was able to get me out of the deep dark hole that I had thrown myself in, as well as the inheritance demons from my ancestors.  I recommend this book but ONLY to the reader that knows God and asks the Holy Spirit to guide them and protect them as they read."
"This book shouldbe taken so seriously!  This book is not for every reader, but the Lord Jesup Christ will have you take on certain assignments that you run from in ministry. This is exactly what happened in my situation...The Lord Jesus Christ has called me for SPIRITUAL WARFARE AND BEING A INTERCESSORY PRAYER WARRIOR!!! This happening in our world today we have Cult activities, satanic rituals, children adults animals etc being sacraficed...We ARE IN A SPIRITUAL WAR!!! Know back I can get you out of whatever situation you are in and he has truly already won the battle in victory over Satan the Lord Jesus Christ has defeated him according to Revelations 19&20...if he has called you for spiritual warfare in ministry then this book is for you remember I did say in the beginning that this book is not for every reader so please do cover yourself in prayer before opening up this book and cover yourself in prayer throughout this book"
"I haven’t read this book but by the reviews seems like we need to focus on Gods word more, everything you need is in the Bible & why let someone is dictate you when God clearly says this world is wicked and every heart is deceiving, He also mentions how the devil is always seeking who to devour. Be Alert! Anyways not sure if I wanna purchase this book after all since it’s focus is more on tactics on the enemy then Our King Lord Jesus!"
"Okay I have to point out to everyone who hasn't already had a second helping of Koolaid that, in this book, Elaine claims to have sex with Satan. In the real world. Seriously. And that there are werewolves and vampires participating in drug fueled orgies with demons. Also there are human sacrifices, pretty much everywhere, all the time. Most of the people commenting here are serious in their belief in demons and vampires. If you believe in magic and are into kinky demon sex, this book will let you indulge without coming out of the closet.Besides being fiction offered as fact it is a very entertaining read. Herein you will find bawdy tales of a young and insecure woman, 'Elaine', and her rise within the ranks of a super secret satanic underculture. In the process she goes to a witch camp where she learns witchcraft and uses it to best other witches in a competition! Like Hogwarts! After proving her mettle at witch quidditch she becomes queen witch and marries Satan! Satan is really hot, rides her around in a limo and drinks fancy champ. As Satan's queen she gets to meet heads of state, the pope knows her, the Masons are in on it and it so on.Then a MAJOR TWIST: under Satan's direct orders, she's supposed to kill this doctor that's super Christian and messing up Satan's plans and that happens to be the author of this book! But that won't be easy because Rebecca Brown uses her Jesus magic to show Satan who's boss. Thereafter Elaine is torn between two men: a hot Satan and a hot Jesus. Both want her. Who will win? Read the book to find out!"
"PLEASE DO NOT ATTACK DR. REBECCA BROWN, TO EVERYONE THAT READS THIS I HAVE HAD TO FIGHT IN SPIRITUAL WARFARE. I ACTUALLY WORKED AT A HOSPITAL WHERE THE WHOLE IN TIRE NIGHT CREW I FOUND OUT WERE SATANIST!! PEOPLE WERE AND HAD MYSTERIOUSLY DIED!! THE SATANIST HAVE COME AGAINST THIS WOMAN AND HAVE FOUGHT AGAINST HER TO DISCREDIT HER!! EVEN IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT SHE MAY HAVE LOST HER LICENSE,THE LORD REVEALED TO ME THAT THE WHOLE COURT SYSTEM AND EVERYONE THAT SPOKE AGAINST HER WERE SATANIST!! AND THEY ACTUALLY CAME AGAINST HER TO KEEP THEMSELVES FROM BEING EXPOSED!!! IF YOU ARE NOT A BELIEVER THEN YOU HAVE BEEN AND ARE BEING DECIEVED BY THE DEVIL! JESUS IS LORD HE DOES EXIST IF YOU WOULD JUST GIVE HIM A CHANCE AND SEEK HIS FACE AND ASK HIM INTO YOUR LIVES.JESUS DIED FOR THE SINS OF THE WORLD !! NOT ONLY THAT THE DEVIL TRIED TO TEMP JESUS MATTHEW 4:1-11 IN FACT THE DEVIL HAS A LONG HISTORY HE DECIEVETH THE WHOLE WORLD I ASSURE ANYONE THAT YOU WILL EXPERIENCE THE HOLY SPIRIT!! HE WILL COME OVER YOU AND DWELL WITH YOU. HE WILL HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON , AND WILL GUIDE YOU.THERE IS SPIRITUAL WICKEDNESS GOING ON EVERYDAY! IF YOU DO NOT KNOW JESUS I SUGGEST THAT YOU GET TO KNOW HIM! BECAUSE HE SHED HIS BLOOD FOR THE WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD! I HAVE THIS BOOK AND IT IS REAL PEOPLE ! Ephesians 6:12King James Version (KJV)12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."
"Most Christians live in a fairy tale world and have no concept of the Satanic powers that threaten them even though the Bible warns them constantly of the spiritual wars they face.  Like it or not we are currently entering into the Tribulation.  The world government is being ruled by Satan through membership in the Illuminati.  This book briefly refers to how the Brotherhood feared the Satanic powers of the Illuminati.If you want a deep understanding of just how threatening the powers of Satan are to the so-called ""contract"" Christians (those who think they are ready for the Lord's return because they attend Church on Sunday and have a mediocre part time relationship with the Lord) then you MUST read this book.It will describe very clearly the evil powers of these principalities true Spirit-filled Christians are at war with today.  It will humble half-baked Christians and hopefully warn them they MUST get right with God and commune with him and the Holy Spirit every hour of the day.  If not they may be killed by the forces that come upon them in the end-times because they have inadequate protection from these Satanic powers.I pray that every Christian that thinks they are ready for these wars to humble themselves and understand they will come face to face with Police, Government, and US Soldiers very soon that are being driven by the forces of Satan's army.  If they are not fully protected, they will be viciously tortured and killed.Become right with the Lord now - 100%!"
I enjoyed this book from beginning to end but of course the book won’t be available Satan is blocking it because he doesn’t want people’s eyes to be opened but JESUS WILL ALWAYS BE OUR SAVIOUR
"There was only one biblical error I found in reading, which is that Satan can read your mind.  He can't.  He doesn't have that kind of power.  Only God can, and he will only participate in your thinking if you invite him in.  Satan has demons who if they are let in, dwell with you; and they report to Satan.  Also, these creatures have been around humans for a long time and can read nuances very well.  I grew up in a demon infested home, with a mother who had a love for Jesus, but was lost to him through demonic control for most of her young adult life.  I experienced a lot in this book, and we were not Satanist, but actually believed we were Christian... unholy Mormans."
"I was a bit confused by this book.  Let me acknowledge that I believe in Satan and his power, and I know that things like this really happen.  I don't know, however, if this particular story was true.  I have never actually witnessed a devil being cast out of a person, but I've heard many stories from people who have, and it never happened like Dr. Brown described it.The main thing that I had a problem with was that this woman was trying to battle the devil and his minions without being properly armed.  Rebecca Brown did not have the blood of Jesus applied to her life because she wasn't in the full truth and therefore did not have the power that she should have had when trying to protect herself from the attacks of Satan.  I think that she went through a lot of pain and torture unnecessarily.  Had this woman been baptized in the name of Jesus and received the Holy Ghost with the evidence of speaking in tongues and had the revelation of the oneness of God, her battle would have been much easier.One of my favorite parts was where the followers of Satan went to attack and torment a family - just as they had done many times before.  The only difference was that this family was protected by the host of Heaven, and they couldn't get to them.  I know that, when we have applied the blood of Christ to our lives, we have angels all around us, shielding us from the forces of darkness.  I firmly believe that ""Greater is He that is in us than he that is in the world!"""
"I was directed by The Lord to learn more about apologetics, and the occult.  When I first saw this book many years ago in my Christian bookstore and flipped through it, I first thought this lady was  nuts.  I went to put the book down, but the Holy Spirit had me pick the book up again, and I ended up buying it, thinking there had to be something to it if He was directing me to buy it.  Since I was a young child I already had supernatural encounters with both the angelic and demonic.  I finally was at the age where The Lord already was showing me in His Word how to start living more of a spiritual warrior's life.  I was reluctant to believe on some of the stuff she was first saying, but the more I read the book, the more I realized I went through some similar encounters.  Rebecca Brown's second and third books were even more so helpful in me gaining knowledge and wisdom in how to become a better warrior for Christ.  The spiritual realm is REAL, and is NOT to be taken lightly!! Since first reading her books, I sure have gone through many more attacks in my life, some I hope will never be repeated.  But I know how to take up my armor, and use it effectively, thanks to Rebecca and many others that were bold enough and obedient to The Lord in sharing their life stories.  I didn't ask to have what I have; The Lord gave me what He thought I should have as far as gifts, talents, knowledge, wisdom, etc.  Prophecy and dealing with spiritual warfare on a daily basis (yes, especially between the hours of 3-6am!) is not what I signed up for in this life, but we are to be OBEDIENT to what The Lord God tells us to do, for He will equip us so we can do what we have been called to do while on this Earth.  As long as it brings glory and honor to My Father, that's all that matters.  We need as Christians to take up our armor, wear it every day, be a Light in this dark world, and lead others to Christ, and away from Satan, his demons, and all the demonic traps that he has set. As it is written, ""wake up, oh sleeper..."" It is also written, ""My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge..."" We are responsible to know God's word, take our armor, and fight the good fight every day of our lives, to the best of our ability, and with the strength, power, and authority that has been given to us in God's word!  Use it! Live it!  Stand up to the evil in this world, and as it is also written, ""...and having done all, to stand..."" (Ephesians 6:13) May The Lord God bless all those who are willing to do what He has called them to do....."
"Books like this are so full of bizarre, nearly-hallucinatory religious fervor that I find them like the ravings of a mad person. The Satanic Panic called and it wants its schtick back. Seriously. This is an offense to all thinking people."
"If you miss the Satanic Panic of the 80s and early 90s you can get a full dose of it with this book. Along with other fraudulent works, such as The Satan Seller by Mike Warnke, the stories in this book have been entirely debunked, ironically, by a Christian group who investigated the author and the claims made. The author is in fact a mentally disturbed former doctor and the mysterious Elaine was her roommate. It shares a lot of source material with other Christian books at the time, such as a vast, far reaching Brotherhood of Satan, infanticide, sacrifices and the inevitable ""come to Jesus"" moment, where they renounce Satan, and instead of turning over evidence to convict the alleged mass murderers, they write a book and make money off it. Of course, the police, the Pope and possibly the FBI are all part of the Satanic Conspiracy so I guess turning States Evidence is out. Good thing no Satanists have infiltrated the book publishers. The book is an interesting work of fiction but what really makes it special is there are still people looney enough to believe it is real."
"It has been a while since I read this.  I have mixed feelings about this book.  Many of Rebecca Brown's Bible texts concerning the soul and spirit are misinterpreted and other's meanings are stretched to make her point.  Nevertheless, I feel that God can use anyone to get a certain message  across regardless of where we are spiritually. I feel that in this book,  Rebecca Brown does have a point to make that many seem to ignore: Satan is  alive and active in the world today.Satanism is something that many seem  to poo-poo and cover over with skepticism.  Unfortunately, they close their  eyes to the fact that there could be some people who approach satanism in a  very serious way.  And it could be anyone, be he a doctor or just a  crackpot fringe-occultist. And also that it can be a VERY organized  religion.Satan's biggest tool in deceiving the human race is to make  people believe that he and his devoted followers do not exist. Some of  Brown's stories do seem farfetched and may need to be taken with a grain of  salt that's true, but she brings us to an awareness of the bigger picture:  Satanism does exist, people do commit sacrifices and ritualistic crimes in  his name, it is larger and more organized than people think, and that there  is a spiritual realm that does exist beyond our world.  A place where  warfare is going on constantly.  And occasionally, it is made aware to our  senses.  Christ and his disciples had much contact with the demonic/angelic  plane.  It is biblical.Ultimately you will have to make up your own  mind on the validity of this book, just don't throw out the baby with the  bathwater!"
"Years ago a friend invited me to a comedy show, when we arrived, there was a hypnotist there instead of a comedian. This man asked for 10 volunteers to be hypnotized, and I volunteered.  Foolishly,  I thought that it was all a joke and that no one could be hypnotized.  I was wrong!  He hypnotized me that night and my life changed dramatically.  I became weakened physically, and I would go in and out of a trance.  I almost killed my sister and myself when I went into a trance while driving and almost ran a red light.  My sister screamed before I ran the light,  and I snapped out of the trance.  After this incident, I was in the library and the Lord brought this book to my attention.  Dr. Rebecca Brown wrote in this book how a hypnotist can open a door in your spirit and draw strength from you.  They can still hypnotize you after doing it once.  I prayed the prayer in this book and closed the open door in my spirit.  I personally experienced this and know that this is true!!!"
"Read this book as a prerequisite for Prepare for War, an even better book.  One needs to be read to understand the other.  Prepare for War provides the instructions."
"This is a christian book that deals with witchcraft/satanism;written in story form-first half and gives out information (author's views)-second half. First, this is not the BIBLE;so therefore one has to take the story by faith. However, the author's views on occult practices are correct- One is playing with fire, regardless if you practice white or black magic;or do innocent occult practices ,like palm reading.All occult practices get their power source from dark forces. Satan is an angel of light,out to decieve many. He can give powers to people; (powers,which do good things) as long as he knows he has your soul. Even if you doubt the authors credibility, she is correct that ALL occult practices are sinful and are DANGEROUS.This fact is biblical ;which is why I give it four stars. Please read ""A Divine Revelation of HELL"" by Mary K Baxter. She deals with these issues also...the people and consequences...."
"I was saddened to read so many negative reviews about the author and her books. If you haven't been involved in deliverance ministry you have no idea of the various and ""strange"" trials that you will face and how you will even fail yourself as the enemy consistantly tries to trip you up. Although many of the details are very dramatic, I believe this book was candidly written and without arrogance. The following is a quote from my recently published spiritual warfare book,

  
Strike the Target!









  
  
    
  . ""I have fostered an interest in spiritual warfare throughout my Christian walk. My own deliverance as a new believer freed me to live a more fruitful life according to God's Word. It was not until a friend introduced me to a unique book entitled, 'He Came to Set the Captives Free,' that I began to also understand the ministry of deliverance. The author, Dr. Rebecca Brown, begins with an ominous warning to the reader of the devil's constant and ruthless efforts to keep the truth of his defeated position hidden. After reading this warning, I closed the book, set it down on my living room table and there it remained for about three days. Every time I caught a glimpse of it, I had the sense that whatever information was between the covers would significantly change my life. And it did. My hesitation was warranted as I realized I could no longer be a fascinated spectator of spiritual warfare, but must enlist in active duty as a prayer warrior."" Although I do not understand or agree with everything the author writes, this book is worth reading. It will enlighten your understanding and open your spiritual ""eyes"" and ""ears"" giving your greater discernment for prayer. I admire the authors great faith and courage to help others know Christ and expose the enemy."
"I am a young 24 year old woman from a highly concentrated christian family. I mention this because I have personally experienced spiritual warefar in my life and when I read Rebecca's book, backed by scriptures, I can only say one thing. Destroy Rebecca's character however u may, the truth is the truth and all she says is valid. Every mature christian knows that in times of trials, where Satan has his eye on you, practically EVERYONE will turn against you, including true men of God. (Take Jesus Christ, take Job). God allows it for the specific purpose of the person being attacked coming to the realization that they cannot depend on man and they must put ALL their trust in God. So if every pastor on this earth discredited this book, that is between them and God and their lack of knowledge. Besides, false prophets are ever on the rise.Satan is SO real. And about those reviews not believing in 'werewolves', etc, where on earth do u think all these 'fictional creatures' originated from. Humans. So naive without Jesus Christ.At the end of the day, don't read this book unless u are strong in God. And please, pray for the Holy-Spirit to convict u of the book, whether its true or not.And for all those Satanists and agents of darkness invading these pages to post reviews detrimental to the souls of men, I hold the Precious Blood of Jesus against you. May the Holy-Ghost fire of God destroy your every evil work and expose u for what u are. Jesus is Lord to the Glory of God the Father. Lord Jesus, I cover all my sisters and brothers in Christ in the precious blood of Jesus. Keep us from evil and strengthen us as warriors in your army to fight the good fight of faith.Victory in Jesus Christ, son of the Most High God. Forever and Ever. Jesus LOVES u."
"i read this book from a friend after i had been rebellious to God a couple of yrs, and this book ""jump started"" back towards the Lord. my roommate and i were going to fax her from our phone, when she picked up. i awkwardly asked her about the ""were animals"" and she dryly confirmed everything. even today i have a tough time embracing the blatant Satanic practices she matter-of-factly outlines in her book, but it is just an in-your-face address of the wiles and evils of Satan and Satanic worship. I'd say you'd be better off reading it, and making up your own mind."
"Let me lay out some background about myself:  I am a seminary graduate and a Presbyterian.  I am a cessationist in regards to the revelatory gifts of the Holy Spirit.  That being said, there are some obvious theological problems within this book that do NOT directly conflict with what I already believe.As others have said, this book is difficult to read.  It is published through one of those ""self published"" companies and the need for an editor is obvious.  Many times it switches between persons (1st and 3rd), as well as repeats information stated the page before.  While ""Elane's"" portions are better than Rebecca's, the book is still hard to get through.  If you are a stickler for grammar, take something to calm down before reading this book.Story wise, it is interesting, but problems persist throughout.  Things that make you just go, ""HUH?"" abound.  As previously mentioned, the talk about werewolves, vampires, and zombies was very hard to listen too.  The fact that Elane could become a top witch... and NEVER do their necessary sacrifices (especially w/ all the importance she said it had) seems VERY unlikely at best.  Secret airports that nobody knows about... churches rented without knowledge of the parties involved... illegitimate children born and sacrificed without evidence of their birth... scars from demonic torture that were healed to hide any evidence of Elane's involvement... it all gets to be too much to take.That isn't to mention all the theological issues involved in this book.  Such as how in the world a Christian could be possesed by demons (when possessed by the Holy Spirit), or even CONTROL those demons while being a Christian.  How in the world demons could have physical relations with a human being (Nephilim debate aside).  God the Father (yes, that's right, the *Father*) speaking directly to Rebecca.  That is only scratching the surface of the issues in this book.That being said, the final chapters in the book (which are more instruction than storyline) are why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 or lower (if I could).  The story might be a stretch and hard to believe, but if you read the warnings and advice chapters, you can see that the reader is not ""off her rocker"" as some out there would lead you to believe.  She does have some knowledge of Scripture and is not ignorant in the promises fo Christ to protect His children.  These chapters are the 1 redeeming quality of the book.Nevertheless, if you want to read this book and are intrigued by the Satanic realm, you'll still read it.  If you are looking for something about how Satan works though, I'd recommend looking elsewhere (like Lewis' Screwtape Letters).  This book is poorly written all around, and it shows by the fact that no major Christian publisher would take it as their own.  Sorry Dr. Brown, but if this story is true, you have some MAJOR revisions to do."
"Whether this book is true, I don't know.  Could the events in this book really happen?  I would say yes to 80% of it, but I really don't know.  Whether or not it is factual, it is, to say the least, quite interesting  and entertaining.  I got goose-bumps reading several parts of it.  I am a  Christian, and I do believe in the supernatural.  But I also believe in the  ""natural"" tendencies of a person to exaggerate.  This book does,  however have many good points.  It does place Christ at his rightful place  as a loving God ready to forgive and deliver every, and anybody no matter  what their past.  I cannot be the judge of the authenticity of this book.  But I can testify that two friends I loaned this book to did have some  weird experiences happen to them as the author says at the beginning may  happen.  Power of suggestion?  Beats me.  Buy it, read it, judge for  yourself."
"It is understandable that many, including honest, God fearingChristians would have doubts about some of the things the authordescribes in the book.  And of course everyone has the right, and also the obligation to test the spirits, and to test whatever you hear from the pulpit or from any book claiming to report truth.  This much I am sure we can all agree upon.While all the details in the book may not be entirely accurate according to your particular view of theology, I doubt if there is anyone out there who IS 100 percent accurate.  I do believe though that Rebecca Brown is telling the truth as she remembers it.  The accounts are not too far removed from other accounts from other satanists.  Perhaps we can hold onto the good and reject the bad, as the scritpures admonish us.  I believe there is a lot of good here."
"This book was given to me a few years ago by a very close friend as a well-intended but unfortunately misguided gift.Instead of raking this book or the author and her background over the coals (as much as she may deserve it in this case), I would like to simply point two things out.First, the fact that people take this stuff seriously (along with claims of shape-shifting reptiles that allegedly are running the planet ala David Icke) really says a lot about what passing for critical thinking skills in this country. Amongst some of the far-fetched claims (to put it politely) this author makes is that werewolves and vampires really do exist! Mental illness and medical conditions such as Porphyria (it's a blood disorder) aside, has anyone ever seen any proof of their existence? For that matter, has anyone seen any evidence to corroborate any of the other extreme claims made in this book? C'mon people, think! This sort of mentality is right out of the Middle Ages.Second, I would like people to consider how books like this only serve to undermine the efforts of those who are trying to run a legitimate ministry, are genuinely trying to help people, and in general give  Christians a bad name. Does anyone seriously believe that spreading falsehoods and dubious theology in God's name is doing God's will? Again people, think!If you as the reader have made it this far, you obviously have access to a computer and the internet. I beg and implore you to please use it along with the mind that God gave you to research these things out and discover the truth for yourself."
"I must read this. I am giving 5 stars before reading as the truth needs to come out..i have proof they are here..on vid and audio..i was possessed..my home born into was..this is real..my path lead me..into occult..they set you up..all need to be very safe,,my book is coming out too..it is not to scare..to help free some in bondage now..who have no idea how true..I know this is real..i am buying this..never knew anyone else wrote a truth of this.."
Sorry for my bad English I'm French .I read this book and I can say by experience that it tells the true .I 'm a born again christian.I have been fasle christian church for one year I found them weird so I leaved them .2 years after leaved them I discoverd that they were in fact satanists so they try to kill me by black magic . I went to another christian church a real one this time and Jesus saved my life .I have seen some of the things wich are described in the book that's why I can say that this book tells the true .If you are in France and you are attacked by satanists reed the Holy Bible and Michelle D'Astier De La Vigerie books it saved my life. Michelle haves a blog and a facebook too .Read He came to set the captives free.Be bless.
"In the very first chapter, Dr. Brown illustrates why this book can't be taken seriously.  She demonstrates serious flaws in her reasoning process (pg 11-12), admits to a background that would make her prone to a persecution complex and lacking any healthy skepticism (pg 8), and tends towards delusions of grandeur in her relationship with God (pg 12).Initially I was quite intrigued with the possiblility of having a clear eyed report of the process of winning a dyed-in-the-wool Satanist over to  God's light and love.  Instead, Dr. Brown comes across as being just as unthinking and crazed in her beliefs as the Satanists she seeks to convert.  She repeatedly fails to look into what normal experiences have been recorded before attributing the events she perceives to extraordinary supernatural powers (pgs 9, 13, 15).  Part of me is disgusted with the educational institutions that awarded this person  degrees in nursing and medicine, in that she somehow failed to learn how to analyze, think critically or reason.It's too bad she couldn't have been a little more straightforward in reporting the events that make up the book -- it would have packed much more punch.  As it is, I just can't recommend it.  Read it if you must, but remember this falls at the low end of believable testimony."
"HE CAME TO SET THE CAPTIVES FREE is probably one of the worst books ever written about demoniac possession and exorcism.  It barely holds your interest even as a work of fiction, which it most definitely is.  The fact  that a drug-addicted doctor managed to convince so many that her tall tales  were real should give all Christians cause for alarm.  If you're searching  for juvenile pulp fiction with conspiracy theories, Satanic cults,  exorcisms, and a little gore, you've come to the right place.  If you're  looking for a serious study on Satanism or demoniac infestation, look  elsewhere."
"I read this book years ago and found much of it hard to believe, but I tried. Now I look back and see that I was right to doubt. However, it was colorful and could be entertaining, as long as you don't take it's contents too seriously."
"This novel was based on a true story about a young woman name Elaine who was an occult priest that that eventually was delivered by the power of God through a  a christian doctor called Rebecca brown. The story is told from the perspectives of both Elaine and Rebecca; each took their turn telling the story from their perspective. It started out with the early life of Elaine, about her birth and how her mother gave some of Elaine's cord blood to some women posing as a health care provider who was really an occult member who was going to use the blood for occult rituals. Later in Elaine's life she became a practicing witch and went very deep in the occult. According to her story she became the high priests to Satan and even had sexual relations with the devil. She met Rebecca and her life started to change. Rebecca through the power of Jesus started to help Elaine so that she could be delivered from the powers of Satan. After and even during the deliverance both women were getting attacked by other occult members that were very agree with Rebecca for pulling Elaine out of the group. They tried on numerous  occasions to kill these two women. After Elaine became a christian her life became so free and it was a blessing for her life. The knowledge in the book is so in sight full about how media is influence.  The music is influence and the book said that some occult member put spells on the music so that those that listen to it are influence and are also brain washed.  It talked about how rock music and hip hop music was all an orchestration of the devil. I am so happy that read it book, it has made me so aware of the stuff happening. The television is influence by the people that coordinate it and they only allow things that they want the people to know and they use it as like a kind of brain washing to get the people to think they way want them to think.This was a great book in that it thought so much about how God can work for His children and also what devil does in the world. It was so surprising what the book point out about what was and is probably still happening in our country. I could not believe that any where in america people could just kidnap someone and then have a ceremony were they pretend to kill them like they killed Jesus on the cross 2000 years ago in Israel. It was good that it also gave knowledge about how the devil works against the churches in the United States of America. I recommend this book to any christian and to any parent in the United States of America that wants their children to do well in their life. Other than that every one who is an actually christian must read this book and take really good notes."
"It has been more than 7 years when I first read this book, and it has been 4 years since I wrote my review on Amazon[.com].  First of all, I will say some of the things addressed in the book are real.  For example, can evil spirits insert thoughts into our mind?  From all the pastors (who I know have experiences in spiritual warfares) I'd asked, the answer is yes.  However, it doesn't mean that we should believe in it wholeheartedly.  After all, it is the Bible which contains the only infallible Word.  My recommendation is to read it with caution.  If Holy Spirit within you tell you otherwise, you should listen."
"Also read the books of ""He Came to Set the Captives Free"" in 1987, and other books. I was young and did not understand way read a book that will just keep you thinking and to bring fear. Fear is not from God. The Lord knows how I read these books, I went on letting these stories to be real in my life, and I was reading the books more than the Bible. Sharing and encouraging to others in church to read this book.The Lord knows what I went through, Jesus help me to be free from the secrets of Satan. Now I'm not worried, but I focus on God. I fear the Lord, in a Godly way. The Lord is my Shepard and I shall NOT WANT!I'm leader not a follower, I only follow The Christ my King Jesus.This book is dangerous to read. God sees and watches how this book can really make your mind think to bring confusion, with illusion, no peace of mind, and with no comfort. Satan so-called Secrets. God Knows everything, this book is to trick you to keep you away from God's love, peace.God does not want us to be burden with all this. The books you should read are the Books that bring Faith, Love, Peace and JOY! We should be keeping the Lords Words of encouragement, The Bible to hold on to God's Words.Like He said in Revelations:...you who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned Satan's so-called deep secrets...But God said;...to I will not impose any other burden on you except to hold on to what you have until I come.'This is God telling us not to worry about what this book or any another secrets that Satan has. For us to HOLD on to what we have, until He comes. YES JESUS come quickly. Amen!Revelation 2:24-2624 Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, to you who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned Satan's so-called deep secrets, `I will not impose any other burden on you, 25 except to hold on to what you have until I come.'26 To the one who is victorious and does my will to the end, I will give authority over the nations--"
"I was a bit apprehensive about reading this book because, I did not want to know things that I am not ready to deal with. I prayed to God about this and HE gave me complete peace to go ahead and buy this book. This book cannot be read or understood scientifically and its like the saying ""The heart has its own reasons that reason know nothing of"". I have read her other two books ""Prepare for war"" and ""Unbroken curses"" after reading this book and being a fundamentalist Christian, I can say that her writing is scripturally sound. Her obedience to God is something that is rare among western evangelists and I pray that more and more people could read this book."
Don’t think this needs to be a book. She says the same thing a million times. Don’t spend any money on anything that isn’t absolutely necessary for 21 days and use cash when you do. There. You just read the book.
"If you can get past all the super fundamentalist christian (SFC) stuff in this book, the main message and point of it is pretty great. I first discovered it about five years ago via the Washington Post (where Singletary is a writer) and I'm not kidding or exaggerating when I say it changed my life. I'm not Christian at all, but somehow I battled through, probably because I was in a REALLY bad financial place at the time and desperate to dig myself out of the hole I had created. I had about 10k in credit card debt, $0 savings, over $40k in student loans that I had periodically ignored or gotten forbearances on, had just made a cross country move that I couldn't afford, and I come from a family of people who are just TERRIBLE with money. I had really kind of lost hope. This book, well the exercise of doing the fast in this book, really changed the way I think about money, about spending, about saving, about what I really ""need."" It's only 21 days, so I initially thought, oh that's not bad at all, I can give this a try. For the 21 days, you read a chapter a day, and there is an assignment at the end of the chapter (some of which I didn't do because they were too jesusy, but some of them, especially in Part 2, are great. There are budget worksheets, you have to look at your credit card statements very carefully (first, look at your balance and see if you can remember what you bought, what the balance represents. You probably can't), lessons on entitlement (""I deserve a vacation"", ""I deserve to buy myself a little treat""), etc. And during the 21 days, you cannot use credit or debit, only cash, and you can only buy essentials (hence the ""Fast"" part of the Financial Fast). That means no eating out, no going to the movies, no gifts; you can still go to entertainment functions, but only free ones. You can buy groceries and medicine, and that's about it. But it's only 21 days! Anyone can stick to something for that little time. It might sound like a hokey diet, but when you change your spending a prolonged period of time, it does change the way you think in a way that just a day or two or three does not. I've done it several times, so trust me on this. Just try it.It's worth it. There are a ton of studies about this, many quoted in the book, but from an anecdotal perspective: using cash really changes the way I spend (even to this day) and forcing yourself to THINK about your purchases for 21 days just really changes my mindset. That's why I do it again every new year; it's like a ""reset"" to me.It's over four years since I first did the fast (I have done it at least once a year since, but sometimes I've done it several times a year when I find a friend who wants to do it but needs support - it definitely helps to have someone with whom to check in), and I am happy to report that in 2016 I became 100% debt free, and honestly, it's only because of this book. I do not think I would be debt free today had I not found this and taken to it. I paid off my credit card debt, my student loans, a personal loan from a family member, and I now even am building savings, for the first time in my life and definitely for the first time in my immediate family. I'm saving now to hopefully one day buy a house, which would be the first time in my life to live in a place that is not rented.I do wish she would write a secular version of this book, because I always feel weird recommending it to people (and have to give them the SFC caviat), but I am not kidding at all when I say that she changed my life, changed the way I think about money, and has become the financial role model I never had, that helped me to become (what I think of as) a real adult, a financial grown up."
"I participated in the 21-Day Financial Fast this past July. It was an excellent experience. The 21-Day Financial Fast: Your Path to Financial Peace and Freedom is required reading for participants. Michelle Singletary approaches the financial fast and lessons from a Biblical perspective. That may turn some folks off, but I want to encourage those of you who say Bleah to reconsider. I walk a slightly different spiritual path than Michelle, but did not find anything presented in the book to be a turnoff. It's kind of like a 12-step recovery program - your Higher Power and mine may be different, and they can very much co-exist together.I learned a ton participating in the fast - not just about finances and how to manage them better, but about me and my habits, many which are not beneficial to healthy finances. Those things can be sneaky, and Michelle does a great job giving examples of what those might be.I've decided that I'm doing a quarterly financial fast to keep myself on track as I continue to exercise newly found financial muscles. That may taper off to 2 or 3 times a year, but I found so much benefit, that I want to continue to challenge myself to be a better steward of my resources. Plus the other cool thing about this process is how creative a person can be in saving money. I actually had fun.And a side note - a lot of this is difficult. My difficult areas may not be yours and vice versa. Give it a try, and hang with it for the 21 days. See how well you do. Subscribe to Michelle's Color of Money (Washington Post) column electronically; she'll announce when she's doing the next fast. In the meantime, there's a lot you can do yourself. And if you choose to wing it, her Financial Fast videos are available on YouTube, so you don't have to go it alone.A final note - I cut my monthly credit card bill down by 50% during the fast, and have consistently cut at least 1/3+ out in the months following. We always pay it off, but when you put a lot on the card, it shortchanges other areas. Tired of shortchanging my savings and my retirement funds. Tired of shortchanging other areas of my life. And now that I have the tools and support - I know where Michelle's videos are - I'll continue exercising my new financial freedom muscles."
"This is a great reset book. However, I will caution non-Christians. At times, the author writes passionately from the perspective of her beliefs. There were a few sections I either skipped, scanned, or laughed my way through. Overall, if you are mature enough to filter out the information that does not fit your paradigm you will find it to be a helpful read."
"This is the one book I read at least once a year and do the money fast.  It has plain, easy to understand directions to save money, make money, and live within your means.  It is the one book I would recommend that everyone read.  Ms. Singletary quotes the Bible, but the non-religious will find it just as useful.  Rich or poor, this book addresses money management that doesn't require a college degree in math to put into practice."
"I love this book! It's based on Biblical principles but not overly ""preachy "". It is grounded in common sense and is challenging to everyone that goes through the 21 day financial fast. It's definitely worth the money and so much more! I love that it includes worksheets and giuidelines to do the fast in a church or group setting."
"I love this book and have recommended it to  some of my friends and relatives.  I re-read it every now and then to get back on track with my spending habits,  It's all common sense and what we all know we should do but it's always good to get confirmation in writing.  If you follow the plan for 21 days you will be amazed at how much money you can save, REALLY!"

   Initial Review Delivery ONLY: I’ve seen reviews of product is that were messed and this is a first for me. I’ve ordered soft copy books before and they were just fine. For some reason this one wasn’t so lucky. I’m unsure if it got beat up from the delivery or if it was shipped like this. I’m excited to read this book, as I’ve seen the author on the Today show and I liked what I heard from the short explanation of her financial practices."
"As a believer, I'm blessed to see another teaching about finances. Before purchasing this book, I knew I needed to do better with my finances. I was awake of my spending habits, but I needed to find a way to really gain control over my finances. I prayed to God and God revealed this book to me. During the fast, I gave up my credit card and hardly used my debit card. As a new believer in Christ, I enjoyed the scriptures that the author included throughout the book. The author also broke down the scriptures for us, readers, to get a better understanding on what God is telling us. I wrote down every scripture and quotes that spoke to me. I almost highlighted the hole book. I also bookmarked pages that helped me understand the chapters and any questions that I had. What I also truly love about the book is that the author include daily commitments from each chapter.Even though the fast is over now, I still refer to the book and my notes. I carry it with me everywhere I go. I always check my finances everyday. I used to be iffy about investing but I'm slowly earning how to invest (thanks to the book). The one true thing that really stuck out to me thermos during the fast was Day 4, Tithing. Although I'm not part of a church anymore, I still believe in giving back to God. When give back God, it's stating that you recognize the things God has provided for you and in return, you tithe 10% of your paycheck. Although you expect nothing in return, but you still give back to God. I did find a way to tithe which is through the Bible app created by Life Church. I'm truly blessedness grateful to give back to God and Togo through this financial fast. I will do the financial fast twice a year. I have grown in my walk with Christ and with God."
"Not sure how I heard about this book, but I remember reading other people's reviews on the book and decided to try it.  I asked my morning prayer partner if she would be interested in reading this and she said ""yes"", so I ordered two books.  When the book arrived I went through the book just to get an idea of what we are up for.  I made notes to prepare.  I decided that I wanted to just ""read"" the book through and not DO anything, and my prayer partner agreed.  The next month I read it with my husband... again JUST READING.  We knew December would NOT be a good month to begin, so January 1 we were committing ourselves to a 21 Day Financial Fast.  Michelle says it like it is with many Bible verses and experiences.  The second time around, my husband and I did more discussing of what information was in the book and where we were in our lives.  We did pretty good for the first time around.  I believe we are going to do this Financial Fast again during Lent and work on improving on more of Michelle's suggestions.  We are not in debt and we own our home, but Michelle is very compelling when it comes to spending, saving, tithing and alms giving.  It is ALL about the Budget and where God comes into your life.  Was it hard?  Not for us, but for some this may be impossible.  A great challenge indeed!"
"I like how this book addressed the various phases of life, emotions and issues that directly affect spending (habits). Personally, it helped me hone in on tracing where my money is going, and yes I found out where!  It’s not that you’re being wasteful but knowing where my money is going is a good feeling .  I really enjoyed all of the testimonials, many of which were relatable.I have recommended the book to many friends already.  Yet, the proof is in the pudding so I know when they see the results I experience they will undoubtedly hop on board.  Thanks for sharing your wisdom Michelle"
"I LOVE Michelle!! She is so real with honestly helping set people on the right path. I purchased this book to go along with a class that she teaches and it was a needed reality check for both my husband and I. My husband realized just how much he would spend and I realized that I couldn't antagonize him but we needed to come to a common ground. The information is very useful and she is just downright relate-able. It is tough to complete but if you stick to it, you will truly see and understand the value of money. Thank you Michelle!"
"This book was ok. It made me think about my spending habits. Only buying needs and not wants was restrictive, but I did it. This book helped me remember how important budgeting is. Hoping I reach all of my financial goals this year.  I try to start each new year off with a financial book, and that is how I ended up reading this book. I would recommend this book to those who want to do better financially."
"I loved this book and the fast! It felt so good to stop ordering stuff after the panic buying from this pandemic. Having to use cash made me go to the ATM, something I rarely do. I became more conscious of the prices of food and what we eat. I stopped wasting money on subscriptions that I let auto-renew. It was difficult to commit to tithing, but I did it, and I feel really good."
"My husband and I recently purchased this book and it has impacted us in a great way.  We took this fast seriously.  It was a little rough the first few days but by day 21, we realized how much stuff we buy that we really dont need.  Through reading this book, we have developed a tighter budget which has created extra money to pay off debt.  I am so thankful the author wrote this book.  I recommend if you are really trying to be better at budgeting, you have to read this book."
"This will change your financial life 100% for the better, IF you do the work. Even if you don't do it all the way the first time you will still be better off financially. I will be debt free at 30 because of doing the work laid out here. Also, the way she connects Christ to our money and backs it up biblically - a blessing in its self."
"This book is the best I have ever read in terms of how to fast financially.  What a blessing!!  Michelle Singletary has shared  how to be become prosperous in every aspect -- financially as well life in general.  Even though I am in my eighties, I have learned so much.  This is the first time I have ever done a financial fast and plan to do it periodically to help me get  out of debt and have peace.  Thank you Michelle."
This book not only helped do a no-spend but gave practical Biblical foundations for spending.  I was blessed by the journey and the content provided. I encourage others to not only grab the book but take the time to complete the fast regularly.
"It's like what others have said in their reviews, you get the message after first chapter. Everything else is about her religious beliefs.  Don't waste your money, just ask yourself if you really need your purchase if not save your money"
Good resource for finances. Read it and set goals. She is quite bright about these things.
"Great book but get ready for a fight, with yourself.  This book challenges you to rethink how you spend and see money. It's not easy and I failed the fast on the first two tries. But it has changed how i spend money, as helped me to be a better saver and reset my financial priorities.  This book will require hard work so do this fast with a partner. Believe me even if you fail you win. This book will change your financial future for the better."
"Biblical and practical.  It's more than just getting out of debt and making a budget which is certainly and clearly addressed.  Michelle gets deep into subjects such as the reasons for our spending habits and to look forward to retirement, long term care for yourself as well as your parents ( I've had to use the resources cited for caring for the aged since going through the fast).  There are many other resources for becoming better financial managers of the resources given to us by God.  Going through the fast and doing the 30-day spending ""analysis"" has made me much more sensitive to spending, saving, and giving without being stingy and a hoarder!!  Michelle's book is really helping me to become an even better ""godly"" steward of God's money!!"
I was involved in a group book meet during the reading of this book. Michelle is so real and engaging. This is the most practical financial book I've read.
I truly enjoyed reading this book! I actually have been doing a lot of the things already that Michelle recommended. The only two areas in which I needed to improve was saving more money and investing. This book has definitely helped me to see these two areas where I can cut back.
"Very enlightening book so far, I feel this will be a very helpful guide to help me get a grip on my spending and learning to save."
Heard about this book because of the TODAY show. My New Year's resolution was to become more finically well. This book is wonderful and I hope others learn what I have. There was more of a religious aspect than I thought there would but I ended up liking that more than anything.
"This book can help you get a handle on your spending and evaluate the whys, what's and hows of your spending habits!"
"This is an important and potentially life-changing book with some sloppy moments.  My husband and I each purchased a Kindle copy of this book and read it separately, then made time every night to review the chapter and our answers to the daily assignments that Michelle Singletary gives.  The book illuminated many dark areas of our finances and is still helping us, months later, to address our financial problems.When I say sloppy moments, I mean such errors as displaying two pie charts purporting to show the different amounts young people and older people should allot to different types of investments - and the two pie charts are exactly the same.  A few of the chapters contradict the basic message of the book, too.  For example, at the beginning of the book, you are told not to spend any money at all on food outside the home during the 21 days of the fast.  Yet, in one of the later chapters, Ms. Singletary says (I am paraphrasing), ""Heck, I work hard, I make good money, I deserve to eat dinner at a nice restaurant.""  Kind of calls the main thrust of the fast into question.  Finally, there are a number of typos and misspellings, a couple of which are inadvertently amusing.  Someone was asleep at the wheel in editing a book that would otherwise have been a 5-star read.My final comment is that this book will only help you if you ""work the book.""  If you're thinking of simply skimming it or reading it for a few good tips, forget it.  The 21-Day Financial Fast can support you in changing your financial future - but only if you put the requisite effort into it."
"Very good, from a very conservative Christian point of view. (Tithing, for instance: a man can tithe, no problem. A woman needs to get her husband's permission.) If you can get beyond that aspect of it, it's a good program. We used it for our church Lenten Series, and 2/3 of us got a lot out of it. It actually led me to purchase YNAB software (You Need a Budget), which is the best budget software I've ever used. Nothing else has come even close!"
"Great learning tool, for the beginner, excellent quality and i received this product in a timely fashion. Definitely will purchase more books from this seller."
"Hard to get into. Less church talk, financial information needed."
"I've read many of her columns in the past. This was truly a revelation into how I spend even though I considered myself somewhat thrifty. I call it the whole ""stop and think"" phase that needs to become part of who you are. Whether you make way below six figures or make beyond that it helps to see how to be content with you have and to be helpful and kind to others without having to expect something back from it. The daily assignments are great and beneficial.Truly a fabulous read!"
Well thought out and with a proper foundation this book teaches the read how to live a profitable life. Great advice and principles for living the “good” life.
I don’t think others should have to go through this journey with you. I couldn’t get pass day 1.
Starting off the new year with this book and hoping to get my finances in order. This book is easy to read and looking forward to put the author's suggestions in place.
"As a spender, I learned a lot from this book!! Every time I wanted to buy something, I reminded myself to say no and stick to the fast. It's the first book I've read that has truly impacted my life for the better. I highly recommend it!! I'll be reading it again several times to glean more wisdom each time."
"Excellent read & practice for everyone willing to live a  debt free life. This book challenged my beliefs & practices. Even if you’re not ready to take on the fast, continue reading  the daily exercises - this will change your life."
"This book read well, it was funny and practical. The tools included will assist you with getting your finances on track. It will also help you learn more about the way your spend your money."
"I never knew I had so many other issues, like entitlement, that affected my spending habits. I also wasn’t aware of how much frivolous spending I engaged in. I focused on God being pleased with every area of my life except my finances. Now I also want him to be able to trust me as a good and faithful steward of the financial resources he gives me."
This fast should be done annually as a financial reboot or assessment. Either way God will reveal something new each time.
This book was filled with to much reference about religion. I wanted more financial information. A path to financial peace and freedom is more than 21 days.
Really enjoyed following this plan. Alliowed me to cut back on unnecessary expenses. High recommend.
"I learned a lot about my finances and spending habits. I saved $700 during the fast, and clearly understand the differences between needs and wants!"
good book to read but the work is no longer available online
I am grateful for this book and all that I learn. I’ve completed the fast 5 times and will continue to do it annually! Each time I grow in a new area of my finances and I’m reminded to tighten up with my spending. This book has led to many lifestyle changes which makes completing the fast easier and easier!
This book was an excellent resource and Bible-based. Can be used by individuals or as a group resource.
"This book really does give you the tools to succeed. Michelle is amazing. She has helped me and given me different tools and shown necessary steps that I know in the next 6 months my debts will decrease in half. Also, my spending habits have curved and I am all about saving and investing. I’m blessed and grateful. She deserve more than 5 stars!"
You can’t go wrong with this step by step tutorial on creating the perfect mindset for achieving victory.
Definitely one the top 10 books on my list. This book has changed my attitude on spending. You think after paying your tithes that there's nothing spiritual about money - not true. A great read for anyone ready to change their finances.
Wonderful book. It helped me to evaluate my spending and to stop and think if that it a want or a need purchase.
"This book she gives it to you real and raw, and after the 21 days you will thank her. She helps you to see what areas you’re being wasteful with your spending. I’ve done the challenge 3 times and each time it’s hard, but I survive it."
"The author's  clear and precise instructions were very inspiring .  All being said, this is a great  challenge for all ages , and it should start a very early  age."
"I recommend this book who struggling with money. This book teaches you valuable lesson in managing your finances, and being a better steward of God money."
"This book Helped me understand how to save, evaluate my spending habits and review my expenses. It enabled me to create a emergency fund and share time with family and friends without spending money or shopping. It you want to learn how to become debt free and monitor your finances this book is for you."
An absolute must read. I praise God for Michelle sharing this fast through her book.  It it a very practical and relatable book that I could not afford not to read. My financial life has a much better destiny after going through this fast.
"I've been on a financial fast and it has truly been liberating! No expensive coffee runs, less eating out (lost a few pounds, yay!), better understanding of where my money is invested, more savings, paid off a credit card, no urge to spend on unnecessary items, more scriptural understanding of wealth and giving, and although I have about 4 more days.. I'll definitely be continuing these good habits in my life from here on out. It was a great self-check! .. and no I wasn't a saint and followed every little detail, but I did keep a daily journal of my habits and honesty moments with myself. I recommend it sit on the shelf with your yearly book reads!"
On my way to greater peace of mind after reading this book.  It will serve as a great blueprint to do better with my $ regularly.  Starting my first fast tomorrow.  Fingers crossed.
Learned some great tips that I use daily! Great book to jump start your save more journey!
Practical steps and simple activities that will help you see results instantly. I love how biblical principles are incorporated giving you the steps you are taking towards financial freedom that much more meaning. Love this book!
"Whether or not you are a Believer this book helps bring to light some of the FINANCIAL mistakes that are being made in American homes. After reading this book, it is easy to see where you have made past mistakes. The book encourages you to look forward to not making the same mistakes in the future!!! I would recommend this book to both the young and old because it is never too early or late to get your finances in order!!!"
I am happy I took the time to complete this book. I love the budget advise. I intent to become a better steward of my finances.
I enjoyed this book and got really good results from it.
The 21-Day Fast helped me in the area of my finances confirming what I'm already doing and what I need to implement in my life.
I really enjoyed this book and it has helped me to not spend money on unnecessary things. I always go in the store with a list and only get those things on the list.
"The financial fast has some great tools and tips if you've avoided issues with your finances. If you embrace what is taught, it can truly help you. May not be 100% applicable to everything you may be going through, but helpful nonetheless. Also a great reference for when it does happen to you."
Just as pictured.
"Outdated links and typos.  Good ideas, bad execution."
I love everything about the book.
Good quality
"Simply life changing, This is a book ANYONE and EVERYONE can understand, learn and gain strength and knowledge from. If you want a change, improvement, hope, encouragement etc read this book PLEASE!!!! I will read it over and over again"
Very good tool to help you with planning for now and your retirement.
I like the author. She makes me think of changes I need to make in my life and how I need to change my way of thinking.
"Excellent read, just walked through with a group of 20 and we all walked away with greater insight of how to manage our finances."
"I found this book to be pretty good, I like the references to God's word.I would recommend reading, if you are seeking to be financially free."
This book gives a really great start to financial awareness. Becoming better at responding to daily life with financial wisdom is necessary in all ways.
Excellent Read!!! A great spiritual way to address financial health.
This is a great book for anyone needing to get their finances under control.  I would have liked more detail on budgeting and tips on how to stick to a budget.
"I'm not a reader, but this one got my attention.  Read the entire book.  Going back through a second time to start the process."
"Very good tips.  However, I was surprised when reading it to find it laden with religious thoughts and ideology.  It did not apply to my belief system.  I was able to look at it as benevolent thoughts to guide one through this ""Path to Financial Peace and Freedom,"" which is otherwise just plain common sense that many of us have forgotten when it comes to our finances.  Knowing the religious connotations,  I might not have bought it.  But then, I would have missed out on very good tips.  I think of that old phrase ""Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.""  No offense intended to anyone for whom the spiritual and religious guidance means something different than it does to me.  Author Michelle Singletary wants to help us, and I think she does a good job of it."
After spending thousands over the years to help with my finances I can say this is the best 10 bucks I've ever spent.
It really helps to show you who you are and teaches you discipline. It really showed me the value of money and how we through it away so quickly on senseless items and obtaining unnecessary debt.
Want to get out of debt?  Put these ideas into action today.  It's never too late.  Change takes time.  It can be done.
The best financial book ever
This is a must read
We used it for our book club and it was wonderful in the information and methods and tips it shared.
"The 21 Day Fast is life reforming.  I spend and save money so differently now.  It's all about conscience spending and not buying another mascara, moisturizer, dog toy, magazine, candle, etc."
Simple Down to earth. This book is a quick read overall. This was a great book to get started with
"Very informative book, I was introduced to this book from Pastor John Jenkin's sermon"
"This is one of the best financial books that I've come across in years!!!!She's clear, precise, to the point, and best of all she lets us know what we're ordained to do concerning our finances and she's right on the money. This book is a MUST HAVE!!!!!!!It's such an asset to my collection of reads that I bought my supervisor one and I bought 2. She hit the JACKPOT on this one!!!!"
The 21-Day Financial Fast gave me excellent advice as well as biblical principles to achieve my goals.  It also assisted me with setting up a budget and sticking to it.
Great way to get back on track after the holidays shopping and racking up those credit card bills you know
"Great comprehensive take on the concepts of deliberate saving, refinement, and financial wellness."
It is a awesome book it out you on the right track.
"This book is great. I can relate to the examples she uses in her book; found myself saying  "" this is so me"".  The only problem I had was not able to get the financial examples page's print out.  I am still struggling but I am giving up.  It took me a long time to get into this bad habits; so I know it will take some time to get on track financially. I am still reading and putting it into practice even when I fail I will not give up until I get it right.  God' s blessing."
"Good book and author! You just have to committ to doing the work... the end results are worth it. I didn't fully commit, but I am still implementing the great tips and strategies that Michelle teaches us in the book. I will continue to take the necessary steps to improve my money management skills, save towards the purchase of my house. Of course, there is no time like the present to START OVER and GET IT RIGHT!"
A lot of useful information
Excellent! Although I'm a good steward of my money and I'll do this fast again and highly recommend it! 👍
This a thought provoking read that forces you to think about how and why you spend your money. It is good for anyone regardless of your financial status.
It made me think of money in a whole new way. I was tired of living paycheck to paycheck. I was also tired of wondering where all of my money went. I am now on my way to freedom.
Love all the assignments she given us and how it open your eyes to changing things in your life. She and her big mama was the best at saving money its time. I get like them
Great resource for saving money and planning  your financial future.
"Challenges you! You will take something out of it for sure, as well as it makes you more aware of how you spend your money well after the fast is over."
Smart lady.
This book is very practical and Biblically based.  I am beginning 2016 with a Financial Fast! We are debt free but the budgeting was just not happening...Michelle Singletary has the tools and the steps to make this necessary process as painless as possible.
This book is a good simply already should know common sense it simply reminds you of what should be done and I think it is a great gifting...
A great book and a great process I would go through the fast again.
Helping you get your finances together.
I recommend this book to anyone trying to be a better manager of their money. It helps you think before you spend and helps you apply biblical principles. This is a great investment.
Book was in good condition. Better than described.
"This book has helped many of my friends, so I decided to give it a read. I enjoyed it."
Life changing
Excellent book. I watched her daily videos as well and it was like listening to your best friend encouraging you to be better. Very funny too.
Did a group 21 day financial fast with my friends for the new year. This book was very helpful.
Great read!
I love this book. Reading this book was just what I needed for my life. Thank you for the journey of truth.
"The author gave great advice that wa  practical and easy to understand. I have started the fast and although it takes some time to adjust to the new way of spending, I have seen positive results already."
Really informative and thought provoking read.  It really does encourage you to participate in the fast without making your feel bad about your past choices.
"This book has helped me get on the right path to financial freedom. I have not been the best steward of my finances, but this book has gotten me on the path I need to be on."
"This is an awesome book! I recommend this book to every person who wish to have prosperity not only financially but in everyday life. There is a lot of help and benefits you can learn in these chapters. Take at least an hour out of your day and complete each chapter, it's all worth it in the end! This is actually my second time completing the fast and won't be my last. I know it could only get better from here.."
A timely book..much needed information in easy to understand terms.  Its tough but the payoff is worth it!
"We used the book in our small group and it helped us to review the way we handle money, learn to plan and reduced wastage."
I was excited to read this book to get a jump start to financial freedom. This book is humorous and includes biblical references to refer to for guidance toward financial freedom. The testimonies add a relatable dynamic.
"Though the book is heavily influenced by Michelle’s faith, she gets real about monitoring how we spend money. Read it!"
"Awesome book.  Bought used and it looks like a brand new book.  For whatever it's worth, it's also an excellent book for anyone to read.  Great author and great topic."
I’ve committed to 21 day financial fast and gained great insite to my personal finance and to having a full and complete life. This book is a wonderful addition for overcoming unnecessary  spending.
This book changed my life!  Awesome information....
I liked this book a lot. Good way to kick start the year and get focused on what you really want. Helped me focus on what God has given me and to put peace back in my life.
"Great book. I've done the fast several times now. In fact, I try to do it at least twice a year and I always invite someone to join me."
"The book was fantastic. It was an eye opener and it made me think about my stewardship. It was hard to confront my demons of spending outside of my means. When I looked at my debt,I was outrages and I felt guilty for. mismanagement of the funds that God had trusted me to handle.  I am going to do better and stick to a budget. I like the follow-up of the 30 Day Spending Journal.  Thank you for sharing.Ernestine partakerkid@outlook"
Great book everyone needs to buy this book
Very detailed and trying to follow along.
Keep one and buy more for gifts
Love the book - can't wait to get started!
"If you are ready to change your spending habits this is a great book. My eyes were opened to how much I really spend after the fast, it's crazy, I have changed my spending habits and started to save.m"
"I find this book very informative and helpful. After going through the day to day assignments I now have a better control of my finances and life in general. I highly recommend this book. Thanks Michelle, God bless you"
"Very GOOD book, whether your on the right track financially or not . It will teach you how become Debt Free and stay Debt Free."
"This book was suggested as a corporate fast by my Bishop at Bethany Baptist Church. I must say that this book was truly a blessing and I have done nothing but talk about it since day one. I love her writing style which delivers a difficult topic in such a simplistic manner. I found Michelle often ""checking"" my belief system which helped me to see things from a different perspective. I would recommend this book not only to Christians but to all who are interested in living a life free from debt and full of the prosperity in all areas of your life. Go out and purchase today......this will bless you if you let it!!!!"
"The book was an easy read, emphasized the relationship between spending and consumption, and provided guidelines for the ""Fast"". I gave  several copies as gifts for Christmas. I thought there were too many Biblical citations."
The book was really helpful and easy  to read. I did like the helpful testimonies as well.
"One of the most informative books ever, wasn't expecting the Spiritual growth, that was an absolute bonus!!!"
Excellent book very insightful and helpful. Provides very practical information for people of all ages and stages of life. Highly recommended
I recommend this book for all who struggle with overspending and running out of money before the month is out.
A wonderful read filled with great info!
I love this book. I love the chapter on budgeting.I lobe the way she backs her statement to with scriptures.
Very helpful.
Very Helpfull.
Enjoyed the ebook.
Well I'm still reading so right now its a 3 star.  Info is good I like it so far
Good book!! Great guide to becoming financial stable! But she uses the word trifling so much that's kind of tacky and unprofessional when writing a book of this nature. Just my opinion😂
Very helpful.  I really enjoyed reading it.
"Every couple should read this book together...  Then present it to their children...  I think this is the best Wedding, or family present ever.."
"If you have read any of the columns then the book is a must read,for some it's basic but for others it might open your mind and perspective of your financial world."
Wonderful author and worthy budget management book. You can't fail with this book and it's only 21 days.  You'll pass it on for someone else to do 21 days.
Great book great advice
"""I hated the fast!""--(Terri, a reader who participated in the fast)I think that everyone and anyone who read this book and participated in the fast must've felt this way at some point during the fast.  Like another reader, I also tried to incorporate ""mess-up"" days into the fast...which ran counter to what the fast was all about.  In my first go-round, I gave up mid-way through and tried to do it ""my way""...the unsuccessful way I'd been doing it before.The second time I read the book, I really read it again and started to apply the financial principles that Michelle categorizes in her book.  I have an emergency fund in place and an IRA and retirement, but with debt retired and avoided once and for all, I will be able to maximize my contributions to my financial future.  I have already cut down tremendously on the use of my credit cards (although I still have to work at limiting the use of my debit/ATM card for credit purchases) and have seen a positive impact.  I am continuing to re-read and apply the principles (many of them Biblical, but can be used in everyday life) to myself and my finances."
Loved it.
This 21 day financial fast was a very practical and biblical call to greater financial disciple and accountability.  I did this fast with two friends and we're starting again...it was just that effective.  I recommend this book and Michelle's no nonsense approach to financial management and biblical stewardship.  Well worth the commitment!
"This book has added to the exist list of books and knowledge I have to take control of my spending and change my life for the better. Powerful message and yes it is similar to some other books. However for me I think exploring the factor of why you overspend is excellent. In this book, ​she also talks about factor that cause you to spend. Most of what I learned has not taught this. I think once you start to add pieces to make the solid change it become a way of life."
This book has made me think in a new way.
Good book on how to get your finances together...
"THIS book is insightful, open and gives you hard facts to cleaning up your debt. It teaches you how to live better with less. You can then use your gift to make money to bless yourself and others.  I highly recommend it"
Book was great. The process will be painful but you do what you need to do to be financially stable.
My life has been transformed ...spreading the word about The 21 day Financial FAST.
I enjoyed reading this book.  It was and eye opener for me.  I truly believe this book change my way of spending...
I love this book. It is very simple to follow. It covers so much but it is not overwhelming.  A great read.
Very informative! I love the mix of financial savvy with biblical reference.
I found it very repetitive.
"I generally like Michelle Singletary and her financial advice. Her synidicated column is very helpful. She is knowledgeable, hopeful, and compassionate.I just can’t go along with the whole “God” aspect. No, “God” does not want you to prosper. People are not wealthy because they believe in God. A book written thousands of years ago by men in a miserably patriarchal society does not hold specific secrets to make you rich. It’s the same tiresome shtick Dave Ramsey uses, and it’s tiresome and insulting.The book is deceptive. It should state clearly, “This is a book for extremely religious people who believe God rewards people with money.” I wish I’d never bought it."
Good and easy plan to follow.
"I would give 21 day financial fast 4 stars, started my financial fast well.  I had /have problems with tithing I think that;s personal and 10% is 10% be it your time/talent/finances."
"I think this book is awesome. I was already on the path to changing how I handle my money when this book was shared with me but it gave me a great path. There is a chapter for everyone. I saw an opportunity for many of my family members and friends; even my teenage son. I did not give it 5-stars because I'm afraid the religious references might deter others, who are not like-minded, from reading it and gaining a wealth of information....which would be a shame."
excellent book......very helpful!
Get book and tool to use if you are trying to save money. A must read.
"Real and raw.  This program can change your life.  Buy it.  Read it.  Then go back and read it again only this time actually work the steps.  A time will come will no one will be able to say, ""I didn't know"" because with the information in this book, now we know.  Change your behavior.  Change you life."
Awsome book
Didn’t know how religious this was. Not for me because of this.
I've read this book from the beginning to the end. A definite must read. You must have strong will to complete this 21- Day Fast. It was pretty easy for me because it was something I was already working towards. I love the real-life stories relating to each topic including the prayers along with it. Definitely inspiring and an easy read.
Great Christian insight!!
Very pleased with the shipping and conotion of the book!! Was a great read...would recommend!!!
I highly recommend this book whether you're drowning in debt or consider yourself a good manager of your money.  You will walk away learning something.
It was OK but wasn't what I expected. I was looking for more technical information and although I have no issue with spiritual guidance I just wasn't expecting it in this book.
The book was very informative and very helpful.
What an awesome informative book.  Very insightful and easy to follow.
I love this Book!
"Great book filled with inspiration, wisdom, and candid advice toward achieving financial goals!!"
I love this book I am gd at managing my money but it helped me in other ways
recieved in excellent condition.
good read!
Excellent read. Good practical strategies that anyone can apply.
"Excellent advice for persons who are not good at making and keeping a budget, and who are notmindful of managing their finances."
I really loved this book. I was embarrassed by my spending and mismanaging money. Changes are in order. Thx you.
"A must read, an eye opener.  Make you realize where you are throwing away money.  Helped put finances in perspective."
This was a great book. I really wanted to get a hold of my finances and this book helped me do just that. T will be reading it again in a month. I highly recommend this book.
"Excllent book - Michelle focuses on what is important - relationships over money, but also provides good money management tips. We plan on during the Fast once a year, if not more"
Glad I made this purchase - it was just what I needed.  Making it a must read for my children.
"Awesome book. Easier to read than follow the fast, but it will be so worth it!"
Amazing book with daily task and practical tips. I highly recommend this book to those who are in need of a financial makeover.
Just not the right approach for me.  But interesting reading.
Exceptional
My husband and I did the financial and read the book.  Definitely a challenge but worth doing.  Hopefully we can continue to get our financial house in order.
"Made me look at past and plan for the future. Many working people just put money in bank and spend it as if it will always be there.  On tithing  which we do, many do not know of its true teaching.  This one would be a good text book for our youth."
I am still using the financial plan after the 21 days.... This is a great book. Thanks
Absolutely the best advice for getting your finances...and your life under control!
Wonderful read! Practical information regarding finances for singles and couples.
Every church going person should have a spiritual banker with your best interest at heart.  This book is the banker.  I love the small doses of hard medicine she shared. It was a delight and it is relevant.  I like her approach to this truth. Money is real relevant and I know I must be  better steward.  Woooo!!
Her advise to commonsense but we just don't do it.
"Awesome book, I encourage everyone to read it!!"
Practical and Helpful!
Amazing this book has been life changing Thanks Michelle
Didn't know how much money I was spending until I did It
Great read with simple but life changing principles...
"This book changed the my family's idea of how we look at money!It forced us to look at the fact that we were NOT good stewards over our finances! In though it beat us down it also helped to build us back up! This book provides the necessary tools that we need to be successful! We now have a budget, we now have savings accounts, we are now looking forward to paying off some debt!If you have a vision to live financial free this book is for you!"
I Will doing the Fast soon
This book helped me see how important it is to have only what is necessary.
Very helpful and encouraging
Loved the book and it shipped in a very timely manner :)
Great
I truly love this book.
I agree with everything Michelle wrote in this book. I will be reading again soon. I HIGHLY recommend! I saw her presentation one Tuesday night as she spoke at First Baptist Glenarden and I was so impressed.
Tried the fast twice. Learned so much!
"Good book, but one has to be ready to make the sacrifice.  Perhaps one-income family or retired on fixed income would benefit these people.  I have started reading it, but it puts on such a ""guilt"" trip because I'm no ready to go that fast.Sara"
Enlightening and Convicting. Great read and excellent road map to financial freedom.
"Excellent book, puts things in perspective and makes you really assess spending."
Extremely good book!  You will be helped by the challenge regardless if you are a good steward or a bad steward.  It only takes 21 days.  You will examine your money habits and your relationship with money.  I found financial peace!!!
Life changing ideas and lessons......
"The design is sound:  a 21 day financial ""fast"" is a do-able and not overwhelming endeavor.  The daily chapters are practical and just long enough, with very helpful resources from the author and recognized experts and institutions.  The religious bent may not be for everyone, but the topics raised in these passages are relevant to everyone.  I have made several significant changes as a result of the program and feel the stress diminishing from the avoidance and fear in which I was stuck."
"I first heard about this book when I was asked to talk on a phone conference during the fast.  I enjoyed reading the book and writing in my journal daily.  This is a great book and an easy read.  If you're really determined to being a better steward over your finances, then give this book 100%.  Push yourself and challenge yourself during this fast.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for financial peace.I'm starting the 21 Day Financial Fast again with a group on February 15th."
This book has really helped me to analyze my spending and realize that I have to stop living in the moment and think more about my future. A great tool if you are trying to prepare for a comfortable future in a diminishing economy.
a brand new book i received in about a week or less.
"Michelle Singletary has done it again.  Lots of suggestions, reccomendations, exervises and testimonies.  A great read that yields financial results if implemented in your life."
Even if you don't agree with her religious statements tge book is still an excellent aide in getting the reader to become aware of their spending and saving habits.
Great book. Good guidance for getting on track with your finances
Love the book very helpful
"If you follow the steps they actually work! But you knew that right? Michelle Singletary uses common sense, her wit, and honesty to help lead you to a path of financial freedom. 21 days can begin to transform your financial journey forever! I know it has for me. A must read regardless of your income level."
Great read
Thank you very its a good book.
"IF you are serious about taking control of your finances, this is the perfect way to seize that control. You can participate with a group or do it alone: just do it."
The book is jammed full of smart things to do or not to do with your money.  You can download spreadsheets from Michelle's web site to help you along the way.Michelle is a very smart and religious person.  I feel a bit to much religion is spoken in this book.
"This book along with the Fast was an eye-opening experience. Of course I wasn't out of debt in 21 days but the biblical principles that Michelle touched upon related to getting your finances and affairs in order were practical even for those that may not be religious.I ended the 21 Day Financial Fast with a new insight on money, budgeting, and why it is so important to save, invest, and plan for the future!"
"Loved that is made with love to help all, have not finished yet but has drastically changed already how I manage my money"
Love the book easy read
Good book!!
This is a great book whether you even know what a budget is or have a great budget and are looking to see how you can make it even better!
The 21 Day Financial Fast was an easy read.  I mostly enjoyed the testimonials and how Michelle talked to you as if she's right next to you.  This book is worth every cent and I would recommend it to my family and friends and even strangers on the street.  The book also inspired me to do my own 21 day fast--for other issues I might have in my life.  Thanks Michelle for your being a blessing to me.
Wonderful book!!
"I have learned a lot about myself reading this book.  I am still on the Financial Fast and following the book chapter by chapter.  My only concern is not to lapse into previous bad spending when the fast is over.  Michelle's explanation of how to tackle debt is simple  idea.  One wonders why they didn't think of it.  She demonstrates how it works so clearly.You might think you don't need a book to do what you know you should when it comes to money, but I think the way Michelle puts things really helps and brings the message home very clearly.  I am not a Christian, but I am not at all put off by the Christian messages.  I think she uses them to show that the points she makes are deeply rooted in time.  Michelle's messages are strong.My only regret is that I didn't have this book 40 years ago.  Hope it is not too late for me to change.  I plan to reread this book once a year."
This plan is doable. Informative and real life applications! Ms. Singletary knows her stuff financially and religiously! Keep information coming!
Got this for a friend on the recommendation of another friend who found it very helpful.  It has great ideas.
"Michelle's' book has been one of the hardest task I have taken on in a long time. It's a life style change that I needed to make. I can finally see the light at the end of the financial tunnel I was stuck in. I have recommended this book to 6 sisters, my children, and several friends. I know I will read it again and again. God knew just what I needed, and my heart was receptive to act on the instructions  in this great book.  Beryl"
The book offers solid advice but I could do without all the out of context proof texting that accompanies it.
"So much great information! My husband and I are reading it together. Stumbled across this book  on FB, so blessed that I did!"
"If you want some sure-fire guidance on how to jump start your path to financial improvement, this is a must.  A good read and a good plan.  My plan for 21 days was (1) no shopping at Ross (my favorite) or other apparel shops; (2) no credit card charges; and (3) all home cooked meals.  I was 95% successful.  I did use the credit card for three unusual circumstances, but paid the amount the next day on my account through online bill pay.  I did no clothes shopping or purchasing.  I ate out on two occasions and one was a $3.75 sandwich at Subway."
"Prior to reading this book, I thought I had my finances in order. From the very first chapter I realized that I still have a long ways to go. But more important, it made me very aware of my responsibility to share with the young women and men in my life. I guess that is why I've purchases more books to be used as gifts. Everyone deserves the gift of financial knowledge."
After day 9 she lost me....too complicated.
Love my book! Lots of excellent and helpful info.
Loved the fast! Very eye opening and pushes the limits! Suggest to all that you meet today's! You won't forget it!
Even though this book is biblically based Michelle doesn't bash you over the head with it. She encourages you to take what you will from it. This book will not make you rich in 21 days but it will give you a foundation on which to start taking a closer look at how you throw money away without even realizing it.
This book is awesome. So glad that I read it. I am know committed to being a better steward of money for the sole purpose of positioning myself to help others.
"Michelle said it best for me hereTHIS IS JUST THE BEGINNINGI pray that you will not limit your definition of what it means to be rich. It can mean having a lot of material things, but it also, and more importantly, means learning to live with less so that you can live your life more abundantly. It means having financial peace, which is priceless.I recommend this book for anybody that is in debt, has prosperity or a poverty mentality. It is encouraging and will enable you to make some tough but life changing choices-if you let it.The book is easy to read, very practical and power packed with a wealth of knowledge and resources. It speaks volume and Echo to shatter the glass wall before you each day moving forward. This treasure map will help you to find your way as you journey into your future."
"This book was awesome and just in time for my household. I took this journey with my sister and we both learned so much; but what most, to be good stewards of what God gives us!"
Good book on how to manage your finances.
I love this book.. I will share my success story once I have completed the steps...  Love the way Michelle incorporated the bible verses. Awesome
This book helped change the way I view money. It helped me hear God clearly in reference to my finances.  Can't wait to see what this year has in store for my finances.
Nice and direct!
Fantastic short reads on topics for 21 day review.  Very useful if you are in deed doing the fast along with watching the emailed videos.
Practical applications to my daily life.  I took the challenge and have learned to embrace the additional discipline it has brought to my life. Thank you Ms. Singletary.
Great book to begin a financial fast. The author uses biblical principles to make her point.
"I choose the highest rating possible because this book offersinsight to planning and securing financial peace andfreedom from debt.All of the suggestions and forms are clear, concise and very wellformatted.The scriptures and additional sources of information areright on point.The book is a must for anyone who is serious about developing a savings planand serious about getting out of debt and I am using this book as a tool to help meunderstand better what God expects of me.L. Angelese Offer"
I have been follow Michelle Singletary in the Washington Post for years and I like her advises very much...but the book? Reading it is like reading a priest or pastor lecture! Boring and not useful.
"Lots of common sense instructions, things you know to do but don't apply. Great results and awesome change of habbits!"
Great start and guide to keeping your finances in order.  Excellent guidelines  learning how to prosper financially and maintain peace.
Good book
This is a Blessing from God! This book provides you with knowledgable ways to manage your money and also determine what is a need verse a want.
"Got it ok,"
"I love this book, her wording is just so blunt and she definitely puts me in check about where I should be in my walk with The Lord. Praise God I am almost licensed to sell Real Estate and will be definitely a better steward of the Lords money he blesses me with"
"What surprised me about this book was the layout.  It does not follow the typical financial advice book that you read through as your schedule permits.  This book is organized with a short introduction chapter followed by 21 short chapters, one for each day of the fast.  She also encourages you to keep a journal and has a journal topic/activity at the end of the day to help you really dig into yourself to examine yourself and create change.  I think it would be almost impossible to read the book, earnestly do the journal entries and not walk away with a more Godly attitude toward money.I am a Christian, and while others have rated the book low because it was written from a Christian perspective, that is exactly what I appreciate about it.  This is not just advice to teach you how to be rich in a worldly way.  It is financial advice designed and presented in a format that seeks to create change in Godly people who want to better use the resources God has blessed us with so that we become spiritually rich and financial wise.I am so thankful to have purchased this book after hearing an interview with the author on NPR.  It is helping me to create healthy financial changes in my heart and to my wallet."
"If I had realized this book was written from a Biblical perspective, I would never have ordered it.  I was expecting a book of sound financial advice, and it's probably in there, but I just can't read it in its entirety.  I like the idea of not spending anything but cash for the next 21 days, so it appealed to me.  I'm not faulting the author - I'm faulting my lack of proper investigation before purchasing.  If you're a devout Christian and need financial guidance, this is probably the book for you.  Otherwise, find another one."
"Michelle Singletary provides practical, wise counsel for anyone who wants to experience financial freedom. She gives you the tools needed to help you be a faithful steward."
It is great book not only great information but excellent Spiritual insite. I have started a small group for my excessive spending friends to begin working on a life change of better money management. We'll pleased.
"Unlike the author's regular financial column in the ""Post,"" the book was too religious-based for me. I was disappointed in the book, but I still read the author's weekly column."
There are some good points but I am not comfortable with how much of it is wrapped in religious stuff. Overall disappointing.
Very sound financial advice.
I was really looking forward to trying a fast but I can't get past all of the religion in this book. I guess I'm not the target audience but the description wasn't honest about the contents of this book!!
Great
"What a waste!  If you are looking for practical tips, go elsewhere. I thought I was getting something more than what I could think of myself.  I read her column every week and this was a shocker.  How did it even get published?"
"This book is, above all, a Christian religious text.  That fact by itself would have been ok as people could potentially read past all the religious fluff and just take the actual financial advice from the books, if only there were any.Let me sum the advice in this book up for you free of charge: Don't spend more than you make.  Don't use credit cards.  Don't use debit cards.  Make and stick to a budget.  Invest for the future.The only reason this is a book at all, as opposed to a 1-page worksheet, is that the rest of the content is all about God, bible verses, and testimonials from imaginary people.Your path to financial peace and freedom starts by not buying this book."
"Great book, view helpful!!!"
"This book relies on biblical principles and Christian faith to reach financial peace. While this might work for some people, I wish the description had been more open about the content."
"So since this has somehow become a major point of contention for those who are rating the book poorly, I will start by saying I am NOT a conservative Christian.  No, no, no, no, way.  I am a Pro-Choice, Gay Rights, left-leaning dem and I liked this book.  The principals behind this book are humanistically sensible!  She is teaching you how to get at the root of why you spend like you do and then how to make a plan of action to STOP DOING IT!  All while in the midst of the very exercise that at its conclusion can have easily saved you a $100 plus dollars in 21 days. For her the basis by which she does this is rooted in her faith and upbringing.  For you or others reading it may be as simple as the need to get up from under the debt that is “oppressing” you.  If you aren’t able to look to God for that direction and focus, would not the ability to stop and examine yourself still be of value for the period of just 21-days?Of course the point of the book in its entirety is to read it and do the journaling exercises which again I, as a woman of faith ---though not the same as the author, personally had no issue with--- but if the mere appearance of the word God is a bridge too far for you then you will be missing out on the sound financial advice that is contained within these pages."
"I enjoy reading Michelle Singletary's columns in the paper, so I was extremely disappointed with this book.  Its heavy emphasis on religion is too much for me - I am not a religious person, but I'm not an atheist either.  Also, her plan to solve all your financial problems by reducing your spending for 21 days is too much like the '21-Day Plans for Attaining Your Perfect Weight' and other plans like that which are used to sell books.  I quit reading the book after three chapters and sold it to a used-book store."
"I donot have this book, and if i do it needs to be removed for i did not buy it?"
I could have used the advice without the religious content.  I was very surprised that this book was advertised without any mention of the mixing of financial advice with her religious beliefs.
"I'm Christian. There, I said it. I do not have to write like a Christian Jehovah Witness to get the point across on every page. Spoiler: Michelle Singletary is a Baptist! How do I know this? She says so in about 80% of the book. Enough. Seriously!!! I read financial books for financial guidance. I can read the bible for spiritual guidance. On the money side, I love ""Spend Well, Live Rich"" and I just bought it for my ""keeper"" collection but ""The 21-Day Financial Fast"" did not do it for me and I stopped after chapter one. Out of curiosity, I randomly opened twenty of so pages and well... ""Baptist,"" ""Church,"" ""God"" and ""blessings"" were on every random page. Enough. If the title would have alerted somehow that it's a companion to the bible, I would not have been so turned off by it. Oh, I'm a Christian... in case I have to repeat it for this review. Here's the thing... if you are here to buy this book think twice... why not do as I did and pre-screen it from the library?  I'm sure that is what God wants you to do. I'm not trying to be mean with this review but I am giving MY honest opinion and it's supported by the other one star reviews being given."
This stuff is the truth! It cleans you out good and you feel refreshed. They help with the tight bloating feeling and they  make sure you get EVERYTHING out. you just have to find the dosage that works best for you. Originally it took 5 capsules for me to get results... after a few months nothing was happening. I increased to 6 and now I'm back in action lol .... one important fact is you must take them on a empty stomach or they will not work
"I bought this book because I thought a careful examination of my spending habits would be wise before I retire. There are some good nuggets, and it's never a bad idea to be mindful. But the overwhelming religious overtones are disappointing. I was looking for good financial guidelines, not a Sunday school class. ""You won't make it through this fast without surrendering yourself to the will of God,"" according to chapter 1. Oh really? Nice message to the humanists and atheists and realists, right out of the gate. Whether you believe in God or not, the idea the poverty is your own fault because you didn't surrender to God would come as a surprise to the billions of people on earth who are barely making it. I don't need a carrot-stick pact with an imaginary friend to be responsible with my money. Also, tithing is terrible financial advice. ""God"" doesn't need your cash. But if you can ignore the religious bs on pretty much every page, there's enough content to warrant 3 stars."
"First, yes this book is heavily christian based so if that is going to bother you dont buy it, HOWEVER, there are some sound financial tips if you can put all of that aside.  You can definitely pull some nuggets of this book if you are really struggling, however i think as a whole the book is more geared toward people 40 and up heres why.  There were whole days ""chapters"" devoted to issues that quite honestly are never going to be something I would need addressed for example, elderly parents in homes, teaching teenagers (children but the focus was on teens) about money, avoiding get rich quick schemes, for me personally even the do not cosign chapter was irrelevant for me.  I kept the journal and looking back after Day 14 my ""reflections"" got shorter and shorter, went from whole pages prior to a few sentences.  Im in my very early 30s with no parents or children and some sense lol which is why I specifically point out the chapters on cosigning and get rich quick schemes.also I would advise just using your own judgement and choosing what tips from this book you could use.  there were quite a few things that I personally didnt agree with in this book, but that doesnt mean the book is garbage.  Singletary states that taking condiments from fast food restaurants to use for later is stealing (i disagree) If you ask to take extra for example and they say yes, is it still stealing? or is it b/c you didnt ask? or is all stealing b/c u want to use it for later. She also says that God blesses people to be prosperous so they can help others. But  i know of people who are prosperous who dont help anybody, unless they are donating to charities and getting those tax write offs and i just dont know about it, it just doesnt seem to compute for me.the big one for me was HEAVILY HEAVILY emphasizing in the beginning that if you cant afford your home, move in with somebody, downgrade or get a roommate, which all make sense however she says people doing well should open their homes to family, friends, etc. heres the thing though, she used an example and called the woman selfish who said in a 7 month period, a woman had 3 relatives ask to move in and she told them no. SIngletary called her selfish and said she felt sorry for her . that means in a 7 month period there would now be 3 extra people living in this ladies house if she had said yes to them all and  there is no mention of what this woman lived in.  If this lady had a 2 bedroom, where would they sleep? Ill even give 3 bedroom, so 1 is hers, 1 for 1 person, 2 people would share the other.  She is going to work everyday but has 3 grown people living in her house with no prospects, doing nothing but job searching and now tight on space as 2 people would already be sharing a room.  i just really dont think it was fair to call this woman selfish. Now her attitude towards the relatives was one thing but i dont think not letting people live in your house in selfish. ill even give her 1 person and said she could have let one stay but all 3?? nothe tips about the college education equally outrageous and i dont agree with (sum = dont go to a college you cant afford, you dont need a brand name education but hell ALL college is expensive, so are you suppose to wait and save up for that 2. if your parents saved nothing for your college you would have had only 2 legal workign years to make and save money so what are you supposed to do postpone the one thing that  might actually get u a salary) but this review is getting too long. Overall, i think if you are struggling financially and need a good  foundation of where to start to get on track and dont mind the christian angle then this book will be of help"
"Where does you’re money go? Do you enter a grocery store to spend $5 and walk out having spent over $100? Do you find yourself living paycheck to pay check? Is your spending out of control? Try THE 21 DAY FINANCIAL FAST by Michelle Singletary. She challenges readers to slow down, spend money on only the necessities for 21 days and take an inventory of where your money is going. Each day of the journey she offers hope and encouragement as you look to asses your finances and bring them to order.She is an amazingly gifted and insightful writer. I initially thought this book would just cover stuff I already knew from other courses like Dave Ramsey’s FINANCIAL PEACE (to be sure there was plenty of overlap), but was pleasantly surprised to find a different type of depth applied to money management and individual personalities. I swear she has met half of my family, or at least their financial alter-egos. When addressing the error of being overly frugal she used the illustration that taking extra condiment packets from fast food places… I was sure she had met my great-grandfather who horded stolen McDonalds catsup like it was gold.Each day was full of good insight and was helpful at keeping up the “fast.” I applaud Michelle Singletary and her work on this book. It’s a great add to the subject of finances on my bookshelf and it is one that I highly recommend to anyone looking to get a better perspective on their relationship to money. I see it being especially helpful for engaged couples to use and discuss finances before they get married as well as young folks who have disposable income for the first time or are struggling to make ends meet.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher as part of their Reviewer program.

"This book coupled with Michelle’s teachings have changed our life and marriage for the better. We are on the same page financially. The fast helped to break the cycle of whatever dysfunction we had with our finances. It cleansed us and helped us to realign our priorities. It gave us a new mindset that allowed us to stop using credit, pay off several accounts and eliminate approximately 75% of our debt in less than one year! Fasting helped us to focus. Our family was a little upset when we said that we wouldn’t be attending the family vacation for the year, but we held fast to our goals. Michelle gives you the permission to say NO, unapologetically. For this we are grateful, and will recommend this book to anyone who will listen."
"The 21 Day Financial Fast by Michelle Singletary is financial guidance based on conservative Christian principles. There's no way to ignore that every bit of advice is intertwined with the Bible. While that's one way to approach the topic, you wouldn't realize it by looking at the back cover's description. If you don't want to be preached at about your money problems, this isn't the book for you.This book assumes you've broken one of the ten commandments and your sin is the cause of your money woes. Wow! So someone who got sick or was in an accident and lost their job has... sinned? That's not a very Christian attitude. Another issue I had was not allowing others to bless you if they so choose. So if you choose to do a 21 day fast and it falls around your birthday, no one can bring you a store-bought cake or take you to dinner? You have to decline, says Singletary. Because that's consuming. I would be a little put-off if I brought my friend a cake or flowers and she declined them because it's consuming. It's my choice to bless my friend and it's gracious to accept the blessings of others.What I did like was the book's layout. Many psychologists feel that it takes 21 days to create a new habit and I think that's what the 21 days is aiming for, since 21 days isn't any sort of a Christian time period (perhaps she should have done 40 days?). Each chapter is short and offers critical thinking and ways to question yourself and your practices and attitudes about your ""God given"" money.Disclaimer: I received a free copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for writing an honest review. I received no other compensation."
"I started reading the whole book before going into the fast. It was very difficult starting this fast, since I work all day and have zero energy to cook. So I started cooking in the morning and making quick healthy meals. With that alone I was able to save about $200. Then I stop taking the LIRR and just took the regular subway. With that I saved another $200. I made a list of groceries and stuck to the list. I saved about $100 with that. On top of that I unsubscribed to various apps and subscriptions I had been wasting money on, saving about an extra $100. The first week is tough because it takes getting into, but I’m happy I was able to save that money and put towards my car loan."
"My wife and I read this book and actually did this fast and almost within a few weeks started to see a difference. We do not make a lot of money, however we started to do this fast while my wife was pregnant and because of this book and some personal reflections my wife was able to not work for 6 months after our twins were born and we never missed paying any bills. We saved and planned thanks to this 21 day fast!!!"
"My Thoughts:  Singletary offers some commonly heard tips in The 21-Day Financial Fast.  She's been successfully sharing how to be debt free for decades and she knows what she's talking about.  To those burdened with debt, The 21-Day Financial Fast offers some tips to help jumpstart your savings account.  For those seeking to manage their monies, The 21-Day Financial Fast offers some practical tips to get a jump start on getting your financial house in order.  There is a solution for every financial problem and even those of us with little or no credit card debt can benefit from the tips shared in Singletary's book.The premise is simple, don't buy anything for 21 days.  Yep, 21 days of no shoes, no makeup, no clothes, no restaurants, nothing just the essentials.  Singletary goes so far as to suggest readers refrain from window shopping."
"I really wish this book were advertised as a religious book. There's a lot more about Christian beliefs than about money. I'm giving it two stars because the little  financial advice that is there is mostly good, although somewhat condescending and judgemental. I disagree with the author's beliefs about debt and credit, but I like the overall strategy and found the daily prompts to be thought-provoking. I'm glad I was able to read this on Kindle Unlimited because I would not have liked to spend money on it. I'm hoping to find another book about limiting spending without any preaching of religious beliefs."
"Michelle, challenges her readers in The 21-Day Financial Fast: Your Path to Financial Peace and Freedom to take 21 days and to not buy anything but what they really need. She also challenges the reader to use only cash during those 21 days. The book is split up into 21 chapters for the 21 days. Along the way, Michelle shares many financial tips that will hopefully change how you look at money in the future.I don't know about you, but I need to be challenged at times to think about sometimes what I am spending my money on. Do I truly need what I am buying?I am not currently participating in the 21 day fast, but I think it would be a hard thing to do. Not buying anything that is not needed. At one point, I thought Michelle went a little too far. She said that if during the fast, your boyfriend wants to take you out to eat, you need to say no because that is taking part of consuming. I think if you aren't choosing to spend the money, then you need to allow others to bless.I did think that this book was well laid out and think that the principles are very applicable. Truth that many Americans need to put into practice. I have to admit that there are some areas that I need to work on as well.Thank you to BookLook Bloggers for allowing me to review this book."
"I am a Dave Ramsey fan all the way, so most of what was in this book was a repeat of his ideas and plans. What really stuck with me was about the author's friend who passed away. When they went in to deal with the paperwork after her death, everything was organized and in order. She had her will, bills, life insurance policies well organized and filed, so anyone could find it and follow her system. While my husband and I live on a budget and are working to pay off all our debt, being organized is one area that I fall short in. It is funny, I was the church administrator for  7 years and kept records. I now manage my best friend's accounting since she has ALS and keep her records in shape, but doing it here at home is something that I need to get organized. If you are looking to organize your finances and get your life back, stop living paycheck to paycheck, check out this book. Now off to start organizing my disaster of a desk!"
"The 21-Day Financial Fast is a book which I received from Booksneeze in return for my honest opinion of its content. No other compensation was received or is expected. Now that that disclaimer is out of the way, on with the review!I chose this book for a couple of different reasons. Let’s start with the frivolous one first — no one else had chosen it, so I wanted to be the first!  On a more serious note, I was intrigued by the title and description.  Times are tough and I know that I have not been the best steward of late, so I had great hopes that this would be one way to correct my inattention to fiscal matters.I found her approach novel and one that I am willing to try it. She uses the Bible as her blueprint, and while some may be offended by her expressing herself based upon her beliefs, doesn't every author inject some of their personal beliefs into their writing? Even if you don't agree with her viewpoint, her financial challenges and suggestions are ones that can help you get out of debt and be more responsible with your earnings and that's what I was looking for, a plan of action."
The wealth of information in this book is priceless!  Has truly blessed me and my family.  I am sharing with everyone in my family in hopes of breaking the generational curse of debt!!!  We must position ourselves financially to be a blessing to others!I highly recommend this book!
"After reading the book, I did not find ""my type of spending habit"" but I definitely learned more than what I expected.  I also definitely think maybe if we were not living in a society that promotes spending or portrays lies and misinformation people would probably be managing their money better and save more 🤷🏾‍♂️"
Awareness and connection to the roots of my money issue were made clearer by reading . Quick read with some good challenges .
I read this book with some friends of mine. We started the new year with a financial fast and it was such an excellent read. Very through provoking. I was able to recognize some changes that I needed to make immediately.
"I found the 21 Day Financial Fast to be a valuable and easy to follow roadmap to financial stability.  By completing the ""assignments,"" the steps that you personally need to take to get your financial house in order just pop up at you...no digging necessary.  The templates that are provided for documenting a budget, etc., are also extremely valuable.  The associated videos - available at no additional cost, further drive home/reinforce the financial principles in the book.  I personally saved more than $500 during my 21 day financial fast and am still reaping the benefits of the adjustments I made.If you are living paycheck to paycheck, or conversely, if your pockets are overflowing, this book is for you.  Ms. Singletary not only leads you to prosperity, she helps you ""give back"" before and when you reach your financial goal."
This book truly did assist me in becoming a more better and frugal steward over what God has given me in finances. It opened up my eyes to things that other financial classes that i took never even touched.Thanks
"I was interested in reading this book because I use to which the author's reality show on cable television (TV ONE). She worked with families and help them with improving their financial situation. It was a good show and her religious beliefs did not over shadow the work but just a little. However, I could not complete this book. She did, however, have some good resources to use in developing a plan but was berried in all the religion book.  Although I am a spiritual person and believe some of Michelle's beliefs, this book came off  to me too preachy, judgmental, and rigid. I stop reading when I came across the chapter when she started to outline bible scriptures for each step and why you should follow the principal. When she started preaching about men spending money on their mistresses I was done. I was interested in obtaining a plan to help me improve my financial situation not be preached to.  This book can be good for over religious people who is uplifted by her style of preaching.  It depends on how you are able to take in information. This is only my opinion. Decide for your self."
The 21 day financial fast is by Michelle Singletary. She is amazing. I did the fast while reading the book. The book is a chapter a day book. It takes you on journey through the fast to show us how to gain financial peace. It helps us better understand what money is and why it is important for us to be wise with our money.  This is really the first time I've read a financial book because I wanted to change. I liked it. It was easy to read. It was easy to understand and it gave me great ideas that I can use. She gives you tools to help you succeed. At the end of every chapter is a homework assignment. I recommend not skipping over them because it reinforces why you are doing what you are doing. It helps you discover why you like to spend and how we can change.
"The whole idea is that you do not purchase anything other than necessities for 21 days. Nothing. This allows you to save money and see where you are wasting money. The idea being at the end of the fast you will have learned how to make lasting changes to your financial situation for the better.My favorite part was the idea of having both an ""Emergency Fund"" and a ""Life Happens Fund.""  The emergency fund is used for 3-6 months or more of household expenses in the case of a loss of income. The life happens fund is for when the car breaks down or the stove goes out and needs replaced and the author recommends $700-$1000 in that account. It allows you to be thoroughly prepared for both situations.I did not agree with the way the author presented the material in some cases.  There are sections where the text comes off judgmental (such as the chapter on entitlement) or other places where the author seems to be trying to make the reader feel bad in order to make a change.  I would like to believe that the author's intent was not to come off this way but it certainly changed my mood and opinion of the book.Finally, if you have read ""The Total Money Makeover"" by Dave Ramsey or other similar books you will get very little, if anything, new in this book other than the 21 day concept.  I think this concept is worth taking a look at the book and can be a helpful tool to those who have trouble controlling their spending habits or need help shedding some light on their habits.All in all it is a great concept with potential that came up short.*Note: I received a copy of this book at no charge in exchange for my honest review.*"
"Good book to read but I personally wouldn't follow some of the advice it. I liked some of the testimonies in the book which gave you a take on how the fast went for other people. I also liked the different references to scriptures. This let me know this was not only a financial fast but a fast that would draw you closer to god.Overall, this is a great book to get some tips on learning how to save your money.Received complimentary in exchange for a review.All opinions expressed here are my own."
"With the rise of easy credit, many people find themselves in over their heads when it comes to their finances. The book The 21 Day Financial Fast attempts to help people reign in their spending by giving them a daily lesson on finances and a daily assignment, both in the context of being on a financial fast -- not spending money for 21 days.The author uses Biblical principles to underlie most of her ideas.  At the same time, she incorporates a lot of common sense into her suggestions.  The main ideas are the usual ones:  set a budget and stick to it, cut out non-essential spending (after defining ""non-essential"" -- cable is not essential), get over feelings of entitlement, etc.  By going on a three week spending fast, the author hopes to re-condition the reader to break out of negative spending habits that have resulted in debt and financial problems.Each of the 21 chapters that relate to one day of the fast begins with a main point and a pledge to help focus on what negative habit or positive change will be worked on that day.  Some of the topics include ""the Salvation of Saving,"" ""Marrying Your Money"" and ""the Curse of Credit.""  There are also testimonials sprinkled throughout from people who have followed the fast and gotten their finances under control.Most of the information was pretty obvious, but for people in dire financial difficulties, I can see how following the daily guidelines set up in the book would be beneficial (although if someone really needs to be told to take their property tax amount, divide it by 12, an set aside that much per month so they can pay their taxes, they are probably beyond help!).  I did find some of her advice to be a bit questionable.  For instance, she is very big on tithing, which is fine, but she goes so far as to suggest that people go to non-profit agencies or churches for food and clothing aid, so people don't have to tap ""into your tithe to pay your expenses."" So, you may have enough money to pay your expenses, but better to get handouts so you can give your own money away?  This makes no sense, especially as advice for those who are financially challenged to begin with.Still, for people who have absolutely no idea how to control their money, this step-by-step program offers some concrete steps to take.  The back of the book includes budgeting forms and expense journals to help people keep better track of where their money is going.Disclaimer:  I received a copy of this book from Booklook Bloggers in exchange for this review."
If you want all that God has for you especially in your finances you need this book. It helps and guide you on the necessary steps to have financial peace with God.
"My daughter told me about this wonderful fast and I couldnt wait to start! For me, this is like a refresher course in money management....I really like the many references to God and the Bible....for me it has reenforced the very principals instilled in me by my parents and grandmother....Thank you Michelle for developing this concept of a financial fast....I also like that the chapters are actually short and to the point....I love journaling so the idea of keeping a journal while on the fast was one of the reasons I was attracted to the plan. I  purchased a journal and I am enjoying the daily assignments. The information is practical and based on biblical scriptures....it's easy to read and provides realistic and attainable goals."
The book is an excellent read. Now is the perfect time to participate in the fast due to the quarantine. The non essential businesses are closed which eliminates the need to be tempted.
Great book to help get you back on track with spending and does it based on biblical principles. Outstanding!
"Always trying to find ways to maybe pinch another penny, I am very open to any book that promises a new approach to saving money. Most of these book have very traditional ways of getting financially independent, paying off high rate credit card debt first, paying off mortgage early by making extra payments early in the year etc. While the messages in these books hold true, they are not really great and new revelations. This book is a little bit different, it tries to teach people that money can be saved by determining what is really essential. Cutting down on expenses can be hard, but if you realize that life essentials are really only a few items then walking past a lot of store windows without buying anything becomes easily achievable.I rate this book along the lines of the new ""minimalist lifestyle"" movement that is gaining traction in which people cut down on expenses by focusing on items they really need. What I found distracting was the tie in with Christian believes. While I do not question the power of anyone religion, Jesus in my opinion had very little to say about spending money on the large amount of commercial items that are available to us today, including online shopping. I would not have minded a chapter dedicated to showing how Christian believes support good spending habits or living according to a strict budget, after all tithing is an expense that can easily be budgeted. But the author, in my opinion, goes overboard by making constant and never-ending references to Christianity.This book is about getting people out of the routine of simply spending and the author has good advice. She recommends spending cash rather than plastic, keeping a journal of expenses. I do  both of these things and have done for years. Did it take a huge religious epiphany for me to start keeping a journal? No, I simply realized that keeping a journal had made it easier for generations of women in my family to get their money allocated in a way that allowed them to save despite scarce resources. What helped me cut down on expenses was the knowledge that superficial things, such as clothes and house and jewelry, are not what matters. Is there some tie in to my underlying religion, yes, but I certainly do not consider keeping a journal an exercise in religion.Unfortunately, I have to give this book a rather negative review because the constant litany of Christianity does this and Christianity mandates that, when really the author has good recommendations on how to focus your spending on essential items and re-evaluate your current spending to focus on what is required; both processes will allow most people to cut back on expenses and save in the long run.Disclaimer: I received a free copy of this book courtesy of booksneeze.com in exchange for an honest review.

I am reading this book for the 3rd time.  With every read I learn and grow.  It's not complicated or hard to follow.
Great book....
Thank you Michelle!  The financial fast has allowed me to look at my spending and finances in a different way.  I’ve made long-lasting changes.
"The 21 Day Financial Fast by Michelle Singletary is a book to be read in a ‘devotional style’ while doing the financial fast. The point of the fast is to stop spending more than what you need. You only will spend money on bills, tithes, groceries (needs), gasoline, etc. You are encouraged not to go out to eat, but eat the foods in your home and just go get groceries while needed. The fast overall is a good idea. It’s not to save money, it’s to help learn stewardship with your wealth.The book itself is filled with testimonies of people Ms. Singletary has helped with the fast. I think the fast itself is a good idea, and I personally enjoyed it myself and helped a lot financially. However the book isn’t necessary and I wouldn’t recommend it, because it doesn’t read help with the fast. If you do desire to read it along with the fast then borrow it, but don’t buy it.I got a free copy of this book from BookLook Bloggers, I wasn't required to write a positive review"
This book has been life changing. The fast absolutely works... thanks.
I find this book easy to follow along with the u tube backup.  It has help me in many ways.  I have just started over another 21 days. Thanks Michelle
Not much content. Read something else instead.
"While doing a Daniel Fast, I told myself I also needed to fast from my spending...this book assisted me all the way through me getting a grip on my spending.  Looking forward to completing another 21-day financial fast with my family in the near future.  Great book to share!!!"
This book will show you how to defeat debt.
"I received this book to review and I was very happy when I read the title. I never heard of the author before to be honest. I have also read Christian financial book that I have enjoyed myself. I love the The 21-Day Financial Fast itself. Taking 21 days to spending nothing but necessaries. I think is a great idea and a challenge that I recommend doing. I , myself, went through some difficult financial time and as of today my only debt is my home.When I started reading the book I was very excited to read it the minute I was hit with biblical quotes after quotes I was a bit turned off. Reading the part where you write down the 10 Commandments and compare them to your finances was a bit too much for me. Then telling your female readers to ""obey"" their husband when it came to tithe was when I decided this book was not my style.Remembered I mentioned that I never heard of the author and I was expecting her experience when she did the fast. WRONG! All I got from her style of writing was arrogance and judgement. Nothing about how this fast affected her personally but how it affected others. About not having debt, how she told this person this and that. I felt like she couldn't relate to someone that was financially struggling. Author doesn't believe in living together, believes in tithe no matter what. Can't do it, get a second job. I'm all for giving back but once you get your financial situation in order. The more you save the more you give.Her Debt Dash Plan is very similar to other plans out there. I compare it to Dave Ramsey debt snowball.I gave it two stars because I do like the idea of financially fasting, I like how she explains budgeting, and gives out other financial tips. What I couldn't get over was her I'm too good attitude and some of her views."
This book reminded me of all the unnecessary spending I do daily. This is a must read for young and old. I truly enjoyed this book and the fast. I will recommend to my family and friends.
Excellent book on how to maintain finances
"If you're looking for tough love, Michelle delivers! Don't expect to be coddled, she brings Truth to the best way to handle your finances. I've tried similar programs in the past and generally went back to my old habits before long but there is something about Michelle's openness and honesty that hits to the core. And if you are offended, its probably because she stepped into your house! Be honest, if you weren't looking for change - real change - would you even have purchased the book? There are a lot of ways to do things - God's way is always best! Thanks for stepping on my toes Michelle!"
"Luckily, I saved money by taking this book out of the library.  I really like the idea of putting myself on a financial ""fast"" and buying only things that matter and thought I would get some ideas or help from this book.  Sadly, I only got to day two before the overwhelming Christianity got to me.  I am not Christian.  I don't want to be preached to, but I want to learn how to handle my money better.  Too bad she couldn't write a book for the rest of us.  Also, to echo other reviewers, the description on the back of the book mentions nothing about it being Christian based.  A little truth in advertising please (not very Christian-like to deceive people)."
This book has changed the way I think about money and giving. It has convinced me to start to tithing again and get me my finances together so that I can be a blessing to others.
"I'm a follower of Christ, a Christian, and this is exactly what I wanted to read.  I was amazed by some of the low reviews simply because she is providing a foundation for financial freedom on Christian beliefs.  I hope more Christians who read the book will comment positively.  As a writer for The Post she must be balanced, but don't hate the good news she provides because she's a Christian.  My advice, get the book and do the work by any means necessary."
It really works if you are serious about your money and setting yourself up for financial success!!
Young adults should read this book before they earn their very first paycheck!  The lessons they learn in the pages of this book can help them on the road to financial security regardless of how little or how much money they earn.
"I was really excited about this book and bought a kindle copy for myself and my husband. I was not aware how heavily religious this book would be.This book interested me because I was interested in learning to live with less, and found that the God and Wickedness references tossed about were really distracting. The emphasis of the book seemed to be more about getting closer to god through fasting, and not actually establishing better spending habits to gain financial freedom as the cover and description of the book suggests.Overall, I am really disappointed with the book, and am struggling to make it though to the end. Not what I expected at all."
"I was really looking forward to reading this book and following the 21 Day Financial Fast.  I've followed Singletary's column in the Post for a long time and I have always really liked it.  I was expecting the book to be similar to her column, which is why I was so surprised by the book.  The advice in the book is completely based on conservative Christian values.On Day 2 the focus is to identify which of the Ten Commandments you have broken that have left you broke.Day 4 is an entire chapter devoted to tithing.  And her advice in this chapter is where she lost me.  Her advice on how to agree with your spouse on tithing (if one does not want to tithe and the other does), is that the wife should ""submit to his leadship"" and go with her husband's wishes.  But for the opposite, if the wife wants to tithe and the husband does not, she says that the wife should ""Make an appeal for tithing without becoming disrespectful of belligerent.  Do what you can to make your case but don't go against his wishes.  You could tithe off the amount of money allocated in your budget for your own personal use.""I really tried to stick with this book, even though from the start is was overwhelmingly Christian focused.  I thought that I could separate out the biblical references and conservative ideology and apply the financial principles to my situation.  But Singletary has mixed them together so thoroughly that it is clear she feels you can only be financially successful if you follow her belief system.There should have been mention of these conservative Christian views in the description of the book.  On the entire back cover description there is not a single mention of God or religion, which is particularly deceptive since there is not a single page in the whole book that does not have a bible verse or reference to ""God given"" money/wealth."
"I purchased this book after see Michelle Singletary on a special financial segment of ABC news.  I was inspired by her enthusiasm to get people out of debt, and her seemingly impressive knowledge about getting finances in order.After reading only a few chapters, I realized that this book would be difficult to digest because I disagreed with some key principles.  She inextricably links managing personal finances with proselytizing Christian ideals, and makes no mention of other cultural exceptions.  In some cases, she very much crosses the line into outright judgment, admonishing couples who choose to live together before marriage, and correlates this to being ""broke"".Also, the entire chapter devoted to ""tithing"" - which is giving a specific amount of your income to your church every paycheck - really threw me.  Ms. Singletary implores the reader to donate 10% of gross - not net - income to the church, explaining that the money you earn belongs to God, and giving back is an extension of faith.  Got that part - but then goes on to explain to how to navigate an argument one might have with their spouse over tithing.  She instructs that the woman should strive to make a case (maybe a powerpoint?), but ultimately must stand down to the whatever the male in the relationship decides to avoid conflict.  I don't even need to mention same-sex couples (over a million in the US today), working women who earn MORE than male counterparts, other organizations besides churches that are deserved of money, and PERSONAL religious (and non-religious!) choices, to know that this chapter just doesn't work for a lot of us in 2013. It's just much too specific.With these concerns in mind, I will still embark on a ""21 day spending diet"", if only to gain deeper insight to how and where I spend my money, where I could cut back, and as an incentive to keep better records.  I thank Ms. Singletary for the idea, but I will most likely execute it sans her instructions."
Basically this is a bible study course with some financial comments thrown in for good measure.
Totally a waste of money and time .Not at all as advertised as being helpful . I was terribly disappointed  in this nonsense . She's right not to be too concerned with her finances being out of whack because those of us who have been foolish enough to buy this book have insured her income. I've requested a refund as this was a joke !!!!!! Reviews seem to have been padded severely .
I no longer get the paper so I missed her column very much and she is a favorite of mine so having a book written by her was special for me. Her advice is on point.
"I struggled to get through this book. There is a lot of good advice peppered throughout, but to get to it, you have slog through passages where, as an example, a female author in the 21st century honestly advises wives to “submit” to their husbands on disputes over tithing. Too fundamental Christian to appeal to a wide audience."
I had it on my kindle and then it disappeared can't find it  in my archives.
"I gave this book out as gifts to over ten people in the UK. My family, friends, church members are blessed by this book. I recommend anyone who want to get their money straight, in control & want to know what The Source -The Lord have to say about money and we should use it wisely to get this book."
Informative book. Good content a thinking tool.
"I loved this book and guide. I've been having so much financial difficulties that I was at my wits end. I felt in my spirit to do a fast in regards to my finances and somehow I cam across this book online. I feel like God has used Michelle Singletary's book as a resource to help me get back on track because I've been praying non stop!This fast is challenging, convicting but yet freeing. I've done this fast not once but three times, each new month. Michelle teaches you to have financial peace through God's way and the scripture references help you to stay motivated, on track and to not falter. This fast has given me a whole new perspectiveon how I deal with my finances and the way I should go about them in the way that is pleasing to God. I highly recommend any Christian, or anyone to try this fast if you are looking to better handle your finances."
"Ich habe mittlerweile mein zweites ""Geldfasten"" hinter mir und bin immer noch begeistert von diesem Buch.Das Prinzip ist einfach: 21 Tage lang wird auf jede unnötige Ausgabe verzichtet, lediglich für wichtige Dinge wie Lebensmittel, Miete/Hypothekenrate, Benzin/ÖPNV-Ticket für die Fahrt zum Job darf Geld ausgegeben werden. Gestrichen sind Ausgaben z.B. für Kinobesuche, Essen gehen, Friseurbesuche, etc. sowie ""Plastikgeld"". Jeder Tag wird mit einem Bibelzitat eingeleitet und steht unter einem anderen Motto, z.B. Geld in der Partnerschaft, Schulden, Budget, etc.Ich habe wertvolle Erkenntnisse und Einsichten gewinnen können - und vor allem festgestellt, wie viele Dinge ich wirklich besitze (und ohne das Fasten wohl nie benutzt hätte).Da das Buch komplett auf der Bibel und christlichen Lehren aufbaut, ist es für Menschen, die mit diesen Konzepten nichts anfangen können, denke ich, allerdings nicht geeignet."
I borrowed this book from the local library and loved it so much that I decided to buy a Kindle Copy. Great job Michelle you put in the Biblical principles with what we do everyday into one book.
Amazing book.  Not finished so far but a different way to look at a budget.  Will be exciting to see if this makes a difference for me.
I love it and on point
"Bought the book for my daughters who are young adults and thought they might find it beneficial as they start their adult lives.  I must say I was rather shocked and surprised to see how much reference to God was in the book--something I had not expected.  Looking at the bio of the author there was nothing to indicate that there would be a religious slant to the book.  Although I am not offended by all the references and I am able to take away some of the important tips, I personally would probably not have purchased the book had I known there was so much religious overture in the book hence I would hesitate to recommend the book."
"I love how this Bible is written in today’s language. Typically I read in the NIV and reference this one if there’s anything I’m uncertain of, and a lot of times I’ll just keep reading in The Message for a while before I go back to my place in the NIV. I feel like this version gets a lot of flack, but it’s really an awesome, helpful tool if you want to understand the words and not just read them. (Extra learning opportunities in the Joyce Meyer Everyday Life Bible!)The actual book seems to be pretty solid. I love the cross on the front, it seems bound well, the imitation leather is nice, font size is perfectly readable even without my glasses, and the pages are a decent thickness. It’s not the red letter version, which is fine by me as I like the way highlighters show up better on black font. Speaking of highlighting, you can slightly see it through the page, but only if it is pressed against the rest of the book firmly."
"Love that the OT is now included.  Already had the original Message but originally it was only the NT.  The faux leather cover feels & looks great & I can read this on a hectic or tiring or even a headachy day when I would be strongly tempted to put off reading for tomorrow & go to bed.  It reads so much like a novel w/ it's everyday wording & paragraphs & not like numbered verses w/ phrases & wording of days gone by that it's easy to get caught up in reading it.  The plain up to date phrases & wording are even more what you'd hear in everday talk than in The NLV.  It's like light reading, but w/ the added effect of bringing the Bible stories & prophesies into a new perspective when put in normal language so it makes me see things from a new angle than when I read the age old well known verses in my traditional Bibles.  It broadens my thinking into seeing more of the whole picture instead of just the overview.  It's a total delight to read.  I've never liked Psalms til I read some of it in this version, & now I can't wait to read more. It's the perfect Bible for young people to get them reading God's word & liking it. It would be a great gift for anyone new to the Bible or Christian living, as well as any Christian.  I haven't replaced my other Bible & have no intention of it, but I do find myself eagerly comparing the two often & it is helping me to not read over well known verses in the same way as a person driving down a well known street in auto pilot w/o really ""seeing"" or paying attn because it's so well known.  Puts a freshness into age old verses that's eye opening.  When comparing to other versions, it is keeping w/ the meaning of older versions, but I had my doubts the 1st time I ever picked up & read parts of The Message some yrs ago.  I did a lot of translation comparisons to prove The Message was not holding to the original Bible meanings, but it has proven itself to be on track in every instance.  It's like David & Paul & all the rest of the Bible characters are just sitting across the table telling me what they wrote the same way the person next door & my own family talks.  It's absolutely wonderful & the Bible I reach for when I'm too tired or short on time or have a bad headache but don't want to set aside my time in God's word for tomorrow.  It's made me less of a procrastinator in reaching for a Bible when reaching for a Bible isn't what I really want to do sometimes.  It also helps in familiarizing myself w/ the Bible in such ordinary terms that I believe the more I read this version that it will become 2nd nature to talk to others about what's in the Bible w/o thinking about how to phrase something or what to say because it's so natural.  That was a kind of surprise too because I wasn't one of those people that you hear about that say they don't understand the KJV.  I love this version for many reasons.  It has a place in any Christian's life & especially non-Christians interested in learning about Christianity & in getting young people interested in their Bible."
"I am so disappointed!  I love Eugene Peterson's tanslation and bought this, even put tabs in it to make finding Bible books easier.  And then I got to the end of Romans and the next pages are Ephesians 4 -- missing I and II Corinthians and Galatians.  Is this why it's so cheap?!!  Lousy job of quality control.  Mr. Peterson would be so disappointed.  I want my money back!"
"From what I have read, I would call this an interpretation rather than a translation, at least in parts.For example, In the Sermon on the Mount, when Jesus talks about removing the beam in your own eye before removing the splinter in another's eye. But the author changes it completely. Instead, he says: ""It’s easy to see a smudge on your neighbor’s face and be oblivious to the ugly sneer on your own. Do you have the nerve to say, ‘Let me wash your face for you,’ when your own face is distorted by contempt?"". Well, that's a fine analogy to be sure, but it's also a different analogy entirely. The Beam and the Splinter can mean many, many character flaws, not just the outward manifestation of a sneer. So in that sense he severely limits the analogy. I guess what bothers me is that the author apparently decided he could do a better analogy that Jesus.The other issue I have is the authors use of idioms that change the meaning and won't last the test of time. For example, the says ""“You’re blessed when you’re at the end of your rope"" instead of “Blessed are the poor in spirit"".This feels more like a vanity project then a literary interpretation for a modern audience."
It's a nice bible that reads like a story more than the Word of God.  An offering of larger print would have been a plus for these old eyes.
As I was reading I saw that the author removed certain verses against the Bible and as a Christian that is anti biblical so that’s the reason it’s rating is one star
"I purchased The Message Bible & flipped it open to Micah chapter 3 & was skimming through the verses, and I can’t get over these two words getting placed together. There is no way to read it without taking the Lord’s name in vain. I understand it’s not meant that way, but another word or wording it different would have made it better."
"This book, while is ok just to read as a book of someones comments on the ""Inspired words of God"" , It is not a replacement for reading the Bible.  I found it differs on some very important facts.  If I had not had it too long, I would have returned."
"This is just the text, no commentary from Eugene like in other editions.Upon opening the box, I was initially disappointed it wasn't size of regular book (I'm 72 yrs old).But that all changed drastically.  I like how light it is and how comfortably it rests in my hands every night as I read and ponder from my easy chair.I can't get over how pleasant the Imitation Leather feels in my hands- it's warm and soft.  I wasn't prepared for this pleasant sensation.  I've read the Bible every night since age 9 but never had reason to enjoy the actual feel of the Bible.  My Bibles were always hardback books.  But suddenly, though, at age 72.  It's like NavPress is making reading the Bible as welcoming as they possibly can - thank you NavPress."
"If you were like me, wanting a book that translated the Bible then do NOT buy this one! It is not the word of God! It is not a translation of the Bible as stated! The verses in this book hardly match with the Bibles meaning. It is widely taken out of context. And It is extremely pagan/worldly. There are satanic verses even “As above so below”???Please do not buy this, and inform others who are interested in it!!! This is and UNholy book!"
"Nice quality build, but Im finally realizing the paraphrasing of the topic is just too far off of proper meaning.  So, I won't be distributing this version anymore.  Bringing confusion to God's word is a No-No."
Awesome version of the Bible. I love having this bible open side by side with other versions. The language is contemporary and breaks down passages that are hard to understand in such a simple way! I absolutely love it. It’s a great bible for someone just getting into the word
"I was so excited to get this Bible... until I opened it.  Although the way it's written is very contemporary I was beyond disappointed that the numbers for the verses are printed in light gray, and they're lumped together by paragraphs, rather than each verse being numbered individually.  I also should've checked first, before ordering it with my Amazon Prime, to see if it offered free returns.  It didn't.  So it cost me $6 to open it, be dissatisfied, box it back up and return it (all in less than ten minutes).  That just added insult to injury.  I REALLY wanted to love this bible."
"Found this bible locally but didn't want to pay the price they were asking. Found it on Amazon for half the cost. Great copy of The Message. Started reading last night. One thing I noticed about a lot of the books when I was looking locally was how thin the pages were and how much of the print I could see from the back of the page. Made it difficult to read and was distracting. This edition of the book has some of the ""bleed"" through but it is very minimal compared to other prints. That is why I wanted this specific book. Very happy with the purchase."
Perfect size! This will be used as a study guide along with our King James Version and other versions as well. This can be used as a good tool to help reach younger kids and youth in more of today’s modern language. It’s always wise to check and recheck any version with what you know to be the truest version of The Word if God.

   I love the texture/feel. Very smooth.I have owned many bibles, and handled more,.. this feels the best of any.Smallish font,  but helps me slow down. Well organized."
"At the outset I should say that, while spiritual practice is an important part of my life, and I am open to the wisdom offered by the Bible, I am not a Christian. I bought The Message after hearing a passage from Romans read at an interfaith retreat; the use of vernacular language was a breath of fresh air. On returning home, I ordered a copy, and have enjoyed dipping into it at random, as well as reading specific, familiar passages. The clarity and directness of contemporary language used in The Message only adds to the storytelling power inherent in the Bible without sacrificing deeper meaning and the beauty of metaphor. Had I had access to this rendering when my daughter was a child, I surely would have read to her from it!"
"I was excited to give this as a gift, until I discovered that the print is so tiny, the person it was intended for would need a magnifying glass to read it!  I returned it for a Large Print edition, which is excellent."
"This is such a great buy. I'd been eyeing a slim-line Message translation for three times the price, and decided to try this one out because it was such a great price. It is awesome. I can read it easily (the type is clear and dark and the backside print doesn't show through) and it is small enough to tuck in my purse or tote without a ton of weight or bulk. I love it!"
"Such a Beautiful Bible, printing of scriptures are clear and beautifully printed, leather cover is so beautiful, I love the wording of the message Bible. Light weight is what I was looking for to read 📖 in other places. The reviews were perfect I glad when it was delivered. Can't put it down."
The original copy sent to me had a torn page marker ribbon. Amazon replaced it within two days and the replacement seems to be perfect. I also noticed that The tag on the replacement says “new item.” The tag on the original one did not state this. See photos.
I love this Bible!  Getting to know the scripture in a new way.  Often refer back to my NIV but fun to compare.  Quality wise this looks and feels like a great product.  Cover feels thick and durable but soft.  Pages are thin but I use a regular ink pen to scribble a million thoughts each day and they just barely show through on the other side.
"This is a really nice looking bible that seems to hold up reasonably well.The Message translation is great, as it is at about a 4th grade reading level, so more understandable.  It is a paraphrase, meaning that Peterson has put a lot of his own interpretation into the translation, as opposed to something like the NRSV which is more literal from the original texts."
Great message clear & accurate to NIV but the one I bought has small print & I have vision issues. Using a magnifying glass. Think BIGGER unless you have young eyes. I’m 74.
"Great Bible translation. I enjoy reading this version, it gives another outlook of the scriptures. My Bible arrived early with no issues whatsoever. Although I thought I was ordering a large print Bible, but it's not too small."
"I love the fake leather, it really makes it feel special and important, because it is! I got this for a friend who struggles to understand ESC and other versions. The contemporary language has given her knew confidence in understanding the Word."
"I really the size and weight, and the feel of this Bible; easy to carry. The Message translation bring the words to life!I was unsure about the size of the text, but it’s not difficult to see/read at all."
Love this translation had an error in revelation pages missing called Distributor in Denver had another one within a week no problem
"I like the value and quality of the item and received it on time. I bought as a friendship gift for a friend and I am sure she will like it. It really follows the Bible, however in contemporary language. Very good reading, attractive cover and durability. I have purchased several of the ""The Message"" authored by Eugene H. Peterson for family members and friends. A must buy!!"
"This has to be the worst bible I've ever seen! It's not a translation, it's a bizarre commentary and it's way off! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!"
I am really enjoying this version. It is making the Old Testament really easy to read. I'm reading it straight through and am almost at Leviticus! Have never done that before. Thank you!
"Great quality! Was looking for a hard copy Bible that I could highlight and write notes on during my devotionals. Love this contemporary translation from Eugene. Can’t beat the price, most bibles go for 2 or 3x more. Highly recommended!"
"The print is way too small, even with glasses. Bought it for my sister. Will have to give it to some one younger"
Makes a great gift to share the gospel in a different translation with friends family and people that you meet.
"This is so good for those hard to understand passages.  The only con is that each verse is not individually numbered. The size is perfect for a large purse, and the cover is sturdy."
I love this Bible so much I bought it for my daughter and daughter-in-law as well. It’s a great way to read the Bible through and enjoy the reading. It is not a study Bible however. But I wanted  to read God‘s word that had an easy flow to it. This Bible is perfect for that.
"I have a Message Bible of my own and love it. It was a must have for a family member for Christmas. The only con was that I kind of thought the Bible would have been bigger. It was a little smaller than expected but, it's a Bible so, it's perfect regardless."
This makes the Bible so easy to understand and really opens up the scriptures to a fuller appreciation and application of The Message.  I also liked the soft leather-like cover.  Highly recommend it.
Beautiful Bible. High quality and lovely. Very small print however so if they’re older maybe get one with a little larger print or the kindle version.
This is not the Holy Bible. Many verses don't line up!!!! Trash
"Type was way too small. I don't usually purchase large print, but this extremely small"
I am so happy I bought this Daily Confession book. My spirit is lifted and my Faith is growing each day.I am so excited for the growth in my life and opportunities before me. My wait is over! Today is my appointed time.Get the book and you'll be glad you did.
Makes reading the word easier to understand
I wanted a non traditional summary of the Bible for research purposes. This is well made and great price. The words are small though make sure and get your reading glasses out.
I love this Bible. It is written so even young kids could read it and be able to understand it. I would give it 10 stars if possible. I recommend everyone purchase this Bible. It would be read instead of sitting on a shelf collecting dust BC you can't understand the others. Best gift I ever bought for myself
I love the word and sometimes it’s hard to understand reading other versions. This a wonderful book. I like it so much I ordered a second one right away for my friend after receiving mine.
"Well made, but some difficulty reading passage numbers. Very light."
The book is great.  THE print size is way to small. Extra small.  They had a good product but drop the ball with such a small letter print.
Surprisingly high quality for the price but is missing a concordance.  I didn't realize how much I use it and I always just thought it came standard so I notice the absence but this is a really nice quality publishing. Nice leather cover and good paper and print size.
"Print was smaller than expected, need reading glasses."
One of the best translations I have come across
cant go wrong with this Bible. It really is a good buy.
Great for beginners in learning the word.
Easy to understand. Written in today's language. I definitely would recommend.
"this is a great travel sized book. Font is a bit small, but ok."
This is an excellent edition to my Bible Library.  Having different translations helps alot when doing Bible studies.  Also it's easy to understand and great readability in comparison to other translations.
This version has helped me get back into reading and I find myself often cross referencing with more strict translations at points of interest. Points of interest that I used to struggle to find when only reading from traditional translations.
I love this bible for when I want to sit and read the Great stories! Highly Recommend this Bible!
The Message puts the Bible in easy to understand terms while keeping the integrity of the original. A wonderful find!
"I really enjoy reading this Bible, except for the print being a little bit too small."
Got this for my fiancé who wanted to finally read the Word of God:) he loves it and it’s so easy for him to read. Great for Bible study bc of the easy translation. Also great to study alongside other translations
"I was disappointed.  It is not what I thought it would be.  I thought it would be a good study Bible, but the print is so small and I just don't know how to use it."
I love reading this translation!  This is not a paraphrase but translated into our modern way of speaking. I read much more of the Bible with this book readily available.
"This is a very nice Bible. I bought it for my daughter, and she lives the plain English it is written in."
"I love this Bible. It's small enough to fit in my purse, it's a soft leather-like cover, not paper which is damaged easily. I would buy this Bible 100 more times. I love it."
Greatest story ever told!
This is a wonderful translation.  The binding and quality are very good.  But the print is very small.  Don't expect to be able to read it unless you have 20/20 vision or better!
this was a gift.  easy for everyone to read and follow along for
Always wanted to read the bible but hated the wording.  This reads just like we talk everyday. I'm grateful that someone took the time to do this.
Well made Bible. We found it is good for kids to understand. I wouldn't base doctrinal studies on the Message version but it is very helpful getting the basic message in an easy to understand language.
"Good bible, the best to give away to those who appreciate a modern translation that uses current language."
I decided to read the Bible from start to finish for the first time in my life before I “study” the Bible!  I just don’t have time to look up all these words I don’t understand.  This is the perfect way to read it and understand the main picture in my head.
I am looking forward to reading this.  Making comparisons to see translations
Love the cover. Very happy with thus Bible. It's a must have.
Easy to read
EASY TO READ ALL AROUND GREAT VERSION
the Modern language is great for both the new believer and the seasoned believer as well!
I liked that it arrived as promised. It looks much nicer than I expected. The print is not too small -which was my concern- and is very crisp. It handles very well. I'm very glad I purchased this book.
A wish the print was larger
"Bought two, one for a friend, one for myself. Absolutely love it. The Bible is today’s language. Easy to read, easy to understand. My friend loves it as well."
Easy to read and understand.
"My grandkids are 11 and 12 and they are enjoying reading the Bible through this interpretation.  It's understandable for the most part, for children of this age."
I enjoy this biblical perspective.
Nice looking bible. It’s aesthetically pleasing.
I am so happy with it totally readable and easy to understand.
It’s so easy to understand and I can’t put it down! It’s like a story book....it is but it doesn’t seem like a Bible
This Bible is so easy to understand! I love reading it. This is a gift and she can’t wait to get it!
A wonderful little Bible the only thing that I didn't like about it is it doesn't have the Scriptures individually listed there listed in groups which is not what I expected
our pastor suggested ordering this version and it is awesome!! great price for a great bible!
It was terribly expensive and was not at all what I thought it would be given the hype in the add.
For the price you can't beat it. It has chapter and section titles and verse numbers. It's easy to find things and it feels like a nice Bible.
Purchased as a gift.  I'm very pleased.
Wonderful .. Love it🙏🏾❤️
It’s what was advertised
Great bible- love this version
"When I got it, I was a little concerned with the size. It was very small so I thought it was going to be just a couple books of the Bible. I was very pleasantly surprised to find it was the WHOLE Bible! And, the text size is PERFECT! I’m so happy with this purchase!!"
I like how easy it is to understand. When i compare it other translations i can figure out just what was trying to be conveyed. I also like the leatherbpund cover cover which majes for easy maintenance and care.
Love this bible! He really does put it in a way that anyone can relate to. The bible itself had a beautiful and durable leather cover.  The print is easy to read!
I’m pleased with this bible.
This is a really easy read Bible give it as a gift my friend said it's the best gift she's ever had
"Great version of the scripture , adds to your understanding of God. . Very important It is a translation not a paraphrase . Helps make the living word more alive . Makes a great gift"
This makes the Bible come alive to me in a fresh way. I also love the leather-like binding and cover. Would recommend
I love the book and how easy it is to read.  It has helped guide me in understanding older version of the Bible.  Will be buying it as gifts for people
Great for new Christians!
I was impressed with how well this was made & the price was great!!
Added tiny collectionThanks
Eugene Peterson did a great job of translating this Bible in everyday English.
My wife just finished reading this book.  She liked it.
Good for reference
"I really love The Message Bible, it is so much easier to read, while keeping the same truth with every scripture."
"Print super small, hard to read"
This is an awesome bible especially for the price. The cover feels like real leather. Definitely WORTH the buy in my opinion.
It’s a great study Bible.
"Good bible, good value"
It’s helping my husband with his relationship with Jesus
"Besides the ""modern"" interpretation, the soft leather cover enables the best management of finding pages that have I haave experienced with all my bibles."
A great gift for my Sister!
I love this bibe! I have others but this one is easily comprehended  I bought mre for family gifts.

Love the Bible. The conversation format makes it much easier to read and study.
they like the book a lot
"Love the color, lightweight, and it’s not bulky...which I find a plus. If you’re looking for a straight forward translation of the Bible, look no further."
I like the translation a lot. The binding and paper quality are nice enough to make a good gift.
Great book. A+++
The print is small so get out your reading glasses.
"I like the Bible overall, but the text is to small, you can barely see the number of the verses so it is almost impossible to follow along with someone when they ask you to go to a certain chapter and verse."
"I really like this Bible, it also assist me when preparing for Bible study."
It feels great to have this Bible back in my hands. I originally had the hardcover 2007 version of the Bible but it got ruined so I've been looking for a replacement for cheep. So happy I was able to get this Bible for $12!
I was pretty surprised with the quality of the product. I feared it would be cheap because the price was so good. I was surprised to see it did not lack quality
Amazing!!! My favorite Bible ever.
I am happy with my Bible it's not heavy perfect size for me. It is easy to read specially to my small children.
Love it
Love it
Makes the scriptures easy to understand.
I love this Bible but I do use mine in tandem with my KJV
Love this version
"I'm very happy with the size of this Bible; it's very light and portable.  The leather-look looks great.  Pages are not too thin; not see-through, not easily wrinkled.  The font size is just fine.  This was a great choice."
"I'm enjoying reading this bible but I'm glad it was for me and not a gift. As you can see by the picture, the bookmark was ripped and taped together. The rest of it is in good shape but I'm a little disappointed with that."
I purchased 10! This is one of the simplest Bibles to read and very easy to understanding in layman's terms
Awesome transaction! Item was exactly as described! Thank you!
Perfect!
"I really like this, if you have a hard time with a regular Bible this is definitely for you"
Excellent product
These bibles were purchased for a youth Sunday School class. They are a nice size and easy for a 9 yr old to read.
It met my expectations.
Print small
I love message bible available at this affordable rate. :) Thank you:)
Wonderful!
"love this bible, the size is great the leather is nice"
"been reading it since I bought it, love it"

King James Version is hard to grasp for new believers in Christ. But this version in contemporary is very easy to understand.
absolutely love it!  in great shape and pricing was fab
Great!
I like this version of the message much better than my previous message bible purchase. I enjoy the clsssic text format and the font size and overall feel are great.
great fast
Very nice for the price paid.
"The pages are very thin. Other than that, it's a great read."
This bible is easy and enjoyable reading.
Easy to read
My husband has been wanting this version for a while. He uses it everyday..
"Perfect Bible, the cover feels nice, no complaints!"
Great bible and easy to read.
Book came as expected and I highly recommend it. Great for anyone esp. someone just learning the Bible.
Love it! Very easy to understand
"I love the color, and there’s is great spacing on each page. Easy to see and read!"
love
I like the lightweight Bible but I need it big print
"Lovely look and feel.,.small print"
I do not like the fact that the verses are grouped together. Because of the extremely pale color of the numbers it is very difficult to find the verses at all. Not sure if I'm comfortable with the changes
Very nice!  Great price!
"I would have loved a larger print, otherwise I’m very satisfied."
"reading at home, easy to understand."
"So easy to read and understand, it was reccomended to me"
Great Bible
very informative. easy to read.
"Great! A little larger than I like in size, but great!"
"I have various Bible translations and so far NIV has been my go to version. While this translation seems geared to the millenials, I feel its good for everyone since it makes reading the bible way more fun. You can almost read it like  story book. Very nicely made as well. Great value for money!"
Excellent gift Bible in plain english translation.
Very Pleased !!
"It's good in that it helps to understand some things more clearly, but he uses language is some places that doesn't seem appropriate to me to be used in God's Holy Word."
"This is not a real bible -- and far, far from it. I'll give just one example -- the Lord's Prayer according to this pretense of a bible uses the phrase ""as above, so below""!  This is a common phrase used by witches and satanic rock and roll bands. The phrase doesn’t mean anything to 99% of the populous (and even more Christians). All systems of magic are claimed to function by this formula. The universe is the same as God, God is the same as man, etc. It is a TWISTING of scripture.The best bible -- unless you can handle the 17th century English of the King James -- is the Modern English Version (MEV). Besides having translators that are believers in Christ Jesus, another HUGE consideration is what manuscripts were being translated. The MEV and the KJV had Believers who had good reasons to use the manuscripts they used. They certain had access to others. And since the KJV was translated, hundreds of other English translations have flooded the market -- (it IS the best-selling book of all time, at least until recently) -- which use CORRUPTED manuscripts and all-too-often some or all of the translators and/or editors are non-believers."
"The one thing you are not to do is take verses out, add or change the Bible. This is distorted. The new language version of the Lord's Prayer is absolute garbage.  Get an ESV study Bible. It explains things quite well. Stick with the Bible, not some knock off."
Please stop calling this a bible.
I thought I loved studying the Word of God. That was until I purchased the Message Bible. This version is so Great I bought two more copies for family members... Awesome... Amen...
Product was perfect and came in a timely manner.
Excellent!
Love it
This is a gift and it is a beautiful bible
"Very nicely done.  Have wanted this translation for some time.  This is just perfect.  Lightweight, compact, but still readable for older eyes."
Have used this translation of the Bible for years now.  Easy to read and understand!  Leather look is very nice too!  Leather gives it a masculine look.
I gave the Bible as a gift and the person I gave it to really liked it. I was very pleased.
Absolutely love the book. Thank you to whomever sent it and made important notes in it. May God continue to bless you.  Best money spent.
Great gift for my son
I love product and just as promised.
I LOVE THIS BIBLE

"My teen wanted this Bible as it is the one her youth Pastor often uses . Much easier to understand , therefore much more enjoyable for anyone to read : )"
Very very good quality! more than I had expected. I ordered another one as a gift for my friend today.
Nice to be able to read passages in everyday speech for better understanding.
"I love this little bible, easy to understand"
"Just wasn’t what I was looking for, doesn’t mean it’s not good."
Bought for a gift. Quality. Looks good. Nice size. Fast shipping.
The Bible was well received.
"Good quality, the cover material it’s perfect and the content as well. I’m pretty happy with the product, I gave as a present and it was a success."
The Message version of the Bible is the perfect interpretation for anyone desiring a deeper understanding of the scripture.
Good book but was advertised as large print which I found not to be true.
Love this translation!

Awesome service and description was very accurate
"Got it for the wife at her behest.  Other online sources say clearly this is not a scholarly translation but she loves it because it gives her a different perspective. If you are going to theology school, then you definitely do not want to be seen lugging this around."
"Can I give this translation zero stars? This is one of the worst translations out there. If you are a true Christian don't EVER buy. In my opinion all new age translations are very wrong, as well as this one in particular. There are many videos and blogs that you can check aboyt comparison and see that 'Message' is not a Bible at all."
"I used to be the girl who would blow up social media with posts that promoted diet culture, make countdown to summer-body posts, and who posted countless before and after photos, seeking “likes” for achieving a smaller body. I was laser focused on seeing the number on her scale go down. For years, I treated my body like a project- exercising for the goal of a dramatic before and after photo,  shaming myself for not getting ""results,"" obsessing and restricting only to later binge,  self- sabotage, completely lose control, ALWAYS thinking my body was bad and needed to be fixed. Food and body image and the scale were my ""little g gods."" I hate to admit it but I spent more time in my day thinking about what I could eat or should eat or might eat than about anything else in my life, including my family and friends. I kept my eyes fixed on my own body and all the many ways I felt I had to improve it.Jess Connolly's book Breaking Free From Body Shame has helped me understand God’s original design for me and for my body.I was made WELL,  created GOOD by a Father who loves and delights in His daughter. The purpose of my body is not to GET cut quads or 6 pack abs,  but to BE His hands and feet. My body is not a project.I no longer feel like I used to- like my body is bad, like my body needs fixing, like my body isn’t “summer ready,” like the scale matters even a little bit, like smaller is better.I was wrong. Man looks at the outward appearance but God looks at the heart. God looks at the heart. God looks at the heart.And this body? It’s God’s home. I will not shame it, rate it, discount it, forget it, misuse it, curse it or worship it ever again. I pray you don’t either. We don’t do that anymore."
"I’m a 47 year old mother of 14.  I have tried every diet  out there, I regularly exercise, eat well, and take my vitamins.  I read my Bible everyday.  And until this book I shamed myself everyday for my body shape/size.  NO MORE!  I tossed the scale and while I will continue to eat well/exercise and take my vitamins I will never talk to myself that way again!  I am made in the image of God and my body is good!  If you have struggled like I have or know someone who has/is struggling please pick up a copy of this book."
"Listen, I wasn’t looking for this book. I honestly didn’t even realize I wasn’t free from body shame. I knew that I would pick and prod at my body & had a tendency to see my body as “a work in progress” but I didn’t realize how stuck I still was. I didn’t realize how not free I was until I read chapter one. Jess has a gift of speaking life in a way that feels gentle but convicting. This book opened my eyes to the hurt I had experienced that I didn’t know still affected me. It walked me through practical ways to break free and then live free. The format and read of the book is sweet and gentle - sprinkled with truth, you’ll not feel punched in the gut, more so you’ll feel a hug of support. If you’re on the fence on whether you need this book or not, hear this: if you have a body, this book is for you. Amen, the end. Happy reading!"
"Jess Connolly beautifully addresses the body image issues faced by nearly every woman in today’s society by reminding us that God has already named our bodies as good. Through scripture and love, she calls each of us to reconsider the negativity with which we treat our bodies. Jess’ writing is easy to read and relatable, which I think is especially important when writing on a subject like body image. I look forward to sharing the lessons from this book with my daughter as she grows, to help keep her rooted in the truth that God designed her body to be good. I cannot recommend this book highly enough to anyone who has struggled with body image or even walked through an eating disorder."
"I don’t write many reviews (mostly because I’m forgetful), but after reading Breaking Free From Body Shame (audio while reading the printed copy with highlighter and pen in hand!), I had to take a moment to shout from the rooftops, “YES and AMEN, thank you Lord, for bringing us Jess to share and spread this message!”Ladies (and gentlemen), your body is a GOOD body, as it is, where it’s at, in whatever condition. Let Jess walk you through the process towards freedom and throwing off the shame that has so quickly engrossed our minds, hearts and spirits. I have lived a life carrying so much shame over my body and how I’ve failed it or it has failed me, how the world will never see me as worthy, avoiding mirrors, cameras and the beach because I’ve been so very ashamed. But I now feel HOPE in this area of my life more than ever before. Thank you, Jess. MY BODY IS A GOOD BODY and I will walk in freedom."
"Here’s the thing: as a generation, we don’t have a frame of reference for this stuff. Many of us don’t know what it’s like to not hate our bodies. We’ve seen it, we’ve been modeled it, we’ve been sold it. This book is the first complex, nuanced, biblically-grounded teaching on how to heal our body image —starting with why our bodies are good in the first place.It’s clear Jess Connolly has done the work of listening, researching and (of course) receiving from the Holy Spirit. I’ve been admiring the way she embraces the nuance and complexity of the questions she’s gotten (“but what about health?” being the most common).No one needs my or anyone’s approval to do what God has called you to, but for what it’s worth I am really excited for this book to be out in the world. It will reveal and heal in places we didn’t even know we needed.-Alyssa Pike, RDChristian Eating Disorder Registered DietitianFounder of Gratefully Nourished"
"These are words and a topic that we need right now! Jess Connolly writes so honestly and vulnerably about her own story and struggles. Our bodies are good because there is a good God who created them. Whatever thought, feeling, trauma, or mindset you've had with your body, there is freedom to found today! I am so excited to read and reread these words! God says our bodies are good so that now we can do the very things He has called us to do. Even if you don't know what God says about who you are, I pray that you come to know the gospel truth and know Him as the Savior of your life! Highly recommend this book to all women. Let's walk in freedom together and encourage one another!"
"I appreciate what she was trying to do- and the book does contain nuggets of biblically based wisdom and truth which I love- but as a whole I didn’t care for this book and actually lost interest after a few chapters and just stopped. It was too apologetic for my taste it had a secular tone of “don’t want to offend” or “validating your experience” which was a little too prevalent for me.  Again- I appreciate what she was trying to do- but for me personally, this book was wholly not helpful. I was too put off by the writing style and felt there were secular undertones."
"For a long time, I've been frustrated and grieved with how Christian women typically approach body image, diet, and exercise. From the first chapter of this book I gasped and exclaimed, ""This is what I've been wanting to say but didn't know how!"" Jess's enthusiasm and compassion ooze out of every page. I'm grateful and relieved that she has wrestled with, thought through, and put these issues into words so we can all benefit from wrestling and thinking alongside her. I don't agree with all the author's methods and sources when it comes to interpreting and applying scripture. But the main points are important enough that I still highly recommend this book as a significant, rarely-if-ever-heard message for Christian women."
"I just wanted to briefly share why this book means so much to me. ♥ My name is Amanda and I have struggled with my body image for years, both physically and mentally. I have type 2 bipolar disorder, which is an incurable mental illness that I inherited from my dad and is something that has tormented me for over a decade. Due to the severity of the symptoms, there was much damage done to my mind and body and I developed a deep self-loathing that led to me developing a severe alcohol addiction. I ended up gaining a ton of weight and was advised by my psychiatrist in 2018 to quit alcohol and also try to lose weight in order to go on new medications. I felt so ashamed by my appearance, which I never thought was “bad” until it was pointed out to me. I also felt cursed by God due to my illness - it made me feel like I could never be a good person due to my mood swings and depression. Nevertheless, I began the fight to get better, but it was an uphill battle. I fought for my life starting in July 2018 and now here I am 3 years later. I am now 74 days sober with a full release from the clutches of alcohol by God's grace alone, I have lost over 45 pounds, I am off all of my medications, and for what feels like the first time ever, I am realizing God's love for me and how valuable and worthy I am to Him. However, I still struggle daily with my body image due to my past and overcoming my trauma and deeply entrenched beliefs about myself. That is why I am beyond thankful for this amazing book, which has already made in cry in just the first chapter alone. I am beyond thankful for the clear and loud message that my body is GOOD - our bodies are GOOD! I am now finally understanding what it means to be 'fearfully and wonderfully made,' and to know that because God crafted me, I am bursting with freedom and life in abundance. Freedom from self-hatred, freedom from self-destruction, and freedom from body shame. What a good and glorious Creator we have! This books makes me feel seen, heard, and understood. As Jess asks in Chapter 5, ""What are we getting our bodies ready for?"" For the good He has set before me. For His glory. For Heaven. This body is temporary. I will one day reach my eternal one with the Eternal One. I am ready to rename by body as good with God."
"You may not even realize the things you've been told or you've said to yourself about your body since you can remember but it's time to change what we believe about the way we view the body that God has created. Jess Connolly gives an invitation to let go of shame, lies, and to pick truth over the words we speak about our image. If you read this book, it will challenge you to move forward and not backward with your health and overall view of yourself and God. You have a good body and it's time to stop the negative ways we've seen and talked about our bodies. Giving this book to a friend and so many more people. So important and so good!"
"This timely book is poised to spark a powerful movement within God's kingdom. I revel at His goodness in revealing this to Jess right now, at the peak moment of potentially disliking how our bodies emerge from the pandemic. Praise His name for bringing about this collective paradigm shift.I am a group fitness instructor and as such people often share their body woes with me, typically with the goal that I'll help them meet the cultural expectation for what their body should look like. However, in His goodness, at the beginning of my venture into teaching fitness, I discovered Revelation Wellness. I've been discipled there to care about the heart first, then food and fitness. So when women complain to me about their ""chicken wing"" arms, I ask them to put a hand over their heart, take a deep breath, and appreciate what a miracle it is that they are breathing, their heart is beating, God is sustaining them, and all of their systems are working together to keep them alive, functioning, and moving. I encourage them to value the amazing bodies they're in and care for them well.However, cultural expectations had overcome me in many ways I didn't realize. I am so grateful that Jess' revelation about how we carry the things that have been said about our bodies. I needed a lot of healing in this area. I'm grateful she challenged me to speak life and truth over this body. I'm glad she reminded me of the purpose of this wonderful gift, the meeting place with my maker. How easily we've been duped to think it was for our glory.Jess teaches with passionate conviction and sound, biblical truth. She does not shy away from sharing her own relatable painful experiences and the mistakes she's made.This book could only be better if there were a reference to The Office. Wait! There is. It's completely wonderful in every truth-in-love, in-it-with-you, let's-change-the-narrative kind of way.I imagine that the enemy is trembling at the chains that are falling and the territory he's losing. May the Lord be magnified as we break free to serve HIM only in this good temples he designed."
"With 97% of women struggling with body image and shame in relation to their bodies - that is 318.35 MILLION women in the United States alone - I believe this conversation is the most needed conversation of our generation. What would happen if one by one women lined up and said, ""Your body is good."" and then one woman who heard that message started believing and saying, ""Your body is good""... one after one after one after one. We have the tools in our hands to change our lives, the lives of our children, our children's children, and generations deep with four words - Your body is good. This is discipleship on a whole NEW and REFRESHING level! Jess Connolly has a way of bringing holy conviction, gentle correction, and massive encouragement when it comes to theology, hope, and victory. This book is a MUST read for every woman you know. Don't just get yourself a copy. Buy 5 and invite four friends to read it with you. Let's get loud and start breaking free!"
"Here's what you need to know: this book is valuable. It will add goodness and freedom to your life if you read it thoughtfully and prayerfully. It's not magic; the book itself won't change you and your long-set ideas of your body and God. BUT...it will allow you to process and consider the idea that peace with our bodies is possible. I've often separated my body image and care from my spiritual life. Jess Connolly invites us to see that they're deeply connected. If you're in a place where your body feels limited or it's changed or you're still facing the need to constantly ""correct"" it, this book is for you. I've given it to friends already. I've talked about it with women over work lunches. I'm chatting with strangers on the internet about it! It's the conversation we all need to have - with freedom and care and community. Read and enjoy."
"I don’t know who doesn’t need the words found in this book!! We are soo consumed with images and comparing ourselves to those around us either negatively or with a haughty attitude. Or if we aren’t comparing, we have at some point in our life nitpick what we see in the mirror or dislike what we see or feel in our bodies. So many of us deal with unseen things that can be so discouraging because it feels like nobody understands or possibly could be dealing with the same thing. This book lets you be seen! This book reminds you that your body is good! The creator didn’t make a mistake when He designed you! And I love how Jess leads us to our relationship with our Heavenly Father so we can realize how valuable we really are! I’m so ready to live to the absolute fullest in this new freedom and so excited to see the many of us women and men step into the freedom that is yours as you realize just how good you are!I’ve also been listening to the Audio version and to hear Jess Connolly read her own words with passion and feel every emotion with her is so worth it! I highly encourage you to read or listen to the book and be ready to live in FREEDOM!"
"I want to shout this message Jess Connolly has given to us from the rooftops because this isn’t a message from Jess, it’s a message from God. The words in this book are the healing and freedom women have been aching for in generations. This book will be a balm to you to heal your soul and body starting with your mind all the way down to the practical everyday. But even more so, it won’t just heal you, it will wildly set you free. Your body is already good, in Jesus name."
"Exercise is such an important component for living a healthy life. I KNOW this, yet I've rarely been able to keep up with anything.  My body has never been good enough--thin enough, sexy enough, nor strong enough. BUT GOD. From God given wisdom, Jess masterfully conveys that our bodies are truly good because God said so, end of story. There is nothing to add or take away. This book has shifted my whole view in regards to my body. Now I see exercise as a worshipful experience honoring God with the abilities He's given me. We all different abilities and therefore can honor Him with our bodies in different, beautiful ways. Buy this book. Let the Holy Spirit root this message deep in your soul. I'm so glad I did!"
"I pre-ordered this book because, at 43, I've spent the last year tired of keeping up with my ideal size and wanting to enjoy the food in the fridge I buy for my family.  I want to bake and enjoy the product with my girls because I want them to enjoy making things with their hands.  But I have been struggling with how I feel about myself, needing to buy larger sizes has been difficult and I tell myself it's because of the budget aspect.Just last week, my almost 11 y.o. said, ""Mama, what's this?!"" And she had 3 stretch marks on one thigh. Over the past week, it's started on the other thigh and they're increasing like a rash.  I'm panicking for her, thinking about all the body image issues this could bring to her in the future.  Last night I reached out to friends in prayer; I want to teach her to care for her body and NOT project anything on her, starting body image issues now.  I started reading the book last night and it's speaking right to my heart and it's giving me verbage to share with my daughter and teach her about the goodness of her body 💜. Thank you for writing this book!"
"I bought the audiobook and the physical book because I travel so much as a speech therapist, but I NEEDED the hard copy to reference and highlight. Jess breaks down the strongholds of words placed on us about our body by friends or family members of our past that we have carried as mountains. Learning how to live in freedom because God only makes good things and he made US. My body is GOOD. I can release the hurtful words I’ve carried for far too long, because I’m made in His image.Breaking Free isn’t just a book, it’s a movement. It’s words on page that I wish I would have had at 10 years old. It’s healing things inside me that I didn’t know were still there. It’s also helping me form conversations to have with my daughter. She will never have to be shameful of her God-given body, like so many of us were. This is a must read and also a must listen on audiobook. You will not regret stepping into loving your body."
"I cannot say enough good things about this book. It is an incredible gift and I am so grateful that God  gifted and called Jess to share this truth with us. This book is life changing! Every woman needs to read this! For ourselves, our daughters and future generations: they desperately need us to get this message and live it out. I love how much scripture Jess researched, this book is FULL of what God says about us and himself, cover to cover. I’ve already bought over a dozen copies to give away to the gals in my life! Y’all need this book!!!"
"Read this book and give it to your friends, daughters, nieces, aunts, mother, and grandmothers! This is not a “one and done” book! There are layers and seasons to the shame we are tempted to inflict on our souls. Society and culture will not let up any time soon, but we can put on the strengths and truths that Jess Connolly shares. This mighty work is well-researched from multiple aspects. Jess delivers truth with grace, compassion, and love. You won’t regret a page or a moment spent soaking it in."
"I feel a moral obligation to add my voice to the chorus praising Breaking Free from Body Shame. The book was an answer to a prayer. It awakened me from a lifelong recurring nightmare. It changed the way I see food, exercise, and myself. It freed me from the tyranny of the scale. I thank God and the author with all my heart. May the choicest blessings of heaven rain down on Jess Connolly!"
"I pre-ordered this book in February and have been counting down the days until it arrived. It has been everything I hoped and prayed it would be and so much more! It is such a necessary and timely conversation about the shame we so easily and almost automatically carry around with us throughout our whole lives! Jess asks us to think about women who live shame-free lives in relation to their bodies, and I struggled to think of anyone I knew who lived in this counter-cultural and free way! I have had a 2+ decade struggle with a chronic illness that has done some serious damage to my body, so taking the time to reflect and pray about whether my body is good or not is taking some time and work. I hope to soon without hesitation say- this body is a good body! I highly, highly recommend this book!"
"I’ve struggled with weight issues for all of my life.  I’ve been bullied and shamed and it has shaped me over many years.  It wasn’t until this book got into my hands that I realized that Jesus loves me right where I am and I don’t need to be trapped in the cycle of dieting, depravation, and low self esteem.Jess centers you back on Jesus and the stories are so relatable !"
"I have only just started reading this book, however, I have been listening to the podcast where Jess reads part of the book to you and of course following along in all the freebies she provided with preordering. I am certain that this book is going to impact my generation in so many ways. The depth of thought and care that Jess put into this book is impressive and beautiful. Grab a copy, you won't regret it."
"my genuine hope and desire is that every woman would read this book. I’ve been on a journey of body freedom the last few years but have spent most of my time in the secular space because there haven’t been any gospel-centered resources on this topic. This book is everything I’ve been waiting for and more. Jess Connolly you really did it girl! Ladies, your body is not a project or something to be fixed. From the minute God spoke us into being he called what he created good. “You could do nothing else, your body is good” (p. 87). If that’s hard to believe, pick up this book because there is freedom offered to you in these pages. Wave goodbye to shame fueled body modifications and step into the vision that God has for you. I will most definitely be reading this at least 2 more times."
"As a woman, I have struggled with weight and body image for most of my life. I am bombarded by a culture that tells women they need to look a certain way in order to fit beauty standards, and it has always caused me so much shame and embarrassment that my body never measured up. Even though I am a Christian who believes that God made all bodies to be good bodies, it can be easier to listen to other voices that scream at me all the ways I don't fit the mold. Reading Breaking Free from Body Shame was a turning point for me. It is beautifully written, and each sentence seems to cut straight to the heart. There are so many pages I've bookmarked to go back to these truths whenever I feel like I'm struggling. I will be recommending this book to every woman I know!"
"This book has provided so much encouragement and refocusing for myself and how I will address self-esteem and body confidence with my daughter! Pointing us back to God’s Word and shaking us to reveal just how good our bodies are is just what this generation needs right now. In a world that is so attentive to likes, swipes and shares, Jess Connolly turns our attention away from comparison and judgment towards the freedom that has been promised to us through Jesus! No one else is talking about this the way Jess is! This is a must read!"
If there is one thing I’m learning from this book it is the truth that God loves me as I am NOW and that He calls my body good. It is an interesting and challenging journey to be learning how to walk in truth and freedom from shame after 44 years of internalizing the distorted messages of the world about what constitutes a good body and how to live if your body doesn’t measure up to this standard. I’m so thankful to God for this book through which He is helping me break free and love myself as He already does and to live in this truth. Highly recommend this book.
"This is the book I didn’t realize I needed. I have struggled with body image for as long as I can remember, and I always thought it was part of life. Even after getting to know Jesus, I never knew I could let him into my issues with how I see and treat my body. Jess so beautifully shares her own story with body shame, continuously pointing the reader to the Word of God for truth and guidance as to what GOD says about our bodies. Throughout the book, Jess is both gentle and strong in her call to break free. She is honest and authentic in her words, challenging us to question the beauty standards the world says we need to follow- replacing them with the truth that Jesus has given us. The truth is your body is good! This is a MUST READ for any woman or person who has ever thought anything unkind about their own body!"
"Breaking Free from Body Shame is needed in our world. It is needed not only for us but for our children who deserve to grow up with an increased sense of self esteem walking in the freedom they have been given by their Father! I have lived my entire life feeling broken…as if my body didn’t deserve to be freed from the pain that plagued me for so long. Then this book came along and became a roadmap that is guiding not my body but my heart and mind to a life of liberty and as a result, my body is moving in freedom! This book declares that freedom is here and because of it, I now believe that freedom lives in me. Everyone needs a copy of this book!"
"Jess writes this book as your friend. As someone who has tasted freedom and pursued it. As someone who wants to see you walk in freedom.This book doesn’t tell you 10 steps and affirmations to have a good body. Jess reminds you of the truth, that your body was named good by your Father. Then asks the questions and challenges you to uncover lies you have accepted and move forward in your thinking.If you have ever, for a moment, thought your body needed to meet a goal or standard or change, read this book. Break free and rejoice!"
"I have struggled with body image as long as I can remember. I have let it hold me back from being present in activities, from ministry opportunities and in relationships. Jess truly spoke so much godly truth over this and has opened the door to freedom and to fully believing that God created my body good.It’s easy to hear society, see social media, compare our bodies to women around us – the truth is that God is who He says He is, what He says is true, and He has good things for His children. If He says our bodies are good I want to believe it and bring all of my friends into this freedom too.To sum it up: you need this book - for you or to share with a woman you love that’s struggling with this!"
"I’ve got my Bible, my journal and my Breaking Free from Body Shame book and I’m doing the heart work of breaking free. I’m learning that I cannot continuously consent to bad news. I need to filter it out. This book is helping me do that. Every time I look in the mirror, I remind myself of the words in this book, “The deafening roar of the Lion of Judah is breaking chains of shame, darkness and defeat with this proclamation of protection over his beloved: ‘This is my daughter. I made her body good in My image. Let no one say otherwise. Her body is good.’” I am in the process of renaming my body good."
"""Your body is not an object or a project."" This book arrived at the perfect time. Postpartum after our third baby, it was comforting to read so much truth. The stories of women living with things like infertility, autoimmune diseases, disability, racism and more, serve as a reminder that we need to continue to breakthrough the cultural molds that tell us we need to be better, to be more, in order to be accepted or loved. This is a powerful read, and I hope every women begins to internalize the truth that her body is good."
"This book has been changing my life all summer long. Calling it what it is has exposed me to how women around me and my inner voice are so critical of our bodies. Body shame is in almost every single conversation I have. Jess’s book gives clear guidance on how to identity it for what it is, how to change it, and how to move forward. The best book I’ve read all year and one I’ll come back to again and again."
"Wow. I didn’t really see myself as having a lot of body image issues, until Jess blew my mind with the simple sentence: your body is good. That thought had literally never crossed my mind, in my entire life.Her words are life-changing. Her freedom is trail blazing. I HIGHLY recommend this book for any and all women who want to be free!"
"I have struggled with body image my whole life. Even as I’ve come to know our Savior in recent years, I never really saw how we treat, love, honor (or not) our bodies as a spiritual issue. But I see it now, thanks to this book. Jess so beautifully shares her own story with body shame in a real, authentic, relatable way while continuously pointing the reader to the Word of God for truth and guidance as to what GOD says about our bodies. She also does a beautiful job of bringing awareness to current beauty standards of the world- challenging us to replace them with the truth that Jesus has given us. Today, I’m declaring your body is good, my body is good- thanks to this powerful book and what GOD says about us!"
"WOW! The back cover, the introduction, the real life stories, the mercy, the kindness, the willingness to go into the conversations that needed CPR... I believe I cried through each chapter. But they weren't just tears for the sake of a good cry. They were tears for feeling seen and heard, for freedom, for redemption and for the opportunity to extend a hand to my sisters and call them up to something that's possible - and not compared to each other's new-found freedom. Goodness, may every generation find this Holy redemption worthy until Christ returns. Keep going Jess, you are doing this right!!!"
"In my opinion, every woman should read this book. While it is written from a Christian perspective, the concept that “your body is good” is a universal truth that all women can champion. Connolly champions this idea in ways I’ve never read it presented before. I immediately recommended it to my friends and family and want my teenaged daughter to read it. Connolly also does an excellent job of carefully avoiding details around disordered eating that could be triggering to some women, making this book safe for most, if not all, readers. I couldn’t recommend this book enough!"
"So grateful for this message! I can relate in so many ways. As others are starting to speak about body shame more, it’s important to keep our eyes on what God says!"
"Whew! Had to wait until my eyes were dry to be able to write this. GET THIS BOOK! I have searched for years for the “magic pill” of freeing my never ending recording of body shame and This.Is.It. This book is convicting without shaming, challenging without condemning, and a soft place to land after years of beating up my body inside and out. Jess takes biblical truths most know to a much deeper and practical level. This book will be on repeat until I get these truths so deep, it is my new default to think this way. Thank you Jess for your obedience. Thank you God for giving her these words at this time!"
"I have struggled with body image my entire life. Now at 27, I just assumed it would always be this way. That is until I saw Jess Connolly post about this book on social media. I immediately preordered the book and joined the launch team. Going over the content the last 10 weeks has shown me that freedom isn't only possible, it is what God wants for us. He says our bodies are GOOD! Since getting the book yesterday, God has just continued to confirm this truth in my heart. I cannot say enough good things about this book, and I can't tell enough women about it :) I want to live free, and now I am learning that I can.edit: sharing this review on my husband's account."
"After a decade and a half of struggling with disordered eating and exercise, Jess’s book was like the friend who climbed into the darkness, grabbed my hands, looked me in the eyes and said, “It doesn’t have to be this way.”I have responded to every word of hers with opened teary eyes in a hopeful disbelief that I have the freedom to leave the bondage I was in. I get to be free. I get to just be. I get to just move. I get to just eat. I get to just rest. And I don’t have to beat myself up emotionally or physically because it’s what I deserve.Because of Jesus and God’s sweet grace, I’m, we, are given so much more. Freedom."
"I received my copy today and have already begun to read it. This is the book that is needed. As a mom of two daughters I have seen the harm that has been caused by our culture-both inside and outside of church circles. We are being told lies from the time we are children. We have become desensitized and/or harmed by these lies. It is time to break free from body shame and see our bodies as God sees them. Uniquely crafted with incredibly deep love for Kingdom purpose and dreams. Thank you Jess for listening to God's leading and embarking on this journey, we are in it with you, breaking free one day. and one woman, at a time. We are in Bloom."
"This is the first book I’ve picked up in about a year, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. I’m not even completely finished reading, yet. Just in the first chapter, I realized 1) how truly weighed down I am by diet culture and societal pressures. I claim to know I’m fearfully made and fully known and loved, but I don’t live that truth. And I realized 2) that healing is possible for me. I’ve tried every diet and weight loss strategy I could find, thinking I’ll start living in God’s love as soon as I get to a certain weight. THEN I’ll truly be worthy. Jess rocked my world and wrecked my heart with her words. I’ll be recommending this book forever."
"I preordered this awesome book months ago and joined Jess’s Good Body Gals meditation and movement online community. I have had multiple breakthroughs during the sessions and throughout this whole book! Parts that stand out are “my body is not a project,” “my body is already good,” and “we don’t invest in the spiritual to gain in the physical.” I have struggled with liking my body and always thinking that it needed “fixing” my whole life. This struggle has caused me to miss celebrating what my body can do. I hope to instill this truth to my future children and my friends that struggle with knowing their body is already good."
"Oh my goodness!!! I will be purchasing more of this amazing book! I initially bought three one to keep and two to give away, I read mine and gave it away too!! This book and the audio book paired together are like healing balm to my soul!! Jess writes lime she’s got you sitting in her living room and is having coffee with you! The book is also well designed and I can hardly wait to have more copies in my hands to give away (and hopefully maybe keep one this time.)"
"Jess Connolly is an authentic voice that has personally walked out the message of this book in a very real way. This book is for everyone who has ever felt embarrassment, dissapointment and anger against their own bodies. It is a lifeline of hope to anyone who feels she could never love herself as she is. It's time to get free, and Jess will lead you to the source of true freedom."
"This conversation is so important. In a world where we have been convinced that our bodies are projects to perfect and not vessels to experience and share God’s glory, this book steps in to allow the Holy Spirit to stir hearts towards truth and break free from the shame that our bodies carry. Jess writes with humility, honesty and vulnerability, letting the confidence in God’s ability to redeem what has been misnamed and broken come through on every page.In short: GET THIS BOOK + step into the brave space of healing and freedom!!"
"This book is amazing! It was actually my very first Kindle purchase on my new Kindle! My entire life has been a journey of up’s and down’s about my body image. And it’s something you can’t just escape from because you see it everyday. This book has taught me so much, but more than anything, it has guided me through so much. That’s when you know it’s an amazing book...when it doesn’t just tell you, but guides you through transformation- with a lot of help from the Lord himself!"
"Life-changing and life-giving book! I listened to the Audible version and purchased a paperback copy to re-read and take notes in. The Audible version is narrated by the author, Jess, and I highly recommend that version. It’s so powerful to hear the emotion she has on this very important topic that’s straight from her own heart. This book is FILLED with scriptural truth and is gospel-centered. It’s exactly what I needed to help to begin healing my broken self-image and relationship with my body."
"As a wellness and fitness professional for over 28 years, I wish this book was around when I began my call. I would have had ever female client I ever trained, over the age of twelve read this book. It would have been a game changer. But it's not too late for us to change the game but first we must change our language. Our bodies are good! Thank you Jess for giving us the words our souls have been longing to say. Is body image a spiritual issue? YES! Read this book and find out why, then pick up your mat and walk into glorious freedom!"
"This is groundbreaking, world changing, perspective shifting work. This book is already shifting the way I see myself and others' bodies. I've struggled with self-image and body issues since I was 5 years old, but it's never too late to allow God to transform your mind. He is doing that through this book and Jess' words. Grateful for this, and I can't wait to see how God moves and changes lives through this book and movement."
"This book is needed by every woman. The message of freedom in this book rings so loudly. Jess Connolly is the perfect person to steward this message. The way she gracefully navigated the things that just about every woman struggles with (body image) is a gift. If you want someone to coach you to freedom in this area of life, or you need to be equipped to help someone else walk in freedom, this book will give you all the necessary tools to do just that."
"Don't wait to buy this book I bought the book and audio, I listen to the audio in my car i felt like she was talking to me personally and the freedom in am feeling now from not judging my body is amazing. Buy it you won't regret it !!!"
"Jess Connolly truly understands that God is the one to whom we please, not the world in what our bodies look like!  Such a great truth and I recommend it highly to all those seeking as I do to be rid of body shame !"
"Jess Connolly struck a nerve in this book in the best way. With such a majority of women struggling with body image, this book is so needed. It is a rally cry to see our bodies as God sees them—good. This is a must read!!"
"As soon as I broke the binding of this book I was captivated from start to finish!  The words speak so tenderly to the heart, spirit, and mind. I cried, laughed and learned how to grow scabs over scars that were so deeply rooted from my past. I can’t wait to dig even deeper into this book as I read it again and again not only for myself but for my own daughters. This book absolutely ignites a fire to heal and BREAK FREE to enter into truth, hope and secure identity into who we truly are in Christ."
I love this Book in how we are changing view on how we can Renew our mind when it comes to our Body! We can take how God made us and be the individual of the unique way God has made our body. Going to say I have a Good Body no matter how it looks or works.
"I'm just getting started with the book and enjoying Good Body Gals at the same time! It means so much to me to read and hear that my body is not shameful or wrong. I enjoy the fellowship and the Biblical references that back up the discussion. Thanks, Jess!"
"If you have ever hated the number on a scale, found flaws in the mirror, or heard/said mean comments about your body, you NEED this book!!!! It's time to take back what the enemy stole from us, and that's identity. It's time to step into who God says we are, and break off crap we never needed to carry! This book is gold, and Jess Connolly delivers love and truth!"
Love this message! We have nothing to be ashamed of. Book is mostly biblical. Just a few loose words but I would recommend it for sure. I already gave my copy away.
This book is life changing! It has shifted my mind and freed my heart! If you’ve ever had a negative thought about your body… Get.this.book! Beautifully written solid truth rooted in Gods word!
"Wow wow wow. I had to stop halfway through to leave this review because this book is so life changing already. For years my body has been misnamed as not good and unworthy. It has been named as the reason I would lose all significant relationships and the weapon I would need to use to keep them. No more. If you ever in your life have felt the longing to be free from the emotions wracking you about your body, you. need. this. book."
"Jess is a woman on mission to change the world for other women, and this book is one of the most powerful tools I’ve seen to make that happen. Ladies - YOU ARE NOT STUCK and you are not a victim of the narrative you’ve been given about your body. Get this book and go push back hell - for yourself and for generations of women who will follow you."
This book is a must read for all women - our generation is in such a need for these words by Jess. She has poured out her heart to help everyone we were created with a good body- not one to be punished or to be ashamed of. This is a message that needs to be heard by all because body image affects us at a base level. Go buy this book! - you won’t regret it!
"This is more than just a book. This is revival. Every chapter is filled with biblical truth about our bodies. They are good and we can break free from body shame. It’s possible it’s real and Jess did a beautiful job making sure it is trigger free for women who struggle with body image issues/ eating disorders. Grab your friends, your mama, your daughters, your aunties and start a book club. This book is a must have for every woman in your life"
"Reading this was a breath of fresh air for me. It is a deep longing to be free in my body, to not carry the weight of criticism and “perfection”. I physically felt the weight lifting as I read chapter after chapter. We need this book and the revolution that Jess Connolly is leading through faithfulness to the Lord."
"This book has the potential to shift the culture of our world. What the world says is not good, God says otherwise. Thank you so much to Jess Connolly for stewarding this message so well! Thank you for taking what is counter cultural and running towards freedom! I’m running with you and it is all because of this book! This book needs to be in the hands of every woman and anyone raising up the next generation. It is an absolutely invaluable resource."
Best book I’ve read on Biblical content concerning body image. So good so anyone that’s ever struggled with this. And in today’s culture it’s a huge problem!
"This book is a taste of freedom I think many of us women didnt think we could hope for...to know we are good and beautiful in every stage and season , not just because we think so, but because our Creator and Father says we are and passionately defends us! It's one I will read and reread and I believe one that will open women to a whole new world of freedom to explore. This is a gift."
I needed this book. And while I knew my need for it I didn’t expect the freedoms that came from reading it. I gained confidence and a love for myself that only come from unashamed love for ones body through the work of Christ. And Jess Connolly’s words.This book has become my anthem. That all bodies are good. And I believe every woman (man and child) needs this message.
This book is amazing!  Within the first few pages I could totally relate to Jess and the way she was raw and honest about her body.  Her love of Jesus and her honesty about her body makes this a best seller in my mind.  I even bough the audio version too!  I felt like she was sitting next to me telling her story and helping me to unravel mine. Every girl old enough to read should get this book!
"Breaking Free has not only given me the space and permission to step into the woman God has called me to be, by Jess has created a resource that is Kingdom-centered to guide us on our way to freedom. This book has given me the opportunity and the blessing to call out the labels I (and others) had put on my body that were rooted in shame, and has helped me reclaim my body for what God intended it to be...and it is GOOD."
"This book has been a breath of fresh air, revealing what most of us feel daily but don’t often acknowledge.  I love Jess’s heart and can’t wait to finish this and listen to her speak in person.  I want the audiobook, I’m missing out on the prayers!"
Jess wrote this book so thoughtfully. I love that it addresses the idea of body shame from a Kingdom-perspective and from a place that doesn’t induce any further shame. This message of freedom is so important and is exactly what we need.
"This book has completely changed my outlook on my body and what “a good body” really means, looks like, and doesn’t look like. I have kept this book at my side since I bought it to be able to lean into the reminders of where my worth comes from and to keep me grounded when it feels like the thief of comparison is getting too loud, or when the pressures of this world come a little too close."
I was nervous this book would impact me negatively--allowing me to slip further into shame--but instead I was gently reminded this is a good body. This book teaches you about brave spaces and learning to replace those lies you've heard about your body for so long with truth from God. I 100% recommend this book to any woman who may struggle with any amount of body shame.
I gave this book to a friend who has had many surgeries. I hope she will be blessed after reading it.
"We all at some time or another struggle to see our bodies as good. But God calls us good in all seasons. As Jess reminds us, God doesn't make bad things. It's time we rise up together and walk in the freedom God always intended. Jess leads us in that journey of healing with transparency & truth."
What a refreshing Christ centered approach to freedom from body shame. I listened to it all in one day. And need to go back and highlight all the parts I want to revisit and ask the Lord for more freedom.Must read!
"I’ve struggled with body image for as long as I could remember.  I’ve read all the books, listened to all of the talks and none has had such an impact like this book. Every woman needs to read this. I pray I can be the change for my young daughter and can have an impact on each generation after me. We belong to HIM and our bodies are good!"
"Let me just say…the Holy Spirit is present within the pages of this book!! Jess Connolly is a treasure to women everywhere! Her words are life-giving and challenging and fierce. This message is for you, friend! Don’t hesitate to grab it!"
"I was scared to pick up this book because it felt like there was something sacred about it. I could feel in my bones that I needed to break free, but didn’t know how. This book showed me how. Jess reminded me of the profound truth that Jesus has set me free. Shame has no hold over me. Satan has no hold over me. Here’s to #freegirlsummer!"
There is freedom to be found in reading this book! The emphasis Jess places on viewing our body from a kingdom perspective is so helpful. Jess speaks about this delicate topic with such care. It is a book for every woman who desires to rename her body as good.
"This book has brought me so much freedom. My life has changed for the better because of these words. I'm walking in a freedom I haven't experienced since childhood, and I'm unbelievably grateful."
"If you want to find freedom from body image issues that may have plagued you for years THIS IS A MUST READ.  So much truth and inspiration.  I have struggled with this area of my life for years.  I have tried everything, I mean everything and this was the answer to my prayers.  GO GET THIS BOOK NOW!!!!"
"I’m a few pages into this book, and WOW! I am sooo excited to join the good body gals journey! Also love the illustrations on the front and throughout the book. So simple & beautiful just like the words! This will be my summer read! Will update once I finish the book :)."
This book is about to change the world because of the freedom it’s bringing about in the lives of thousands upon thousands. Jess meets her readers with such tenderness and truth. Grateful for the freedom it’s brought to my own life. Praying expectantly for the freedom it brings to others as well! ♥️
Let’s individually and collectively change the script about how we view our bodies. This books shows us how.  I want to give this book to every woman I know.  It changed the way I think about the body I was given.
"This book is for anyone who has ever questioned if their body was good enough or worthy enough. I am so grateful for Jess for putting this message out in the world. It is time for women to be set from from shame surrounding body hatred and comparison. This is our summer, Ladies!"
"Everything about this book is pure goodness. From the brave space to face the things we’ve done or said about our own bodies so we can heal, to the convicting truth that we have participated in saying shameful things about others and their bodies. It’s impactful and needed. A much appreciated word in season."
"Much needed book, filled with hope and love!"
I am so pumped to finally have this book in my hands! Jess does an amazing job with writing this book and the community behind it is the best there is. I’m all for this book and finally breaking my chains of body shaming. I’m tired of being my own worst critic and I’m so ready to reclaim what God has named good.
This book will change your life if you allow God to open your eyes. Jess absolutely understands how women feel about their bodies and how culture has influenced them. God has shown her a new way to think about our bodies and how we can glorify Him. Absolutely recommend this book.
Grab your highlighter because you’re gonna mark up these pages from the beginning! Jess is bringing the truth and good words from page 1.
"There are countless books talking about all the disciplines you should be better at, this book was a breath of fresh air and full of encouragement. I’ve been telling all of my friends and even read it twice myself because I needed to hear the message so bad."
"As a young college girl stuck in body shame & disordered eating, struggling to find freedom 10 years ago, I wondered why the church wasn’t talking about this. But now we are. I’m so excited about this book; this conversation needs to happen!"
Everyone needs this book! Life changing!
This book has changed my life forever! Never again will I live in shame. Everyone should take the time to read this book.

"Truly incredible. Jess brings such a powerful, loving, and gentle perspective to how we view our bodies. I’d recommend this book to anyone and everyone. Thank you, Jess!"
"Jess is personable and welcoming through her words. She is firmly sweet in her delivery, inspiring us to be bold in rebuilding the narrative of what God says about our bodies."

This book is so good I bought the audible version so I can go back and reference easily and already bought extra copies to give away.  This is a vital conversation that I didn’t know how to have.  Thank you for writing this!
I’m in the middle of this book right now and it has been so healing and challenging. I’m incredibly grateful for the message this book carries on body image FREEDOM through scripture and truth.
I have never read a book like this and I am really enjoying it. Definitely recommend if body shaming is something that you struggle with.
It’s exactly what I needed to hear. I just finished and I’m staring it over so I can let the words wash over me again. It’s that good.
This book is an absolute answer to prayer. I have struggled for many years in this area. I just never realized the issue was shame. My body is a good body!!!
"I loved this book.  At 55 years of age, i found great comfort in how Jess speaks about how much God loves us and created us GOOD.  I'm sharing the book with all my female friends."
"Body image is a spiritual issue! Jess perfectly tackles this issue by helping bring revival to generations defined by body shame. If you are thinking about buying, stop thinking and just do it."
This book has changed my life.
"Only part of the way through, and I am already amazed at the progress this book is helping me make on the journey to break free! Thankful for Jess and her boldness and faith to write this much needed book."
"Jess brings us back to how our bodies should be loved, honored, and respected. She does in such a simple but eloquent way. If you need a sign to purchase this book. HERE’S SIGN!!!"
Such a great book!  Challenging and freeing all at the same time.  A much needed word for women today!  I cannot recommend it enough
Jess is open and honest and speaks life and freedom in ways I haven’t heard before. She talks about the hard things that so many other Christian authors avoid talking about.
"So very thankful for this book. I have been thinking about, talking about, and treating my body with so much more kindness after reading this. Thank you, Jess, for your much-needed words."
Jess brings the truth of what our God says about our bodies that he created and changes your whole perspective!
Such a great book that really puts things into perspective! I wish I could tell everyone they are worthy of love!!!
"So thankful for this trigger free , freedom filled, Biblical approach to a topic so many of us have struggled with."
"This book is amazing, it is such a needed message for so many of us today. I love the intention that Jess wrote in every page of this book! Don’t miss a chance to read this"
Thank you for writing a book about how we can positively look at our bodies through Christ’s view.
"If there was a book I’d consider buying twice, it’s this one! I seriously want this book in audio so that I can listen to it on repeat until it sinks in!"
This is a must read for everyone! It is time to know that our bodies are good and are made in His image.
A beautiful reminder and much needed encouragement to lean into God’s love for us and our bodies.

Just what I needed!

Love this book
"I have read many books and articles about body-image issues, and they are often quite fluffy, tending towards shallow reassurance and pulling Bible verses out of their full context to tell the reader how beautiful God thinks she is. Although these books can have a positive impact, I find them frustratingly shallow, especially since I have approached this material from the perspective of wanting to help and encourage others. Many body-image books offer nothing of substance that I would find helpful in a conversation, but ""Breaking Free from Body Shame: Dare to Reclaim What God Has Named Good"" is exactly what I always wanted. Jess Connolly writes with a deep understanding of both our bodies and the kingdom of God, and in this book, she persuades Christian women to see past cultural, familial, and self-imposed expectations to see the inherent goodness, worth, and dignity of their physical selves.Finding True FreedomConnolly emphasizes that body shame is a spiritual issue, not a matter of shallowness or vanity. She clearly articulates a biblical and kingdom-focused view of the body, and emphasizes that because God has called our bodies good, we should not let anyone else say otherwise. Connolly addresses issues of shame related to other people's words of judgment, and specific objections and wrong narratives that she encounters. She includes chapters like ""Your Body is Not a Project"" and ""Your Body is Not a Marker of Righteousness"" to break down the lies behind common socially enforced beliefs, and at the end of the book, she encourages women to find permanent freedom by changing the way that they think about, react to, and talk about their bodies both privately and corporately. She encourages women to recognize their inherent value, treat themselves with dignity, and model a God-glorifying view of their bodies to others.Throughout the book, she shares vivid personal illustrations, but she tends to avoid focusing on traumatic elements of her or other people's stories. At the beginning of the book, she explains that she wants this book to be safe to read, so that it will not deeply trigger women who have experienced trauma related to their bodies. With this approach, she only briefly references the damage of sexual abuse without going into detail, and she does not focus on traumatic details of verbal abuse that readers may have experienced. Also, because everyone's experience is unique, Connolly includes brief reflections from diverse other women at the end of each chapter. These stories are brief and restrained, but address general details related to body shame and struggles with disability, illness, infertility, and other issues that affect how women experience their bodies.Some Minor CritiquesI think it would have been helpful if Connolly had addressed concerns specific to athletes, who pursue high-level physical fitness for their interests and/or career. Although athletes shouldn't misuse their bodies or push them towards unrealistic, damaging ideals of perfection, I wish that Connolly had nuanced some of her statements against stringent exercise or diets with sports training in mind, instead of implying that all efforts towards peak physical fitness are unnecessary, misguided, or likely to be ungodly.Also, I found that as Connolly tried to be sensitive and avoid offending people, she wasn't willing to address the issue of gluttony. She treated ""What about gluttony?"" as a distraction from believing that our bodies are good, but it is a legitimate and biblical question. People can be guilty of gluttony regardless of body size, and it is appropriate and biblical to address this as an aspect of stewarding our good bodies and living in a way that honors God.My other concern is that even though Connolly parenthetically mentions men a few times, she never fully, directly acknowledges that men also struggle with hurtful words about their bodies, unrealistic expectations, and the same lies about their bodies being projects, trophies, or markers of righteousness. Even though Connolly is writing to a female audience and doesn't need to address men directly, I wish that she had provided context for body image issues across gender lines. It is great for this book to address concerns and experiences specific to women, but I think that Connolly's writing could have been even more powerful if she had shared perspectives related to men's body image struggles, making other women more aware of this in ways that would be beneficial in their relationships with male friends and family members.Conclusion""Breaking Free from Body Shame"" is an incredibly powerful, wise, and life-giving book. Connolly moves beyond shallow reassurances and empty platitudes to focus on a holistic biblical perspective of the body, helping women recapture God's vision for their physical forms in every stage of life. This is a wonderful resource for both teenage girls and adult women to read independently or in discussion with others, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is struggling with body image at any level, even if they have already made a lot of progress. I would also recommend this to people who want to be able to encourage and help girls and women within friendship or counseling relationships. This powerful book is full of deep, unexpected perspectives, upends false cultural beliefs that surround us, and encourages women to find true freedom in the bodies God gave them."
"Like Jess says, this book is a trigger-free, soft place to land when it comes to reframing the conversation about our bodies. But she is in no way a push-over when it comes to body freedom. She charges us women of God to:1. Rename your body as good with God2. Give your body rest3. Find restoration through worship4. Seek revivalIn Jess Connolly fashion, this book is well-written and compelling —a smooth read with tough questions. As an author, I appreciate her elevated but very relatable vocabulary. As a Christian woman, I have been waiting for someone to get loud over the body shame we have kept silent. As a mom and mentor, I now have a resource that sums up what I want to say about how to step back into the Kingdom mindset and return to our good, God-given, messy-but-marvelous, enigmatic-yet-eternal bodies.Get this book and put it into practice with the Lord. You won't regret it."
"What a powerful book about what we think about our bodies. It is revealing on the cultural pressures that we allow to put on women in today society is extreme. Jess Connolly wrote it in a way that shows me the lies that I told myself about my body. About the barriers that I created for myself because how society has told me how I need to look to fit in. She goes into the truth of the word to show how beautiful our bodies regardless on how imperfect it is. How we can accept and love our bodies because it is beautiful in God eyes is a beautiful message that I want all women of all ages to hear.Love this book, even better in the audio version."
"Breaking Free from Body Shame is the fire of revival that us women of God NEED. With 97% of us struggling with body image the time is now to embrace freedom in Christ and to break free from this generational bondage. As a registered dietitian I would recommend this book to my clients, friends, and family. Together we can positively change the narrative around our bodies with TRUTH. Your body is good. You are made in the image of God. Jess has created a wonderful tool in this book and I cannot recommend it enough."
"Jess has done it again! She is preaching, teaching, and proclaiming freedom over us…the freedom already brought and purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ.It’s easy to get caught up in the images on social media, lies lined up on the magazine rack, or for me remember the snickers of classmates in the locker room changing for gym or feel the weight of not looking a certain way in the fitting room. In sweeps the shame of what is not rather than celebrating what is. Shame much like sin so easily entangles and informs our inner voice, image, and eventually belief. This isn’t just a body image “issue” but a spiritual issue.Today is the day we dare to reclaim what God has named good. “This body is good!” It’s for teaching, loving, serving, and worshipping! Today is the day we proclaim our freedom from body shame, insecurity, and the expectation to meet cultural ideals. Today we shout “Shame off you!” Jesus has defeated shame on the cross and freedom is ours for the taking. Join me and other readers on this journey and grab a copy of Jess Connolly’s Breaking Free from Body Shame and #LetsBreakFree"
"She does an impeccable job guiding the reader first through the Kingdom Body Mindset.  Jess weaves passionate and convicting stories throughout the book while providing a path towards freedom.  She guides you through Renaming, Resting, Restoration & Revival.  I like the physical copy to make notes in — but I’ve truly enjoyed listening to her on the audiobook + the bonus content.  God wants you to experience His freedom — so if you are ready, grab your copy and — “Let’s Break Free”."
"“Just wear the shorts.” This was the post from  Connolly that shook me and brought me to this book. At a young age I was told that I have “chubby knees”. This statement totally transformed the way I saw my body and still do today. However, after reading some of this book, I feel I have scratched the surface in seeing my body as Christ does! Highly recommend this for any other woman that needs to transform the way they see themselves through Christ’s eyes!"
"Breaking Free from Body Shame came at a perfect time for me. The process Jess and the Lord have worked and walked together shines through authentically and personally! I'm thankful for her vulnerability to share her story and to tackle such a hot button topic with grace, honesty and courage. This book is timely and I pray it blesses every woman who reads it!"
Wow!!!! What I have been searching for!!!! I have been praying for a book like this. Out of all the messages and books I’ve read I have never felt more fulfilled and happy with what I learned in this topic. I have continually thought that there was a gap in this message in this world. And now there isn’t anymore with this book!!! A must read and a life changer!
"This book is beautifully written and speaks to the pressures and perfection we tend to place on our bodies without even realizing it. God has shifted things in my heart through Jess’ honest words and encouragement. If you’re thinking about purchasing— just do it! It’s a must read for any person with a body 😉❤️ Good solid truth for your good, good body!"
"Just getting started and already feeling lighter!  I love how Jess confronts the lies that we are told about our bodies and how we are to believe about our bodies with biblical truth. Made in His perfect image, how can we NOT be good in ours?  I can’t wait to finish this and will be recommending this book to all my friends and family, young and young at heart!"
"I have been following Jess on Instagram for a while now and her voice is one I trust. I can tell she believes in this message and wants to impact women’s lives for the better by leading them to believe this message, too. I’m so grateful for her hard work in breaking free herself so that I can have the tools to break free as well!"
"Read or listen for the actual truth about your body. Spoiler alert—it is already VERY GOOD! I can say this even though my own body has dimples, creases, and two autoimmune conditions. My body is good, and so is yours! Thankful that God used Jess to deliver this very important message in this book."
"Believing my body is good means I now have more time, more brain space, to do what I love and to enjoy this life I’ve been given. So much energy is spent working to make my body good when, in reality, it already is and was and will be. This body is a gift. This book, too, is such a gift. Thank you, Jess."
A beautiful and necessary conversation that all women should be having. Breaking Free from Body Shake has truly allowed me to gain a kingdom mindset over this body and I’m grateful to have red it before having my first baby girl.
This book is such a beautiful gift of freedom! Every woman should read!
Such appreciation for Jess' heart in how she presents this topic. Cautiously to avoid triggers. Biblically to seek Scripture. Inclusively with featured co-authors throughout. Beautifully written.
"One of the best books I’ve ever read. From someone who’s struggled with eating disorders in college and constant body shame and insecurity, this book has been SO helpful. Thank you Jess for speaking truth!"
This book has been transformative! I have learned new ways to talk about my body and talk to my body. I have found myself telling everyone I know about Jess Connolly and this beautiful book.
"Such wisdom and truth within these pages. Jess shares personal experience and speaks words I’ve longed to hear for my own self, but also for my daughters."
This is an awesome read and a beautiful tribute to the King that made our bodies good! Thank you for turning around years of falsehoods in Jesus Name!
"This book is amazing. Having battled disordered eating and behaviors my whole life, this book was refreshing and life changing. Jess is like a voice in the wilderness."
I love Jess and her boldness in how she speaks. This book is for such a time as this! This is something we need to start talking about!
This book has genuinely helped me heal my relationship with my body and has transformed my life!! I highly reccomend it
"This book seriously changed how I think about my body and how I talk about it. Jess shares Bible verses to help us understand how God views us and the purpose of our bodies. She also shares practical steps to stop shaming ourselves and others. I’ve already implemented some and shared them with friends! Seriously, if you’re on the fence just get the book, you won’t be sorry."
Love it
I love this book. I can’t wait to share this book and all that I’m learning about God and how He sees my body as good with the ladies I get to disciple every year plus my daughter.Jess gets it and is slinging hope and truth and women need this message. We do not need to live by cultural standards.Amazing. Get it today.
"Fair warning: The kindle edition for 0.99 is the Tent CCC, *not* the one that many people think they are getting since the main page shows the second edition. If I wanted to get a Trent CCC then I would have bought that. Amazon needs to fix this listing since many people are probably thinking their getting the latest one. White cover with gold trim. Hope this helps someone!*Here* is the correct kindle version for the Catechism Second Edition. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AD6Q7GM/ref=oh_aui_d_detailpage_o01_?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
"Essential work if you want to understand what the Catholic church actually teaches. This book contains the necessary (imho) information for anyone who wants/needs to learn what Catholicism is all actually about. This book is divided into 4 (four) parts: profession of faith (creed), sacraments (7), life in faith, and prayer. Starting with a total explanation of the profession of faith (creed) and ends with the Lord's Prayer. Before reading this I had so many misconceptions about the Catholic church. While reading this the misconceptions disappear while the truth and beauty of the Catholic church appear."
Every Catholic who is a practicing Catholic should have one of these. And if youare not a practicing Catholic you might want to get this and ponder the book andsee if it can maybe change your life. We are talking about your soul and yourfamily's souls.....is there anything more important than that?Good luck and God Bless
"I'm so happy with this purchase, especially after I added the tabs. It's compact and easy to reference, which is perfect for me because I'm currently a RCIA candidate. I wanted a hardcover CCC that was small that I could easily toss into my bag to attend RCIA classes and also use outside. Very happy with this purchase and recommend it!"
I ordered two of these - one for my husband and one for me. We were both terribly disappointed when the glue holding the binding in place broke open the very first time we opened the book. I'm going to try ordering a different paperback version. Perhaps that will have a more satisfactory binding and we'll be able to use the Catechism for many years. This is why I gave this product a two star review.
"The complete teachings, beliefs, and doctrines of the catholic church all in one book. The OED defines “catechism” as “An elementary treatise for instruction in the principles of the Christian religion, in the form of question and answer; such a book accepted and issued by a church as an authoritative exposition of its teaching….” This is a useful definition for understanding what kind of information can be found in the catechism.The Catechism of the Catholic Church was approved by Pope John Paul II in 1992. Obviously, the information contained in it was not new—it is based on the Bible, documents from church councils, encyclicals, previous versions of the catechism, and other Church documents that predate it by hundreds of years.The Catechism is meant to be used as a reference work. It’s organized clearly with an extensive table of contents and a glossary. I wouldn’t recommend trying to read it from cover to cover, though you certainly can if you’re of such a mind to do so.The Catechism is easy to find. It’s available for free on the Vatican website, though since I hate reading on the computer, I don’t find it more beneficial for anything save the search function. Printed copies are easily available used, new, paperback, hardcover, trade paperback, mass market paperback, e-reader, and any form you could want. As long as it says “Catechism of the Catholic Church,” it’s the right book. Be aware that theUnited States Catholic Catechism for Adults is a study supplement and does not contain the full text of the Catechism."
"I'm not even sure how to review this.  It's the catechism from the 90s that was written as a compendium of the beliefs of the Catholic Church, and is derivative of what was put together during the second Vatican Council.  It is what it is.  Some parts are clear and straightforward, but much is mysterious and obscure.  Such is the nature of a religious document, I guess.  The ebook is formatted well enough for breaking up the various sections (using the contents as your jumping off point), though it isn't broken down to the same level in the contents on the side that comes up in the app (I'm not sure where there's a disconnect there)."
"Well written guide to Catholicism circa turn of the century, a la 20th/21st. Some of the concepts could be plainer and explored more clearly. It is encyclopedic with brief blurbs about all the important concepts such as the Sacraments.There is not much history or context of ancient quotes. Sometimes the text, while written beautifully, meanders and one wonders what in heaven it's talking about.This is an intermediary text. Not for beginners but also not for people looking for further exposition. It takes into account variants in the Orthodox and Protestant faiths."
"This is a pearl beyond price - a treasure - a companion for life.  Not your 'Baltimore Catechism' type of Catechism with the old style question/answer format (although the Compendium, also listed here has that style for those who wish to use it). The Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) is the masterpiece produced while John Paul II was Pope and with the loving guidance of then Cardinal Ratzinger.  It is a reference and guide, so don't try to read it as a novel, which it is not.  But a slow, meditative reading of a few pages at a time can be richly rewarding, especially in the first part which is about God and Faith - these chapters could be prayed, they are so inspiring. I am working through the CCC a few pages a day and I recommend this approach instead of just using it as a reference work.Also interesting is the Introduction to the Catechism of the Catholic Church by Cardinal Ratzinger and Christoph Schonborn, which contains introductory presentations by the authors since the publication of the CCC.Finally, The Companion to the Catechism of the Catholic Church contains all the relevant texts from the sources footnoted in CCC - almost 3000 pages of material reproduced verbatim."
"Overall, good value for the money. The main issue I have with the book is it is very “stiff” (doesn't want to stay open on its own and makes me nervous opening it too wide as it is so stiff I feel like I may break the binding). Hopefully, over time it will loosen up a bit.If you have vision issues you may want to look into something with larger font. The paper is good quality though and there is no text bleed-through which is a big plus.The Nicene Creed (pg 56-57) does not 100% the creed recited in my local Parish which I find a little odd. When I google it, I can find the correct version used in my church, not sure why that is not reflected in the Catechism...(ISBN 0-385-50819-0)"
"Thought this was the recent one.  It is not.  Also funny, but not acceptable, are the typos.  “The holy Ghot” (goat? Really? How interesting!). In contents, and creed, and who knows where else.  They couldn’t even wait until after the TOC to make a mistake.  Don’t even bother with this."
"This is considerably cheaper than the current edition, but it is NOT the current edition. That is not a problem if you want to read it for its historical value. I read some of the first part (in the Kindle version) before my priest pointed that out. The production quality is very good."
"Im 32 and wanted to start reading the Bible for the new year and complete it as well. And anyway, I’ve tried to read before but always get stuck at Genesis and stop reading. This book along with the guide you choose usually this book as a guide that I found from the internet. Anyway it’s working for me. I haven’t stopped reading and I’m finally understanding what I’m reading. So if your A beginner get this book and figure out the guide you want to use to help you understand the Bible and actually get it"
"Love this book. Quick reference guide. Complete teaching of the Catholic Church. True Catholic law not rumors!! If your Catholic you need this book. I’m Catholic and taught CCD, I received this book when I started teaching. I was shocked at how little I knew about Catholic law. I had to tell many elders in the family they were wrong! They had it all wrong!  This book will blow your mind. If you have kids and want the truth, this is the book. They also sell reference tabs for this book to find quick info. Great gift for teens, newlyweds, parents, and people in need of spiritual up lifting."
This is the book I was searching for but the hardback version  is very small and almost impossible to read.. I ordered the Paperback Version by Doubleday and found it much easier to read.
"Aug 2021 -- Great book! Content is exceptional - true to the Faith and references, cross-referencing and indexing are very welcome and exceptionally useful.  Format is only drawback for me ... good news/bad news:  lots of white space for taking notes if that's you thing; however, print is still not much larger than the much smaller (physically) 'pocket paperback size' Catechism.  Wish they had increased the font size 1-2 pts, that would have earned the 5+ star rating."
"This is a compact edition 7.2 x 4.5 x 1.7 (825 pages) of the larger, more current and easy to use edition 9 x 6.7 x 2 inches (920 pages) by USCCB Publishing. Yet, this is more suitable when travelling and on the road.Nota Bene: This edition was published in April 1995. Although called the Second Edition, this is not therefore the ""Catechism of the Catholic Church: revised in accordance with the official Latin text promulgated by Pope John Paul II"" which was published in April 2000. In fact, there is a proviso on the copyright page that says, ""This translation is subject to the Latin typico edition (editio typica) when it is published.""Anyway, there are a number of different good Catechisms that are in print. To name a few, Father John A. Hardon gave us 

  
The Catholic Catechism: A Contemporary Catechism of the Teachings of the Catholic Church









  
  
    
   and 

  
The Question & Answer Catholic Catechism









  
  
    
  . Archbishop Donald W. Wuerl authored the 

  
Teaching of Christ









  
  
    
   and later 

  
The Gift of Faith: A Question and Answer Catechism Version of the Teaching of Christ









  
  
    
  . Better known as the 

  
Roman Catechism (Resources for catechetical teachers)









  
  
    
  , there is the less known version of 

  
The Catechism of the Council of Trent









  
  
    
  , which has a history like no other.Each of these has its unique format. However, examining the Roman Catechism, one finds it is divided into four parts which correspond to the divisions followed by the Church since early Christian times:1. Catholic belief presented in an explanation of the twelve articles of the Apostles' Creed.2. The seven sacraments are explained at length, instituted by Christ as a means for the living of the demands of faith.3. The Ten Commandments in a New Testament setting showing how Christ brought the Old Law to perfection.4. After a detailed treatise on prayer: its nature, its necessity, and the practice of prayer in general, including an exposition of the seven petitions of the Lord's Prayer.If we look at the new Catechism of the Catholic Church, we notice an apparent likeness in how it corresponds to the format of the Roman Catechism, having four main and similar divisions:1. The Profession of Faith2. The Celebration of the Christian Mystery (and the Sacraments)3. Life in Christ4. Christian PrayerSo, we can say that the new Catechism in many ways is really update of the Roman Catechism and the teachings and practices that Church has clung to throughout the centuries from early Christian times. This gives much credibility to the permanence, and uninterrupted nature of the Church's beliefs, doctrine, and the Christian Life espoused for 2000 years. We could call the Catechism of the Catholic Church a ""Defender of the Faith"" for what it does. It could also be called ""Defender of Scripture"" because it cites Sacred Scripture more than anything else, which certainly takes us back to early Christian times. There are also great references to Vatican II Documents, other Council & Papal documents, plus the writings of the Church Fathers and the Saints. You could say that it ""teaches with authority!"" It is a great reference book, not something the average person will sit and read from cover to cover."
"I recently re-embraced my Catholic roots, started attending chapel during the week and mass on Sunday. So much has changed and yet many things are coming back. After some maturity too, I've learned to see things differently, so many things make much more sense and with the help of this gift I'm feeling even better about my return to my roots. This series was recommended to me by a young man at chapel and my adult kiddos got this for me for Mothers Day. I truly enjoyed every second of this video series.Suzi"
"The hardcover version of the Catechism of the Catholic Church has turned out to be an excellent choice for me.  Well-priced at just under $9 and printed clearly on nice paper, I think this compact version (4-3/4"" x 7-3/8"" x 1-1/2"") will travel well and hold up much better than the paperback, which cost more."
"I had read the book once back when my mind was not so developed and thought I would give it another read. This book is full of valuable information from start to finish, some of which is very hard to find referenced anywhere else as the Vatican guards official records very tightly. It begins appropriately , Speaking of God and man. Our desire to know Him, ways in which he has revealed himself. It speaks of mans ultimate vocation. It speaks of Christ. The scriptures, The Holy Spirit, creation, the fall, heaven and earth. These things it touches on a very general level, yet with truth. It then goes on to elaborate on every word of the creeds of Christendom ( the apostles and the Nicene). It lays out what the individual and the Church believes as a whole.Only after these are put in light to the reader are we informed on the liturgy and brought into the insiders sphere of the church, We touch on the sacraments, baptism, confirmation, the Eucharist , penance and more. Finally we arrive at Life in Christ, this section of the book touches on every subject from man's purpose, to his passions, vices, virtues, sin, social justice, the persons relation to society and government, to the church, to strangers. It then walks us through the 10 commandments in great detail and finally closes with a thorough discussion of Christian prayer.This book is an amazing read and is filled with the insight and wisdom of some of the greatest men in history. The words have more than once brought me to tears.I must admit that I do not believe everything the Roman Catholic Church states nor follow some practices, but if one can tone out the over-admiration and dang near idolatry that for some reason so many Catholics around the world apply to the saints and Mary, almost everything else in this book is spot on and I applaud the Church for putting this fine piece of work together. God Bless all. Praise Jesus!"
"I liked the fact that this book is small, not heavy, clean and concise.  I like the fact that it teaches you about Catholic Church Doctrine and clear cut it is easy to understand.  I learned a great deal about Catholic teachings and it's deepened my Catholic Faith."
"In one book the Church as developed this text after Vatican II, in order to revise it in accordance with the official Latin text promulgated by Pope John Paul II in 1997, and has been enhanced to be more complete, and includes quotations from St. Thomas Aquinas the Great Theologian, which enhance knowledge of our faith tremendously.  Not like the Baltimore Catechism, with it's questions and answers, this format takes the Creed, and the Our Father, the Ten Commandments, and the Sacraments and more, and gives a full understanding about them, and cross references within the Catechism to other sections referring to the same topic, or with footnotes to other sources, or Scripture. ( The footnotes have been fully researched, and printed out in full text in a book called  Companion to the Catechism of the Catholic Church), for ease of researching and reading the topic instantly.  The Church has maintained all its work and teachings and doctrines, Truths, and oral teachings, and liturgical development, consistent over the centuries, and has not omitted anything according to social norms or personal choice by anyone, even bad Popes.  Christ said that ""You are the Rock (leader) and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against her). Thus Christ is the Head of the Church in Heaven, and has given authority to his apostles and down through the ages.  This belief is found in the Catechism of the Catholic Church.  It is written in a format that is not judging, and is an invitation for the reader to come and join Christ in the Body of Christ, His Church.  It is a wonderful source to understand, believe, and to practice one's faith."
"Catechism of the Catholic Church is second only to the Bible in importance to a Catholic as a book of knowledge. It answers almost any question concerning the Churches creed, God's laws (with biblical and modern applications) and the basis of living a fulfilling spiritual life. It serves as both a reference and an interesting book that leaves you to acknowledge that after two thousand years of tradition the Church fathers have gotten it right. Read a little at a time or read it straight through with an open mind and heart and you will find realistic guides to a life that can achieve peace."
"The Catechism of the Catholic Church is a beautiful guide to the faith, replete with scriptural references, and quotes from a variety of women and men whose witness illuminate the vast tradition of the Church."
"I bought this for my son who has left the Catholic Church, but has had a re-awakening to his faith in God's son, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit.  He was very grateful for the gift because it will help him understand the Catholic Church and hopefully he will return to it.  This Catechism has been a great reference book and study guide for me as I become more familiar with God's church.  I have used it extensively in many of the Bible Studies I have taken in the past few years.  I recommend this book to all Catholics, expecially those who are serious about their faith in God and His Church.  Every time I read it, I become more solidly confirmed that the Catholic Church is the one that Jesus Christ himself established before he died on the cross.  Thanks be to God for this gift that has come to us through the church in addition to the Bible which also came to us through the church.  A must read for those who question the authenticity of the Catholic church and anyone else who questions what the Church teaches."
"You get wonderfully lost 'in' this Big Green Book - in the wonder of it all -  when you start to look up something in the Catechism of the Catholic Church.  My husband and I were Converts and, although we knew the Bible very, very well when we came into full-Communion in the Catholic Church, we still had a lot to learn.  We both had our own copies of the Big  Green Book (this one) as well as several copies of the small light weight white one which went into our book bags.  However, this larger Catechism has everything - the best foot notes and an excellent Glossary. The Glossary was written by former Archbishop William Levada, of the Archdiocese of San Francisco Agana,  who is now William Cardinal Joseph Levada, the Prefect of the Congregation of the Faith.  The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith is to promote and safeguard the doctrine on the faith and morals throughout the Catholic world - the former role of our new Pope Benedict XVI.  Cardinal Levada was the only American to work on the new Catechism.My husband always called the Big Green Book a page-turner as he just could not stop reading.  He would pick up the book to look up one thing and keep reading for hours.The Amazon price is so amazingly low and you will find it is a great gift.  Catholics who feel they must defend their faith - which has lasted over 2,000 years - or just want to learn more about what they believe - will want to own this book.  Terrence J. Sexton commented in his review of this Catechism, one of the best comments of all:  ""Fulton Sheen once wrote that there are only a handful of Americans who hate the Catholic Church, though there are millions who hate what they think the Church is.""  I have discovered that many cradle Catholics say they came from a very poorly Catechized time and they, too, need and appreciate this book. Truth, and that is Truth with a capital ""T""  is so clear in this Catechism and topics are all easy to locate.We, unlike any other Christian group, have the Authority of the Church.  It is wonderful to know What we Believe and Why we Believe It.(I wrote this review for Amazon February 4, 2007.  I always like reviewing my own reviews years later to see if I still believe the same thing today - I always do.  This one is about the Catechism of the Catholic Church and it still is a ""page-turner"" in my book!)  Terry Fenwick 2/9/2011"
"This book has helped me understand the Catholic faith like never before. Because of it, I have a renewed reverence of the magnificence of God, a deeper love for the faith, and an understanding of church teaching that I somehow missed in 12 years in parochial school and many a mass homily. So glad I purchased it.  I thought it would be dry and boring, but it was absolutely the opposite. I am filled with joy each time I sit down and read a section.  Don’t hesitate!"
"This is a great resource to have in a time where there is so much discussion as to what is correct in our Faith. When I have a question, I look it up and know I am getting the straight dope. And iIf you read this all the way through, you will be assured of correct doctrine to call on anytime."
"This is NOT your Baltimore Catechism.  Second Edition means that it is the one that follows the First, written at the Council of Trent, 500 years ago, and follows, expanding--not correcting or changing--that teaching.  Christ sent His apostles to TEACH what He taught them; not to figure it out.  This book is what the Catholic Church teaches, in accord with Christ's command to His Church.  The Catholic Church does not make it up as it goes along, but to the everlasting horror of those who want it their way, the Church has written down in concrete what cannot be changed by man; that is, the TRUTH.  This book has no page replacement binder that can accommodate the newest ""teaching"", which has become so popular with those churches that vote on the truth.  Whether you buy this edition today or 1,000 years from now, it will remain valid.Saint John Paul II, who released this beautifully written book and affixed his signature to it, declared it to be a ""true norm""."
"This earlier Catechism is well written and nearly timeless in what it presents. Perhaps the best ever written book on Christianity. I found it better written and easier to understand than the newer catechism, and a good way to prepare for reading the newer version. It is not King James English, straight forward English."
"This 'tome' has over 800 pages, so do not expect a book review in the near future, however, you do not have to be a theologian to recognize the value of the Catechism of the Catholic Church."
"I had second edition.  I don't know if they have correct this typos.  In number 188 ""The Greek work symbolon"" meant..  It should be ""word"" not ""work""."
Letters are too small and the book’s format is makes this book difficult to read
Very nice and has nice hard cover. I like the organization and how the explanations are clearly understood. Love the ease of cross referencing. Good companion to have when you read the Bible so that you get a thorough understanding of the Catholic faith.
"Important resource that every Catholic should have. I'm going through RCIA right now and I enjoy looking into the history, background and traditions of Bible teachings. It's also great when reading the Bible to thumb through the Catechism (and vice versa) to enrich the teachings. My husband and I can spend hours looking up one thing, leading to another... and another."
"This purchase was a gift.  I chose it, having a copy myself, because of its orderly presentation, index, and expanded coverage of each subject.  The topic sounds heavy, but I keep in mind that it can be used  either like a dictionary when information on a topic is needed or when wanting a more thorough coverage in the larger context."
"As a practicing Catholic, this is a must for our household. Beautifully written and meaningfully explains all we believe. Being in communion with the Holy Catholic Church it is incumbent on my family to know the teachings of the Church; It is laid out well, organized for ease of reference. Flipping to any page brings knowledge and graces. When you have a question about the faith, all you need do is look it up and you will find the answer. So much scholarship has gone into this. We are very happy to have this for so many reasons. Don't hesitate to make sure your Catholic home has this essential book. It educates your mind and fills your soul."
"This book provides, in English, the universal catechism of the Catholic Church.  Other catechisms exist (e.g. Baltimore), but besides the Catechism of the Council of Trent, produced centuries ago, there is no other catechism that bears the authority of universal application.This particular edition of the new universal catechism has several features of note.  The catechism is organized by parts, chapters and articles, in some ways similar to the older catechism, but it also has convenient paragraph numberings (in bold).  An index of major themes in the back of the book enables quick reference of specific teachings.  Also beneficial: throughout the work papal, conciliar and Patristic sources for the catechetical words conveniently are footnoted on the same page.The only real issue I have had with the edition I purchased here is that the hardback cover rather soon wore down (along the spine and at the corners, revealing the pulpy cardboard-like material beneath), and I was obliged to use tape to keep the exterior from deteriorating further.  Oddly, I have had a similiar problem with the Book of Concord."
"This is a great compact version of the inspiring and uplifting modern day Cathechism that is NOT your grandmother's catechism.  Incredible!  This catechism teaches about God and His Church, Jesus and salvation history more deeply and thoroughly than anything else I have come across.  It is inspiring.  A lot of knowledge in a compact book!  I highly recommend it."
"It's hard reading, most have an understanding of the Catholic religion."
"This book is a must have for any Catholic. If you want to read it online you can go the Vatican's own web site and read it or print it out. However, having a copy of your own that is well made and clearly printed is a must for any Catholic. Why? It is because most Catholics have no idea where to go to get a full document of the stated beliefs of the Catholic religion. Well, my friend, this is it! Finally we have the authoritative teachings of the Catholic Church written down in one large book. That's what this book is. It has taken a long time for this document to come about. It was fought for and Pope John Paul the second finally made it happen.I will warn you, it is very long and very wordy. It is a scholarly work to say the least. If you have ever read the works of St. Thomas Aquinas then you will have some idea of what caliber this book is. It is not a question and answer session as many other books are. Instead, this book takes you from step one to step 100 in standard book format so that it is as clear as possible given the complexity of the subject matter. It will take you some time to read, at least it is me. But it was worth every penny.If you want to know more about being a Catholic then definitely get this book and read it. If you are running a Catechism class or teaching young ones then as well get this book and use it. That's why it was made. This book was created to teach you what we as Catholics believe. It is worth gold. Use it in conjunction with the Bible."
A must read for Catholic’s and non Catholic’s alike.So many people has misconceptions about the Catholic Church and its teaching even most Catholic’s though they probably fall into the cultural or habitual category.
It’s everything you need to know about the Catholic Church. It’s a heady read in places but it explains the beliefs of the Church. The print is almost too small for me to read but I’m managing. The affordability of this copy is why I bought it.
"I used to practice Catholicism/Christianity the first 33 1/2yrs of my life until 4 yrs ago when I found out the truth and totally left Catholicism/Christianity. If you want the truth, every catholic and non-catholic should have this book. It's not gonna be what you think it is. This book is for TRUTH SEEKERS/RESEARCHERS. When they put the truth 💯 right in your face and only blind eyes can't see it."
"This book is all you need to learn about Catholicism. Extremely well organized and written clearly and easily understandable.  If there is one book you need about being a Catholic, it is this book. It's wonderful!"
"Easy to read.  Anyone claiming Catholicism as their religion of faith should read this and the Bible in its entirety.  How else can one fully understand, support, and share the saving grace of Jesus, or answer questions of faith?"
"For anyone wanting to know what the Roman Catholic Church really teaches and believes, as opposed to all the misinformation that is out there, then the Cathechism of the Catholic Church is for you.  It is long and very thorough covering literally everything that the Catholic church teaches from the immaculate conception to abortion, contraception and homosexuality.  It is more of a ""everything the church teaches and believes in a nut shell"" book. You can always look up more in depth references such as ""Humanae Vitae"" if you want to read the in-depth teachings of subjects, but the CCC gives an outstanding overview of the church and covers everything a catholic must believe in order to be in full communion with the church. Highly recommended reading!!!"
"I should've researched a little more before buying this... I liked this one because it's small and could fit in a purse easily, but I really needed something with the Compendium in it for a bible study I'm doing."
Words are too small to read. Tried to return but it is past the return window.
"Enjoyed the book, especially the section on prayer. It's major flaw is in its formatting, in order to look like the hardback, the Kindle version retained the paragraph numbers off to the side making the actual content use half the screen forcing me to read in landscape mode and making text to speech a problem.Now that I have read it all the way through, I have downloaded a file with the Catholic Bible and Catechism divided into 365 parts to read them both in a year."
When first reading this I realized how important education in the format of the Catholic Church is to be strong and rooted in the Mother Church.  Faith can unfortunately wane when pressed with so much hostility towards the Church on the outside world.  If you know both sides especially the pros then you can stay rooted in your faith when the Mother Church is bombarded with scandals.The Compendium and the Catechism were shipped together and came on time.  Both were in perfect shape.I have to say that if you want to understand and not feel over burdened with dogma you are not familiar with get the Compendium.  Without it I would have shelved the book.  This is a must half in this Year of Faith.
I purchased this book to go along with my bible studies and my spiritual direction classes.  This book is so very valuable and has a wealth of information about the Catholic Church and her teaching.  It is a wonderful reference book and one to be added to your spiritual book collection.  This is a book that I know that I will be using for years and my children also will get a lot of use out of this book.  I have the hard copy but decided to get the kindle version as it would be easier to carry to class.
"The Official exposition of the truths of the Catholic Faith. Here are all the questions you may have wanted to ask. Its the universal document of the Catholic Church and surprisingly readable. The authors were well aware that they wanted you to be able to move through the message easily. I was surprised that the Church also encouraged countries to create their own national catechisms to include profiles of their own local saints and inclusive of their perspectives on the faith. If you want to really know about Catholicism, here is the place to rest and take it all in."
"The Catholic Church has a wonderful philosophical theological history. It shows in this Catechism.  Please don't listen to the ""Media's' or many others interpretation of what the Church teaches. Go to the Source!.  This is a compendium of Catholic doctrine. It is not an ""easy"" read as we are used to in our modern life.  Taking small daily doses, or looking up relevant subjects of interest is one way to study this book.. Or join a discussion group"
It's hard for me to read.  I skimmed over it a lot.  Read in detail the parts I was interested in.
"The book itself is in excellent condition! And this is one of the greatest books of all time, next to the Holy Bible! Explains Catholic theology well! All people interested in religion should read! All Catholics should read to understand our own religion! Everyone should read, as it explains well why the Catholic Church teaches what it teaches! Absolutely stunning!"
"Excellent Educational Review and Reference. A good source for answers about the faith of the catholic church, and good review for the elders who have been away from catechism for a while."
This is ONLY useful on kindle for the word search.  The green cover version makes better use of kindle formatting.  Neither allow one to search for CCC numbered paragraph citations.The tan cover kindle was free as a Kindle MatchBook 'purchase'.
"Every Catholic should have a copy of the Catechism. It keeps one rooted and reminded of the Truths in the Church's deposit of faith and helps serve as guide in the way we lead our everyday lives. Promulgated in 1992, matters of faith and morality are explained in the contest of today's realities and issues as we understand and encounter them.The most important explanations and answers to one's own and other Catholics questions about his Faith are found in this comprehensive volume: Holy Tradition, real presence, doctrine of the BVM, the Paschal Mystery, etc. This CCC is the most complete and the official CCC of the Church. All other new Catechism books are (or should be) derived from this one.  A bit heavy reading though. And it might take time before one finishes the entire tome and could be difficult at some portions. The language is a bit difficult especially for ordinary persons like me who have may not have had formal lessons in theology. Many words used are a bit unfamiliar. However, this should not stop anyone from reading it. A solution would be to read the Compendium or any other shorter forms of the Catechism written in simpler language. The CCC can thus be used as a ""resource"" or ""reference"" book when one wants more detailed or deeper explanation of things. Every Catholic should have at least read the CCC once as a ""refresher"" or introductory course.The small-sized Doubleday printing of the 2nd edition is a handy companion to the Roman Daily Missals that provide cross references to the Catechism. It's a good copy to keep on hand for meditation or reflection purposes. (It has enough content to help in meditation.) The binding looks sturdy enough to last a long time and carry along. Convenient enough to carry around and squeeze into tiny spaces in the car.My problem with this printed version is that the texts are too small worse with the footnotes), not at all reader-friendly. The texts are even smaller than the ones in the tiny missal I use. I can hardly see anything when I used it under subdued lighting. The publishers might have missed out some practical aspects of the Catechism's uses. If you need the Catechism for other purposes like a reference for writing or research, this printed version is a bit troublesome to use. Unlike the small missals, it doesn't stay open when you lay it out on your desk for reading. No space for writing side notes for study. Still, I purchased the copy I needed to have a copy of the Catechism (2nd edition); unfortunately, it is the only one available at Amazon when I bought it.If not for this inconvenience and as there are many alternative copies by other publishers, I would have given it 5 stars."
"A book that should be a staple in every catholic home. Our son is discerning priesthood, and this is a book he had on his Christmas list. He has yet to put it down"
"When Jesus said to Peter ""Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven..."" (Matthew 16:29) he wasn't talking about a book being bound -- necessarily -- but he could have been -- because the result of that charge is bound in this book. Or, put it more accurately what Peter, the Apostles, and those that that succeeded them...what they decided under the infallible guidance of the Holy Spirit (John 16:13...he will lead you into ALL truth)...is documented in this book. This is what Jesus was talking about. And to think that for a few bucks, you can have your own indexed, hardbound, edition. That is perhaps not a miracle, but it's pretty incredible. If left stranded on  a deserted island, this is the book you want...along with a Bible."
"Perfect, but made me look like a smarty pants at confirmation class.Seriously felt like a teacher's pet.  Mission accomplished, but now I'm worried they're going to bring in a priest to tone me down.  Too much truth for the audience."
This is a must have for any Catholic or anyone interested in the Catholic Church. It's a real world guide for understanding the positions of the Church on issues we all face in modern times. My family has referenced it many times. Don't just trust what people say the positions of the Church are. Sadly our society has skewed the views to demonize the Church. Use this books to actually see what the real positions are. It's very well cross referenced with the biblical reason why.
There is nothing to dislike. I like to learn about the different religions of the world and read about their alike-ness and different-ness.
"This book is essential reading for anyone who wishes to know about the Catholic Church and its teachings. Albeit a little small in terms of dimensions, it thus allows me to carry it around."
No wonder all the priests are going back to the Council  of Trend Catachism.  This book is fantastic and has a list of Authors and Credits that are way awesome.  Just great to learn the Catholic Faith.
"This Catechism, Replaced one that Deb the land lady stole. i cant stand stealers."
"These books are cheap and very well built with all the info you could possibly want about the Catholic Church.  So, that is cools"
"This book stimulates the mind and nurtures the soul. It is highly intellectual but also deeply spiritual. It is not, however, difficult to comprehend. Anyone who hopes to gain a basic understanding-- a true understanding-- of the teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church should read this book. It also serves as an excellent reference book for Catholic individuals or families who need to look up official doctrines on important subjects.This book is a paperback but is a high-quality book nonetheless. The typeset is especially pleasing to the eye. It feels good in the hands, too, which is important, I think, for anyone who intends to read it cover-to-cover."
"As a newly Baptized Catholic, having this available on my Kindle has been simply wonderful.Over two thousand years of contemplation from some often tremendous minds gives you a straight forward presentation of the Catholic Church and its foundation, the Holy Word of God."
"I am a convert and the Catechism is a great resource to show people that the Catholic Church does NOT worship Mary, idols, or saints. It does not teach that you have to earn your salvation. It does NOT teach that everyone is going to Heaven. It is NOT OK to use artificial contraception.Do not worry about what you might hear about the Catholic Church or what some individual Catholics might ""say"" the Church teaches, even if they are priests or bishops. Many are just not well catechised or they are in rebellion. Find out for yourself in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. This one is a good edition b/c it contains an index in the back so you can look up topics you are interested in."
Great condition & informative book.
"I purchased this version of the Catechism to replace the original first edition by Ligouri Press that I had before (ahem) ""lending"" it to someone a few years ago and never getting it back.  I miss that first edition for a number of reasons, not the least of which were my rather copious margin notes and highlights I had made, as well as it's overall heft.  The only downside was that they subsequently did some revisions and issued a separate addendum containing the corrections.  For the record, that addendum always stayed with the main book and is presumed ""missing"" along with its main volume.  Without getting too bogged down in the history of the book, the First Edition was based largely (if not exclusively) on the French translation of the Catechism.  Once they completed the Latin version and began cross-checking, they discovered a number of linguistic inadequacies that were later addressed through the addendum then through subsequent issuances (like this one.)I was pleased to find this 2nd edition printing available (in hard cover, no less) for such a decent price.  And to be certain, it is indeed the ""revised"" (based on the Latin text) version of the new Catechism. The reality of things hit me as soon as I pulled the volume from the box it shipped in.  This edition is at least 1.5-2 inches smaller in both height and width than it's Ligouri predecessor.  It also seems a skosh thinner than I remember the original being.  I'm guessing this is due to smaller margins and MUCH smaller typeface, as well as some apparent content that was trimmed from this edition (primarily indices).The book does seem to be well constructed; the binding is tight, the leaves appear clean-cut and a casual pass-through noted no noticeable bleeds, smudges or mis-registers.  Aside from my expectations with regard to dimensions, it seems to be a nice, solid publication.  The 4-star rating was for the overall size of the volume and typeface.  The Catechism itself receives a solid 5-stars for content, and will likely be the Catholic Church's legacy to future generations for many, many years to come."
"This is perfect for Catholic RCIA classes, although the print could be a little bigger. Good size for carrying to class."
A must have for all Catholics. We love referring to it. With many different Catechisms we weren't sure which to buy. It's exactly what we wanted.
We're Living in Strange Times - Up is Down n Down is UpThis Book is the Dogma of the Christian Church which can Not changebecause of a Passing Fancy or a Pope in Power.  This is a Compass foryour Family to keep True to God's Word.This is the Best addition - be careful what books you do buy -Must be printed years ago. Nothing current can be trusted anymore.God Bless you - Keep The Faith
As a copy of the Catechism this cannot be beat for price.  The book is quality and hold up well to reading and highlighting as needed
Wish we had gotten this 40 years ago. Would have definitely helped with conscientious and correct voting choices
Don’t buy this one.  Get the green one.
Product as described. Good service. Thank You. Highly recommend.
I purchased the Catechism Of The Catholic Church at the recommendation of my Bible study group. I was not disappointed. I did not rate 5 stars because I purchased the Kindle version and I found it a little cumbersome to navigate through. My sister has the book and of course it's much easier to flip through the book to find the page your looking for than it is to flip through pages on a kindle when you don't know the exact location or page you need to locate.
"Very disappointed, the cover was different from what was advertised. I’m not sure if I received the same book."
"Raised Roman Catholic, for most of my life I've described myself as more spiritual than religious. Recent events in my life have triggered my curiousity to ask, ""Why?"" and, ""Where did this come from?"" in a number of areas. The book has turned out to be both easy to read and easy to search through.I easily found several references to answer my first question - and each explanstion references supporting material from elswhere in the book and/or in the Bible. That's very refreshing from a research standpoint.In addition, it's so easy to read, I've begun the process of reading it cover to cover. Good book to have in one's collection."
"I love the hardcover CCC.  It's much nicer than the paperback, stitched binding, good quality.  Paper quality is nice."
"As a Catholic, I am not here to review the content, which of course is wonderful and essential reading for every Catholic and every human being who wants to understand what the Church professes in our own words. But as for this particular edition, I recommend it. It is very portable, good hardcover, good paper quality, the font is nicely sized and easy to read. And vey importantly, easy to find a paragraph as the numbers are clearly listed in bold font at the margins of each page. Get this version and use it as a reference for many years!"
"Amazon, thank you a very fast service.  I am a cradle Catholic and I need to know my religion fully.  We have many traditions, however, I need to know the meaning my church beliefs."
"This book is the best authority on the teachings of the Catholic Church. I have been a catechist for the last year and thus far used the books provided by the church to teach. With the CCC I feel more secure in the information I use to answer my student's questions about their faith. The whole text is so well organized, first by the four pillars of  the church, then subdivided therein, and each paragraph is numbered (so that when you reference it you only need to state CCC and paragraph number), and finally each paragraph has a list of other paragraphs within that relate directly to that paragraph. I have found that it is not only for teaching my students, but through reading it my own faith has grown... reference CCC 94! ;DThe text itself is a little bulky, but you can purchase it as an at home study text and while on the go, the publisher USCCB has the entire text on their website for reference.I have not used it yet, but the reference index and appendices at the end (almost the last third of the text) are very detailed and I'm sure will be helpful in the future.Overall, A great purchase for all catechists and great for anyone curious about the church and hoping to strengthen their faith!"
"After learning about this book, I wanted to look into what exactly it contained. I found it to be an easy read. I have to admit I like to read parts in the book of interest to me over and over. The Catechism is very helpful in understanding the Catholic Church teaching. I have given one as a gift to a non catholic friend who wants to know more about the church.  I will purchase this again and again and highly recommend the book if you are looking for truth."
"I think this has been a great Gift given us by The Holy Spirit through The Magisterium of The Catholic Church to The World.  It gives us a deeper image of God and us.  It stands in the forefront of the unwavering doctrine that concerns us all with a most permeating and most ""ethereal"" question on earth.  Who are we and what are we here for?  What is our purpose?  It gives us ""ideals"" to reach for, and a purpose to be patient to hear and to listen to It's words.  It doesn't judge anyone but judges actions and indeed to some it may feel as if it's intentions of those actions are to bring a kind of mistaken teaching that there does exist in this world a kind of ""spirit"" in which exists a misleading pleasure of things not intended to be ""eaten of"" or even tasted lest we fall.....again.  But isn't it something that could consider it a possibilty to ""come and see"" what some of us may not wish to hear and listen, at the same time we desire the same from ""it""----To be listened to?  This is from a Fullness of Truth told not from a personality but from The Divine who brought us into being for a reason as a kind of light that sheds truth, as severe as would if one were to stand and stare at the beauty of the sun which gives us warmth and comfort, but also can destroy our eyes at the same time and also teaches us to show great respect for eachother of which we may agree or not of an assurance or credibility that we all have a responsibility to extend to eachother from our fellow members in the human race.  Does it intruct?  I hope so.  For it is what it is, a Truth as Old as The Age, and even though historically it can reach only 2000 years, it speaks out to us in clarity, genuine desire to appeal to an odor of that unquenching desire on the lips of us all to be, to live ""Fully"", and to understand a hope that comes and moves beyond the mere existence of our own mortality.  And to remember what Jesus said that, (whom respectively He is The Saviour, The Prophet, or just a good man) ""To Whom Much Is Given, Much Will Be Required""."
"No words can describe this book. Its like having an encyclopedia. All the information and questions you ever had will cease as you read. The table of contents is perfect and so easy to follow. Whatever you want to know you can go to  the articles and find the information in simple language. You will love the "" Index of Citations"" It list the Sacred Scriptures each book of the bible in relations to what you are reading. That's wonderful!"
"The index is basically useless when looking things up for me. It's set up in a unique way. Make sure you read the note in the beginning of the index. And it will explain it. Other then that. I flip through it and find it riviting. It's great to understand things more in depth as a Catholic, and will certainly help my faith be in a better direction. This is a must have for any Catholic. It's just understanding the index that is the problem. Other then that. great explaination of the commandments, and the prayer our father, and understanding the human condition."
"Enlightening read for all Catholics. The Church' playbook for all issues. Amazing how many Catholics haven't read the Catechism., including me until now."
It’s a very interesting an enlightening book It’s helping me inner stand Catholicism and answer some of my questions as I get more involved in my religion.
"Material is fine, using it via Kindly not so much.  Many times you want to refer to numbered sections of the Catechisms and there is really no easy access.  A simple goto would solve...but not the way my kindle works...the newer versions of kindle may allow - I do not know.  I likely will order a paper version.On the material itself...this is my first real exposure to the Catechisms and they are amazing.  A wonderful insight into the deep thinking of the Catholic Church and Biblical interpretation and reflections.  Very inspiring.  A great work."
"The Catechism of the Catholic Church is, in my heart and mind, only eclipsed by Sacred Scripture from which it draws truth, in enlightening and teaching the reality of Church established by Jesus.  Not meant to be polemical here, just stating what I've found the book to do since becoming Catholic.  I wouldn't be without it.This version is especially good because it is well made, fits in the hand nicely, and the print is the right size to make it more readable than the smaller paperback version I had before it."
"I would highly recommend the book.  I have had the pleasure of reading  the Spanish version (5 years ago) and have decided to read the English version now.  I ordered 2, one for a gift and the person whom I gave it to told me she can really understand this versus the Bible.  It is not a replacement of course but rather highlights importance scriptures and categorizing concepts such as Virtues, Sacraments, Holy Order, and so much more.  I cannot say I am a devote Catholic or even Protestant as I was mostly around but I could say that great reading is easily identifiable by any follower of Jesus Christ.  Buy more than one, I will be definetly, God willing, purchasing more for gifts this year."
This is an excellent source reference that belongs in every theologian’s library!  Go for it!
Perfect resource for Catholic or someone wanting to know more.  Great price.
"The text is the same.  My rating is based on the use of the book as a reference.  There is no easy and reliable search by paragraph numbers that are cited.  Given the number of the paragraph, you must search the same way you search a physical book-- by opening pages and noting whether the paragraph is to the left or the right of the page you are looking at.  This is slower on a ebook than a real book."
I bought it for my granddaughter who is teaching Catechism at church.
Very satisfied with the product and service I received from seller!!
Spiritual guidance proves to be instructional and lending towards questions and discussions
"This Catechism provided many answers for questions I had and some answers to questions I never knew I had.  It is truly informative and a solid foundational explanation of the Catholic Church and the beliefs it has been established upon.  A great read for all of those who seek and who want to know why their faith is what it is and why they do what they do during mass.  It is revealing, inspirational, and able to fill in gaps one may have or may never have known they had.  One of the best books I have ever read and one that will never, ever get old."
"A book with all we Catholics need to know, the answers are here."
"I don't agree with all this, but it is a good 756-page ""summary"" of Catholic doctrine.  Although I'm no Catholic, this book and An Exposition of the Christian Faith by John of Damascus are the best writings on the Trinity that I've seen to date.  How blind of us Protestants to ignore such teachings, and spend at least as much time preaching about the tithe as about the Trinity."
I'm not catholic but the product is in great condition. Will be useful to learn about catholic doctrine.
"I was raised catholic for the first 11 years of my life before i got tossed around the system and various foster homes. now that I'm older I'm trying to regain my roots, and understanding Catholicism. i took the chatechism when i was young, but i didn't remember much of it, i got that out of this book; plus some other stuff that wasn't included when i was young, some of that is stem cell and infertility alternatives."
Lots of info and easy to find subjects but book is too thick for its size hard to hold open to read
"I like this catechism for the size and the easy to read print. It is wonderful to be able to look up any questions I have about the teachings of the Catholic Church and to learn how the Church's teachings coincides with the bible. Once I realize the reason for the teachings, it makes a lot of sense to me."
"It is a strange and abiding foible to assume knowledge without inquiry. The Catechism of the Catholic is, literally, an open book. Agree or not, what the Church teaches and why She teaches what She does is as fully bared as can be in as many pages as there are. For those who ask the same questions, time after time, yet make no effort in finding proper answers, here is an opportunity to satisfy genuine curiosity."
"Doesn’t have glossary like the green edition, but it is absolutely gorgeous."
"Excellent and updated. However, this version is a bit big compared to other's versions in my Bible Study class. Art gives it an added dimension. Type is large enough to read easily. The Catechism is a wonderful guide to learn about the Catholic faith. I recommend giving it a try, especially for use in group study."
"Excellent Book , I’m enjoying the reading on my kindle."
"Genius distilled into a few words --- the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Union with God & his Son, Jesus Christ, spelled out on paper in a how-to form.  The Catholic Church HAS THE TOOLS AND THE GRACE AND THE MERCY to get your eternal soul back to glorious, eternal union with the Creator of the Universe. Death is but a doorway to Glory if you've allowed your soul to be awakened, cleansed, educated and reborn into the Kingdom of He who adorns the flowers far more beatifully than your finest garments.  If He cares so much for the flowers, how much more does He care for you, O Man, made in his image, given free will to choose Him or not?  Read the Catechism...make sure you are educated for YOUR BIG Eternal Choice.  God Bless You."
"I read Peter Kreeft's ""Catholic Christianity"" before this. I knew I would need to read this, for my Catholic journey. I'm not saying that they would make me, I'm saying that I wanted to be an inquiring mind doing a proper inquiry. It isn't that hard and I can now appreciate what it means to be a Catholic by having done my own due diligence. There is beauty here, don't allow any one else to tell you what a Catholic is. This book is where you find out on your own."
I love this book. A must-have for every catholic’s collection
What can you say? Great price. If you don't have one of these on hand now's the time. Put it next to your Bible. And if you think you know how a Roman Catholic thinks -- buy this and let any possible misconceptions evaporate as you are pulled closer to God.
An embarrassing read. Trent should be retracted! Why hasn’t it been.
Needed it for catechism classes. Great durability
Oh my goodness! Thick as a phone book! But has everything you need to know in it.
This was a gift for a young man who loves to read the bible. He was very thankful.
It's very informational about the Faith. Get a lot from it...
This book answers every question one has about the Catholic  faith.
easy to read (not super tiny print)
Bought this used and it was like it was brand new.  Great reading for everyone.
Great book.  Handy to have it in ebook format.  Easy to access.
Great book for brushing up on your faith while helping the little ones learn.
Was as described. My only complaint was that it was put into a shipping box that was near the exact same size as the bol causing some creases to the cover and pages.
"If you have ever had the privilege of visiting St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican in Rome, you know it is better in person than all the raves you had heard at home, and i felt the same way as i read through, or prayed, the CCC for my second time, beginning my 3rd time tomorrow.  (for fundamentalists, i do the same thing with the Bible.)As you might know, the Catechism is divided into 4 main parts:  Doctrine, following the Creed; Celebrating the Doctrine, following the 7 sacraments; Morality, following the 10 Commandments; and Prayer.  I found each section not only informative, but actually poetic.  You could easily bring the CCC on a retreat, and meditate on nothing else.  While i expected that the doctrine would be precisely stated, i was surprised by how often its language became colloquial, almost folksy, especially in the last section on prayer.  The CCC centers on the Person of Jesus Christ, leading us to his Father, us connecting to them in the Holy Spirit.  I found many provocative phrases which caused me to look at the same mysteries from different perspectives.  Virtually every line in my copy is highlighted.Of course, the CCC is not like the old Baltimore Catechisms, so buyer beware. the CCC well summarizes how the Documents of Vatican II are essentially and intimately connected to the Church's teaching handed down by the Apostles. It is primarily for priests and educated lay people, especially those who will 'break it down' for children or adult education.  While Pope John Paul II promulgated the book, and thus in one sense is its author, it was undoubtedly researched by a committee, chaired by JPII's successor, Benedict XVI.Read it, study it,pray it, meditate not only on the CCC, but the realities under the words, and enjoy!"
"The most comprehensive and basic at the same time, this large tome covers everything you need to know to choose to be catholic or Catholic or Christian or wanderer.  No one reading and thinking about this book will come away unchanged for life (and for the better)."
"This was supposed to be brand new, but it came with a hole in it and ink or dirt smudged on the front. I am a bit disappointed at the quality."
Came new and intact.  Would order again.
A good catechism will keep in mind this discertation!
Used it very frequently during bible study. Perfect size.
While I'm still in the process of reading this book I am thoroughly enjoying it and learning alot!!! Great for all Catholics who want to know more about why the Catholic church does and says some of the things it does!
"I love the CCC! Whatever question you have about Catholic Church practices is explained here. After taking a religious ed course toward my certification, I went home and shared what I had learned that day. We had a question about organ donation because we had been discussing cremation, and I was able to find the Catholic stance on both. Since purchasing this for myself, I gave it as a gift for a family member who was in RCIA."
"The Catechism is a reference which should be available in any Catholic home.  I have both the Kindle and hard copy, which is about 2 inches thick.  The Kindle Edition provides portability. plus it can be copied for use in electronic documents.  Index is useful for quickly locating a topic.  While this Catechism differs substantially from the classic Baltimore Catechism in terms of format, is complete and informative."
Small and precise.
Came right on time and has been a huge blessing to have this information in hand at this time!
"The content seems to be all here, but navigation is a problem.  This book, like most documents of the Catholic Church, should be organized around paragraph numbers.  But this Kindle edition doesn't know that.  The only way to go to a paragraph is to search for its number, and then there are many hits and you have to guess to figure out which one you want.  Another problem is that the related paragraph numbers (in the margins) are just numbers and are not links to those paragraphs.  So I'll stay with the paper edition for most things."
"This is a great guide not just for Catholics, but for others to educate themselves on the church, its beliefs, traditions.  Every Christian should read the Catechism and every Catholic should have one in their homes.  It is a reference guide for all questions regarding the Lord and the Church.  You will learn much from this book and understand the rules of God and the Church."
Give more knowledge of the Catholic Churches teachings. I felt that after reading this book it made it easier to understand the Bible
"i'm early on, but it's a lot easier to read than i expected. seems like a must read for a Catholic."
"Raised Catholic, don't know why I've never had this book!"
"I was looking for an authentic version at a reasonable price and this delivers.  If you are looking for a true understanding of Catholicism and don't mind putting serious effort into studying this lengthy publication, this is the version to get."
Item as described
Use this book all the time with my Bible study and with questions I have that concern the Catholic Church!
My husband ordered this as a gift for someone.  My husband thought it was a good book
Great read on the process required to becoming catholic
"We keep giving away our copy of this book to those who want to know more about the church.  As a result, we keep buying replacements.  There is so much more that we Christians have in common belief than there is disagreement that it helps Catholics and other Christians to understand each other better."
"Awesome study guide, easy to read and convenient to take anywhere. This is a great good resource and reference guide to the Catholic faith."
This book provides explanations for various dogmas of the faith.  It's an excellent resource for those looking for answers about the faith.  A reader doesn't have to be Catholic to find this book helpful.
SMALL PRINT HARD TO READ.  I DOWNLOADED KINDLE VERSION INSTEAD
good reading
Needed for review of doctrine.
great book
"In today's society there are vast misunderstandings of what the Catholic Church is and what the Church teaches.Fulton Sheen once said ""There are not one hundred people in the United States who hate The Catholic Church, but there are millions who hate what they wrongly perceive the Catholic Church to be.""For 10 bucks I see no reason why everyone shouldn't own this well-written, well-organized overview of Church teaching."
"Received it in good shape, well made. It is large but needs to be for the all the information it includes. There is not only the catechism but footnotes and quotes from the Church Fathers as it refers to a teaching of the church."
Excellent
"It's a catechism. Good font, good paper, good binding."
A clear and comprehensive treatment of the things every Roman Catholic should know about his or her faith.
"I needed this book for one of my college courses, and it is hands down one of the handiest books one can you. It is very knowledgeable and has an extensive amount of information for any type of person"
This is my favorite version of the CCC- hardcover so it doesn't rip or break at the binding as much as the paperback. Also it  is just a nice compact size so I could carry it with my Bible without feeling too weighed down.
"I have placed the order and it didn't arrive at the latest delivery date. So I contacted Amazon Chat Room service to check the status. The rep. thus refunded the amount for delivery, and promised to allow for a free reorder in case the book I would get is in bad condition. I felt reassured for the caring service provided. When I did get the book, it is in the best condition. I have great gratitude for the service and the book. I recommend Amazon for those looking for buying books through online media. I can tell that Amazon must provide the best service for those reasonable problems. I am also using Kindle as well.For the book, it is a must have for those yearning for a fulfilling catholic live. The content is in plain english and very easy to read. I think the book helps only determined by  people who carry out or not the credo from the book and so discipline their lives accordingly. I do hope that anyone studying this book will get better for their own spiritual lives. And for those turning back from strayed directions would use this book to guide their lives' perspectives."
I received a caechism but not this one don't like it.
"I should have looked at the measurements as listed.  The content is superb, but this small book doesn't look good as a gift."
Good reference
"Highly recommended for anyone, Catholic or non-Catholic, who wants to know more about what the Catholic Church teaches. Excellently cross-referenced with the writings of the early church fathers and other apostolic and papal documents. Vivat Jesus!"
"Excellent hard cover copy of the Catechism.  It’s significantly smaller than the more commonly seen green paperback version, but is word for word the same.Highly Recommended."
Great
The Catechism seems all there but I wish I could have found it in bigger print.
"This book is great! Good price and very handy to have around. Convenient size too. Would definitely recommend. It has helpful ""Contents"" section in beginning and ""Subject info"" sections in the back."
A masterpiece of thought! Uses reason to present truth.
This is a great book for bible study!
Good quality.
This is a must to have in every catholic home. Love reading this.
Using the book for my private study!
"I would be lost without this book!  This book explains the Catholic Faith in terms those of us who had horrible Catechesis growing up can understand.  This book has helped me understand and grow in my faith and makes me appreciate more than ever, being Catholic."
"If your learning the catholic religion, this is a must have.  I chose this one, because my church uses this book in the learning classes"
"IT is a must have for Catholic christian, it teaches the basic principles to be a good christian. it is a knowledge to know the laws  of GOD which simple supposed to be, for a willing and able to be a good citizen of the world."
"Exactly what I wanted at the right price.  It is a must have resource for catholics.  I know that it is available online, but I love to read it on the printed page. Nothing can replace a book."
It is exactly what I needed for my Bible Study Group
Good
bought it for a friend hope he reads it
I have this near my bedside and my go to when I’m unsure what to do. Easy to read and understand. gift this to all Catholics.
Nice reference for my reading. My pages were turned down in the middle of the book.
This book answered all of my questions and provided me information. Right to the point and guidance for more research on you topics/research.
I had been looking for a good affordable copy
Book came with pages folded inside when edges were cut. Should have been caught by quality control.
Wonderful text. Just as described.
An indispensable resource for those new to the faith and those who are cradle-Catholic.
"This is what all Catholics need. Good little Catechism. Not expensive and explains what the Catholic faith is all about. If you want to learn what the Catholic faith is all about, then this is the book for you. It explains everything and in easy style that is not hard to understand. Definitely worth getting."
"Anyone who wants to know what Catholics really believe should have a copy of this book.  It is easy to read, has an excellent index so one can find almost any topic.  I recommend it as a reference manual, but it is good reading also."
If you want an answer to almost any Theological question this Catechism of The Roman Church has an answer for everything and it is well written. You may or may not agree with them but if you agree with their first premise than you must agree with their conclusion. If you accept that Religion is the interpretive practice of Theology than this Catechism is a wonderful reference for any Christian Religion. This Catechism is a bright light illuminating the darkness falling over some Christian Religions of today.
"Thought I was ordering the regular paperback. Still good, I just don't care for the size."
"The truths of the Catholic faith with answers and applications to every moral issue and life question, from the teaching authority of the magisterium. Although it is probably not intended to be a narrative to read, rather an indispensible reference for serious Christians, the beginning section on prayer is beatiful. It is bound to help everyone who reads it deepen their prayer life and relationship with our Lord."
Purchased for bible study.  I like having paper copy for bible study. Side note: font size appears to be 10/11. I could not find large font CCC text anywhere online.
Teaching Confirmation II to 11 graders and as they were confirmed I gave them classes on those CCC (Catechism of the Catholic Church) notes they see so often and gave them advise about talking to our Christian friends with this book they read and show what Catholics believe in addition to the Bible. Received in time and nice package from this supplier.
"Tiny is good if you have good eyesight because it is very compact and takes up very little room.  For those who really want a compact catechism.  The pages obviously do not stay open on their own because of how small it is, but the hard cover makes it last.  Recommended."
A must have book to carry with you!
As Described! Seller Is Reliable!
"Wonderful, completely exhaustive book. My review however is more on the physical part... I didn't realize this is a smallish book, not traditionally sized -  with very stiff binding. It's not really the lay-in-bed and read it cover to cover type of book, but rather would be good as a reference. I am going to order a larger one that is easier to read with larger pages. I do not have problems w my eyesight btw!"
Referred from video.  Great price
"Like other versions of the ""Catechism"" this edition provides me with the resource for which I was looking.  While for ease of use I prefer the large green cover edition, this smaller, more compact version does provide for easy transport and accessibility for use and research ""on the move""."
"This newest Catechism takes time and diligence in study. Far from other issues, it describes in the fullest manner the beliefs and practices of the Catholic Church. It goes to great lengths in explaining why things are the way they are. Not only a study of current practices but also the history of the Mother Church. It is a must for Catholics or those desiring to become Catholic."
Though a dated edition the book is in excellent shape and very useful as a resource for me as RCIA member.
"The Catechism of the Catholic Church is a wonderful reference book to find out about Catholic beliefs and why Catholics believe what they do.  There are so many misconceptions about Catholicism, and this is a wonderful way to clear them.  It is a beautifully written and easily understood testament to the faith.  I highly recommend it for both Catholics and those who are interested in Catholicism."
"I bought two of these books, one for my mother and one for my grandmother. My grandmother is becoming Catholic and my mom is becoming Confirmed. They both loved it. My grandmother showed the book to everyone in their class and bragged about how nice of a book it was. The priest even said that the book was wonderful and every Catholic should have one. She truly enjoys reading it and I think it's a wonderful book at a wonderful price."
This Catechism of the Catholic Church is great.  When you go to the back of the book and look for subjects you simply click on the subject or paragraph number and it brings you to the desired content.
Excellent gift for confirmation
something every catholic should own and have access to.  It answers many questions about our faith.
"Having the desire to learn every aspect of Christianity possible, I began my quest towards Catholicism. Having little knowledge on the doctrine and procedures, I purchased other books first. This is the one you must have to even consider converting. Although it doesn't really explain what a non-Catholic must do to convert,(I would recommend SURPRISED BY TRUTH for all the details involved),it is certainly an excellentplace to start. I found it very interesting and fairly easy reading for a beginner in Catholic Doctrine. The index is one of the best I've found. It doesn't take long to discover whether you're up for the challenge that lays before you. I LOVE THIS BOOK! Whatever direction GOD leads you, the information on The Catholic Religion will have a place in your spiritual growth.I wouldn't feel my Christian library was complete without this book. If you've always had questions about The Catholic Religion-here, you will find the answers!"
"I liked this book, because it was written in plan English."
"Nice compact version of the big green book. Much easier to bring with you to class than that green monster.  Text is very easy on the eyes too, which was a concern I had with it being smaller."
"This hard copy is about the same size as the small paperback first edition.  I have the green paperback second edition but it was larger than the giant print bible I use. This is a great size.  It is fits easily the bag I use to carry my bible and binder for bible study.If you have teenagers at home you must copy paragraph 2217, frame it, and hang it in their room :)The pages are thick enough that you can write/highlight without it bleeding through."
good book
Niece is Roman Catholic and very happy to have it
"The Catechism of the Catholic Church is an excellent resource to know about the precepts of the Catholic faith and to understand how they tie in to the biblical texts.  I do bible studies all the time - some Catholic, some non-denominational Christian.  The information in this book really expands my studies in a wonderful way and allows me to explore my Catholic roots in a way that provides true clarity and understanding.  It is amazing how we are given this huge deposit of information growing up and going to Catholic schools, but somehow it can get lost because we are not able to make the connection between the teachings, the bible and life in general.  This book helps with all of that and has helped me to grow my faith by answering questions and providing new insights. I highly recommend it to anyone who was raised as a Catholic so they can understand their faith expression through the Catholic Church and also to non-denominational Christians, so they can understand how the Catholic Church is tied to the biblical teachings."
Really great version. I enjoy reading it!
"Nice small book size. Easy to study and hold whether sitting, laying in bed or sunning at the beach. Hard cover a plus. Fantastic price."
best roman catholic reference available. if you have a question the best beginning answers are here.
"Nice price, nice size to carry with you places.  Plus....it is jam packed full of the good stuff!!!"
"This book is teaching so much about catholic. I""ve always wanted to know more about my faith and this book did the job. Very informative and detailed. Still reading it and learning everyday about something new."
Best place to start to know our faith.  A must have reference in a great handy size.
"Using this as reference book.  Good value, good price and was in great shape."
Ordered for RCIA so I could be confirmed.  Does a great job of expressing Catholic values in an easy to digest way.
"Supplementing the Bible, Catechism of the Catholic Church is a great resource to assist in understanding the spiritual depth of one's Christian faith.  Non-Catholics will also find it informative and enriching."
Nice size version of the Catechism.  I just started RCIA and was advised to get a copy of this to go along with our readings for each class.
Very nice looking and good price for $7
Excellent resource
Required reference book for any practicing catholic.
The best!
This is a great value.
Anything about the Catholic church is 5 stars.
Great version of the Catechism.
Bought this for premarriage classes. It was at a very affordable price with free shipping. Great condition for being used!!
"Inexpensive and compact, this is the information you need."
"So happy to have a catechism in the home, and the cover is very attractive. Only thing I'd say is it would be great if it had ribbons for the book marks. That would be a nice addition."
"Item was as expected the product I wanted. Nice price, fast shipping. The book was in better than expected condition with some notes in the margins.Purchased for research and comparison and not for the material contained therein.I would buy from this vendor again if the need would ever arise."
"All Catholics should have this as their ""go to"" book for all things regarding our faith.  Sometime it can be hard to use, but once you get the hang of it it's such a valuable tool to understanding the beauty of Catholicism.  My husband and I give a copy to the new Catholics that enter the church at our parish to help them along."
"The content is what you would expect but the formatting is messed up, there is a large margin on the left side, only by reducing the font to very small do you get a reasonable size page to appear.  Also, no table of contents.  I should have taken more care before purchasing and looked at a sample."
Pastor loves it give to RCIA
"It's a very nice copy, slimmer than my previous one, easy to navigate. Overall high quality copy & size makes it easier to carry."
Very nice quality
Needed this for a Bible study. It works great.
"If you are Catholic and are just interested to know ""why"" something is the way it is with our religion, this is a must-have book on your shelf.  Remember, the only way to get close to God is to ask the tough questions and prove to yourself His way is THE way!"
Well OrganizedAnd Well WrittenAnswers To Many QuestionsConcerning Catholic FaithThank You
great
I like the book format for the catechism.  It is handy for carrying with less bulk.
Everything you need to know about the Catholic teaching.
This was purchased to use in a class to teach people who are coming into the Catholic Church.All Catholics should have one in the home right next to the Bible.
A must have for any catholic home.
Love it!
Required for school
Informative and a good guide
Looking forward to reading this! Came in great condition.
Type is too small for me to read with a magnifying glass.  Wanted to get some education on the Catholic church beliefs.
"Almost verbatim from another review:I used to think this Doubleday edition of the catechism was good but it lacks the Index of Citations and Glossary, and the Subject Index is incomplete.This is the one you want has all indexes,etc. in the back(many used ones from .01 cent and up):

  
Catechism of the Catholic Church/English"
quick delivery beautiful book
Have given copies to others and used as reference for those tough teen questions.  Love the scriptural backing as well.
AMEN!!!!
Excellent book - A must for every Catholic who wants to go into the depths of learning how to be a Catholic and the Faith.
"I purchased the online edition because of vision problems.  Have a little trouble fitting the page on my reader, but I do like the fact that I do not have to lug a book around.  This book is tough reading, but worth the extra effort to guide anyone through the OCIA classes of the Catholic Church."
GOOD RESOURCE FOR UNDERSTANDING CHURCH ISSUES.
This is the complete and digital version of the 2nd Vatican council. A book that I am still reading. Nicely put together.
"Excellent teaching on the catholic faith. Explanation of scripture and oral tradition. Must have for catholics.  If you are a protestant looking into the catholic Church, this is not an apologetic book, but still an excellent and ""true"" source of information."
"Bought my Catechism 3 years ago.  Now it's falling apart.  It is GREAT reading.  I know that sounds far fetched.  I really not exaggerating at all.  Grab a pencil, a warm chair, good light, and what a marvelous wonder it is!No need to be in a hurry.Ample room for contemplation.  And not the morbid destructive sort with which we are all too famaliar."
"The editors drew on much input from many catechists in putting this together.  Based on what I knew before of Roman Catholicdoctrine, I reckoned it is a fair and comprehensive catechism.  I take it that before there have been some regional variations. It is easy to read and since I am a person of faith, I agree with most of it.  The writers who gave input love the Lord.  The footnotes are small and abbreviated when referring to sources..  An improvement for future editions could be to make the print in the footnotes at the bottom of the pages larger."
"Really just glanced through the book, then found the Catechism I was looking for and bought that."
Not five stars because the size of the type is minuscule.
"this catechism alongside the Holy Bible are the perfect pair to evangelize non-catholics and to re-evangelize catholics....the Truth could not be any clearer when using these two treasures, that are driven truly by the HOLY SPIRIT......st. john  14:20-33,.really comes to pass........."
"This is a book every Catholic should have and use as a reference if not read front to back.  The buyers in my gift shop prefer this edition to the larger more expensive one.  It does not have sme of the extra references that most people don't use, but neither have the new translations of the mass and prayers made in 2012."
love it
like it just wish it came in bigger print
"we need to read to know GOD's mission for us...."".read,! read,! read,""! baby Jesus said to st. augustine, if you wish to know GOD and what HE expects from us!!!......st. augustine is my next choice.......from sinner to saint!........"
"Just what I was looking for, a nice compact size. This edition appears to be made to higher quality than others I have seen. The only negative I've found is the small type."
This book is perfect in my studies. Very helpful.
This book provides in-depth information about the Catholic Mass. it’s very useful for study and refreshing the meaning of the Mass.
"If you want to learn and understand a full in depth knowledge of your Catholic faith, here is the book for you. The more knowledge of what Christ gave up for us and how to better your lives by serving our Lord and Savior. This is an amazing book, I recommend to anyone who wants to strengthen their faith."
"you will be suprised, at what the catholic church really says about marriage , sex, forgiveness, written in layman's language, this is just a wonderfull read/dictionary. If you have never seen it, you need to take a look..."
The basic content is there but the book is super small and the binding prevents you from reading close to the margins.  The paperback is less expensive and easier to read.
"How many other faiths have a manual/book that states exactly what they believe?  I don't know many but the catholic church does.  If you want to know what the church teaches on a subject don't ask a ""catholic"" that thinks they know go straight to the source :o)"
The CCC hardcover is excellent but if you want this for your Kindle on your phone or tablet I recommend the big green CCC book. The formatting is much better. Download the sample first to be sure it is to your liking.
This is a great version of the Catholic Catechism. The kindle setup makes it really easy to jump around to find whatever you are looking for. You can also double tap the footnote numbers and go directly to the reference. This was definitely an awesome book to have on kindle.
As expected
This is a compact version of the larger Catechism of the Catholic Church...enjoy it for its portabiliy and compactness... nice version makes it easy tohave close by when reading Scripture and pondering the Will of God...Thank you
"Taking a course at my church - Teach me to Pray.  They are using this book for class.  Happy to have my own copy, and the price was right"
This is a good reference source for today's Catholic or those that would like to learn more about the catholic church.  It's very easy to find information in this book about catholic teaching and doctrines.  I recommend it to anyone that would like to learn about Christianity or the catholic religion.
"A great book to have, but they made the book smaller."
Nice book light weight easy to use
Highly recommend this for anyone desiring to know more about the Catholic faith and its teachings. I read the original edition cover to cover and was so taken by the way in which it was written. Likewise with this second edition. It is a beautifully written document.
easy to read and to find interpretations
Just what I needed
"The book is fine.  But I expected it to be regular book size, not paperback size.  My fault.  I obviously did not read description closely enough.  But has info I want."
"Love the size, perfect to carry around."
We ordered these for Confirmation students. They are a bit smaller in book size than lots of others. Perfect!
Need this for my daughter's religion class.  Fast delivery and affordable
"Excellent source of info about prayers, sacraments, Mass etc. Excellent Table of Contents and Index to find what you're looking for.gg"
"This is an excellent reference to use along with the Bible. I use this Catechism along with the Bible-RSV for my weekly Bible study class and for the readings for each weekly class., I find this very helpful."
This edition of the Catechism of the Catholic Church is most beneficial for Catholic's and a helpful reference for those interested in learning more about the catholic faith to have in their library. The content presented in this catechism is very useful in understanding the teachings of the catholic church and the reasoning behind those teachings.
"I am in an intense Bible study group and having this on my kindle is perfect, I don't have to carry around a lot of heavy books"
Perfect for my RCIA class!
I'm not sure how to review this. The book smelled nasty. It was also written in and marked. My husband asked me did I write in it already.  He was the one who opened the packaging.  I am excited to have the real catechism instead of the dumber down one.
"I received my book yesterday, and I am truly delighted. The book is in excellent condition. People like myself takes a chance when shopping on line; however, sellers like you are rare now a days,and than you for bringing back my confidence."
"Kindle version--formatting only works with small size fonts. With larger-than-average fonts, each line is one character long. Unreadable."
Great to have my own copy so I can look up any questions I have.
Good for anybody who wants to learn more about Catholicism or is trying to grow their own Catholic faith!
Helped with a class I was taking.
Very satisfied!
"Great purchase, helped with research. Great quality, product as described."
Awesome price
Helpful
Get this book to learn every day about our wonderful christian faith. It contains the essence of catholic teachings and is the perfect companion for bible study groups.
Great book every Catholic should own.
"I need the latest addition too, but didn't see it offered."
"If you read 9 paragraphs per day, you can read the entire book in 1 year.  Great insight into doctrines and their origin.  I read other things online that reference the Catechism, so it helps with that as well."
Nices my son dir the first communion..he was study and was so helpful
"Very informational..the product was in very good condition, timely arrival, an very good price."
"This text contains the definitive doctrine of the Catholic Church as of 1992 (when this edition was published), so it incorporates new pastoral approaches since Vatican II, unlike the Baltimore Catechism. It is not in question-and-answer format but rather divided into four sections (roughly speaking: belief, worship, moral life, and prayer), and the tone is much more gentle and inviting than older versions of the Church's catechism. However, the text does not sacrifice the intellectual integrity of its themes nor dumb-down some of the more complex doctrines, and it is written in a way that expects the reader to engage with the content rather than passively accepting it. For those looking for a more beginner-oriented catechism, the US Catechism for Adults or the Compendium of the Catechism may be more suitable, but for those who are ready and willing to dig deep into what the Church believes in this day and age, this is the complete and full statement of Church doctrine, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested what the Catholic Church teaches its followers.As far as its physical attributes, I like that the book is small (meaning I can carry it with me or stuff it in a bag pretty easily), and the hardcover binding seems very durable. It is a sturdy book without being to heavy to hold for an extended period of time, and the gold and white cover is aesthetically pleasing. I personally think this is the most visually-pleasing version of the modern catechism available right now."
Detailed and everything expected! Excellent resource! Easy to reference and read. Use it for my RCIA and Confirmation students for their journey with and in the Church. Give it to them as a gift as it is the tip of the iceberg on their lifelong journey in the faith.
A great resource for anyone interested in Catholicism.
"A good priest I know says every Catholic should own and read at least three books: The Bible, Documents of Vatican II, and the Catechism of the Catholic Church (if you're not Catholic and want to learn what the Church really teaches the Catechism is a good place to start). I agree. The Catechism is an invaluable resource in helping one to know and understand their faith and is chocked full of insightful citations to the other two must-read books mentioned above. You can read it from front to back or use the Subject Index to find what you're most interested in. This version is also very small (you can easily hold it in one hand) but the font is still readable."
I purchased this book for a Bible Study Class and it is definitely an excellent resource on the Catholic Faith.
Cardinal ratzinger ( pope Benedict xvi ) does a good job of editing. Hard to summarize Catholic doctrine in one book. But he does it!
Really good!
The Catholic Church has done a GREAT job of updating the catechism to this second edition.  Two thousand years of church knowledge and teaching is summarized in one concise volume.  The table of contents is so detailed that this volume is easy to use for reference.
I highly endorse this version of the Catechism for Newbies such as myself that are just starting out. The book delves into every subject in great detail which is very helpful for beginners to Roman Catholicism. May be a little repetitive for experienced Catholics however but still a fine read.
The book was described as 'Good'. I found it to be as good as 'New' and in perfect condition.
Truly the sure norm of our Faith. Eliminates much confusion. Want to know what the Church really thinks about homosexuality? Look it up here!
"Reading the catechism radically changed my view of the Catholic Church and therefore my whole life. This catechism concentrates 2,000 years of wisdom in the apostolic tradition in a very beautiful way.  I feel that I am finally at home in my faith both intellectually and emotionally. The Truth will set you free!Warning- This book is dangerous to those that are content with their dissent regarding Church authority and modern issues that call for sacrifice.  Do not fall into their errors, read this book and hold fast to the unity of the faith!"
"While book is what I ordered, I did not realize it came in a very small print.  It was meant as a gift and would have been much better received if available in a larger, easier to read print size."
"If a person does not need a larger print, the small size makes it an excellent choice as opposed to a paperback version.  However, someone must have dropped the book from its printing until its shipping because I had a predented corner on the book when it arrived."
perfect
Adds so much to my understanding.
A must if you want to know about your religion and what you believe.
Quick shipping. No damage to the book. Looking forward to learning more about the faith!!
This is a must read for all Catholics who want to understand all there is regarding our faith. It is a very big book so start from the beginning and read 5-10 pages per day. Your faith and understanding of the one true faith and church that Jesus started before his Ascension is what will grow with this book
A must have when you are studying or if you just want to understand the Catechism.  Love it!!!
"Fast shipment, highly recommend!"
I am going through the RCIA program to become Catholic. I have used this book several times as a reference in my journey. Well worth the price and the information.
Very nice.
It is everything the description says it is and it came on time
"If you're Catholic, you need to read this book.  I am still working through it, but it provides a terrific documentation of the faith, with references to various underlying documents.  My only beef is that it should be published in a large print version."
Great read!
All was as advertised. Loved it.
"If you still like to hold a book in your hand, this is great.  Content of course is priceless and the cover properly frames it."
"I'm reading this book with a small-group, and believe it or not, it's pretty easy to read!  Despite the large size, it's not overwhelming.  A lot of good info."
"This edition of the Catechism is really nice.  It's a bit smaller than the one I originally bought, and when I found this, I ordered it for a friend.  It's really a nice edition."
Solid resource.
"As a new Catholic I found this catechism easy to understand, and so easy to use.It will aid me in learning my faith and be a better informed member of the church.  I also use this catechism as a cross refrence when reading articles or other books, to be sure what the authors are saying is in line with Church teaching.I recommend this book very highly."
"Cheap simple book and very handy, not too expensive, not too weighty, just right for the average reading of the Catechism of the Church.  Recommend it for casual use."
"I bought this version as it was smaller than most, but it is not set up like a true Catechism.  My most learned Catholic friends have a hard time locating subjects in it. I ordered the big one for my Kindle."
"Just what I needed - in the process of becoming a member of the Catholic church, and this is a great, compact reference."
Perfect
Very educational and a good reference.
A must for every catholic household.
like
Awesome resource for life
I had to buy this for Bible Study.  It is a must have if you need to know what the church teaches with regard to scripture.  These give very useful explanations that help you understand dogma.
"The information in the Catechism is all I hoped for but the physical size is smaller than I expected. This is good and bad because it is small enough for me to keep by my favorite easy chair but at times, especially at night, it is hard to read without a magnifying glass."
Allows you to read the latest teaching on the Catholic Church.  A must have when questions arise.
"Not just a reference book, this is an excellent read."
"I guess I didn't know what multimedia meant.  I was expecting an audible that I could play in my CD player and it is some wierd thing that I have to read on my computer.  If I could return it, I would!"
I like the way the Catechism of the Catholic Church is structured so that you learn the faith systematically.
The complete Catechism of the Catholic Church which should be used not only as a reference but also read in its entirety.  It sums up the basis for the beliefs and rituals that are the Faith.
"The rules and mechanisms of a Catholic's life, a resource for understanding where we are on our spiritual journey within the Institution and Religion known as Catholicism."
Perfect.
Love it!
A must for any CCD teacher.
I gave it to my four children for Christmas.They are all Christian but not Catholic. I was concerned that they would not be opened to it. To my surprise they were totally taken by it and love it.  Wonderful resource book for every family.
"Amazing resource, and this edition from Doubleday is excellent quality and compact in size. Everyone (Catholic nor not) needs a copy of this."
Very Useful Resource to understanding the basic doctrines of the Catholic Church
Excellent bindingClear printArrived quicklyNecessity for resesrch
A+
Helped me understand and learn so much!
Great resource for study and meditation.
"A beautiful little book with clear type. Beautiful to hold in the hand! Of course, the content is pure, linear, undiluted teaching of the original church - quite profound."
Great product from a reliable seller!
"While complete and accurate, reading this version take some getting used to.  The print is small and the book itselfis small.  I would prefer a paperback edition the net time."
"Very easy to use, compact, can be carried easily anywhere."
For all the Catholic brothers and sisters out there highly recommend you buy one book
"I use this book as a reference for our bible study class.  It was recommended to  go with Look and See studies, and we use it a lot. We find a lot of different views of areas in the bible and it gives a different thought.  I would recommend it ."
good book quick delivery
"The Catechism is the ""reference text"" for the teachings of the Catholic Church that resulted from Vatican II.  This edition is the updated version done to better reflect the official Latin text was finalized."
"3rd time is a charm.  First I got the ""Compendium"" (written like the old Q&A), then the US Adult Catechism (more narrative form), but all the references go to this version.  A must have."
Quality for money.  Bible study
My Faith...
"I already know the catechism is beautiful in an of itself, but the presentation of this edition elevates it."
It is what it is!!!
"From dogma to liturgy, it's all in here--the summation of the Church's teachings on faith, wisdom, and guidance.  I highly recommend this book to Catholics and Protestants alike."
Answers all the questions about this beautiful religion!
The binder broke within weeks
"Every Catholic should have this easy to understand book. It makes a great read and a great reference for looking up what the Church says about different topics. This book is the adult version, not the thin one that children get as a gift."
"This book is indeed the whole CCC, and it has a nice strong hardback cover and a small compact size. Print is a little small, but if you have even 40/20 vision, you can read it. Not sure about if you use bifocals tho, just a heads up.Long story short, if small print isn't a problem, this is a great value."
AS DESCRIBED. GREAT BUY
I was lucky to find this book for my son because the bookstore was out of them and it would have taken forever to order. I almost forgot to mention that I saved a bunch of cash as well!
To know and believe the teachings of church is a tremendous power position to have your own spiritual life. I highly recommend to all Carholics.
I have found this book to be very informative about the catholic faith and practices.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting correct information on the teaching and beliefs of the catholic faith.
"It's just what you'd expect...a systematic, comprehensive presentation of the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church"
I wish it came in hard-back in large print. I purchased it for a student in one of my religion classes.
i buy this for my mom she has been going to a bible study group. this is one of the books they use.
Great Book! I'll be looking for the newest addition!
"I was surprised to see how small this new edition is, but I liked it for its smallness in terms of portability for Bible Studies or travel.  The book is white and gold outside, which makes for an attractive but economical gift.  As for the contents - need I comment on the the excellence of this catechism?  It is a real boon to Catholics who want to be feel confident they can find out  everything The Catholic Churches teaches regarding faith and morals, without conferring with priests or doing extensive research."
Our church has over 90 kids a year for confirmation and this is one of the goodies they receive during their confirmation retreat.  Wish the Y-Cat was cheaper but this oldie but goodie is perfect!
Arrived on time to give to a friend. I believe she was happy.
Wonderful and explains everything clearly.
Love it.  Very easy to read and follow.
Gave it as a gift.  Excellent!  It was received very well!
"Every Catholic household, indeed every Catholic and non-Catholic person, should have and use the Catechism of The Catholic Church.  Of course, it doesn't read like a novel but it is a tremendous reference for what the Church teaches."
Arrived quickly and just what I needed
Perfect and easy to use. I bought this along with the workbook and love it!
Had all the content I was hoping for in a clear and easy to understand format
This book is more suited to theology students I think it goes into the subject deeply.
"This book is the authoritative book on the teachings of the Catholic church.  It's as simple as that.  Really, every Catholic should own one of these for reference if nothing else."
"I believe every Catholic family needs the CCC.This book is well constructed, easy to read and is a perfect size to hold in your hands.  It should hold up really well."
Have a question that needs answering; then you will find it in this book. It explains in great detail our faith and it also guides you as you grow in faith and knowledge.
"If you want to know what the Catholic Church REALLY teaches, this is the place to go.  It's also beautifully written & gives you a deeper understanding of the scriptures."
exactly as expected
"This catechism explains in perfect detail what the Catholic Church teaches. I have enjoyed newer explanations about Church's views on its 6 major precepts, effects of Vatican Council on Catholicism."
"No surprises. It is the Catechism of the Catholic Church. There are many free online versions, but I was happy to spend the $6 so that I could mark it and make notes."
I'm taking a class and it is perfect.  Not too big. All the info. I need
"Every catholic house should have this book. It's a great present for someone thAt asks questions regarding their faith, it presents a great opportunity for evangelization."
Good informative book. Basically answers most questions you may have on catholic beliefs
I bought this to replace a water damaged copy of the Catechism that I received for confirmation in 1999. This version is a little more light weight with smaller pages.
"Okay, first things first.  1.) Where is the shrink wrap? The second book I ordered came in shrink wrap.  I ordered a new book not a used one and even paid a tad more and by going thru someone with a higher rating than most. 2.)  The sample reading had print that was much larger that what I received.  The print is so small I will need a magnifying glass to read it for I have poor eyesight.  3.)  This really is false advertising.  I would have given it one star but saying that I hate it is rather strong wording. This is the second time I have ordered on Amazon thru a bookstore.  The first time I ordered what was called a brand new item and it was shipped to me with bunches of duct tape wrapped around tons of bubble wrap  Underneath it all was a set of four books truly second hand.  I shied away from ordering like that for quite a long time and decided to try one more time.  I know better now."
I have a hard copy but having something that is digital and therefore searchable in an instant is very nice indeed!
exactly what we wanted.  Thank you.
This version is great for study. I recommend it to anyone who is interested for something as reference as well. I was surprised how easy it was to carry around and resistant it is to wear.
"Small paperback version of the catechism. I can easily fit this book in my purse. Easy read print, and answers to every question you could ever have about all things Catholic."
"I'm reading it from cover to cover. It's very clear, and I'm glad to know just what the Catholic Church teaches. I may convert, but I want to know a great deal first."
First rate
I did not like that you 'cannot look' up by paragraph numbers.
Needed for the class I'm taking
Great understanding.
"No review necessary. One of the most important documents ever created. Buy it, read it, and learn everything about your Catholic faith!"
Good reference book Catholics or Protestants. A must have for Catholics who wish to learn and understand ones faith.
I really wish that it has a better index. It is a reference book that should have a fast way to look up what a reader wants.
The best and most concise and eloquent presentation of the Christian faith to be found anywhere and in a convenient size and price to boot.
A book that should be in every Catholics home.  It is a very in depth teaching of the Catholic beliefs. I highly recomend purchasing the Compendium along with this.
"Everything was exactly like the book except one thing, each paragraph is numbered in the Catechism, and if you could provide that service also it would make looking information up so much easier. Thank you for Kindle, best thing ever."
Thank you
Great reference book. Using for Bible Studies.
Exactly what I wanted!
"The catechism will explain any unclear issues you may have regarding your faith. - Scripture is not self-interpreting, see Acts 8:27-31. Also you must be very carefull interpreting the bible yourself, see 2Pet 1:20-21. You don't have to be able to read Greek and Hebrew to be saved. What a treat by the church Christ started."
"This book is a great tool to use a a building block of ones faith.  I recommend this book for everyone. If the were only two books to have pertaining to the Catholic faith, first would be the Bible, second would be the Catechism of the Catholic Church."
Very useful and meaningful for me as a missionary in preparation to be sent in mission to Canada. This will certainly help me.
I am not a Catholic but wanted to learn more about what the Catholic church is all about.  This was a great way of learning.  Thank you for making it available to fast and easy!
This is a nice option for a portable catechism. It does not have the bible verse index.
I have the hardback for at my study desk but this is the one I take to the Chapel with me. It's easy to stick in a bag and take along. I read and re-read it and probably will for many years to come.
Very nice. Well written and good references. Written at a higher level. More for adults.
Perfect gift for campus minister.  Recommen to everyone.  Quick delivery; extremely satisfied and grateful.
"Everything in here is online, so I have a nice, pristine copy that's on my shelf...Why bother cracking the spine, when you can carry this tome on your phone?"
Size of book and printing was  very good.  I carry this in a pack so I have it available and it is very handy.  I recommend this to all who want a good size to carry and use alot
"Content is very good but it difficult to navigate to a specific paragraph.  E.g., if I want to go to paragraph 256, it is hit or miss  to get there."
Information
This was recommended by a friend as the best way to find the answers to my many questions about the Roman Catholic Church and it is just doing that.
Great little manual to help you navigate through the many questions you might have about Catholic dogmas and regulations......Very useful to have handy in the house...
I needed a Catechism for my Bible study.  the price was right and I liked the idea that it was a hard cover too.  I liked the other reviews that I read on it too
Good detailed reference.
Great
"This kindle edition is not formatted for its medium. Text and footnotes run together; sentences are broken up. My advice, buy the book."
Great book. Classic Catholicism. cheap!
Lovely hardcover binding of the Catechism. Nice size in the hand. Easy to read or reference. Looks great on the shelf.
I t was fine
A very helpful guide for bible study class.  I found it easy to navigate in.  Would recommend this to all who are in need of a good reference guide book.
Awesome! totally worth the read and recommend it.
OK I grew up Catholic and am digging deeper. This is a textbook. It is not a story book but very dryly explains the religion and is a wonderful resource.
Kindle version is wonderful especially with aid of the dictionary.
Insightful
"Great book, I use this to know what a ritual means and how long it has been used by the Catholic Church. Good for the researcher or devout Catholic."
"Great Edition of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, I love it!!"
I probably should have gotten the LARGE PRINT version of this book.
Excellent reading and learning about my faith.
"Essental for all RC homes, i stronglysuggest as a part of your family!the 2nd edition has so much toteach u!"
"This is a great reference on how the Catholic Church has developed its philosophy over the ages.  It give you an answer on why things are, but like any book, you have to look it up."
Wonder ful guide to the Catholic faith.  Easy to use to look up information on any subject pertaining to the faith.
"What Catholics' profess, for all who desire to know and for those who want to know more. To be consulted frequently for best results."
"OK..there's not much this book doesn't have.I leave this readily available on my desk, or take with me on my Bible Study Night!The sections, and arrangement (s) are well done in this book."
Good Condition!
Explains church doctrine in fairly easy format.  Great reference book for other books on Catholic doctrine. A must have for any catholic student's library
This Kindle edition is the same as the large paperback edition. The only difficulty is getting from one paragraph number to another. The index does not offer that option.
No Catholic home should be without the Catechism of the Catholic Church.  It's easy to use and will help with those discussions about our faith.
"I was curious about how the Catholic faith differed from my Protestant faith. This book was EXTREMELY helpful!Catechism #966 was a ""deal breaker"" for me..."
Bought for my kids religious education class
"Great book, good shape"
The hard cover is beautiful and elegant.  It's a small book.  Easy to carry in a handbag.  I love this book.
"I was really needing the larger type.  The pictures were an added bonus.  Arrived in great condition, won't stay that way for long!"
"The perfect guide for any Catechism teacher to refer to, plus a good read for any Christian."
"If you are serious about your faith, this is a must have.  It's packed with authentic Church Teaching and scriptural resources.  A must have in a Catholic home!"
Praise be to God!
"Nice portable Catechism, well-organized. Highly recommended for Catholics and for anyone looking to learn more about Catholic doctrine. Based on the Bible and Catholic tradition."
"This is a great book, very pleased with this purchase especially for the price. The book is laid out well, high quality hardcover and a must have for all Catholics."
Beautiful treasure of the Catholic church.
Great resource for information on the Catholic Church.  Will use it often.
informative
Super resource and easy to read and understand.  Has been helpful with my RCIA classes. highly recommend to anyone who wants a deeper understanding of their faith.
An excellent reference book with lots of cross-references and biblical footnotes.  It is great to just sit and read and to have on hand whenever a faith-related question comes up.
"If you want to get close to God, you have to know him. The Catechism helps us do that."
Great!
"This edition of the Catechism has an extremely detailed CONTENTS section and Glossary. The ""In Brief"" section at the end of each chapter highlights the main concepts, as well."
This has to be one of my ten favorite book purchases of all time.  It was a joy to experience wisdom of C S Lewis.  I wish I had read these books forty years ago.
"I purchased the hardcover edition in 2010, and it is indeed of superior quality-- but way too big for reading in bits and pieces here and there around the house. I'm here now getting the same collection for a friend who was just ordained, and I think I'm going with the boxed set, because a paperback version of the hardback would be as difficult to hold open as Michener's Hawaii.If you're reading this, you don't need my opinion on CS Lewis's writings, now do you."
This is really a great collection of C.S. Lewis finest pieces. It helps paint a picture of what true christianity is through captivating stories/illustrations. The book arrived on time and in perfect condition. Worth the buy.
"I always thought of Narnia when C.S. Lewis came. Very pleased to have ""discovered"" this anthology. Currently on the Screwtape letters, should be required reading."
Great collection of Lewis classics. Bulky to hold. I'd rather have a set of 5 books in a box sleeve.
I just love the logic and rationale of this man.  C.S Lewis is one of the great thinkers that should be read!!
All of the Lewis' masterpieces in one book; pretty thick to travel with but manageable. Love the author!
Great to find so many titles in one paperback! And the price was great! This was a gift for a friend and she loves it!
Having the books all together is very helpful and a good value for the money. He really was a fantastic philosopher and follower of the King!
I bought this for school & it came as described even though my professor never decided to actually use it.
The book came with a ripped front cover and damaged first and second pages.
Gotta love CS Lewis - he says things so clearly and just when you think 'But wait ...' the next paragraph answers the concern or objection.  I like that this cover is like a hardback so you can use the flap to keep your place.
I always enjoy C.S. Lewis' writing. He keeps my attention. His work is intelligent and thoroughly researched. I read somewhere that a good book can be read and enjoyed by the young and old. His work fits this exactly.
Gathers a number of the important titles in one place.
Love these writings so much. C.S. Lewis is absolutely brilliant and these are some of his best works!
Needed this for a class.
to enhance my religious experience
"Arrived on time packaged well, son enjoyed the read"
Very enjoyable reading.
This is 8 of CS Lewis' books in one book.  Great read.  I recommend it for everyone.
Love everything C S Lewis
a must have book
"Great item, great all around service. Thanks!"
"This book is GOLD. Professor Lewis is a great teacher, a philosopher full of wonder! I value this above The Chronicles of Narnia."
Not much needs be said about C. S. And the quality of his prose. The quality of the edition is superb as well. Will be buying more as gifts for friends and family.
Love that all of these books are together.
"Very happy all the way around. Many books in one paperback. Love the content, book itself good quality."
"The book arrived when expected. However, several pages were folded over and back. The pic is after straightening them out. Not pleased. I may return."
What is not to love about C.S. Lewis?
"Like new. Great deal, great service."
This book is conveniently filled with 8 classic works by C.S. Lewis. It was delivered to me in less than 2 days via my Amazon Prime account. I am impressed.
It's wonderful to have these C. S. Lewis classics together in a single volume
C.S. Lewis is both imaginative and insightful .
Contains several of C. S. Lewis's famous books.
This book is better than expected. I am a very satisfied customer. Thank you so much.
This collection is far better quality than I expected for the priceQuite a good deal
Great!
Wow
I've read a fair amount of books in my life. But none like this. Literally every page is full of profound truth and wisdom. Lewis is one of a kind.
great
It is great having so many books by C.S. Lewis bound in one volume!
Great book! And delivered on time
But this as a gift for my supervisor and it is an amazing buy with some of Lewis's best works.
lots of words
This changed my view of Christianity and it helped undo the progressive indoctrination I grew up in being born in 1990.  Great reasonable arguments for God and Christianity.
"This book is excellent value for money because it contains the eight most important Lewis classics, including Mere Christianity (the greatest of them all), in a single volume.C.S. Lewis, author of the Chronicles of Narnia, was a highly gifted writer in English. Among all the great English writers, only George Orwell comes close to Lewis' particular gift in terms of discussing extremely complex ideas in crystal clear language accessible to all. In fact, these classics are worth reading for literary merit alone - and as a masterclass in how to write.In particular, I would draw your attention to the Abolition of Man. I think this essay is particularly relevant in our own times. He makes a powerful critique of society and educational institutions - being C.S. Lewis he is also extremely gentlemanly in his criticisms - and he shows the wisdom of inherited traditions."
"Mere Christianity good, others verbose and sometimes loquacious. The love chapters are interesting."
"Really well presented, great gift"
"The lettering is this book is very small so I am quite disappointed with it because it is not very easy to read.Also, I did not realize I was getting ONE book, I was looking to several books in C.S. Lewis  collection.The seller's advertising is not very clear, and I feel that I was mis-led."
If your looking for truth read these C S Lewis classics
"The book itself, is of good quality. It is a bit heavier than usual books because of the many pages (8 books in 1), nevertheless, I have no complaints and was just what was advertised. 5/5 in my opinion"
Exactly what i wanted
Good
This study is very timely for what’s going on in our nation. So glad I decided to do it. Another great study by Jennifer Rothschild!
"Excellent study!  Jennifer stays rooted in Scripture throughout this study.  Every week was amazing. I was touched, encouraged and at times convicted.  I have learned so much and have grown closer to God as I have walked through this study with my wonderful ladies group. I appreciate Jennifer's relatable stories and  practical guidance.  Easily one of my favorite studies."
"If you are having a hard time with anything in your life, this Bible Study is the one to pick up! Not only does it ask frank and challenging questions in a gentle way, but it also sweetly reminds you that God is always there."
"My wife loves this Bible study,t hank you so very much"
"What an inspiration to hear and read the word Jennifer has given us in this study!  I appreciate her talents to write and bring the Bible into today's world and teaching of having courage in an uncertain time!  Great, great study and I would recommend it to anyone who has suffered any type of loss or are experiencing depression.  There is hope in having courage!"
"Super disappointed. Bought this study, excited to begin only to find out that you have to purchase or rent video sessions for each lesson. Considering I pay for data and have no streaming capabilities in my area... I am discouraged with this purchase."
I love the study and Jennifer Rothschild is very good.I highly recommend any of her studies.The service from Amazon was great...delivered when they said it would be
This book was bought for a small group bible study.  It has been a wonderful study.  Amazing what a small 2 chapter book of the bible can teach you.  If you go on You Tube the authors videos are there for each week (you will understand when you go into the study).  She is an awesome woman.
Exceptional nibble study book.  All of Jennifer Rothschild books are worth every cent and moment you spend reading and doing them.
"This is an excellent Bible Study by Jennifer Rothchllds. I highly recommend it. I watched the free 7 video sessions that go with this study on Youtube when I did my “homework” and then my church was also  presenting the study in our Women’s Bible Study.Google the author’s name and you will be blessed with her testimony, her videos and much more."
We are using this book as a small group with other ladies. We have the cd’s to watch each week along with our study books! Jennifer Rothschild is a wonderful teacher! After each session there are questions to ponder & discuss! I highly recommend!
I wish I would have read the description better. This requires a SEPARATE and additional purchase of videos ($100 😮) or audio sessions ($12). Wish I would have known this. Why do all bible study guides these days REQUIRE videos?!?!?! It's so frustrating. I wish they were supplementary.
This is my first time doing a Jennifer Rothschild study and I absolutely love it! I love that she digs deep into studying the Word of God as well as making it relatable to every day life! Her personal story is very inspiring! The video series that goes along with the book is also wonderful! A great study to do with your women’s group at church!
AMAZING bible study!!!If you need encouragement and something to reroute your thinking...get this book!!!You will not be disappointed!Jennifer is the girl next door who lives with all of her heart!
"Wow!!!  This Bible study was absolutely amazing.  I was touched so hard by it , I had to purchase a lion ring to wear to remind me to always Take Courage!!  Jennifer Rothschild is an amazing God filled woman who has truly become a mentor for meGreat great amazing study 💯💯💯"
I love Jennifer's studies. I was shocked to see one on Haggai but it changed my life literally. It is a study that I will do again and again throughout life I'm sure!!!!
The study was not my favorite by Jennifer Rothschild. This study was from the book of Haggai. A two chapter book in the Bible. Two months of study could have been wrapped up in two weeks. A lot of Repeat!
This is my first Bible study by Jennifer Rothschild. I enjoyed her style of writing. She gets to the meat of the study while keeping a friendly atmosphere about the study.
"Whether you do this alone or in a group, with the videos or the free audio, this is pertinent to all of us. The pandemic has tried to plant seeds of discouragement and fear.  You will use this study’s as a tool in your bag even after the study is over to visit to strengthen and encourage your journey."
An excellent Bible Study about a lesser studied profit. Jennifer Rothschild knows how to get you into the word.
Using for a church Bible Study Group starting Sept. 9.
A group of ladies are doing a bible study
This is a wonderful study! Jennifer Rothschild has found a token in the book of Haggai and is sharing it with the world.
Great book! I’m half way through and it has help me a lot! The author is an inspiration
This is a wonderful study that I highly recommend.
This study has come at a time when I needed it most- great study of one of the smallest books of the bible!
"This was not advertised as used, yet when I got it there was significant writing on the inside of the book!"
One of the best and most timely studies I have ever done.
Another wonderful study by Jennifer Rothchild. Who would have thought studying Haggi could minister to my season of life right now. God is so faithful to give us everything we need in all circumstances. I am grateful for Jennifer’s obedience and transparency.
It is an awesome study. In this time many people are discouraged. Find hope in this study.
One of the best bible studies I’ve participated in!
Bible study
I enjoy this author's videos which augment the book.
Another amazing study by Jennifer Rothschild
Not finished preview for group bible study
Take Courage has been an inspirational Bible study. I have grown in my faith through God’s Word and Jennifer’s challenging questions. I highly recommend this study.
Summer Bible study book. Thought provoking study and not too difficult. Great way to start each day- 5 lessons.
Small group Bible study
Our ladies Bible study used this with great success
"I would highly recommend. While the shortest book in the OT may seem dry, author Jennifer Rothchild brings it to life with context and many contributing scriptures."
I am so excited about this book. I did the Psalm 23 study and it was so insightful. This one looks awesome too!  A much needed subject at this time.
This was used for a women's Bible study
Perfect and fast!
"My church used this book for our Bible study, and it was great! I wasn’t expecting so much info on such a short book in the Bible. This is my second study I’ve done of hers, and I was not disappointed. 😀♥️"
"I love the study of Haggi, and  we're  in the mist of his journey!! The author of the book is amazing!!!I received 2 copies and would like to return one of them. Please send me return instructions. Thanks"
Great book
Great almost done with my study
Each day of this devotion is powerful. Life-changing for me. Highly recommend.
Is there a word better than awesome or terrific or fantastic if so that’s the word I want to put in here! Literally changed my life!
Loved this study!  Jennifer is so down to earth and the message she gives is so clear and relatable.
Best Bible study I have done. Really great scripture review and a very timely message.  It is one you will refer back to again and again.
Well written and gets you in the book of Haggai with other scripture study as well.  Great study for our present times .
A good 6 week study for a small group or individually
She uses different versions of the Bible so you are not just stuck in one verse.
I like the book
Book came  quickly and it was exactly what I expected
"Amazing study source, that's being used in a Bible Study class. S"
Wonderful teaching
Used for a weekly Bible study. Well received by the attendees. Excellent for individual or group study!
"Such a wonderful study, and great reminder of God’s Glory!"
This was the best study bible workbook i have ever done.thank you
This was a much needed Bible Study for such a time as this!! Thanks!
Bible study
Great for bible study
"Not for the One Who Has Already Wrestled with GodJust as Jacob wrestled with the angel in Genesis 32, so, too, have I wrestled with God for some 40 years.  I don’t mean fighting Him; rather, I mean daily going to scripture, self-examining, repenting, praying, asking God for wisdom, journaling what I’m learning.  Rothschild’s studies teach you how to do that.  I do her studies because I lead women’s small groups; however, for me the studies are redundant—given what I just explained about my wrestling with God.  Because of that it is frustrating that there is so little in it for me.  But, it is a wealth of learning for those who haven’t learned the process of seeking God through His word and self-examining.Therefore, if you’re a bible-study leader and are looking for a study for new believers, Rothschild’s studies would be perfect—with one word of warning:  they are time intensive in that each day (of 5 days) requires several pages of reading and writing.One more thing:  the videos are absolutely not necessary for the study.  Rather, the videos are 30-minute talks, by Jennifer, about stories of her life viewed from the lens of scripture."
Did this study with a group of women and we watched the video. Helps you to remember God's Word when you need courage.
I would recommend this book to others. It did take a while to arrive but that was stated in the description.
The title of the bible study says it all! It is so refreshing I highly recommend it!
"I haven't bought a Max Lucado book in years. It's 2020 and decided I needed a little spiritual uplifting. The book provided that. My reason for 3 stars is that the book's number of pages is deceptive and this wasn't done years ago. The book is 219 pages including 5 pages of notes, which I enjoy and appreciate. My complaint is that the actual text is only 139 pages. I was just barely half-way through the book and he writes that the chapter I'm reading is the final chapter. What the heck? The rest of the book is 72 pages of ""Questions for Reflection"". To me, these are a total waste of my time and paper. My reflections are based on my life and not what someone else thinks I should think about. It was written like a study guide, which I don't want. It's probably a personal taste thing. Those who like ""role play"" meetings probably love these. I was very disappointed the book ended so early based on the total number of pages. The actual 139 pages were wonderful."
"Max Lucado uses the miracles of Jesus to illustrate that we are never alone in our journey through life. The miracles of Jesus used in Max's book You are Never Alone are found in the Gospel of John - from the first miracle of turning water into wine at Cana to the restoration of Peter after Jesus's Resurrection God's Presence and Power are illustrated.Max uses his easy to understand writing style and stories (personal and other inspirational stories) to demonstrate God's Presence in our lives during the good and bad times. He shows how God cares for us through these stories- for example in one story Max is taking a walk with his dog and granddaughter when he ends up rescuing his granddaughter from a thicket of bushes just as God is here to help us and give us hope in our daily lives. You are Never Alone is full of encouragement and hope. Max Lucado shows us how to relate and apply Scripture to daily events and current situations of our lives- illustrating how we can apply God's Promises to our lives and find Hope in our trials, darkness, and despair.The book includes Questions for Reflection on each chapter allowing for deeper thought and connection with God and Scripture.I recommend this book for everyone looking for hope, encouragement, and help in the struggles of daily life. I received an advanced copy of this book for my honest review. All opinions expressed in this review are my own."
"I lost the love of my life to COVID-19, we had just passed our 49th year anniversary, she was 70, & still a very attractive woman. Yes, she had a few maladies, as most of us do when we age, but nothing so drastic as to take her life. I lived in disbelief & shock, & still deeply affecting me. I’ll refer to one chapter in this book that had tremendous impact on me. If it takes 20 minutes to read chapter, took me about 40. Chapter so overwhelmingly touched me deep within my being. If you’ve lost a loved one, this chapter will definitely speak to your heart. Will bring on waves of sadness, & waves of joy. God bless all who reads this book."
"Max Lucado has done it again.  As he has done many times before, he’s managed to anticipate what the reader needs to hear and give them a message of hope.  I enjoyed every chapter, but I admit, one chapter has weighed on my heart.  It has made me think about certain things in my life and reconsider where I stand on them.  He opened my eyes to a passage I’d read many times but never really seen.  I highly recommend this book to those who are looking for hope in the midst of hopeless times."
Love Max Lucado books and this one is no different. Just started and had had 3 chapters before I knew it. I just love how Max makes it so easy for me to understand and so relevant to me personally. I know this is going to be another great one.
"I've read so many of his books but this one is so wonderful and enlightening.  The Chapters are short so it is veryeasy to sit and read just even one Chapter and then meditate on that one, short Chapter.  He finds so manypoints in one verse of Scripture it's amazing and brings valuable thoughts to mind .B. Adams"
This book is awesome!  Max shared things you would never imagine and how he had dealt with them. I have found so much freedom by reading his gifted words. You can too!
"You are Never Alone is not just about Jesus' miracles in Cana, Bethesda, Siloam and places where Jesus walked.  It is also about His miracles in Max Lucado's life and many other lives ... people like you and me ... where Jesus walks and performs miracles today.The book is masterfully written. Each chapter is a stand-alone message to savor, re-read, learn, and enjoy.When you feel like you have been deserted, abandoned, or hurt, any chapter in this wonderful book will help to reassure you that you are truly never alone.David CottrellAuthor, Monday Morning Leadership"
"Just when you think he couldn't get any better, he surprises us with a well-thought-out, deeply touching read so applicable for us now in the middle of this pandemic when so many people are suffering from social isolation, loneliness and even depression. A GREAT READ!!!"
Sometimes I feel so alone. Surrounded by people yet truly lonely. This book reminded me that I am never alone and that by faith I can see the presence of God in the simplicity of life occurrences. Thankful for the gift of writing that Max was given and how he faithfully uses it.
"Admittedly I am only 32 pages into this but it’s hard to keep reading because Lucado is pushing the idea that everyone’s prayers will be answered no matter what. The kicker is the prayer may not be answered how we want, when we want. It might not be answered in this life at all. Well, if a prayer is not answered in this life then it is not answered. I wish Lucado would confront reality and teach us how to cope with that fact.I recently lost a child and my honest prayer is to have my daughter alive with us. That prayer will not be answered in this life so I take no comfort in the idea of prayer being answered “On the other side of heaven.” Thanks but I don’t get any hopeful feelings from knowing I can not live this life with my daughter and that I have to die to (maybe) see her. Perhaps a book that actually grapples with reality, where there is such a thing as prayer that will not be answered, would be more helpful for those of us actually grieving from serious loss."
Well articulated book. Easy to read yet full of substance. Not just another feel good book.
Any book written by Pastor Max is a good one.  He has a beautiful heart.  He cares and always wants to reach out to help others.  This book is really appropriate now.  Pastor Max always points to Jesus.  That is so important.  When you read this book it will bring you a lot of peace.  Pastor Max uses God's Word to draw you to the God that loves you.
"Loved this book. Easy reading. Max Lucado does an excellent job explaining how God is always close by to help us with challenges in life we need help getting through. Gives many examples from Gospel of John with explanations and understanding. Easy to understand the miracle of the empty tomb. “You are never without hope or strength because you are never, ever, alone.”  This book brings comfort and peace to me."
"My knowledge of the bible is slight. Grew up Catholic. Am a born again Christian. Mr. Lucado is new to me. But, he puts the scriptures in ways I can understand and use them in my life. Will read more of his books.This one was terrific!"
"Pastor Max Lucado has given us another book that is well written. You Are Never Alone is a thought provoking, inspiring, and a very revelant read that I highly recommend and encourage everyone to read."
I just love reading Max Lucado books and once again this book does not disappoint. It is very well written and every page reminds me that I am never alone in this world. God has my back and he is with me even during some of the darkest times in life.
"I do like like the book. I passed it to someone else that needed it’s message., teaching. No wonder I don’t have books.  This is perfect for Christians that are new to faith , or perhaps going through hard times."
"I love this book.  I was diagnosed with Covid-19 on Sunday, September 12, 2021.  I am quarantined for several days.  My mom brings my meals to the door and I take them once she is downstairs.  We talk on FaceTime, yet most of my time is in my room.  However, I am not alone because God has been with me through it.  He is loving me, healing the infection, and strengthening my tired body.  This book soothes my soul thru COVID"
I can’t get enough of Max Lucado’s words! This book I started reading from my pre- published edition is full of hopeful & encouraging words. His writing & scripture references wrap themselves around you & give a BIG hug.
"I am enjoying reading Max Lucado’s book You Are Never Alone. As always, it is insightful, full of humor and inspirational. It is the right time for this book. I have read many of his books and this one does not disappoint. I can’t wait to read more."
"love the author, his books are very good in expiring you to be a better you.  His books have helped  me become a better person."
"Following Jesus’ miracles from the gospel of John, Max Lucado brings comfort to the reader. You Are Never Alone is a great read for the time of COVID or any other time. I would highly recommend it."
My husband and I use this book for devotions.  We read a section and then discuss the questions in back. It's a wonderful part of our evening bringing us closer to Jesus and each other.
I love the book and are enjoying book reading sessions with fellow church members via zoom.
Enjoyable reading
As usual Max Lucado writes with humor and  the use of many scriptures to bring comfort to hurting people.  I would recommend it to anyone feeling the loss of a dear spouse.
"This book is okay. The chapters are really short, and 1/4th of the book is reflection questions. I don’t like the book because Max takes not only verses out of context, but stories as well. “Ministers” should not take verses out of context to fit their own narrative. Max Lucado has other great books, but this is not one of them."
I could not get into this book!  I have always bought his books!
Great book! It addresses a variety of issues that cause emotional Duress in a compassionate way. It is a easy read. Well worth the money.
"Max writes with his life experiences and humor prevailing throughout his book. A much needed read during these stressful pandemic times. When you read one of his books, you will hunger for more of his works."
Life changing read. Deepens your belief in Christ . Will read over again for excellent support to believe He is with me always.....
Didn’t disappoint. As with every book max puts out it was outstanding! Perfect for the time we are living in. Very encouraging.
This is an awesome book!  I highly recommend to understand how much God loves us and gives us encouragement that we are truly never alone.
I am enjoying reading this book and applying the many truths it holds  to my life!Thank you for taking the time to address such an important point about God in our daily lives!
"Bought this for someone for Christmas. Haven't heard any complaints, so I guess it's good to go."
"I love every book that I have from Max and I've read them all a couple of times. Max is able to make a real connection  to the Gospel and to his readers by sharing 'real', touching and sometimes even humorous personal anecdotes."
"This is the first of his books I have ever bought. I only found it through the podcast Proverbs 31 ministries. As soon as I heard Max speak I knew I had to have this book... the moment I opened it & started reading I grabbed a pen and highlighters...marking passages, making notes. I love the way he opens up about his personal life, adds a bit of humor, and really grabs your attention"
This book is so needed in this uncertain time.
"This will bless you, especially during these trying times of 2020-2021!  Thank you, Pastor Lucado!  I see the Word of God in a real light!"
This book is one of those that you will reread many times. It's a real treasure. Can't recommend it enough.
A new author who I found interesting. Well worth the time.
"Gave as a gift to my mom, she LOVES it!!"
Like the questions in the back for Reflections
Good book.  Very informative.
Great price and fast shipping
Max simply has a way of making you feel as if he’s just talking to you as a good friend.
Inspirational
Enjoyed it.
Great reading.
Max weaves a tale of John and the miracles of Christ into a mirror of your very own soul. Excellent read
This book will help you to draw closer to God. Max truly is a gifted servant of God. Praise the Lord!
I recommend this book especially to fledgling Christians and non-believers.  But it’s pages contain encouragement for everyone who has an extra 30 minutes a day for one week.
Great BOOK—-
This is one of the “good ones” for sure!! It was very timely to what I was going through. Thank you for caring enough to share some really personal stuff.
If u our a max Lucas fan this is a great book. Uplifting e as dy read
As always another great read!  Max always Deliver's!!
"Again Max leaves us with more understanding, in a down to earth way. Understanding and compelling."
Another great book by Max Lucado!
An amazing look at the miracles in John.  This book is inspirational and encouraging.  I have all ready read it twice.
Great book to add onto Bible Study
One of the best books I have ever read. Encouraging. Thought provoking. Sharing the Truth. Love it. Get it; you’ll be happy you did.
"I have several of Max Lucado’s books, he never disappoints me, I always learn from him!"
Good book
Thank Max for giving the new insight on The Gospel of John and it really helps me to regain my faith in the tough time
Great book everyone should read
This book is awesome. We are using this book as a Sunday School study.
Awesome book.
Love this book very well done by the author it really touched my heart❤️
Max Lucado wrote another great book!
really bored disoppointment
"I often feel alone due to circumstances of my birth and life, so the title of this book alone was a Godsend (as was the fact I found it in a price club; don't tell me God has no sense of humor). It's also the first Max Lucado book I've read all the way through (I know, I know. I have a big TBR pile). But if You Are Never Alone had to be my first, I'd say it was a solid pick.Max Lucado makes Jesus come alive. That's not to say he's a better writer than Biblical writers, or that any book takes the place of the Bible. He's not and they don't. That said, I saw and heard Jesus in a new way throughout this book. Max took the familiar stories I've known for years, from the blind man in John 9 to the death and resurrection of Lazarus, and made them new again. His writing helped me see how Jesus truly maintained relationships with everyone He encountered. He loved them, and as the title of the book says, He was always right beside them when they needed Him, even when they thought otherwise. The Lazarus chapter, especially the parts about Martha, got me a bit misty.Additionally, I applaud Max for reminding me and other readers to keep our eyes on Jesus. That's a Christian cliche, I know, and one I've come to dislike because until recently, I didn't know what it meant. I tend to take things literally, so I thought it meant, literally sit in your prayer chair in absolute silence and meditate until your emotions go away. (Yeah, I know. You can laugh at that). But this season, between the pandemic and personal struggles, I think I'm learning what ""eyes on Jesus"" actually means. I don't have it ""down"" yet, and maybe I never will, but You Are Never Alone certainly helped.There are a couple of weak points that cost this book a star. The biggest were contained in Max's personal stories. To wit, he likes to use examples of people with ""special needs"" inspiring others to underline his point. For example, he tells the story of how a whole basketball team stopped a game dead in its tracks so a developmentally disabled boy could make a basket--and the whole crowd cheered as if the team and the boy had achieved a 50-point upset. That's just one example, but there are others in this and other Lucado books.This is called inspiration porn, or using a disabled person as an object to make other, non-disabled people feel good or learn lessons. It's kind of a time-honored tradition, especially in Christianity. But as someone who lives with a disability and advocates for disability rights, I cannot and will not endorse it, especially from Christians. I wish Max and other authors would move away from it, and away from other forms of personal storytelling that, when coupled with such great analyses of Scripture, just feel schmaltzy. It's like having a superb cup of dark, hot cocoa--and then somebody dumps a tablespoon of marshmallow fluff all over the thing.Anyway, that's a personal issue and I'll understand if other readers don't see it that way. All in all, You Are Never Alone still gets my recommendation, because it still did what it promised to do. Namely, it refocused me--and potentially other readers--on Jesus and His desire to commune with us, and it provided hope."
"Lucado is a master communicator. Even though he has written scores of books, this is another excellent one. He gives us lessons on many of Jesus' miracles, retelling the events. He adds other stories too with some from his own life. There is an extensive section of questions for reflection so this would make a good book for personal journaling or group discussion.Here are a couple of insights from the book that made a big impression on me. When the royal official came to Jesus to request his son be healed, he traveled from Capernaum to Cana. (John 4:46-54) That was 18 miles. When Jesus told him the son was well, he still had to go back to see it. Granted, he was met part way with good news but he still had to travel hours believing before seeing. What a lesson for someone between Cana and Capernaum, waiting to see the answer God promised.Another insightful lesson comes from the man beside the pool, waiting 38 years for healing. Could he have done something in all those years to move him closer to the healing pool or was he satisfied in his condition? Lucado asks, “What can I do today that will take me in the direction of a better tomorrow?” (410/1631)And one more insight. John recorded miracles not only to affirm Jesus' deity but to assure us of the presence of God and that God cares for us. “...[E]very one of Jesus' miracles was an act of kindness. Someone benefited.” (96/1631)This is a very encouraging book. It is full of encouraging stories and lessons. I highly recommend it.I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher. My comments are an independent and honest review."
"I've read many of Lucado's books, and I never fail to find them encouraging. This was no exception.The author's latest book is based on the gospel of John. While each chapter focuses on Lucado's experiences and stories, each one has a connection to the book of John. I was a bit surprised that there wasn't as much Scripture in this one as there have been in some of his other books.Lucado has the ability to take familiar stories from the bible and make it relevant to today and our daily lives.Key themes include facing our fears and coming to terms that we are not alone. These are critical reminders, especially in the times we are currently experiencing.Disclaimer: I received a complimentary copy, but I wasn't required to leave a positive review."
"Max Lucado brings the promises of the Lord and Jesus to us through the miracles that John wrote about: that He is with us, that we can take all our needs to Him, that He will not leave us, that His help is there, we are not alone, He comes to us and more. The writing of Max Lucado draws us right in front of the Lord and Jesus. I found as I read, “You Are Never Alone” that there were three areas of need in my life. First, I needed to stop holding onto various things. Second, that I have kept putting aside things that I now realize I need to take care of. And third, that I have pushed some things aside far enough that I was not aware of, and now I need to work on them. By seeing, acknowledging, and starting to do the work needed, “You Are Never Alone” has given me strength, peace, comfort, and a way to now take the steps that are needed. A quote from chapter one sums it up, “Life happens when we believe. We find strength beyond our strength…we see solutions beyond our solutions…Belief happens when we place our confidence in God. It is a decision to lean entirely upon the strength of a living and loving Savior.”  I thank Max Lucado for writing “You Are Never Alone” for giving the needed encouragement in these unexpected days, and for the help I need in my journey of faith and belief."
"I recently finished this book.  It is an easy-to-read book that I could have finished in a weekend but I chose to read more slowly to give myself time to reflect on what I was reading. Every chapter has a message. Max Lucado uses real life examples to help us understand the Gospel message and apply it to our lives and past, present and future circumstances. I consider myself a mature Christian and I still had a number of “ah ha” moments when I was reading. I plan to re-read the book and write these ideas in my Bible. The questions for reflection for each chapter are helpful. I used them to review what I read. I plan to join the Bible study using this book this fall"
"In a Case for Christ, Lee Strobel gives evidence that helped even he himself, a professed atheist, come to believe in Christ. The gospel of John similarly gives a first-person account of both the miracles and teaching of Christ that made him believe, so that we can also believe. In his latest book, You Are Never Alone, Max Lucado incorporates scripture from the gospel of John with personal anecdotes and modern-day miracles and stories of perseverance to help us see that “you’re stronger than you think because God is nearer than you know.”  His book helps us see Jesus and his miracles not only as stories of the past, but stories of the present—of our present—so that we can also give a first-person account of the difference that Christ makes.As someone who has been struggling with chronic health issues for the past couple of years, this book has been very encouraging to me. I was so thankful to receive an early copy of this book; as always, God’s timing is perfect! If you are struggling through something today, this book is a wonderful reminder that miracles still happen and God is still present. He is also a very personal God that craves a relationship with us. With God by your side, You are never alone!"
"I am honored to have received an advance reading copy of this book and am able to share with you this honest review. You Are Never Alone is both relevant to the time in which we live as well as insightful. Max Lucado highlights the miracles of Jesus from the book of John while reminding us that, ""John recorded them, not to impress us, but to urge us to believe in the tender presence and mighty power of Christ ... God can carry you!"" He challenges each of us to, ""...offer a simple prayer and entrust the problem to Christ."" If you are feeling drained by your current circumstances, you will be encouraged by the meaningful messages shared throughout You Are Never Alone! It certainly is a refreshing read for such a time as this!"
"I’m going to begin my review like this:  Go ahead right now and buy this book.  You’ll be glad you did.  For the times in which we are living, we need this closer look at Jesus more than ever before.Max Lucado has given us a book that’s enfused with hope and encouragement as he guides us through the book of John and highlights the miracles of Jesus.  I found this book to be by turns  comforting; convicting; encouraging; inspiring; warm; and humorous. It would be difficult to choose my favorite chapter, because each one has its own special application to our lives. This book holds a much needed message for all of us:“The message of the miracles is the Miracle Worker Himself.  He wants you to know that you are never alone.  You are never without help, hope, or strength.  You are stronger than you think because God is nearer than you might imagine. (Quote from Chapter 12).  I’ve read many of this author’s books, but I think I highlighted something on nearly every page in this one. I’ll be reading this book again, and working my way through the study questions included with the book.  I want to glean as much as I can for this thoughtful devotional book.I received a copy of this book from the publisher.  All opinions are my own."
"#You are Never Alone# by  Max  Lucado is a Christian living book. Max is a Senior Pastor at Oak Hills Church in San Antonio , Texas.  He  is a best selling author. He has  been writing for two decades. This book is  practical and helpful .

Thank you to the publisher, author and netgalley for allowing me to read and review this book."
"Another excellent read by Max Lucado! While I generally read Christian fiction, when I do read non-fiction, Lucado is one of my go-to authors. I've read a majority of his works and have loved them all! This one is no different and is so appropos for our time. This book follows the miracles of Jesus as outlined in the book of John and demonstrates the ways that Jesus communicated He is here for us. Using scriptures as well as stories from his own life and lives of others, Lucado has spelled out the Love of the Father in a very unique way. Even though one of the catch phrases this year has been ""we're all in this together"", I think I speak for many of us when I say that we've never felt more alone, in spite of that. This book is such a good resource for that and I can't recommend it enough! Special thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for an advanced e-copy of this book. I was under no obligation to write a review and the thoughts contained herein are my own."
"You Are Never Alone: Trust in the Miracle of God's Presence and Power by Max Lucado is a timely read that is so valuable today. This author has a way of making his writing instantly relevant and deeply personal to the reader. It is like he can read our inner thoughts and pierces directly to the heart. He intersperses anecdotal stories of people he knows with the stories of people in the Bible, bringing the Scriptures to life with a vibrancy that makes it even more relevant to our own lives. With a message of hope in the certainty of God, this book is a must read in today's chaotic world. I highly recommend it. I received a digital copy of this book from the publisher with no obligations. These opinions are entirely my own."
"I wanted to love this book, but to be honest first chapter in I felt it was kind of all over the place for me. It didn't capture my attention like I wanted it to.I wanted to love this being that I don't know much about the Bible, but it seems like this is for people who know a little more than I on the word of God. I will try to continue,  but when you're not into a book it's harder to understand.I like the quotes from the Bible. But the story just , I couldn't follow."
"You are Never Alone is another treasure written by one of America's pastors, Max Lucado.I was blessed to be selected as a pre-reader of this book, receiving an advanced copy from the publisher and I am so grateful!It is just what we need at this time - Max’s book is convicting, making me ask questions of myself while pointing me to Jesus 👈🏻for the answers and giving me a hunger to know more.With each chapter I followed along in the book of 📖John. Filling in the parts between the miracles that are unpacked in this book.In John 5:19 Jesus tells the Jewish leaders:“Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; He can do only what he sees His Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does. For the Father loves the Son and shows him all He does. Yes, and He will show him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed.”‭‭John‬ ‭5:19-20‬ ‭NIV‬‬Thank you Max Lucado for helping me to see these miracles with fresh eyes!Jesus is still showing us who He is in so many ways. Let’s open our eyes 👀 to the miracles recorded in His Word 🎚and to the miracles surrounding us everyday.💜“Your greatest need is His presence. Yes, you want this storm to pass.

This book is perfect for this crazy time we are living in. It is a wonderful reminder that no matter what we are going through or how crazy the world gets we are never alone and God is still in control. I hope Max Lucado does a bible study and publishes a study guide to go alone with this book. This is a book everybody needs to read. Thank you Thomas Nelson--LUCADO BRAND - Thomas Nelson via NetGalley for the ARC copy of this book. All opinions expressed are my own.
"I've never read a Max Lucado book I didn't love, and this one is no exception.  He really goes in depth into why we are never alone, and how the bible explains the closeness of Gods presence to bring us peace.One thing that's really different about this book compared to his others, is the section in the back.  For each chapter he has a corresponding workbook type area.  It has many questions to reflect on.  It doesn't leave room to write in the answers though, so you might want to get a separate notebook if you plan to use it as a workbook study guide.In the face of struggles, no matter if it's fear or sadness, this book is exactly what you need! It brings hope to the hopeless and opens your eyes to the power of God's presence.  Highly recommended!"
"The focus is on Jesus. The focus is always on Jesus in Max Lucado’s writing—on how much God loves YOU, enough to send His Son Jesus to cover your sins with His shed blood. The God of the universe loves you and wants to have a relationship with you. That is the message of You Are Never Alone.Max Lucado’s style of writing is so appealing; it’s like sitting down with an old friend who loves you and has great anecdotes and wisdom to share. He has a way with words. Even his acknowledgements section, often the boring part of a book, is a masterpiece of prose. Lucado can paint word pictures that make you feel you are right there in that hospital waiting room with a hurting mom or having a fish breakfast on the beach with Jesus, risen from the dead, and Peter who denied him. The writing can grip your heart as you see yourself as Jesus does, make you smile as you respond to the humor in a situation, and bring you to your knees as you realize the enormity of God’s love for you.You Are Never Alone weaves anecdotes Lucado has collected along the way with Scriptural lessons from the book of John in the New Testament. He writes in everyday language with inspiration that will keep you turning pages. Look for theological soundness that never seems pompous and scenarios that depict life as we know it in vivid language we understand. There is a lot of tongue-in-cheek that you are not meant to take literally but which elucidate the heart meaning of the passages. He jumps from Jesus cooking “fish tacos” for His disciples to earlier references of art restoration as Jesus wipes away “layers of guilt and shame” in Peter’s heart with a “cotton swab of grace.” Lucado makes these complex connections seamlessly, and the reader emerges with a new understanding of the old story of God’s redemption of man.This inspirational book can be devoured as a whole, read chapter by chapter over several days, or studied in depth using the “Questions for Reflection” prepared by Andrea Lucado. This section occupies one quarter of the text and takes the reader through thought provoking questions that encourage you to invest yourself, including your imagination and feelings, in the study which never strays from the Scripture. This book is an examination of the themes and miracles found in the Gospel of John. It is inspirational, humorous, and insightful. You Are Never Alone is yet another of Max Lucado’s books that will encourage you to trust in God during life’s storms.I received a complimentary copy of this book. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own."
"This book has the reassuring cadence that Max Lucado’s books always have. He reminds us of truth, fills us with encouragement, and pushes away lies of the enemy. I didn’t realize how much my spirit needed this book. I’m sending copies to people I love because we can all use the boost!"
"Each chapter opens with an anecdotal life lesson which the author ties in to a Bible lesson from the book of John. He does this so well with wisdom, compassion, sincerity and even some humor mixed in.There are no insignificant examples of answered prayers. If it matters to you and me, it also matters to God…and, He truly cares. Reading and absorbing this book will help you to move from contingent faith to unconditional faith.Chapter 11…Breakfast With Jesus, was one of my favorite chapters. I loved the author’s thoughts on the complete and total restoration that Jesus offers and gives to each of us when we need it time and time again. His well of restorations never runs dry.While reading this book, it felt as though a wise, loving, shepherding pastor was guiding me into a closer relationship with and a greater appreciation for my personal savior, Jesus.There are some wonderful, thought provoking questions for reflection at the end of the book. Reading the questions and pondering your answers will definitely enhance your reading experience and grow your faith. This book would be an excellent choice for a small group, a Bible Study or a book club, especially if everyone participates in the questions and answers for each chapter. This book is faith enhancing and could be life changing.I received complimentary copies of this book from Thomas Nelson Publishing through NetGalley and the Amazon Vine Program. All opinions expressed in this review are entirely my own.I highly encourage you to read this book and be blessed."
"I am so thankful to have received an advanced copy of Max Lucado's new book You are Never Alone. This amazing story telling has the reader feel like they are there experiencing the same things as the people in the book. This book is perfect for all of us going through the times we are going through today with COVID-19 and civil unrest. I love the references to certain scripture which allows me to go back and do some more reading in my Bible. One of my favorite quotes is ""Life happens when you believe"".  God is with you no matter what you are going through. This is shown to us through the teachings in the gospel of John. If you believe and trust in God he will be there for you. This is a truly amazing book, it has changed my life, and I believe everyone should read it."
"You Are Never Alone is a Christian inspirational by author Max Lucado.You Are Never Alone has a good mixture of stories written by Mr. Lucado, as well as a good selection of Bible verses; most taken from the book of John.Mr. Lucado’s stories show that nothing is mundane with Christ. From the least of prayers to the most of prayers Jesus is willing to answer them.You Are Never Alone has short chapters and is a short book. You Are Never Alone would be great for individual or group study. There are questions for reflection that make You Are Never Alone a great book club choice!I love Mr. Lucado’s books because they are so encouraging.Disclaimer: I receive complimentary books from various sources, including, publishers, publicists, authors, and/or NetGalley. I am not required to write a positive review and have not received any compensation. The opinions shared here are my own entirely. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255"
"""You Are Never Alone"" is a timely read from Max Lucado, especially during the virus pandemic.  Around 200 pages (of which about 140 are the book itself and about 60 are a study guide), the title is a compilation of Bible studies where God was with His people or a particular person.As with other Lucado title, the book is very readable, smoothly transitions from chapter to chapter, has good spiritual insights, and reads like the author is talking with you over a cup of coffee.  Another good title by Lucado!"
"I love You Are Never Alone by Max Lucado. I think it’s his best book! It is also so comforting in the midst of this pandemic! In this book, Mr. Lucado looks at the miracles from the gospel of John in his unique style. His stories really bring the truths home. In each chapter, he helps us understand how we are never alone - God is with us, for us, and will help us. I have found it encouraging to read a chapter each day and meditate on its truths slowly. You should get this book for yourself and others and read it frequently and savor its truths."
"I have always loved the ease of reading Max Lucado’s books and this book is no different. Lucado does such a good job of writing words that mean so much, that comfort the heart and soul, and are read with ease and flow.During this time it’s so easy to feel alone and feel that God is distant, but Lucado reminds us that God is near and listening to our hearts even when filled with questions, pain, and hurts.As always Lucado’s words are 2nd to the strong Biblical truths that he shares in his work, and he allows God’s word to speak for itself."
This great reading is just another confirmation that the Lord our God is always with us- he never leaves nor forsakes us! As a recovering addict it's so comforting knowing this first hand. He was always there with me even when I couldn't feel Him nor see Him. I have Max Lucado to thank for having a part in leading me on my close relationship I now have with Christ. His books are written in a way that even a child can understand them. I need his style of teaching since I'm not as mature in knowledge of the bible. I'm now going to pass this book along to another and pray that this person will feel God's presence always for He never leaves us alone!
"Max Lucado seemlessly and eloquently places the same biblical principles in a book relatable and understandable to 21st century Christians. Through his many current life and bibical examples, Lucado takes readers on a journey to realize the beautifully deep characteristics of God and gives us all a chance and a call to develop our relationship with Christ on a deeper level. Lucado recognizes modern day issues and helps tie readers back to our timeless cure in salvation and communion with our one true Savior. While not difficult to read at all, this boox provides invaluable insight, complexity, and a fresh perspective on God's permanent presence  in our life."
"Mr. Lucado's books always seem to tell me just what I need to hear atthat point in my life. There is no question that this year has been one of the most difficult year of my life.This book has touched me in ways that are difficult to describe.I am now feeling my faith being restored so that I can carry on with my life and cope.Thank you Mr. Lucado, for leading me home.Don't miss this book.  But most especially after what we have all had to deal with in the past year.Highly recommended"
"days agoMax Lucado has done it again. In his latest book, You Are Never Alone, he takes the reader back in time to experience the miracles of Jesus through the gospel of John. He shows us that there is a God who loves us and cares for us and He will carry us through any difficult time. We simply have to believe. Max’s way of storytelling makes the reader feel like we are there, firsthand witnesses to the miracles of Christ. You won’t want to put this one down."
Feeling alone? Through this book Max Lucado points you to Gods word and shows you that “You Are Never Alone.” Awesome book especially for those who are struggling.
"I am a fan of anything Max Lucado and this book is no exception.  You Are Never Alone: Trust in the Miracle of God's Presence and Power arrives at a critical time in our history.  With so many feeling isolated and our world turned upside down, this book offers hope on which to stand.I always enjoy Mr. Lucado's quiet, gentle spirit and his ability to story tell.  The tone of his words soothes the weary soul.If you are looking for hope, this one is for you.I received an advanced readers copy from the publisher."
"In my opinion I just finished the best book that Max Lucado has ever written. You Are Never Alone is a promise and a miracle. He states that you might FEEL you are alone but you are NEVER alone. On the book cover under the title are these words ""Trust in the Miracle of GOD'S PRESENCE and POWER"" and that is the heart and message of this wonderful book."
"Max Lucado has a unique way of storytelling that makes you feel like you are sitting with a trusted friend receiving Godly advice. He always directs you back to Jesus. ""Keep your eyes on the Lord and your mind on scripture."" Every chapter gives us truth from God's word with the reminder that ""You are never alone, never without help, and never without hope.""There is a study guide at the back of the book with questions for self reflection or to use in a study group.I received an advance reading copy of this book and was asked to write an honest review."
"I was introduced to Max Lucado's writings by a friend shortly before the pandemic.  I have read several of his books and was so impressed.  His writing speaks to my heart.  I ordered this book, just before the vaccine became widely available.  I wanted a book that would help me navigate my way out of this pandemic.  Lucado uses the Miracles of Jesus to show us how we are never alone.  There are some other authors in the book, but the majority of the writing is Lucado's.  I highly recommend this book"
"Max Lucado is one of my favorite authors, and this book just makes that feeling stronger. You Are Never Alone shows the reader that even in a world turned sideways, and even when we are at our loneliest. Jesus is always by our side.The Gospel of John tells of Jesus' first seven miracles. People who came to Jesus in his early ministry needing help to save them from hunger, thirst, sickness, even death.This book can be used for individual or small group study, and has group discussion questions in the back."
"Loved this book based on book of John. As always Max is a brilliant story teller. In this book, he invites us to walk with Jesus and the disciples through the book of John, for one purpose, to believe. Mac has a way of describing the stories that I feel like I’m right there"
"Max Lucado caught my heart!  Parts of the book made me cry, laugh, and feel like I was right there in his story!  I have most of his books, inspirational books, and even his Encouraging Word Bible.  This book is my favorite.  I am reading it for the second time.  He grabs you with his honest, down to earth humility, and doesn't stop until the last page -- which is way to soon!  You will enjoy every word, phrase, and paragraph."
Pure Max if he is your usual read but great if not.  Addresses the needs we have now in this stressful time.  One of his best
"Max is a master if anecdotes.  He’s done a superb job of personalizing the teachings of John. If you read this book and don't know that God is with you ALL of the time, not just when he finds time for you...read it again!  John worked hard to record Jesus' miracles and teaching. Max brings them to life in a way only he is capable of doing!"
"I received an advance copy from the publisher to read and review ahead of the release date.  I was so glad to receive this book and would definitely buy it for others.  Especially during this time of uncertainty, Max Lucado's words not only ring true but also bring hope to those who need it.  Even those who are faithful sometimes wonder if we are alone, but You Are Never Alone reminds all of us that we are not alone, even through all this."
"This book is filled with encouragement, scripture, and delightful personal stories reminding us how faithful our loving God Is!  What a timely book for a very difficult year of Covid."
"This was my first Max Lucado book. His voice was delightful to read, with subtle humor and deep points he kept me engaged reading the whole book. This book is about the book of John and all the miracles Jesus did in that gospel with an interesting angle that Jesus did these miracles to prove that He is always with us and we are never alone. It was very encouraging. As someone who isn't currently struggling with loneliness I still found some good takeaways for today and a few of the little stories were memorable enough to carry with me if I ever need comfort in this area. 5 stars.Thank you to NetGalley for providing this book in exchange for an honest review."
"As a young Christian Auther, this book really stood out to me. Max Lucado did an amazing job of making it clear how God still at work in our lives today! Through the miracles of Jesus to illustrate in the Gospel of John, Max dives deep into the knowing that you are not alone in your journey through life. For example, from turning water into wine and the restoration of Peter after Jesus's Resurrection, God's Presence and Power are illustrated and present."
"Reading a Max Lucado reminds me of curling up in front of a warm fireplace in a cozy cabin. Max makes readers feel “at home.” I am no stranger to Max’s books. They have been a balm to my soul in weary times. This book was so timely in this long season of isolation. Personable, loving, and easy to digest, You Are Never Alone is just what the heart needs in the middle of a Pandemic."
"I received an advance reader copy of this book from the publisher.  I have read many of Max Lucado's books and You are Never Alone does not disappoint.  You Are Never Alone is both relevant to the time in which we live as well as insightful.  Max brings scripture to life with refreshing stories from his life and others.  In his writing, he shows us how God is here to help us and give us hope in our daily lives. You are Never Alone is full of encouragement and hope."
Max Lucado is a go to author for me when I’m looking for anything to renew my faith and make it stronger. I don’t think he can write a bad book. You are Never Alone was a beautiful book and I read it at a time when we could all use the message of this book.Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for the opportunity to read this beautiful book.
This is a book with an included study guide as well.This is a easy to read book that really is a great reminder to trust in God... no matter what is happening in the world and in our lives.Very encouraging.
Lucado's latest book is very inspiring and encouraging. He goes through various events that transpired in the gospel of John. Lucado is able to move from the text to applying it's message to our lives.
"I truly enjoyed Max's book. It was very inspiring. I love the stories, especially the stories he writes about his own life. One story he shared as a child was especially inspiring to me. This is a great book to go back to and reflect on. Thanks!!"
"I very much enjoyed this book. It was a timely set of devotions that I believe I will read many times. The message that no matter what I am facing, it has been faced before by others. God is in control and is always with me."
This book is a must read!!! I have read several Max Lucado books and this one is my fave!! This book couldn’t have come at a better time for me. All of us have that feeling of being alone when we are going through a struggle. This book really proves that we are never alone. Buy it today!!
"This book is such a blessing! Max digs into deep, dark places to show and prove that Jesus and his love and light is always there with you!"
"I love this book. What perfect timing to be reminded that God is always with us. We have power and influence because of our relationship to our Heavenly Father. I really enjoy the study guide, it helps me focus and process what I’ve read."
Love all his books.  Another amazing read.  So good!
"“There is a message in his miracles; I am here. I care.” This is another timely book of Good News by Max Lucado that will feed your faith. Lucado draws on biblical accounts of God’s presence and power and assembles them like puzzle pieces that help us see a pattern that confirms we are never alone or without hope, not then or now."
"Such a hope filled book. Quick, easy read, so encouraging. I love Max's writing style. Bits of humor, touching stories, just all together great.I received an advanced reader copy, which did not influence my review."
"Max Lucado is such a relevant author for our time! It was a  very encouraging and uplifting read at this time!Through personal stories he confirms that we are never alone...God is ALWAYS with us, even when we don't feel like it! It was a great, easy read! Uplifting!"
There are times when I have felt that God was so far from me. Especially during this pandemic. I was honored to be chosen to participate in Max Lucado’s book launch. I had the opportunity to read this book when a pre launch copy was sent to me from the publisher. God knew what I needed! He’s no further than our next breath. Buy the book and enjoy some time with your savior! You will never regret it.
"ManMax Lucado has been  given a gift of words to describe Christ, who he is, who we are and what is our relationship. Thank you God."
"Max Lucado takes stories and accounts from the Bible that we have heard and brings them to speak on a personal and current level to remind us We Are Never Alone.  This book can be read over and over, shared with others who are facing difficult times and used as a Bible Study series.  Get your copy today"
"As always I enjoyed Max’s new book. His writting is just like listening to a good friend or mentor telling stories about life and Jesus. It is an easy read and easy to listen. I ended up purchasing the book on Audible because I like to multi task and I can listen while doing the dishes...it’s quite hard to hold a book and fold clothes, #momlife."
This is the second book review I have given on a book by Max Lucado.  Max Lucado has a way of writing a book that gets his point across with some humor and relativity mixed in.  This is something that you will realize in just the first two chapters.  Max Lucado's message is that we are not alone even if we feel like we are.  We have Jesus who will help us through anything.
Max is one of my favorite authors and he did not disappoint in this book! He always makes me lift my head up and realize how Blessed I truly am not matter what!
"The author is transparent and honest, reminding/telling us that God is always with us. He has a plan and we are in it."
I listened by  audiobook and loved it. definitely will made me feel there’s always hope. Not to be doubtful. Thank you
"Our world is different, but God is not. He is always the same and is always with us. In You Are Never Alone, Max Lucado brings Jesus’ miracles to life for us by using the Gospel of John. Mr. Lucado displays how these miracles bring Jesus into our world and how close he is to each of us."
This book is a MUST HAVE for 2020. I received a copy from the publisher and have already read it. Once you start you will not want to put it down.It’s very uplifting especially in a year like 2020.
I absolutely love Max's books! He knows exactly how to talk to what you're dealing with and this is no exception. His work to get this out in a time when so many are struggling is such to help so many people! Definitely worth the read!
If these unprecedented times have you feeling alone and afraid this is the book you need to read. Max takes the miracles found in the book of John and shows us lessons on their faith and how to apply them to our situations.
Max's writing is amazing.  He brings things you already think you know right into your heart with incredible clarity and humor.
It’s a good book but would not buy again
"Good book as are the books I choose to buy from Amazon. Nit novels right now, books about living the life you want and deserve"
"This is an excellent book, it pulls at the heart strings. His best book"
Another excellent read by this author
Great buy
Probably my favourite author.  Was surprised when it came as we were told that it would be delayed
This is my favourite Christian author - and this was an excellent book
Nice size book.  Easy to read.  Arrived early! Comforting book in an uncomfortable time.
Realizing that we really AREN’T along ......... God is there
so well written by Max; very comforting.
"This book has the potential to be good, but it really didn't meet my expectations as a book about relationships through the lens of the Enneagram. Suzanne goes through each of the nine types, much like she and Ian did in The Road Back To You, but now the focus seems to be specifically on trouble spots in relationships for the nine types. Each chapter tells a story of how someone unintentionally hurt the ones they love with their own vices or excesses unique to their type. Of course, this type of information can be good and helpful if you're prepared for the fact that it can be, at times, painful to read. But when you're sold a book on relationships, it feels like a shortcut around writing a much longer and more detailed book specifically about the interplay between the types.Bottom line: if you finished The Road Back To You and want to learn more about the ugly side of each of the types, this book is for you. But if you're looking for the interplay between a 4 and a 9, or a 7 and a 2, etc, you'll be disappointed by the lack of content."
"Wow – there is a chapter about me and it has some tools that are helping me open up (a little) and letting others into my life.Probably the most important insight is the awareness there are more than two ways of being in the world.  I have always known there were my way and their way.  But the author identifies 8 other ways other people see the world.  Once I got past the embarrassment of the revelations about me, I realized the awareness of why others behave differently can help me in my relationships with my immediate family.Some things the book has taught me about me are:• I can “be in an intimate relationship without risking more than I can stand to lose.”• I cannot “live my life without needing help from others at times.”• I will have “to work to balance my thinking with some emotion and action.”I am old enough to realize my fences will always be there and I will always need gates if I want relationships with other people.  The Path Between Us has given me some keys to unlock my gates and some lights to illuminate the paths to my gates.There is a chapter in The Path Between Us that is about you.  A chapter that can help you beautify your paths so your relationships can blossom to their full potential."
"As a therapist, I use the Enneagram as a tool in my private practice.  I have seen positive changes in my client’s lives and their relationships.  I recommend this book to my clients often.  I also recommend it to my friends and family.Suzanne Stabile gives us understandable, in-depth information about how we all see the world differently, react to the world differently and how this effects our relationships with others in our world.She opens the door to her wisdom of the enneagram providing us with insight about how each specific number typically behaves in relationships along with having an understanding as to how and why others respond to us in relationships.This book gives specific information on how each number can best get along with each other.  The end of each chapter has bullet points on steps we can take to better ourselves and thus our relationships, along with things to keep in mind when relating to someone of a specific number.Suzanne Stabile’s “The Path between Us” is a great book for everyone to read. I highly recommend this book along with her first book “The Road back to You”."
"Just as a book, this is not bad.  If I had read no title or description and had no expectations, it would have been all right.  But it's advertised as a book particularly about relationships, and as one that substantively adds to the information in The Road Back to You.  As such, I found it pretty mediocre.There's very little information here specifically about the interplay between the types, particular trouble spots specific combinations may run into, etc.  In fact, this is limited basically to a sidebar in each chapter.  It really reads more as a basic ""about the enneagram"" book, from the perspective of ""this might be the type of someone ELSE in your life,"" as opposed to the ""this might be you"" perspective found in the previous book.It didn't add enough value, in my estimation, to have been worth buying this in addition to its forerunner (which is very good); I feel like I wasted my money buying this one."
"Suzanne Stabile is the most accessible teacher of the Enneagram that I have encountered. Her narrative style communicates vast knowledge in a tone that invites honest self-reflection and compassion for others. The Path Between Us is a brilliant combination of story-telling,fact sharing, and growth invitations to open the reader's eyes to how those they love see the world.Do you want to love better? Do you desire deeper connection in relationships? Do you long for insightful empathy toward people you disagree with? This book can be a wonderful guide in that journey!"
"Suzanne Stabile is a Master Teacher of the Enneagram, having studied and taught it for many years in a variety of settings and contexts. This accessible book provides a map to healthier and more fulfilling relationships through the lens of the Enneagram. Having some basic knowledge of the Enneagram prior to reading this book would be helpful (I would suggest ""The Road Back to You"" co-authored with Ian Cron).At the end of each chapter, Stabile has two summary pages: Relationships for Type Numbers and Relationships with Type Numbers. But don't just settle for the summaries. Each chapter is filled with wisdom from Suzanne's life and her interactions with people from all walks of life in all the places of the Enneagram. I found her section in each chapter, ""Limitations in Relationships"" to be particularly instructive."
"This is one of the most practical books about the Enneagram I have read!  The book does not just present theory's and concepts but rather provides real life, entertaining stories that illustrate the subtle differences between the Enneagram numbers and how they see the world, especially as it relates to relationships. The stories make the wisdom shared easily accessible and understandable.One of my most favorite aspects of this book is the creative and helpful way it is structured.  Too many times when I find a book that I like, I have to search back through the pages and find my highlighting or underlining to reference important points.  This book does that for the reader by breaking out the chapters into the different Enneagram numbers and then highlighting important points within the text, as well as on the side of the page where it outlines key facts about how a specific number relates to other numbers.  Each chapter then concludes with information about relationships for and with that specific Enneagram number.I keep this book at my desk for easy reference.  I have purchased several copies to give away to friends, and then have discovered they have done the same because they found it so helpful.  I also purchased the audio book, which I highly recommend!  It's great to listen to in the car on the way to work if I need a refresher and it is also helpful if I want to share about a particular number with someone - I can let them listen to that particular chapter or story.  The audio book is read by the author which is another benefit because she is very easy to listen to and you can tell she is very comfortable with the material. It just fits!"
"Best Book on The Enneagram ever written.  Ok, I have only read 42 but this is the best of the 42!  If you want to become the best person you can be, if you want to grow spiritually and you want better relationships then definitely buy this book!"
"In this book Suzanne Stabile provides insight based on her own experience and years of investigation into the experiences of others.  She gives us the fruit of her years of work in a way that is accessible, useful and helpful.  Utilizing her gift for storytelling, she clearly lays out how we can improve our relationships with each other by showing us how we can be better together by understanding how we see the world differently from each other.  Whether you've ever heard of or studied the Enneagram or not, it doesn't matter; buy this book!"
"I was attracted to this book because… I am enjoying learning all I can about the Enneagram. Suzanne co-authored the THE ROAD BACK TO YOU. This seemed like the next logical step to take.This book was about how the nine Enneagram personality types see and process the world. It is very revealing to realize how your type and the other eight types respond to the circumstances. First, you this book helps you understand your type’s motivations for responding and where to watch for how you can make positive impact on your own motivation.Second, understanding how the other type see the world and respond, helps remove judgment and gives you insight into build your relationships and not tear them down.Things I liked about this book Suzanne presents the material in an informative and entertaining way. Almost all of the antidotes, remind you of experiences of your life and your relationships. Most of the time, you are saying to yourself, ‘oh, that’s what happened.’Why you should read this book In this life, relationships are the most important aspect of our life. You have felt at odds with both your closer family/personal relationships or in your distant professional/social relationships, this book will help you understand the conflicts. It will also give you the insight to help you take those relationships to a deep, more successful path. If you are like me, it will give you a greater desire to know more.This book lived up to the back cover copy  - I agree with the notes on the back cover. This information will lead to more life giving relationships."
Loved the conversational tone of this. The Enneagram information was interesting and well explained. My favorite features were the spots where she highlighted each number in relation to the other eight as well as the chapter-ending pieces that were words of advice for each type and then for people in relationship with others who embody that type. Excellent!
"Appreciated the authors humor and down to earth approach. Some of the numbers got many more pages than others. The best approach would be to take into consideration that people grow ,change, and mellow. So don’t take the book as the end all. I think it would be helpful to show how each can grow into a better them. Some numbers I felt had too much negativity and not enough, here’s how you grow."
"Beautifully written and invitational this book is a breath of fresh air. Suzanne Stabile is an Enneagram master and speaks to this ancient concept with expertise, humor,  a fresh perspective and kindness. A must read for anyone interested in better understanding themselves and the world around them!"
"Sadly, this review is not about the content of the book. Instead, I have to describe the print quality of the book because it's so distracting. I'm even worried that Amazon may have sent me a counterfeit, as they did with $240 million of ""Liturgy of the Ordinary"" fakes.These issues with quality have significantly affected my experience, even making it hard to read the text:· Cover falling apart at the spine after less than two weeks· Ink is not as black· Low resolution on all type, especially on small type (because it hurts legibility so much)· Callout backgrounds make the callouts illegible—I doubt they would have gotten past IVP quality control.None of the quality issues were a problem with Stabile/IVP’s companion book, “A Road Back to You”.  Here are some more differences; I think they’re also quality issues, but they didn’t hurt my experience as much as the others:· Much lighter weight (315g vs 415g)· Cover lacks ribbing"
"The enneagram is such a powerful tool for growth, both individually and in relationship, but so many books on the subject are dry, too complex or boring. Suzanne Stabile has taken her years as an enneagram master and boiled the subject down to an entertaining, clear message in The Path Between Us, handing us a simple tool box for deep understanding, healing and growth. Her stories and insights are invaluable in helping us work through our personalities and recognize our challenges in relationships with others, deepening our ability to become better human beings and connect with people in real, tangible ways. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand and improve their relationships."
"Run don't walk to get your copy! Suzanne Stabile's newest book is full of stories, powerful insights, and deep wisdom to help you and your relationships at work and at home. You will want to read this book over and over to glean something new with each reading. Enjoy!"
"I just finished this book and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a clear, simple and insightful book on the Enneagram. Susanne Stabile uses stories to illustrate the timeless wisdom of the Enneagram.  Her descriptions go beyond a static personality typing system and dive into the unique ways that we move within the Enneagram during times of stress and security.  I have read numerous books on the Enneagram and have found “The Path Between Us” to be the easiest style to learn from. By teaching through a narrative format, Susanne meets any reader where they are at on their Enneagram journey, and encourages them to look deeper into their relationships with others.  This is a great book for those looking to learn more about the Enneagram."
"I am beyond disappointed in this book. I bought it and the study guide based on reviews and book discription. When it arrived today I started reading the book and was a little confuse as if I should have read another book before this one. I switched to the study guide and there it was. ""it is worth noting that if all of this talking of Ennergram isn't making sense to you, now would be a good time to go back and read The road back to you: An Ennergram journey to self discovery.."".. Umm why didn't the discription say this is a second book in the series... I can't follow what they are talking about and fell like I wastes my money. Sooo disappointed."
"I actually couldn't get into this book much. It feels to me like the beginning drags a lot, explaining exactly what the enneagrams are and what the book's purpose is to the point where I was no longer interested. It may be a useful book, but just not my cup of tea with a busy work and family life happening."
"What an approachable, insightful, and transforming book about how to understand your Enneagram number and how that impacts your most significant relationships. Even if you are new to the Enneagram, the introduction alone offers a brief but deep overview that will help you identify your number and then take an even deeper dive into how your number functions in community with others. Suzanne's writing and expertise bring as many laughs as they do wisdom and application. The Enneagram is not meant to be just a mental pursuit; but more of a tool for powerful self-discovery, compassion, and transformation. This book captures that and I highly recommend it!"
"I have read a lot of enneagram literature, and this one is unmatched in it's ability to communicate the complexity of the enneagram in relationship. Suzanne has taken this to the next level. She communicates in an authentic and inviting way that allows and invites discussion and appreciating for how each type sees the world. She is able to provide invaluable insight into the variety of relationships that exist in our world. This book will change the way that you view yourself, your relationships, and your world."
"I actually found this book more helpful to me than the initial Road Back to You book. While self-awareness has value, what this second book does is really help grow in awareness of how I am received by others and how I might interpret others. This is extremely helpful in leading a team or just being part of a team."
"Both the books are beautifully written- Road Back to You as well as The Path Between Us. The explanations are easily understandable and the examples are very, very useful. You will leave with a comprehensive understanding and yearning to learn more about the Enneagram. Fascinating. Truly grateful for such a wonderful teacher. 🙏🏽"
"This is a wonderful supplement book to ""The Road Back to You"".  It is truly the most helpful tool out there for fostering understanding and compassion for others!!! Love it!"
"If you want to continue your learning of the Enneagram after reading A Road Back To You, this is your next step. Suzanne's method of teaching through storytelling allows you to see yourself and others in each of the 9 types and to apply these learnings to your relationships.I found the best way to use all of this information was to get a group of my friends together and go through the study guide. The insight and personal stories we were able to share by using the study guide and book together allowed the learnings to come to life. If you want to take the next step to learning more about yourself and how you relate to others, I would definitely recommend both the book and study guide (and a good group of friends)."
"I appreciated this book for expanding upon my understanding of different Enneagram types and how they can play out in relation to others. The multiple examples were helpful for demonstrating how even the same numbers can express or react differently in various situations and circumstances. I enjoyed reading Suzanne's writing and found that her voice makes it easy and friendly to learn the Enneagram on a deeper level. This book can speak to those with a basic understanding of the Enneagram, and will also appeal to those who desire to understand and apply the Enneagram further. I highly recommend this book, and hope to read more of Suzanne Stabile's work!"
"I couldn't read this book fast enough!!!  As a new student of the Enneagram, I continue to find more and more insight into my own way of being and greater compassion for others, through Suzanne's great work!!!  The personal stories shared are helpful to paint pictures of what it is like to be in relationship with each number.  And I love the bullet points and lists that give an ""at a glance"" look for each number to know about themselves, and for someone in relationship with them to know them.  Suzanne provides guidance for continuing to grow in your number and to find the path between us to grow in healthy relationships."
"The Path Between is a must read for everyone who wants to understand  themselves and those they love better. Suzanne is brilliant in bringing the Enneagram to us in ways that enlighten so many facets of relationships. Her understanding of the Enneagram is one thing, but her helping us understand the Enneagram in relationship to one another is life changing. Suzanne brings her wit, gift of story telling and her wisdom of the Enneagram as expected, she has a gift of teaching. As a wife, mother, daughter, friend, and therapist this book is enlightening and edifying to all of my relationships."
"Wow this book is a must read. It is definitely what I was looking for! It helps to understand how others around you process life. For me,  knowing how they are wired helps me not get so upset. Now, if I could just get THEM to read and understand how I am wired!  Thank you!"
"Helped me learn about why I do things the way I do - ways to stop the negative stuff before it becomes a problem, and ways to deter distractions & keep my focus.  Also a most excellent reference book for learning new ways to work with people that challenge me!  Suzanne has a way of clearing the heady verbiage of other valuable sources into everyday language....with laughter and truth.  I honor how hard it is to speak truth in love of all that tough stuff about each Enneagram number....even her own!  She is a master - and keeps learning.  Can't hardly wait to see what she publishes next!"
"This is a delightful and incredibly helpful book when it comes to self knowledge and relationships. As a professional counselor I use the enneagram in my practice to help clients understand their motivations and how their personality functions, this book will be an excellent resource as it is full of helpful stories and nuances for each personality type. I heartily recommend it for any person wanting to understand the enneagram or wanting to increase their understanding of it."
"Several months after receiving the book, I finally had time to start reading the book from the very beginning. After 10 minutes of confusion and no-end sentences, I realized that the pages were completely out of order. Here's what I have: recommendations, pg 10, pg 11, copyright page, dedications, pg 14, chapter heading Eights,  Book Introduction, pg 18... And it keeps on going. It must have been a misprint. I'm so bummed! Make sure you look at your book as soon as you receive it!"
"My husband and I followed up ""The Road Back to You"" with this one and found it incredibly helpful in our relationship with one another and others. We've done a lot of personality typing tests, and it just feels like this is more accurate than any of the others. Very practical information on how different Enneagram types interact with one another. Highly recommend it!"
I read and re-read this all the time... and have the audible version. This book has articulated things about myself i've never been able to put my finger on. it's been such an amazing tool within our marriage... within relationships at work... with friendships. I recommend this book (and it's sister book) and gift it out on a regular basis. BUY IT!!!
"These are such good books for learning how to properly learn about your own personality- the highs and lows- and then how to fight the worst parts of who you are, and how to raise up the best parts of who you are! Such a helpful book!"
"Not only does this book fully explain the inner workings of each place on the enneagram, it always thoroughly explains the relationships between them. I look forward to using the knowledge found on these pages to more fully understand others in my life. Excellent book, and an enjoyable read!"
This is a great book to read if you are interested in helping yourself understand and do better with relationship building.  Easy and enjoyable read.  Would reommend highly.
This book is a must for people who want to improve relationships. The practical advice applies to work and personal relationships. This book explains the why that most popular books on emotional intelligence do not address:  the filter of different personalities.
"I ordered this for my daughter and son-in-law. They have been married for 2 yrs. I am hoping it will help them navigate through their early years of marriage, as they get to know each other better. i recommended this book to my friend. Her daughter will be getting married in June. She gave it to them to read, and has already gotten good feedback!"
This author does an excellent job of explaining the ennegram. Easy to read and informative.  Helped me get to know myself better and develop understanding of others as well.
"Reading Suzanne's words feels like carrying a candle into oneself and finally seeing why one does what one does. And the further work happens when one looks into others with that same candle. I learned a great deal about relationships and how to better see myself and others.  Suzanne's writing is deep and powerful, yet she finds a way to inject humor in a way that makes this book an extremely compelling read."
"interesting personality ""explainer"" and helps you to have compassion for others and improve relationships - both personal and professional"
"My husband and I are both working through this book. We have honed our communication skills, learned about others' motives for their behaviors, and initiated conversations with friends about how they operate. Love love love!"
"This was a fantastic book. It dovetails very nicely with Road Back to You which I highly recommend reading first because it gives a better overview of the numbers. This book tells very insightful stories from the perspective of each number. This makes it much easier to see how other numbers think and operate. Finally, the lists at the ends of the chapters are very accurate and informative. Overall a good read."
"The Enneagram has been career saving and life changing for me personally and a complete game changer for my family, especially parenting our teenage children. The Path Between Us is the perfect next step to knowing your number. It helps you know how you relate to every other number which impacts every relationship and immediately creates more love and compassion for the people in your life! I highly recommend it! Rev. Debra Hobbs Mason, Richardson, Texas"
"This book serves as more of a reference than one you'd sit down and read all the way through, but has already been immensely helpful in helping me sort through issues in current relationships with other numbers."
"Enjoyed the book, Suzanne is one of my favourites.  Easy to read, non-threatening, gentle...good for beginners in understanding how other people look out and see the world as well as gentle insights into one's own way of seeing."
Not for Christians; threw it away. It’s kind of like personality test but in a divination kind of way
I read this with a group of my family.  We all enjoyed analyzing our different personalities and how to best work together and have good relationships.
Good book. * religious book. Nice bullet points for descriptions of each number. Doesn’t have quiz to find number so will need to go online and take test.
"Suzanne Stabile is my favorite Enneagram teacher. I have attended her classes and downloaded several online resources. This book is AMAZING. Honestly, the content is so rich, it is taking me awhile to read it. ""Awhile"" - but in the best possible way."
Great reference book. Very interesting and it’s a book I will continue to cone back to.
Excellent for learning to love and accept those that are different than us.
"This book must be a miss print the pages are all out of order starting with 10 followed by 11, 14, 18, 19, four, five, 22, 23, eight, nine. I bought it at the same time as the road back to you- and didn’t open it until months later- to my dismay- As a enneagram 1, this feels like a cruel joke."
This book series is my favorite on the topic of the enneagram. Very insightful.
Excellent book if you’re into enneagrams for relationships. Easy to read and the info is spot on.
"Such an insightful book. It explains the relational aspects in a way other enneagram books don’t. Stabile makes it relatable, applicable, and easy to understand."
If you liked “The Road Back To You” this book will delight you. It’s the rest of the story. Excellent and easy read.
A great resource for those who want to dive deeper in to understanding the relational connections between enneagram numbers. Definitely add it to your queue if you’re diving into the enneagram!
A good resource for understanding how to relate to people in your life.
This book is such an eye opener and the way the author explains each Enneagram Type is the best I’ve heard. The book keeps my attention with detail!
Definitely helps couples who understand their Eneagram number understand one another and their behaviors better
Really enjoyed this - I've heard Suzanne speak & both of her books are outstanding.
This goes deeper into the types of enneagram and builds on the book ‘The Road Back to You’.A fast and easy read that I will come back to in the years to come.
The book is too short and the information is superficial. I expected more from it.
Liked that the books arrived quickly. The book itself is enjoyable.
Better for groups than relationship
All good!
Love this book!
Bought as a gift
"I'm a big fan of Suzanne's teaching on the Enneagram. It's profound. It's practical. This book is no exception. It's a helpful, wise look at how our enneagram type impacts our relationships. Highly recommend."
Probably the best book on using the Enneagram for improving relationships.
enneagram 3’s are the worst amirite??
Great book on relationships and how we interact with one another. I wish it were longer!
I read this after reading The Road Back to You and was so happy to find it. Suzanne’s perspective is very positive and gives practical help for connecting with our loved ones more effectively.
Enneagram is nonsense.
Suzanne Stabile writes in a manner that is narrative. This style is such a meaningful way to learn the enneagram! I had the pleasure of attending one of her seminars and she is such a good presenter of this material.  She is so knowledgable and has so much wisdom.
"This book helps a continued journey to understand oneself, others and the enneagram better. If you’re wanting to do the work, this book is an easy read but it’s a must."
I have struggled to understand why the people I love act the way they do and so differently than I do. This book has been a game changer in my life. It has allowed me to be so much more aware of why I make the choices I do and loving my family for their choices
Least informative of the enneagram books. Wish I had skipped this one.
Excellent read if you want to understand more about the enneagram on a deeper level and improve your relationships. I have referenced this book multiple times as a therapist in my office.
Really helped my wife and I get to know each other better and understand how we work and communicate and how we can do so more effectively.
"I've read it 3x and gifted it 5x in six months since then. Great job, Suzanne!"
Love this book.  It's well written and easy to understand.  I love learning about the Enneagram.
This is a good summary of the enneagram with helpful insights into how to relate to other numbers more so than know yourself.
This book will give you great insights into your relationships and how your personality plays a part in your relationships and maintaining those relationships in a healthy manner. I would highly recommend this book!
Excellent follow up for the Road Back to You..
Wonderful book on the Enneagram and relationships!
Great topic!  The best way to understand relationships is to read this book and know your Enneagram number!  So simple yet profound!
Great insight that helps to see very complicated matters from an unbiased and objective standpoint.
This book has changed my life and my perspective with my relationship!
This is one of the most practical books for understanding spiritual formation connected the Enneagram. Suzanne does an excellent job explaining the stances - which is where the true transformative work really begins.
I am new to the enneagram and it’s already helped my approach to relationships in a short period of time. I knew I had to read this book and I’m so glad I did. I’m challenged and encouraged to dive deeper into enneagram knowledge about relationships. I’m sure I highlighted half of the book!
I really enjoyed the book but wanted it to be more in-depth. I was looking for info about wing numbers and more details about the relationships
Love this book!
This is a great book to read if you want to know more on the Enneagram!
I recommend this to anyone who wants to understand why they do the things they do and ways to grow away from ignorance and weakness into knowledge and strength in relationship to themselves and then to each other.
"This book has been transformational to me. It has spoken truth about my life, named things I need to and can change, and shown me how to better love and manage the relationships that matter to me."
Amazing insight! So excited to finish this book.
A quick simple read but not filled w/extensive relationship knowledge of how the types work together.
"Good complement for another road back to you, It's a nice combination."
"Love love love! This is such a helpful book, I’ve recommended it over and over! Will truly help your relationships and understanding of self"
Great book.
A great resource to dive deeper into the Enneagram and apply it to the relationships in your life. Suzanne is an amazing writer and teacher.
Excellent book- my husband and I found it very helpful and I use it with my work and friend relationships too! Highly recommend her work and podcasts too!
Just starting to read this.  Good book so far.  Everyone should know their enneagram.
A different personality analysis approach from the classic is Myers-Brigg. Helpful for all relationships.
"This is a fantastic read that will help you better understand yourself and how you respond and collaborate with your loved ones and perhaps, less loved ones."
Lots of help figuring out your type and then actually what to do with the information! Loved this!
Amazing book and author.
This is a great book and is like a part 2 to the book The Road Back to You. Highly recommended.
See headline
Great book! Love how it’s broken down to how different numbers relate to each other & can help one another.
A
Difficult concept to accept...
"I LOVED THIS BOOK, LEARNED A LOT ABOUT HOW MY CO-WORKERS HAVE DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES AND REACT TO THINGS DIFFERENTLY"
"So well written, gentle in its delivery with an optimistic view toward growth."
The best
"I ,m glad I came across this book.  It helps to understand people and their reactions"
Excellent book!
Awesome book the first one  the road back to you was good too
The Enneagram and Suzanne have changed my life.  I can’t recommend this book enough.
"“You can’t change how you see—you can only change what you do with how you see.”– Suzanne StabileRelationships bring great pleasure, but they also bring challenges. Especially when our differences seem greater than our similarities.In Suzanne Stabile's new book, she navigates the differences between Enneagram Types. One number at a time, she shows how that Type relates to each of the other eight Types. This is very useful and practical information.“First, please don’t use your Enneagram number as an excuse for your behavior. Second, don’t use what you’ve learned about the other numbers to make fun of, criticize, stereotype, or in any way disrespect them. Ever. Third, it would be great if you would spend your energy observing and working on yourself as opposed to observing and working on others.”While none of this is exact science, it does give positive starting points for how to grow our relationships.“All relationships—those that truly matter and even those that don’t—require translation. And if our interest in relational growth and transformation is sincere, then the Enneagram is one of the most helpful translation tools available.”While this book isn’t necessarily a Christian book, it is definitely a spiritual book, and one that you can apply to your Christian faith. Suzanne Stabile is cofounder (with her husband, Rev. Joseph Stabile) of Life in the Trinity Ministry, a nondenominational ministry for spiritual growth and formation.Here are some specific suggestions from Suzanne about each Type and how we might best relate to them.Ones, the Perfectionists – Things could always be better“In a relationship with a One, honesty is essential, but telling them that they are good in ways that they can hear it is the greater gift. Do it as often as you can in all the ways you can. Ones appreciate equity—they work hard and they expect the same from you.”Twos, the Helpers – Your feelings or mine?“In an intimate relationship, Twos need to hear you say ‘I’m here and I’m not going anywhere. There’s nothing you need to do, there’s nothing you need to be, and there’s nothing you need to help me with. I love you for you.’ Don’t trust their answer when they say they’re fine or good. Press a little deeper.”Threes, the Performers – Being everyone but myself“Since their orientation to time is to the future, Threes are often distracted during conversations. Don’t take the distraction personally. They won’t be interested in rehashing things from the past. Know that Threes want your approval and praise, and they really like it when you verbalize it.”Fours, the Romantics – Go away but don’t leave“Fours long for what they don’t have and they are comfortable with longing. It’s not something for you to fix. Don’t tell Fours to ‘cheer up.’ They are usually neither sad nor depressed. Fours are comfortable with melancholy.”Fives, the Observers – Fences have gates“Be forthright and direct with Fives, but don’t use too many words. If you have a problem with a Five, agree on a time to discuss it. Give the Five time to think about your concern and then limit the length of the conversation.”Sixes, the Loyalists – Question everything“Worst-case scenario planning is comforting to Sixes, so take them seriously when they talk to you about the possibility of what could go wrong. Telling them they don’t need to worry and that everything is going to be fine they will feel patronizing, disrespectful, and dismissive. Sixes like friends who are emotionally mature, honest, and not too needy.”Sevens, the Enthusiasts – It’s all good“Don’t try to get Sevens to commit to specific routines and schedules. They need spontaneity and flexibility. If you want to share your feelings with a Seven, by all means do that. But do not process your feelings with a Seven. You will need to do that with someone else.”Eights, the Challengers – Vulnerability is not weakness“Don’t beat around the bush with Eights: they want communication to be brief, straightforward, and truthful. Be aware that Eights are controlling in relationships simply because they don’t want to be controlled. Even though Eights are strong and assertive, don’t forget that they still need care.”Nines, the Peacemakers – Risking conflict for connection“Don’t interrupt Nines when they are talking. Make room for them to meander a bit—they will get to the point.  Nines don’t like confrontation, but that doesn’t mean you should never confront them. Encourage Nines to share their grievances with you.”My thanks to NetGalley for the review copy of this book."
"This is exactly the book I was hoping for after reading The Road Back to You! I gained so much insight about myself through the Enneagram and specifically The Road Back to You, but I found myself wanting to understand how who I am relates to who the important people in my life are. The Path Between Us is full of great stories, but also great insight into our relationships in light of the Enneagram. My favorite things about this book are that it is relatable and readable. So many ""personality"" books are too scientific and data-filled for my taste. The Path Between Us really speaks to me in a way that I want to go back to over and over again to help my relationships with others grow. I am so thankful to have it on my shelf!Thank you to NetGalley for the review copy of this book!"
"This book hardly builds on the insight in The Road Back to You. It doesn't add depth or unpack the complexities of each number any more than its predecessor. And it hardly goes into any detail on how specific numbers work together, so the title ends up being a misnomer. There's not much talk of the path between US.It is essentially just a (slight) expansion on the relational tendencies of each number with a few more real-life examples of how those numbers act in the world.I would recommend it as a good read if you've studied the Enneagram before and are simply looking for a refresher on how each number presents in the framework of relationships.However, as a person who recently finished The Road Back to You, I felt impatient as it rehashed and reworded many of the concepts found in its predecessor. And, unfortunately, was ultimately disappointed when, after sitting through the rehashing and rewording, only gleaned a handful of additional insights."
"If you know a little (or a lot) about the Enneagram and you want to know more, this is an excellent book.The book begins with a brief explanation of each of the numbers and how the system of the Enneagram works. If it’s been a while since you’ve learned the Enneagram, this chapter is an excellent primer to refresh your memory.Each number gets its own chapter, beginning with illustrations of an interaction between people, which is an effective way to reveal how our motives are so different.As I read the chapter about my number, I was grateful for the non-judgmental description of who I am. And I briefly considered making a million copies of that chapter and then just handing it out to people when I meet them for the first time. (Copyright rules and all that, I know). Being able to point people to this book, so they can succinctly read about what motivates me, and how I navigate the world is such a huge gift.Turns out this book isn’t just about me. ahem. She wrote chapters about the other numbers too, and as I read them, I gained insights on how people navigate the world differently than I do. Each chapter has a sidebar with illustrations of how that number interacts with each of the other numbers. They also have a section for you to get to know your own self better and one for people who love you to get to know your number better.She teaches with stories, humor, wisdom, and gentleness. The best part of you is the worst part of you. In the wrong hands, the ""worst"" part of you can seem judgmental and mean. In Suzanne's care, the worst part of you can be seen in a way that is forgiving, kind, and capable of transformation. I'm excited to put this book in the hands of my loved ones and friends."
"The Path Between Us is fast becoming one of my favorite enneagram books. After reading (and re-reading) the Road Back to You, i was so excited to get this next book by Suzanne. You will not be disappointed. Each chapter is devoted to one type, much like her last book. This book goes a bit more in depth to each number and helps identify certain behaviors each number experienced and why they act the way they do. Suzanne has said in her podcast, you can’t change other people, you can only change yourself. and this book is perfect in helping understand others in relationship and how to both help them and you become the best version of yourself. I loved the helpful tips given at the end of each chapter and felt like i gained much more information on each type and how I come across to them in my everyday interactions."
"I was introduced to the Enneagram about a year ago when I friend sent me the typing test from The Road Back to You by Ian Cron and Suzanne Stabile. I immediately reserved the book at my local library and couldn’t wait to read it. As soon as I picked it up, I began reading and could barely put it down. I don’t know how I went so long without learning about the Enneagram, but it has since revolutionized my life. Learning the Enneagram has done two main things in my life:1) Not only do I engage in a lot of self-reflection and introspection, but I also teach others how to engage their internal lives better. So I was shocked when the enneagram revealed a major blind spot in my life of which I was previously unaware. I’m not exaggerating when I say that as a One, acknowledging my anger and learning to embrace it has transformed my life. A year ago, I had felt my heart becoming hard. But in the last year, as I’ve stopped repressing my feelings and have leaned in to validate them instead, God has opened me up and grown my affections like I never knew was possible. My heart is more tender than it’s ever been.2) Learning that other people have lenses through which they see the world that differ greatly from mine has wonderfully grown my compassion for others. I hear things that people say in a different way. I hear the way they’re processing the world around them, and I’m better able to meet them there. Even when I don’t totally “get” what they’re saying, I can understand how they feel because the need for a Three to achieve, for example, is like the need I feel as a One to do good. My friends’ and family members’ wounds aren’t the same as mine, but we all feel the pain of our wounds pretty similarly. That helps me to understand empathetically and to connect.Of course, since The Road Back to You set me on such a life-changing journey a year ago, when I saw that Stabile was coming out with The Path Between Us: An Enneagram Journey to Healthy Relationships, I knew I had to get it. This became the fourth book on the Enneagram that I’ve read in the last year, and I’m thrilled to say I still learned new things.Stabile is a compassionate teacher and exceptionally knowledgeable. Yet she also communicates with humility, demonstrating that she’s still continuing to learn more. This sense of her own teachability makes the content of her writing easier to receive, so descriptions of Enneagram types do not become too rigid. Like The Road Back to You, this book has an introduction chapter followed by consecutive chapters on each Enneagram number. Stabile emphasizes that this is a secondary piece to The Road Back to You, which allows her to provide additional content to the first book without it feeling redundant of the first.For each type, Stabile includes a brief chart on how this type relates to every other type. Each type’s chart is unique, so that readers gain two insights on each two types’ relationship instead of only one. The biggest thing I gained from The Path Between Us was a positive view of how each type pulls what they need from the numbers they go to in security and stress. So as a One, pulling attributes from Four while in stress is actually a healthy thing–not something for me to be worried about.Thanks for another great book, Suzanne!"
"If you are a person in any kind of relationship with another person, this book is for you. Stabile uses her Enneagram wisdom to discuss how each different personality type sees the world with respect to relationships, as well as how each type relates to each other type. This is a follow up to the book she co-wrote with Ian Cron (The Road Back to You), but you can certainly read this one without having read the other. At the beginning, she gives a brief rundown of each personality type in case you are unfamiliar with the Enneagram. This book is insightful, fascinating, clear, and extremely helpful. I must warn you though, if you’re anything like me... it’s all fun and games until you read the chapter about your own number 😩 Really though, if my first introduction to the Enneagram was like a mirror that showed me the things I knew but didn’t want to face about myself, this one is like a mirror that you use with another mirror to confirm that the dirt someone saw on the back of your shirt is, indeed, back there, even though you were happily unaware. (That actually did happen to me today, but I digress...) This is helping me understand better those whom I love, and it is helping me understand my own motives better as well, which is useful as I try to articulate my needs and areas for growth in relationship with others. Please read it. Pretty please. The world will be better if you do."
"I own a hard copy AND I will be buying the audio book. Why? There's nothing better than learning Enneagram insights from Suzanne Stabile's written and spoken word. ""The Path Between Us"" is a skillful, conversational guide that builds upon the groundwork laid in ""The Road Back to You."" The author leads with brief reviews of Enneagram Number characteristics, triads, stances, and wings, stress, and security, followed by chapters on each Number. I heeded her suggestion and read the Numbers in the order written. It ""felt like home"" when I reached my Number.I love the layout of the pages, the lead-in stories for each Number, and the check-in boxes that follow the stories with ""What's Going on Here""? Clearly, personality is ""going on!""Suzanne easily relates the nine Numbers to the reader. I appreciate the side bars that succinctly summarize snippets of how each Number relates to the other 8 numbers. I really like how the author concludes each Number's chapter with bullet-pointed pages entitled ""relationships FOR 'the Number'"" and  another for ""relationships WITH 'the Number"". I'll be referring back to those pages a lot as I seek to understand myself and others.This book is a fast, enticing read but don't be fooled into thinking the material is simple. It is anything but simple to manage one's personality or to have compassion towards other personalities. It will be one of my ""go to"" reference books as I share Enneagram and relationship insights with others.Suzanne Stabile knows where she has come from, personally and professionally. Just look at the scholars she has studied  (p. 188).  She also has hopes for us - that readers/ listeners become - wiser, compassionate people who help one another."
The Enneagram is such a powerful tool for your life in general.  Suzanne takes it to the most important areas of our lives - relationships.  How we interact with family and colleagues can be greatly enhanced when we understand our motivations and how they compare to those around us.Suzanne is such an insightful writer as she breaks this down into language we all understand and from which we can learn.I've read it once but it won't be the last!  Excellent book!
"It's very difficult for me to get into anything Enneagram-related, as I can't be categorized by its systems, but a pastor friend of mine is very much into the Enneagram and uses it in his ministry quite a bit. So I entered a contest, thinking I'd give him this book, and when I won, I read it first.What I like about this book is that it's got a very holistic vibe to it. It talks not just about how persons are, but about how they can be and the resources that they can draw on when they need to change their behavior, either by stress or by will. It lines up pretty well with what I see of human beings in ministry, as well, although I would hesitate to use such a classification system with them. I think the key lies in their stories of how they became the way that they are and what it means to them, with the valuable feedback of close others to provide a balance to it all.I'm glad I stole a read of this book, even though I'm still not sold on the Enneagram in general. It's worth the read for any human being who is in relationship with any other human being, especially complicated ones (hint: that's all of them)."
"The Path Between us is my third book on the enneagram this year. I have been skeptical about the enneagram, but the more I read the more I can see the value of the enneagram as a framework for understanding both yourself and others.In the end personality tests and psychological models are not really for navel gazing, but for assisting us to become a better people and to related to others better. The Path Between Us has roughly the same summary of the enneagram as The Sacred Enneagram and Mirror for the Soul, but the focus of the three is quite different and I think while not the most introductory, The Path Between us has the right focus of helping the reader related to others well.Each of the chapters has the same basic format, a description of each of the numbers of the enneagram and several illustrations and quotes about that number. Then a description of how that number relates to other people of different numbers and the same number. There are notes about what numbers work together well and how to overcome common problems between numbers.The real advantage of the enneagram as a model is that it is focused on health and inherent weakness and strengths. Being a particular number is not determinative of future behavior or an excuse for why someone does not need to change. Built into the conceptual model is the concept of change and growth, while acknowledging that we have been created in a particular way. As the enneagram has gained in popularity there has been push back. Some of the push back is valid as much because of misuse or misunderstanding as much as a weakness of the system.Like a lot of mental models, the benefit is the structure of the system and that it gives a language to describe the world around us. That model is not reality, but a system to help us understand the reality. If the enneagram does not work for you as a mental model, do not use it. I can see how it can be helpful personally. And I think that like all other personality profiles and relationship models, there are weaknesses.Of the three books I have read so far, I think this was the most personally beneficial, but like I said on the review of the last one, I am not sure whether this is more because it is more helpful or because I understand the system more. However, the framing of this book as helping the reader to understand how to relate to others well moves the enneagram from personal growth to corporate growth and I think that is helpful."
"Bought this book for the relationship aspect, but I was disappointed to see that it contained very little actual information about relationships. There were maybe 2-3 pages on each chapter with simply bullet points in the relationships part. It's not a bad book, but still not what I expected. It is more like another Enneagram book. If you want more information on relationships Helen Palmer's book on Enneagram relationships is much more informative, and it includes detailed overviews of each type in relationships with each other."
"The Path Between Us is an amazingly helpful guide for navigating the complexity of close relationships. In the introduction Suzanne Stabile reviews the foundational material for understanding the various way of  using the enneagram for personal growth. This review of the enneagram's basic principles is so helpful that it alone is worth the price of the book. Readers who are new to the enneagram would benefit from reading other introductory books or taking a workshop to learn their number since the introduction is a review rather than a foundation for identifying where one is located on the enneagram. Stabile offers important guidance when she warns against trying to guess or diagnose other people's numbers. Since this book offers a great way to understand relationships, it is important to know your own number and not guess on the numbers of those close in relationships. The obvious best answer is to encourage others to enter the journey of the enneagram and then learn to relate at an optimal level with each other. With an awareness of how different we are from those close to us, this book offers valuable counsel on how to navigate the often frustrating experience of forming close and trusting relationships with our loved ones and associates."
"I want to appreciate what this book offers for people who are new to the Enneagram, but I am struggling with the way it oversimplifies. Many times while I was reading I found that Stabile overgeneralizes about the behaviors of the types (behaviors which vary more than she suggests) rather than delve into the underlying motivations and complex fears on which the types fixate. Books like Riso and Hudson's The Wisdom of the Enneagram and Chris Heurtz's The Sacred Enneagram better express the depth and richness of what the Enneagram offers as a tool for spiritual growth."
"Enneagram seems to be all around these days, and there's an ocean of shallow teaching. But Suzanne, her writing and her teaching, is the real deal -- measured, thoughtful, time-tested, and wise. I enjoyed her first book (The Road Back to You), but I found infinitely more depth in this one. I love that the focus is on relationships, but not necessarily in a ""here are the things you do to care for X number"" way. It waded into greater understandings of how each number moves through their relationships -- in average time, in stress, in security, and in relation to other numbers and stances. You find yourself in her stories and more importantly, gain a greater respect for the complexity and sacredness of our brothers and sisters. I find myself highlighting something on each page, and am confident this will be a go-to resource for me in the years to come. (If you're looking for some easy Enneagram answers, this is not the book for you!)"
"Studying the Enneagram is a must if you are interested in knowing yourself and personal growth.  What Stabile shares is an explanation and a snapshot of each of the nine types as well as an overview of the Enneagram.  In this book, you will find examples of real lives to help understand the types. You will also learn how you can grow and change as you understand your own type as well as the types of others you are in relationships with. I highly recommend reading The Path Between Us!*I was given a copy of the book in exchange for my honest feedback."
"If you've had an introduction to the Enneagram and are wondering where to go next, buy this book! I read a quote from Anne Lamott that goes something like, ""Grace meets us where we are but does not leave us where it found us."" I think Suzanne Stabile does that with the Enneagram- she meets you where you are, but you can't help but grow spiritually and emotionally after encountering her teaching. Her tone is warm, approachable, and compassionate, but the content has the potential to kick your butt (in a good way!).  I'm already pondering how to put into action what I learned from this book, which is a considerable amount. And if you find that you run into the same issues over and over again in your relationships, I bet this book will shed helpful light on that. Give it a read and learn from one of the very best Enneagram masters out there."
"""The Path Between Us"" is a helpful resource among the numerous recent books about the Enneagram. Suzanne Stabile offers a guide to understanding how each particular Enneagram type/number operates within relationships. Her style is engaging and accessible and she also offers a basic summary of each type while exploring the relational aspects of Enneagram. Her book ""The Road Back to You"" (co-written with Ian Cron) is helpful for a more in-depth summary of each type, while this book is particular helpful in exploring relational aspects of the types. I would consider this book most helpful for those who have already done at least some reading and learning about the Enneagram, though those not familiar will still find helpful information and perspective."
"Of all the authors I’ve read on the subject, Suzanne is by far the most clear and helpful Enneagram teacher out there. Her ability to take endless Enneagram knowledge and bring it to you in bite-sized, yet powerful, wisdom is phenomenal. In The Path Between Us, she has raised the bar, again. You won’t get out of the introduction without coming across wisdom that can literally change your life. If you are serious about personal growth and greater compassion for yourself and others, read this book cover to cover. Suzanne approaches relationships in such a way that is concise but profoundly helpful for how we interact and appreciate one another, both in our similarities and differences. Please make sure this book is on your list for must-read in 2018. You don’t want to miss out on a journey like this."
"We all see the same things in life but what we do with what we see can be very different for each of us. In The Path Between Us we are given priceless information and advice to govern our interactions with others, many of whom will approach life from a much different perspective than you or I. If we are ever to have crucial conversations with each other and if we are ever to truly love and have compassion for our neighbor then The Path Between Us is a must read. Mrs. Stabile invites us to convert divergent paths into convergent paths. Her sentence sums it up best. ‘’ When we are able to see ourselves as we are, and as we can be, it is a beautiful thing ‘’."
"The Path Between Us has changed my marriage! In learning about my Enneagram number and my husband's, I was able to effectively communicate with him. I was able to realize why we both act the way we do and how we can create our own path to happiness.Stabile writes in a way that is easily understandable, yet she packs SO much good information in this book. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to revolutionize their relationships!"
"This was an easy read for anyone new to the Enneagram. Most of us pick up personality type books to help us understand just our own type--this book focuses on how each of the 9 types interact with one another--a crucial component to understanding how we work, play, and love one another. I think this book is unique for this subject, since most Enneagram books I've read are more individualized focus and not inter-relational. We need both for a healthy relationships, which Stabile highlights here. Highly recommend!"
"I have followed Suzanne's work since I met her at a Young Clergy retreat several years ago. This newest addition to the Enneagram conversation adds a layer that is exactly what is needed. I have just concluded teacher a class on her other book, The Road Back to You, and throughout the class questions about relationships between the numbers continued to pop up. I was glad that by the end of the class I could offer them this next book to add to their learning about the Enneagram. This text takes the basic knowledge about the Enneagram and applies it to everyday relationships. Knowing Suzanne's work, this is a key element of her motivation in ministry, building healthy relationships with compassion and care. This book exudes that motivation into text form on behalf of those who wish to learn more."
"This book is excellent in explaining the basics of how different personalities interact with each other. It gives insight into the positive and the more challenging aspects of our relationship pairings. This is true of our romantic relationships as well as our parent, work and friend relationships.I think it explains the basic concepts of the enneagram in a easy way to understand even if you are not very familiar with the enneagram. It will make you hungry for more study of the enneagram. I have studied the enneagram for years and it just gets deeper and deeper in depth of understanding of who we are in our core. This book is a helpful tool on that journey."
"This is such an amazing book and has saved my family vacations.  I have the audiobook and re-listen to it every time I drive to meet my extended family at the beach.  Getting the reminders of how not only I react on autopilot but how they do as well has opened my eyes to the ways I can avoid the predictable clashes we've had for the last 40 years.  Thanks, Suzanne, for saving my family relationships (and beach trips)!"
"I received a free e-copy of this book from Netgalley. All opinions my own.I loved The Road Back To You. It was an excellent primer on the Enneagram and helped me identify my type (finally). While that book does address a bit of how your type interacts with others, I was definitely wishing I had more info on how my being a One would manifest in my marriage, friendships and parenting. This is it!Suzanne is knowledgeable and gentle in her approach and I am so grateful for the things I learned in The Path Between Us. Learning about the Enneagram is definitely a journey and this is a wise and useful tool to use along the way."
"I love this book for so many reasons. First, I loved the refresher information at the beginning of the book.  It does an excellent job of helping those who are newer to the enneagram feel prepared for the more in-depth information that follows. Sometimes studying the enneagram can feel overwhelming but this writer has managed to communicate her expertise in a way that is warm and inviting.  It is clear and concise - taking complex ideas and distilling them into meaningful and manageable chunks of information.  Finally - I love the format.  I find myself returning often to peak at various summaries to prepare for a crucial conversation with someone whose number I know.  This book helps me stay mindful of my limited way of seeing while providing me an opportunity to awaken to the various beautiful ways others see."
"Confession - I started this book in the middle.  After reading the intro, I went straight to the chapter on 3's.  And just like the first time I heard Suzanne Stabile teach and I wept deeply when she taught on 3's....as I read ""my"" chapter I cried.  It's as if she was writing to me.  About me.  As I read aloud the page about being in relationship with 3's to my husband, he just shook his head and said, ""That just makes so much sense.""  This teaching continues to be transformative for me personally and my relationships with my husband and my children.  As I'm working on being my best self, working on allowing those closest to be to BE their best self and knowing how to best be in relationship with one another is powerfully impacting our family.  Thank you, Suzanne!"
"Suzanne Stabile is my favorite enneagram teacher. First, Read the Road Back To You and then, read this to see how you are in relationships and to improve yourself. You can’t change anyone but yourself so use the enneagram as a tool for self discovery, self awareness and change. Don’t think the enneagram will help you change those around you. You change you and then the people will follow.  I truly love and cherish this book and reuse it as a resource weekly."
"**I received this book from the publisher through Netgalley. All opinions are my own.***The Path Between Us is a great resource for understanding your family, coworkers, friends—really anyone who thinks differently than you! Each chapter focuses on one of the Enneagram types and ends with how the other types view them. It has been really helpful and fun as I’ve talked with my coworkers about the way they think.(The beginning of the book has a brief description of each enneagram type, but it would be best to take the test before you read this book instead of guessing what yours might be.)"
"This is a must-have for anyone with a foundational knowledge of the Enneagram, looking to grow in relationships of all kinds. The book is written and laid out in a way that’s very easy to read and digest, while filled with deep insights. I gleaned many practical takeaways that I can apply to my relationships with family, friends, and co-workers.  Using her gift of storytelling, Stabile shares her Enneagram wisdom and intimate understanding of the complexity of relationships in a way that all can learn from."
"This book is an amazing follow up to ""The Road Back to You"".  The reason we learn about personality assessments and strength inventories is so that we can grow as people and in our relationships.  Suzanne Stabile artfully describes the strengths and weaknesses of each of the nine types and how they maneuver relationships.This book should be read after you have a general understanding of the Enneagram and the nine types.Every type has the opportunity for growth.  Stabile gives explanations of how each type relates to one another and can grow.Thanks, NetGalley, for the read."
"This book, CHANGED MY LIFE. It made real life example of the enneagram, in action. With a non-static approach to the web of relationships, this book provided amazing insights to how to navigate some of the most difficult combinations within the enneagram. I can not explain how grateful I am for this exploration of courage and faith Mrs. Stabile took to provide a framework of relational navigation, with the enneagram as a compass. Incredible. Downright life changing. Thank You Suzanne Stabile"
"Calling all Enneagram fans (and even those that aren’t - yet!) - Suzanne Stabile is a master of translating the Enneagram for us common folk to help us all understand ourselves and how we relate to our world. And now, in her new book  - released today - she helps us use what we've learned about ourselves, through Enneagram,  to better understand and to relate to the people in our world, as well as how they can better understand and relate to us. If you know nothing about Enneagram, don't worry! Suzanne begins this book with a quick overview of the 9 numbers of Enneagram to help you identify where you fall on the circle. Get this book! Read it! You’ll all be better for it! #thepathbetweenus"
"The Path Between Us is our differences.  That is our work to navigate. I love learning from Suzanne because she is thoughtful, nuanced and so kind. It seems as though she loves all the numbers and truly teaches that all relationships can work out if each person is getting healthier in their own number. That is the ultimate key. I find so many people still want to use the Enneagram as a personality indicator where as Suzanne truly teaches it as a transformation tool. As well as a compassion tool! Enneagram work is one thing that can help our world do better right now and Suzanne is a top notch teacher to lead us in this work."
"I listened to the audio version of this book and I could barely get through it because of the reader (author’s voice). I did not find her Texan drawl charming, but annoying.Secondly, it struck me as odd that the author fashioned the cover of this book in a way to look like aCompanion book to the Road Back to You, but Ian is not a co-author. Super curious how he felt about that.Overall, I was hoping to learn at a deeper level about the enneagram numbers and their interaction but this book didn’t deliver. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone."
"A lot of people don't know where to turn once they've learned their enneagram number. I know that I was looking for a next step for learning and growth. I think The Path Between Us is that natural next step. It it full of practical, relatable stories and insights and it highlights ways we can live in relationship with one another in a more generous and empathetic way. Who doesn't need that? This is a great book for anyone who is in relationship with other humans!"
"I was able to purchase this book at a conference in March the author spoke at as part of an early book launch by the publisher. As a person fairly new to the enneagram, I found this book incredibly helpful and accessible read on how the enneagram helps us in interpersonal relationships.  I love the author's style writing  with story telling as a way to learn versus just heady information and she also gives practical tips of how to support one another at the end of each chapter.  This is a book I will continue to refer back to as I keep studying this effective tool on how to understand myself and others."
"I encountered the enneagram first as a skeptic. But as Suzanne Stabile says, “it’s just true.”This book is an excellent first encounter for the enneagram if you can’t get into Suzanne’s workshop sessions in person.The enneagram has been vital to my spiritual life, structure for my marriage, and a pathway forward for me as I seek to be the best self God has created for me. This book has the potential to change your life!"
"(I received an ARC for review purposes.)Stabile is a master of the Enneagram and any chance to partake in her wisdom is a learning experience! I was a huge fan of Stabile's previous book, The Road Back to You, and The Path Between Us built upon that foundation. One of the biggest questions I've had since studying the Enneagram is how to maneuver relationships with people of various types--especially those that feel threatening to me! After reading this book, I feel like I have a deeper understanding.  I appreciated the conversational tone of the book and the stores included were really great examples!"
"I’ve yet to read a more clear, concise, and humorous book on the enneagram and relationships. Suzanne Stabile is my most favorite enneagram voice. You need this book. Your family needs this book. Your staff needs this book. And we’ll all be better for it. Order it!!!"
"I have been learning the Enneagram, and ""The Path Between Us"" is a masterful piece to human behavior. Every person in business, education, or relationships will  benefit from learning the Enneagram and reading Suzanne Stabile's new book. She is speaking at different locations...check her out for yourself. She is the real deal! She is helping us connect in a way that has not been done in my lifetime, an it is changing the world."
"Ever wondered why you find some people so hard to get along with? This book provides answers! Even if you’ve never been introduced to the enneagram, you will see yourself and your significant others portrayed with startling clarity. Suzanne treats every enneagram type with gentle honesty and helps the reader see that understanding our own and others’ motivations is the key to improving relationships."
I had been on my Enneagram journey for 10 years when I read The Path Between Us. It was so helpful in how it pointed out the gifts of each number within a relationship. That’s been so key for me to focus on in my relationships and work to use those gifts to strengthen my connections with others. Many new topics were addressed from past Enneagram resources I’ve gone through and I greatly appreciate the work that was put into this. I highly recommend this book along with any workshop Suzanne puts on!
I highly recommend this book. I think it's the best book on the Enneagram I've read so far (I've read 3 other books on it). I loved the emphasis on how to be in relationship with other types.
"For anyone serious about diving deeper into enneagram study, this book is a must! Its content offers new insight into the wisdom the enneagram has to offer us, and its accessibility even to new students of the enneagram makes its application practical for any reader. Suzanne's narrative style is captivating and the tools she includes strengthen the value of the content within. This book is a great next step for learning how the enneagram can increase self-knowledge and then how to use this awareness as you live in relationship with those around you."
"I love that this book gives you so many places to jumpstart conversations. Reading this book on my own was helpful, but going through it with a group and discussing the stories in it together was even more beneficial. If you're wanting to discuss Enneagram and Relationships in a group setting, I highly recommend going through this book. Also, the study guide has really good and thoughtful content to use alongside this book."
"I'm new to the enneagram, but I see it talked about a lot on social media. This book is an excellent introduction with a ton of examples for each personality type. It doesn't have a personality test, but you can easily find several online. You'll start to see yourself, and those around you, with new eyes of understanding after seeing our personality styles broken down by numbers 1-9."
"Wonderful book — Suzanne Stabile, author and Enneagram teacher extraordinaire, has created an insightful reference for understanding yourself and others. She has a gift for articulating the Enneagram types with stories and humor while remaining open and honest. This has helped give me a much clearer understanding of the type characteristics, along with the motivation of each of the types. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. (I purchased the audible version, hardcover, and study guide.)"
Suzanne uses her ability to communicate wisdom in story telling. This book is essential to learning how to connect with others and value each person's unique perspective of the world. She provides a common language to help bridge the misunderstanding that arise from our daily interactions. Truly a must have book!
"The Enneagram, esp. as expressed here by Suzanne, clarifies why I do the things I do.  This book goes farther -  showing how we relate to others, when the way we see the world differs so radically from one to another.  Love the summary sections within and at end of each chapter - very easy to absorb."
"I purchased this book on audio and I could never sing the praises of Suzanne Stabile enough. The Enneagram has been transformational for me, but specifically because of the honest way that she teaches it. I will purchase many more of her audio books/cds simply because the content with the allure of her voice are so compelling. I could listen to her teaching for days and never lose interest. Buy this book on audio if you haven't yet!"
As always Suzanne’s deep compassion and thoughtfulness shines through in this book and reveals so much about the spaces between people and how to connect more meaniningfully. Reading the book feels like being in the room with her — sharing and talking over a cup of coffee. So appreciate her.
"What a wonderful book this is!  I have read and loved Suzanne's previous book, The Road Back to You, and am delighted with the scope and organization of this new book.  I have had the opportunity to facilitate Enneagram learning using The Enneagram Journey and it never fails that people want answers to questions like, ""What is it like if a One is in a relationship with an Eight?"" or any number of combinations that are important to each of us.  After an introduction of Enneagram basics, Suzanne goes on to share her great stories and wisdom for Enneagram Numbers in relationship.  Guided by this book, with insights gained from Enneagram work, we can learn to appreciate our differences and cherish the wonder of each of our Numbers."
I love this book! It is so helpful in understanding others and myself. I feel like my type description was so accurate! A fun read!
"I love that the enneagram isn’t an excuse for “this is the way I am, deal with it.” Instead it is a path for growth as we recognize our tendencies, whether weaknesses or strengths, and seek to grow in maturity. This book provides great tools for doing just that while in relationship with others."
"If you are hungry to dig deep into the various relationships in your life, this is the book for you! Not only does it offer rich wisdom about yourself and the way in which you see and function in the world but it also gives priceless insights into how you can grow in your interactions with others. Suzanne's warmth and humor keeps you engaged and smiling."
I know a lot about the Enneagram and have spent years studying it.  I had a number of insights that I highly value.  Thanks for this great exploration!
"Bought this book, along with The Road Back to You, for a coworker and friend. Suzanne & Ian’s work on the Enneagram has made the subject so approachable, and from this starting point, I hope my friend will find this self examination and growth tool as meaningful as I have myself."
"The Path Between Us represents the best of Enneagram wisdom presented in an exceedingly readable way. I'm disheartened by the diluted nature of much current Enneagram literature and teaching. As the wisdom of the Enneagram becomes more well-known, such dilution is natural. We need teachers like Suzanne Stabile who have drunk deeply from the ancient Enneagram well of wisdom. Despite her decades of work with the Enneagram, she presents her material without being esoteric or inaccessible; indeed, she writes with all warmth and accessibility. You could fly through these pages in one sitting, but don't. Learn from a wise teacher."
"After renting the book from the library, I knew I’d need a copy of my own. I often find myself going back to the book when seeking wisdom on relationships. Suzanne’s knowledge has led me to growth in my marriage and other close relationships."
"Reading a book by Suzanne Stabile is like sitting next to your friend on the couch as she tells stories. The Path Between Us is equal parts funny, compassionate, and convicting. This book holds so much wisdom that can bring healing to relationships and truly help us find the path between each of us."
Great book. Great insights and helpful tips for the interplay of each number.
"Susan Stabile is an amazing teacher. She is funny, compassionate, full of wisdom and knowledge. Her book is a tool that will help all generations now and to come. A must read!"
SO instructive to anyone desiring to learn more about themselves and others.
Enneagram and relationships primer! It’s a must read!
Excellent book by excellent teacher. I have learned more from Suzanne’s teachings than from any other Enneagram instructor.
This bookIs insightful and user-friendly!
Very helpful book!  It was well written!
"This book has been so insightful thus far, and has been good to go through with my girlfriend. We both are liking it, and it has offered us both tools for relating and working through differences. Especially talking through things that may be affecting us that were done in younger years to us.If you’re ready for the challenge of growth, get this book.It’s also a good idea to get the companion book too. “The Road Back To You.”"
"I loved reading this book! It is a great companion to the first book, ""The Road Back to You,"" and broadens the reader's understanding of the Enneagram. Very easy to read while being very informative. I would recommend this book to anyone."
I really loved reading this book and could not put it down. It was a very interesting read and I definitely recommend it.
Primo book on the Enneagram!  Great clear descriptions of each Enneagram number.
Highly recommended!
Gift for family member
"I believe relationship is the foundation of everything, so I am unbelievably thankful for this well-thought out, well-versed book about Enneagram wisdom, specifically in the context of relationships!  There are so many unexpected nuggets of wisdom (i.e. quotes I now have written on post-it notes stuck on mirrors at home, and in my office at work!).  I especially appreciate the layout of the book - starting with an explanation of the ""world"" of each number, succinct, direct information about how each number relates with each of the other numbers, and my favorite - at the end of each chapter, there is great, extremely useful wisdom about what I (and each number) need to keep in the front of our minds when in relationship, as well as what is helpful for those in relationship with us to remember.  This insight can tremendously help to cultivate, and maintain, healthier and happier relationships.  As a newlywed, this wisdom is invaluable!"
"This book is a must read! Suzanne weaves together relationships and Enneagram wisdom in such a beautiful and impactful way.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in relationships, The Enneagram or both."
Just what I was looking for
"Not a big fan of this book. I bought it based on good reviews, but when I read the examples of different types of people it didn’t really match my expectations. The description is very weak and every single person can fit into all those types. I was hoping for it to be little bit more psychological and learning.Also, it’s apparently necessary to buy other book to start with. Well, spending £20 for a book where you need to get through another one first seems a bit pointless to me."
So helpful in understanding people
"I love studying the enneagram and was told about Stabile's work as a result of an enneagram weekend in Tennesee.  I ordered both this book and The Road Back to You and found that they were incredibly approachable explanations of the enneagram.  I am not a beginner but found them helpful tools in my ongoing journey with the enneagram and furthermore I think they are the starting point for any person interesting in learning about the enneagram.  Most of the materials I have accumulated over the years are much more intense and detailed and I wish that at the beginning of my enneagram path I had known of Stabile's books because I think they would have been much more helpful to me at the time when I knew nothing.  From now on whenever I introduce the enneagram to someone, I am going to point them first towards Stabile's books."
"Ich hatte das Buch als Ergänzung zum Ennegramm von Richard Rohr und Andreas Ebert gekauft. Es gibt einige interessante Ansätze in diesem Buch. Aber es hat nicht den Tiefgang, den ich erwartet hatte."
"Me encantó el libro y además me gusta mucho la versión de pasta dura, cuando lo compré estaba a un precio muy bajo, así que fue una buena compra"
Learning to understand myself. This is helpful.
"Some wonderful insights in here about the Enneagram, and how to get along and best support people with different personalities to our own."
Loved it. Would suggest reading 'The Road Back to You' first though.
I loved this book!
"Henri Nouwen’s “The Return of the Prodigal Son” is an in depth examination of the parable of the prodigal son, as featured in the Gospel of St. Luke in the New Testament of the Bible.Father Nouwen, a Dutch catholic priest who passed away in 1996, offers insightful commentary not only on the parable but the famous depiction of it by master Dutch painter Rembrandt.Nouwen discusses his thoughts and ideas about the painting, from his first impressions of a print of it, to his trip to Russia to see the real painting with his own eyes.  He comments on the painting and the parable that inspired it and the end result is an intellectual exploration filled with great insights.  Father Nouwen extrapolates a lot of meaning from the parable.  He also points out some nuanced interpretations that Rembrandt himself seemed to have about the parable judging from the way the painter chose to bring the parable to life pictorially.The Gospel parable is famous.  A father has two sons.  The young son one day asks the father to give him the part of the father’s inheritance that was his right. The father gives it to him and the son leaves his father’s home with it to a distant land.  There, the son lives a life of debauchery.  He squanders the money in pursuits of the flesh and goes completely broke.  As he spends the last bit of the inheritance, a great famine strikes the land.  The son is forced to hire himself out as a laborer tending to swine in order to sustain himself.  At one point, his poverty and hunger reach such a state that he wishes he could eat the scraps the pigs were being fed.  It was at this low point that he realizes his mistake: he had “sinned against heaven and against his father” and that he should go back to his father’s house where even the servants had enough to eat. With a sorrowful heart, he does so.  Upon seeing his son appear in the distance, the father becomes overcome with joy and emotion and runs to his son to welcome him back.The son asks for forgiveness and the father embraces him and orders his servants to prepare for festivities and to slaughter the cow they had been fattening for a special occasion.  As the music and merry-making in celebration of the return of the younger son are under way, the elder son, who had been out working, also comes back and notices the sights and sounds of the party from afar.  The elder son had always been dutiful and obedient to the father; he had never rebelled against the father’s authority like the younger son.  He asks what the celebration was all about and one of the servants tells him his younger brother had come back and that the father was throwing a party for him.  The elder son is immediately resentful.  He goes up to the father and confronts him.  He tells the father that he had always been a dutiful and obedient son yet never was he given a party like that by the father, while the younger son had lived a sinful and terrible life and now the father welcomed him back as if nothing happened.  The father says to the elder son that “all he had was his to have” and that he wanted the elder son to join the festivities because the younger son “was lost but was now found.”  The father urges the older son to join the party because the younger son was as if dead, and now, back at the house, had come back to life. That’s the end of the parable.Much has been written about this beautiful and meaning-filled parable told by Jesus Christ to the Apostles, the Pharisees and others.  Father Nouwen is one more voice in a rich tradition of commentary on this scriptural passage.  In Father Nouwen’s case, he comments on the parable and its pictorial depiction by Rembrandt, extrapolating layers and layers of suggested meaning from the two related works.Nouwen splits the structure of his book into three main sections: first he comments on the story from the perspective of the younger son, then from the perspective of the older son, and then from the perspective of the father.The first section, dedicated to the younger son, is the one most readers and initially Nouwen himself, tend to identify with.  The younger son is the sinner who comes back to life by asking and getting the father’s forgiveness.  He is the sinner in need of redemption, who, after experiencing despair in the world of the senses and the flesh, decides to return to the father’s house. Nouwen points out elements of the painting by Rembrandt, such as the son’s half-shaved head and his torn shoes, to highlight the condition of poverty and despair of the young son.  He also comments on the interesting choice of the younger son’s shaved head and the nature of the father’s embrace around it; an image that to Nouwen resembles the affectionate parental embrace of a defenseless baby.The second section of the book is dedicated to the elder son, who stands for the little Pharisee inside of each one of us.  The elder son is a symbol for all dutiful people who feel resentment when “passed over” by one they judge less worthy or less deserving.  The hard-hearted order-follower who would rather see a sinner punished than forgiven. Nouwen makes many interesting points about the elder son, of which I will highlight two.The first one, which came to him after much rumination on the story, Nouwen finally saw that he probably most closely identified himself with this character than with the younger son.  He does an analysis of his own life and points out his own dutiful, order-following nature from the time he was a young boy, eager to obey his parents and his church.  He shares with the reader that he himself felt resentful and wallowed in a type of disgust and self-pity, forever seeking and yet feeling he wasn’t receiving the love of the father that he felt he so deserved.The second point was the fact that Nouwen says that the end of the story for the elder brother is left open: he may choose to accept the father’s invitation to come back into the house to welcome the brother back (an acceptance of the father’s love) or he may choose to rebel and wallow in bitterness and his feeling of unfair treatment, and thus reject the offer of the father’s love.  It’s an interesting insight on the elder brother’s ultimate choice.  The father wants the elder son to accept his younger brother also, and he wants his eldest to come to the party also, but he doesn’t force his will on the elder son.  He respects the eldest son’s freedom to choose, even if to choose wrongly.  The father is ultimately respectful of the free will of both of his children, although he certainly has a wish for both of them (to stay together in love and forgiveness and to share his riches).Finally, the third section of the book tackles the role of the father, who stands in for God himself, the ever-forgiving and good father who loves all of his children, no matter whether they are sinful or dutiful.  An especially intriguing point Nouwen brings attention to is Rembrandt’s decision to paint the father’s hands, which rest on the son’s shoulders, in different ways.  One hand seems more muscular and rigid, a stronger male hand that “holds” the son, while the other, more fine-featured and delicate, a softer female hand that “caresses” the son.  Hands that both “support” and give “consolation.”  In this depiction, according to Nouwen, the father embodies both the masculine and feminine qualities that he bestowed upon his creation.  All of these qualities are being extended to the younger prodigal son as he is embraced by the father.Nouwen wonders if Rembrandt, who had lived a long and eventful life full of success and heartbreak, ups and downs, had arrived at something like a wise old age and painted himself as the old, half blind father who embraces lovingly the returning son.  From this, Nouwen extrapolates that he himself as well as all of us, no matter whether we most readily identify with the prodigal son or the elder son, should really be striving to become the forgiving, all loving father.  As St. John the evangelist said in his Gospel, “God is love”, and the old man in this rich parable embodies the essence of God beautifully.  He loves all his children, the good, the bad and the ugly.  The doors of his house will always be open to them.  Yet, he allows them the choice of leaving it (as the prodigal son did in the beginning of the parable) or not entering into it if they don’t want to (as he left the elder son decide for himself after the reception party for the younger son was underway). The Father, or God, doesn’t force his children’s hands, but he is overjoyed when they choose to come back into his house.  His joy is such, that he creates a great celebration (“killing the cow that had been fattened”) to welcome the returning son.From sinful son or resentful son, the movement that Nouwen suggests we make is a movement of the spirit: one in which we go from being one of the two needy sons to the loving father, the one who forgives, who accepts his children, whose love is the most salient feature in his actions.  Jesus said, “be compassionate because the father is compassionate.”  And so Nouwen states that we ultimately must depart from childhood and move towards fatherhood; that we must grow from our positions as the sorrowful or dutiful sons and grow into the compassionate fatherhood position, being more like God in this way.  He thinks that this is part of the spiritual maturation process that the parable teaches.Further, in the last chapter of the book, Nouwen states that the way to grow from the childish positions of the sorrowful or resentful childhood to compassionate fatherhood is through the disciplines of grief, forgiveness and generosity.Grief is important in the becoming of the father because one must shed tears in one’s realizations of the immensity of sin in the world: the conflicts, wars, molestation, slavery, cruelty, exploitation, abuse and other barbarities that humans perpetrate against each other.  Looking at the world from God’s perspective, one realizes the mess the human family is in.  This grief, as defined by Nouwen, is a form of prayer.  It’s the mournful realization we need to have that the sins of the world are the “sorrowful price of freedom without which love cannot bloom.”  This grief is a state of mourning at our freedom-having sin-prone condition.  Practicing this grief is a preparation of our hearts for the next discipline, which is forgiveness.  And this forgiveness we must extend to everyone we meet by our grief-filled hearts.As Nouwen continues to explain, forgiveness is the second discipline required to attain spiritual fatherhood.  It’s difficult to do, but absolutely essential for the spiritual growth the parable teaches.  And it must be continuously given to people.  Nouwen describes that true forgiveness is as a “stepping over” or “climbing over” all of the clutter that we carry around that prevents us from forgiving others such as feelings of resentment, injustice and superiority; impressions that we have been wronged; anger; “need” for apology; “need” of praise; “need” for the other to be grateful, etc.  This forgiveness is the forgiveness of someone “empty of self-seeking”.  Forgiveness thus seems to be an act of jumping over the emotional sludge puddle that we create in our souls and giving the opportunity of a new beginning to others as a gift.  A gift that is freely given and doesn’t expect anything in return, just like the gifts of our compassionate God.Finally, the third discipline required to shed our tendency towards being the prodigal or the Pharisee-like son and grow into spiritual fatherhood, is generosity.  The father in the parable gives to the children.  All he has belongs to his children.  All they ask for, he gives to them.  After receiving the young son back, the father showers him with gifts.  When the older brother complains he says all he has is his.  The spirit of the father is a giving one, a generous one.  To be like the father, we have to be generous like the father; giving in our attitude and actions. We can’t be transactional; we have to be generous.  We have to realize those we give to are our brothers and sisters, that we are related and belong to the same family.These are some of the treasures that Nouwen has unlocked in a careful study of both Jesus’ famous parable and the painting it inspired.  Through the reading of his book about these works, much light is shed onto some of the darker tendencies of our human nature, but also much light is shed onto the divine tendencies of the God nature that created us and in which we can seek refuge through imitation."
"The book is a subtle but powerful unfolding of suffocated emotion through a type of contemplation that is both emancipatory and fulfilling. Nouwen challenges us to participate in something revolutionary. Compassion and forgiveness are portrayed as the sublime spiritual doorways through which we not only enter into greater communion with others, but more importantly discover a mystical union within ourselves. The compassion of the father in Rembrandt’s painting is a psycho-spiritual ideal that reflects a basic human tendency to deprive our souls of a radical generous love. The final frontier that has yet to be pioneered in Christianity is “self-compassion”. Nouwen sifts through the Parable of the Prodigal Son at the crossroads of his own exhausted faith and the sediment of Rembrandt’s life. His findings are an exquisite example of the type of diligent exegesis that uncovers a pristine gem within Christ’s teaching. You need not go much further then learning how to love both your wayward enemy and obedient brother through the embodiment of the father’s awe-inspiring compassion. Each archetype is a dramatization of the reconciliation that needs to occur at a deep inward transformative level. If you are seeking inner reconciliation and healing, I highly recommend."
"Just a heads up that the current publishing run of this book is INCORRECT. My Bible Study group had been planning to read this book for a Lenten Study. Thankfully I ordered my book early and opened it up to begin reading. The cover is correct but the interior pages belong to a book titled ""Untangled"" and is a self help book on raising teenage daughters. Others in my group also received misprinted books. I re-ordered and the replacement book is also wrong. I suspect that the entire current publishing run is going to be wrong and until reprinted this book will not be available. Not sure if it would be the same problem with other book sellers. I contacted the publishing company and they sent a pre-programmed reply thanking me for my inquiry so again, not sure if this will be corrected anytime soon.I'm really disappointed because friends who have read this book love it!"
"Our Sunday school class at St. Francis Episcopal in Macon, Ga., read/studied/discussed this book for four weeks.  Using the poster of the prodigal son available through Amazon and Nouwen's well written reflection on this parable, many of us were able to be transformed into a new way of thinking about our place in the world, particularly among our closest friends and family.  Inspirational in every way, our conversations have turned to how well we are moving toward the ""loving father.""  At the same time, we have a new understanding of how often we stand firmly in the grip of the failings of the elder son.  Moving toward the light is always difficult, but worth it!"
"I absolutely loved this book — so much so that I want to get a poster of the artwork so I can study it in detail. Nouwen looks at this familiar Bible story through the eyes of the prodigal, the ""good"" son, and the father. Then he continues to show how we are all of these. Nouwen's use of language is beautiful and I can't tell you how many times I had to highlight whole paragraphs. Sometimes I wanted to highlight the whole book! When I get the poster, I'll probably read this book again."
This book is terrific! I am a biblical scholar ( I have a master's degree in Biblical Languages) and I have never looked at the parable of the Prodigal Son through the lens of Rembrandt's painting although that particular parable is one of my favorites and Rembrandt is my favorite painter. Henri Nouwen's book is accessible and spiritually filling at the same time. Each chapter reminds us of how the world and our own lack of self-esteem can interfere with our relationship with the all-loving God. The book is broken up into chapters that reflect the perspective of the artist and the figures in the painting (who reflect the characters in the parable). Nouwen reveals how the painting and the story reflect issues in his own relationship with God and issues that no doubt affect our relationship with God as well as steps to correct the problems.  I recommend this book highly.
"This is a book written with amazing insight into what the story of the Prodigal Son really meant to the author, and what it revealed to me about me. I like to read things that help me to grow spiritually, and most books of that nature I do not read as novels- this book will do it for you, if you can accept the premises the author makes. I found that I am very much like both sons- petulant, arrogant, jealous, humiliated by my own tendencies toward envious narcisstic behaviors, feeling at times unforgivable and unforgiving. This book helped to change my attitudes and judgments about others, and I understand more fully what requirements are needed to more fully Love God and my Neighbor, as Jesus expressed. This is a book of emotion and intellect. Who do you see yourself as? The son who received forgiveness for bad behavior, or the son whose jealousy held him back from recognizing who he was in his Father's eyes."
"I cannot at all speak to the content of this book. It arrived in my mailbox today and I have not read the first word. I can speak to the quality of this books' ""finishing."" It is absolutely horrible. I purchased a new book. It is scuffed. There is a very distinct collation/cutting issue. The top margin is twice what is should be and there is nearly no bottom margin. There is also a very strong chemical scent that I can only assume is ink. What a shame.Again. I have not read even a single word so the content of this book I cannot speak to but the book itself is a mess."
"This book is one everyone should read.  I have read it twice and have bought extra copies to give to people.Most people know that they have rebellious patterns in their life and feel like a prodigal child at times. They want to be forgiven, they want to start over.  They know a change needs to be made, but where do you start...This book gives answers to these questions, but more then that I show us that we also need to deal with the other elder brother who is inside each of us. The brother who feels slighted, used, looked over, unappreciated, etc. That soul is also hurting and needs some love and forgiveness.But the kicker in this book is... That eventually we all need to become the loving forgiving FATHER, to help others through our  forgiveness and personal blessing.  We have all been the two brothers. We now need to nurture ourselves and grow in to the  adult Father or Mother for all the little prodigal children that come our way.  Blessings"
"I know that books can change lives, particularly the Bible, but seldom do you read about a painting that changed the life of both the artist, Rembrandt, and a viewer. Nouwen is a ""where-have-you-been-all-my-life"" author and takes the painting and story of The Prodigal Son and tells what he comes to know by studying the art and artist's life. He identifies with the elder son and knows he needs to change, leave his childhood behind, and become like the father who shows unconditional love and compassion. Everyone should have this book in his or her library."
"In the Fall of 1983, Henri Nouwen fortuitously comes across Remembrandt's iconic ""The Return of the Prodigal Son"" painting, just like many of us. That is where the similarity ends. From there, it takes off into a deeper contemplation of the very parable with Nouwen's attention Argus-eyed on the trifecta of dramatis personae in this poignant story: (1) the younger son, (2) the elder son, and (3) the father himself.The summit of the Beatitudes is manifested in this parable. So, to have a sumptuous tour behind each of those three characters in a practical and reflective way, along with Nouwen, was the most enriching experience of reading this book. It was neither schmaltzy nor syrupy, at any point.  With an inveterate command over the Classical Languages, especially Latin and Greek, the way he dissects some of the words (for e.g., son using the Greek original of teknon or genus for generosity), added more to the clarity of the central-point he was making, than watering it down with etymological trivia.References to The Bard's sonnets and maxims, besides Estonian and African proverbs were all adding more to the leitmotiv of the reflections. By intensely brooding over his own experience of seeing the original painting at St. Petersburg and applying its Gospel and visual message to his own life, it made it organically appealing to apply the same to one's own life by applying its transcendental and open-ended lessons.  I think, as a reader, that was the biggest takeaway for me.I have two qualms about this current paperback edition, though:1. There is a notes' section in the back, which is pretty rich with references. I only wish, it was publicized properly, if not having footnote markers in the passage, in situ. So, please do not miss the notes' section at the last.2. The front-cover is printed in a way that it only shows 5 characters, instead of 6. As the whole tome is about the painting per se, I think, it is not impractical to expect that this artwork is provided to the best rendition possible on print.Overall, a wonderful book, for this Lent. I loved it."
"The book is miss printed.  The cover says ""The Return of the Prodigal Son"" by Henri Nouwen but the inside pages are the book ""Untangled"" by Lisa Damour.  This isn't the sellers fault, it was printed incorrectly.This is the second copy I received this way.  There must be several misprints out there."
"Yes, this is a book of spirituality, but it is far more than that!This book should be required reading for entry into adulthood, into marriage, into parenthood, as well as entering middle age, not to mention before taking on the label of ""elderly"".There is no greater compliment than being called Mom or Dad.  Here is the instruction manual needed to properly execute the job associated with the title.  And, by the way, it also lays out the path to be traveled in route to the Pearly Gates."
Correct book cover. Wrong contents. Content was a book called Untangled. About raising teen girls.
"Nouwen was a professor (at least one stop was at Harvard) who decided to spend years as a live-in companion for men who were mentally challenged. He took literally the admonition of Jesus that true leaders must do as he did: he girded himself with a towel, took a basin of water, and washed the feet of his disciples. In what may well have been Nouwen’s best book, he articulates beautifully the role of servant leader, especially in its power to change the servant leader, who learns deep lessons about life, about serving love, and deepest meaning. I love this book. We are each less because Henri has left this earthly realm."
"This wonderful book is a contemplation of the story of the Prodigal Son, and an experiential description of a long time study of Rembrandt’s painting, the Return of the Prodigal Son. From it the author extracts a path for the reader to holiness, beginning with what it means to be the younger son, then the older son, then the all forgiving father. Through grief, forgiveness and generosity in one’s life, one can grow in spiritual strength."
"This was recommended to me by a fellow believer who I admire and respect. However, I can't understand why as it's very esoteric and does not align with scripture. Would not recommend."
"This is my favorite book from Henri!! His explanation of the Prodigal Son story has so many lessons in it. The biggest one I came away with was, helping me understand that we all may be like the Prodigal Son at some point in our lives but we have to move past that. We are to become more like the Father in both our spiritual development and in how we go about our daily lives. Once we are forgiven then we must move forward and learn to forgive others despite how hard it can be."
"This was a book that was surprisingly interesting causing thoughtful deep unexpected reflection.  I was expecting not to find too much new in a book about the prodigal son, but I was terribly wrong.  Rev. Nouwen surprised and delighted with his personal reflections and analysis of the protagonist, as well as all of the other personalities in the story.  His insights about the ""other son"" were something I would never have expected (won't give it away), as were the reflections about the father.  His insightful analysis, looking at the details of the painting an painter, coupled with his personal critical reflection on his own shortcomings makes this a book you won't forget.  This book should be read slowly because it is so thought provoking.  It was a pure delight to read this book, and it is one I know I will read again because it is too rich for only one reading.Dr. Tom Accardi"
"This writing is a deep look into the struggle and longing in everyone’s heart. Nouwen reveals the truth that we are all prodigal younger and older sons. He also issues the challenge and the vision to step up and step into spiritual father and motherhood, all the while acknowledging that the struggle is real.This is a writing that produces much thought. I highly recommend it."
"This book has been truly life changing for me as well as for the people in my spiritual direction training cohort. Of all the books we've had them read, this is has had the most profound impact. It's short and it's readable. The story is intimately familiar but devastatingly deep and new. The inclusion of a flap with the Rembrandt picture that you can hold out as you read is really helpful. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to grow spiritually. Prepare to have your life changed."
"I read this book based on the recommendation of a friend who had been deeply moved by it.  After reading it, I understood why.  This is one of the most moving books I have read, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to deepen their relationship with God.Henri Nouwen uses the parable of “The Prodigal Son” and the painting by Rembrandt to reveal his own deep personal insights.  Fr. Nouwen challenges each of us to recognize that we all have the wandering son and resentful elder brother within ourselves, yet we must learn to become the Father and exhibit unconditional, forgiving love... a struggle that even the author recognizes in himself.I am forever grateful to my friend to have been introduced in such a profound way to this book and Rembrandt’s famous painting.  I was so moved by this book that I purchased a copy of the poster for my friend and later for myself, as a constant reminder of unconditional love and forgiveness."
Completely wrong book inside of cover! Only the cover is legit. Book on the psychology of raising teenage daughters inside.
"Really sweet meditation on the Parable in Luke 15 and Rembrandt’s painting of the Prodigal Son. There are some deep and thoughtful meditations here from the perspective of both sons, the father, and even the onlookers. I found some of his thoughts on rejection and compassion personally helpful and thoughtful. Good book worth reading and meditating on."
"Henri Nouwen is well known for his depth of thinking and his spiritual journey. Of the books I've read of his, this one caused me the most self-exploration. I was also unacquainted with Rembrandt's painting and found myself caught up in the many messages Nouwen found in it."
"while there is some value to be had in this book, other books can provide the devotional/inspirational material that is had here without the ""I AM THE BELOVED"" Catholic claptrap. You are not the Beloved, Nouwen. We receive from God's word, not from pictures, and this book is great evidence for that. Hard pass."
"This book is a heartfelt account by Nouwen on his encounter with Rembrandt's painting of the 'Return of the Prodigal Son.' The book is in-depth; Nouwen's style is very pensive and delicate. Nouwen writes in a way that really pulls the reader in and provides the reader with captivating insight on his emotional and intellectual take on the painting. He examines the parable from multiple angles, primarily from the view of the younger son, the older son and the father. I recommend reading the book because it is deep and touching, and it helps the reader explore and understand the parable in a whole new way."
"I ordered this book as a textbook for grad school in the beginning of the semester, and haven't opened it until now. The cover is for Return of the Prodigal Son by Henri Nouwen, as pictured. The entire inside of the book is ""Untangled: Guiding Teenage Girls Through the Seven Transitions into Adulthood"" by Lisa Damour. Not one page of the inside of the book is actually the book I ordered, and now I'm past the return window and have to buy the e-book to finish my class assignment on time. I'm furious and bewildered."
"Henri Nouwen is one of my very favorite authors.  He's easy to read and very real, but extremely profound.  I really want to let his thoughts sink in, so I tend to read just one of his books a year ... sometimes over and over.  Another favorite is Life of the Beloved."
"This book sums up the life and experience of theologian, Henri Nouwen. After nearly thirty years as a lecturer at Harvard,Yale and Notre Dame, Nouwen discovered the painting of Rembrandt, THE RETURN OF THE PRODIGAL SON, which is in the Hermitage museum in St. Petersburg, Russia.Nouwen flew there and sat before the painting for two days. He saw his own life reflected in Rembrandt's visualization of the parable. Nouwen wrote this book, gave up lecturing and spent the remainder of his life as a chaplain in a home for disabled children. It is an extraordinarily sensitive document of the transformed life of a brilliant academic teacher."
This is an extended meditation on both the parable and Rembrant's depiction by an author ready to reveal his true self.  Challenges your understanding of the parable and opens new insights into both the painting and the original parable
"Even if you think you know the parable of the prodigal son like the back of your hand, pick this book up and read it. You will be greatly blessed from its insights especially if you struggle with being a performance oriented christian or you struggle with comparing yourself to others.Henri Nouwen once visited the Hermitage and sat in front the original rendition of Rembrandt's prodigal son for 5+ hours. The result of that visit in addition to deep reflection is this amazing book with many rich insights that went far beyond my expectations."
"I have heard the story of the Prodigal Son all my life, but Nouwen's discussion of it has drawn my heart to the Father more than anything has for a long time.  I have just ordered my second copy because I marked up the first one so badly on my first reading that my copious notes now distract me!Nouwen takes us through his own journey of spiritual discovery that was triggered by his fascination with Rembrandt's painting of the same name.  While he refers to the painting more than to the biblical text, his exploration of the story is consistent (with only one or two exceptions that I can think of) with the text and its true meaning.He directly but gently challenges us to consider in what ways we are like the prodigal son and in what ways we are like the elder brother.  While I felt some pangs of recognition and remorse while I was reading it, it was never discouraging or disheartening, because Nouwen constantly reminds of us the unchanging, undeserved and undeniable love of the Father Who is always calling us home.  While some sermons or books make me feel sad or guilty that I have 'left home', this one makes me _want_ to come home to the Father.And then he adds an interpretive twist that I have never heard before:  he calls us to become the _father_, to become like our Heavenly Father in loving and calling others home. too.  We embark on a dual journey of becoming the beloved son or daughter of God so that we can become a father who loves as He loves.Here is a summary passage that gives a taste of where Nouwen takes us on our journey:""Living out this spiritual fatherhood requires the radical discipline of being home. I find it impossible to love consistently without asking for something in return.  But the discipline is precisely to give up wanting to accomplish this myself as a heroic feat.  To claim for myself spiritual fatherhood, I have to let the rebellious younger son and the resentful elder son step up on the platform to receive the unconditional, forgiving love that the Father offers me, and to discover there the call to be home as my Father is home.""In his warm, vulnerable and profound way, Nouwen offers this book that can itself help us hear the voice of our Father calling us home.  I highly recommend it."
"Henri Nouwen probes broadly and deeply into the meaning he feels and sees in Rembrandt's painting of the return of the prodigal - a painting in Rembrandt's last years - perhaps his last painting. Are there reflections here of Rembrandt's own experiences as both a prodigal and the stiff, manipulative older brother, and of the welcoming father? He probes his feelings as he compares the hands of the father hugging the prodigal. Similarly he suggests many possible meanings. Nouwen also relates his feelings to his experiences."
"Richard  Written with painful honesty, confessional, blunt, yet full of grace. With the painting, and  Rembrandt s sensitivity to the father, both the prodigal and elder sons, the bystanders, light and dark, Nouwens discovers his own story and vocation. His parish with the mentally challenged becomes his path to salvation."
"It's Henri at his best.  I have not finished it yet, but have already gotten a lot out of it and I'm just at the beginning.  It speaks to the deep places I need spoken to.  I would recommend this book to anyone."
"For anyone who wants to understand the Loving Heart of God, this is a must read. The author is so astute at pointing out that each one of us is very much like the Prodigal, and yet, as much like the Good son that stayed home. I gained much insight into the strongholds that keep us from forgiving others, and applauding the fact that God, represented by the Father in the painting, forgives all if we will let Him become our all in all."
"The book is a spiritual journey through the emotions of the prodigal son, his father, and his elder brother as felt by the author.  Rembrandt's painting and the parable are the foundation of the discussion."
"I am aware of the story of the return of the prodigal son and know it well.  Or so I thought.  This story begins with the author feeling a powerful gravitation to Rembrandt's painting in the Hermitage (which is based on the return of the prodigal son).As the story slowly unwinds, the author's fascination with Rembrandt's work examines every detail of the painting to every part of the parable to the very perspective of each and every character.  This observation becomes so absorbing that you too may discover a spiritual healing through the recognition of your own place in the story.A small book over just over 100 pages, it is more thought-provoking than most that are 10 times its size."
"This small but powerful book by Nouwen is a must read.  This was my first by Nouwen and will not be my last.  His understanding of the pains and hopes of human nature, gently and compassionately juxtaposed against the incomprehensibly gracious and loving nature of God, is enlightened.  He bravely descends to the neediest places within himself, which we all share, and welcomes the reader into that space.  He humbly reveals his heart, his pain, his desires (both for the things of God and the things of the flesh), and the wealth that God offers in His simple desire to welcome us home with open arms.  Humanity's erratically charged discontent is neutralized in the presence of Divine Love.  From every angle - the son who leaves, the son who stays, those who observe, those who celebrate - Nouwen gives the reader a solid, probing look into the human heart.  And the hope for healing is always, always in the Father."
"I will be the 5th person to give this book 2-Stars. This is surely the minority opinion when looking at the other reviews. Be that as it may, I wholeheartedly agree with these other four reviewers. The book was so overdone. Like one said about ""the author's review of the painting [being] interesting to a point,"" except ""he made it over and over."" It was so repetitive. Throughout the book, you could not pin him down. Was he in God's camp, forgiven and at peace? Or, as the same reviewer said, ""he spent so much time telling how awful he was."" Listening to this as an audiobook just seemed to make it all the worse, like ""what is his beef?""Recently, I read his, 

  
The Wounded Healer: Ministry in Contemporary Society









  
  
    
  . In my review I said, ""Amazingly, I was disappointed with this, right from the beginning! I have had trouble trying to sync what I consider an awful book with such a celebrated author. In fact, I [was] so disappointed, I [was] wondering if I will ever read another of his books."" However, I gave him another try, especially with the popularity of this one on the Prodigal Son. Just the topic was attractive enough to try it. But what I said in the above review, I repeat here also. His repetitiveness was ""extremely tiring to listen to."" There were sections that seemed to simply be ""rants."" It was convoluted and extremely self-involved. All of this was caught by the other reviewers.Let me say one thing in Nouwen's favor, for which I am glad I stuck with it, trudging and plodding through to finish the book. He presented an insight towards the end which I heard for the first time. We all can identify with the younger son. That does not seem to be a difficulty. In fact, it is extremely helpful. Many of us progress and eventually realize that, surprisingly, we are very much like the older son. But, what I heard new, and what I think is so powerful, is that we are called to go further. We are called to be the loving, welcoming, forgiving father. That is the role that the Lord is calling all of us to follow. Did not he say, ""Be perfect as your Heavenly Father is perfect (Matthew 5:48)? Isn't that an incredible challenge: to know that reconciliation begins with us! That is how God is with us.If the book was simply to get this point across, it would have been perfect. Why then did he drag his readers through so much to get to this rich gem that was unseen waiting for them?"
"I've read this book before and wanted to share it with another like minded friend. Father Nouwen was such a humble man, not afraid to look inward and discover himself as the Son, elder son and the father in this story of the return of The Prodigal Son. It certainly help me with letting go of resentments and the freedom from the bondage of self through forgiveness of others and especially myself. God is so very Good, and I'm grateful for the message He and Henri delivered to me personally through this book!"
"Henri Nouwen's spiritually deep book on the return of the prodigal son is a must read for any Christian. It has had a deep impact on me. It has led me in the place of being forgiven, accepted, rest - Home. And set me on the journey of becoming like the father. This book is a blessing."
"To live in the darkness of the twenty-first century is to seek the forgiveness of the Father, to finally rest in his unconditional love, and to allow him to unreservedly forgive our betrayal of departure.  This book is, indeed, the welcome home for which we all hope."
"AMAZING!!! Fr. Nouwen truly gets to the truth of our hearts where there is no hiding, no covering up, JUST THE NAKED TRUTH!!! THANK YOU FATHER for my brother who points all of our lost souls back HOME to YOU.. THE ONLY FATHER  WHO LOVES US UNCONDITIONALLY!  And here you are hidden in every true believers' SPIRIT, just beyond the veil of our searching SOULS, deep within. This book is a PRECIOUS JEWEL!!!"
"This book explains how we are the son who stayed home, the prodigal son, and the father in our lifetime.  What we do with each of these roles leads us to search deep inside and become the person God created us to be.  I have given several copies away to family members."
"Having now read this book a second time I am touched in a more personal way than before. Nouwen writes about what it is to recognize the darkness within our own emotionally needy patterns of perspective and move away, maturing into the compassionate spiritual mother or father who extends compassion and forgiveness to others without reserve."
"The paperback copy that I received is in terrible condition. The pages are all cut different lengths and looked like they were ripped instead of cut. They stick out further than the cover in various degrees. I can't believe that a company would send out such poor quality. Anyway, this review has nothing to do with the content of the book itself, which I have heard is wonderful and I look forward to reading it."
I am still processing this divine gift of a book and the meaning it has to my life's experiences. I particularly was drawn to the discussion of God as Father and Mother. Read it. You will find something in it to identify with and to inspire you.
"If anyone is ever tempted to study the Parable of Jesus as my study group were, this is the book. It is well known of course and the author as well. Probably the best Parable study of all time. Sinful human nature, greed, envy, jealousy and God Divine Mercy are just a few issues covered in the book. Highly recommend 👍"
"Henri  Nouwen explains a commonly told parable in such a simple, clear way that he reveals all the nuances that have completely  been hidden to me.  He makes me feel like I stood beside him in St. Petersburg before the painting absorbing life's lessons and limping the soul of the artist."
"Henri Nouwen uses the Rembrandt painting, and even the story of Rembrandt's life, along with reflections from his own life and journey with Jesus to reflect on the parable of the Prodigal from the Bible ... but more than that, he shows us how we are all the Prodigal Son ... the Unforgiving Older Brother ... and, even, at our best (when we become who we are called to be), the Welcoming Father. This book is packed with the good, good news that our identity is always to be found in being the Beloved of God. If you're ready to hear this message, you will find it nowhere more skillfully conveyed."
"Read with a group of 10 ladies as part of our Catholic Book group that meets monthly.  Excellent discussion on which personality of this painting and parable we were:  the prodigal son, the older son, or the Father.  Easy to read, and good applications for daily life.  The only problem with this book is that the image on the cover is too dark.  We used a large art book from our public library so that the details, such as the Father's different hands, can be clearly seen."
"This came highly recommended by a very dear friend who also happens to be a Priest.  I always connected with one of the characters in this story, but Nouwen made me look deeper to see that I do have a connection with all 3 characters...and the unconditional love is the key to the entire story.  This book opened my eyes to see the story from different perspectives and apply them to my daily life.  Helped me to see how far I have come since my conversion and realize that I still have a lot of work to do...but I'm ok with that!"
"The tale of the prodigal son—who takes his inheritance early, leaves home, spends his inherited money in a life of debauchery, returns to his father’s house in shame, and is welcomed back with open arms—as told in Luke 15 is one of the most accessible of the many parables found in the New Testament.  Its accessibility lies partly in its seeming simplicity (which it has in common with most parables), and partly in the power of a story of return.  In this short book, Henri Nouwen, a Dutch-born Catholic priest who spent the last years of his life ministering to the L’Arche community for the mentally handicapped in Toronto, has explicated the story in light of Rembrandt’s painting “The Return of the Prodigal Son,” a painting that affected him so deeply when he first saw it on a poster in 1983 that three years later he arranged to sit before it for several hours where it hangs in The Hermitage in St. Petersburg.Nouwen nicely articulates a variety of lessons from the painting and the Biblical story it illustrates.  He takes each of the major characters in turn: the younger son (rebellious), the older son (resentful), and the father (compassionate).  From each of these, he draws lessons and insights, relating each character’s situation to his own.  In the end, the most powerful and surprising insight for him is that he must become like the father in the parable, ready to bless and welcome without judging or punishing.  He quotes Luke, chapter 6, verse 36: “Be compassionate even as your Father is compassionate.”  (The King James Version uses “merciful.”)  So in his reading, the parable requires more of the believer than simply turning back to God and accepting His compassionate, forgiving embrace—as appealing as that sounds.  Instead (or, really, in addition), it requires action; it requires going beyond being the repentant, returning prodigal, and being for others the source of compassion, the safe haven that facilitates return.  Both the rebellious younger son and the resentful older son need healing, which only the father’s compassion can provide.The story of the prodigal son has always been one of my favorites from the Bible.  But as with most people, I suppose, my focus has always been on the prodigal son.  He’s the one I could always identify with.  Having read Nouwen’s book, I can see that just wanting rest, to be accepted, to be forgiven, is selfish in a way.  We all need that, but we also need to make the effort to move beyond it, so that we can provide others with the comfort and the quiet strength that they need.  Nouwen’s reading of the parable, and of the painting, is humble, humane, and insightful.  I will understand the story differently the next time I read it.One note: I would recommend looking at a better reproduction of Rembrandt’s painting than the one on the cover of the book.  Some of the detail, including one of the background figures, cannot be seen in the reproduction used here."
This book is perhaps the most spiritually perceptive I've ever read. It is certainly the most insightful look into Jesus' parable of the prodigal son that I've ever encountered.
"Twice I've purchased this book and both times the cover was for""The return of the prodigal son"" but the contents were the book ""Untangled.""  I could not find a way to report this and get the correct book."
"An excellent book with a thought-provoking understanding of the role of all three persons: the father, the younger son and the older son... and how each one can be understood with reference the reader. I spent a much briefer period of time in front of the same painting in the same location three years following Nouwen's experience. I have selected this book several times as a gift for someone, most notably at graduation time."
I read it for my personal reading and it gave me some great insights!  It showed me several different things I never would have thought about and it made me think about how the Lord could be/is in my life.
"Once again Nouwen explains the struggle within this maturing spiritual adult.  He makes personal the journey that so many fear to clearly understand, we are meant to grow into the image of our Father who art in heaven.  This soul crafting and image bearing are not naturally assumed but divinely planned and intensionally designed by the very Father who calls us to live out Heaven on earth.Once again inspired to live up to the high calling of servant of Christ."
"This book sums up God's attitude toward man, His supreme lavish love that forbears unabashed rebellion which is a consequence of free will with which He has designed humans. With no lectures, admonishment, advice, or suggestions, father gave the second son what he asked for, premature inheritance,.even though He foresaw sorrow it would bring. Then when son willingly returned home, father had a great celebration, barely giving the son time to finish his apology. Again no lectures or preaching. Son learned on his own from consequences of his decision.Father God provides an example of how he wants people to be treated in His kingdom, inspiring us to imitate Him by having kind, merciful, long suffering, tolerant, patient, forgiving unconditional love toward others. This is a summary of God's interaction with man which at the same time is humbling and uplifting."
Amazing book!!! I am loving it...started reading when I got it. There's a little foldout on the book so you can look at the artwork as he reflects on it.
Henri Nouwen has written a stunningly fresh exegesis of the Prodigal Son pluming the souls of the characters and applying the interpretation to the personal spiritual lives of the faithful
"Christine KaiserAfter reading this book, I know that from here on, I will lose myself in any work of art that I view. I will look at lighting, facial expressions, posture, hands, feet, eyes, background with an intensity like never before. My mother's sister was a very talented artist who worked in many mediums -- oil, water colors, dry vegetables and probably many others of which I don't know. As the saying goes, we're never too old to learn."
Inspirational.  I listened twice.  His other books are great as well.  It is easy to see ourselves in each of the characters covered in the painting and  thoughtful book.  I bought a copy of the painting as well and it is hanging in my office as I write.  St. Petersburg will be on my bucket list to sit with the painting and meditate.
"Henri Nouwen is a major theologian who speaks to my heart.  I've ordered this for my son, with whom I share spiritual writings.My problem was with delivery.  It was supposed to arrive on Feb. 13th.  I kept checking, no book.  Finally on the 15th, I tracked it and found a photo showing its delivery by a door half covered with snow and ice.  A sign on that door asks that packages be delivered 20 steps over to the main entrance."
"Nouwen is at his best in this analysis of the painting and the parable.  He gives the reader an in-depth look at each character in this well-known story, then zeroes in on how we all have characteristics of each one.  As always, Nouwen bears his heart and encourages the reader to do the same."
"Our Bible study group had just finished a study of The Prodigal God, by Timothy Keller, which discussed the sins of both brothers and the true love of the Father in the parable of the prodigal son.  The Return of the Prodigal Son:  A Story of Homecoming is a perfect follow up to The Prodigal God.  Father Nouwen's insightful observations of, and meditations on, a Rembrandt painting of the Return of the Prodigal Son are both insightful and inspiring.  I would suggest reading The Prodigal God and The Return of the Prodigal Son in this order.  Together, they are a dynamite study.  You will automatically re-examine your conscience and will see yourself in a whole new dimension which probably won't be flattering."
My first Nouwen book. Moved me to tears quite unexpectedly on several occasions. I recommend it with great enthusiasm to all who want a profound story and metaphor to draw closer to God.
"Getting into the prodigal son, the elder son, to attempt to become like the father it is just an amazing inspiring spiritual exercise. I wish it was not so redundant, it was hard to read the same ideas over again."
"As others explained, the inside pages of the book are not The Return of the Prodigal Son, but are “Untangled”. Very disappointing mistake that looks like it’s wide spread."
"Nouwen takes the reader on a journey toward maturing love in this brief but profound reflection on Rembrandt's The Prodigal Son.  He not only offers insight on the passages itself but also provides a pathway into the artist's interpretation.  As usual, more highlights than not."
"Had to read this to see what all the hype was about.  I think this book lent things to myself that weren't the premier lesson  for the writing of this book.  Sure wished I could feel and understand the painting the way Mssr. Nouwen saw it, but it had a terrific impact on him, so I am glad.Perhaps a different painting will move me like this one did for him."
Such a splendid meditation on God's forgiveness and compassion! High praise for this work that brings readers to appreciation of the artist and deeper understanding of our Loving Father. .
Super frustrating....bought this book with several other Henry Nowen books.  Brought this on vacation to read it and opened to find a COMPLETELY different book....It looks like several others have had the same issue and I don’t know how to confirm if I re-order I again won’t receive a misprint.
It is a great reminder that the call of God takes us to the place where we can comfort with the comfort with which we have been comforted - to find that we are in the everliving cycle of God's peace. We mature from individualistic and insolent sons to compassionate and forgiving fathers. AMEN
I liked Nouwen's observations of Rembrandt's painting. I could see what he was referring to as I read his reflections and studied the painting. I liked his approach of using three viewpoints of the story. It  did get a little preachy and repetitive but that was what he did in his life...preached.
"The monograph is an analysis of the meaning of the Prodigal Son parable from the New Testament.  The author provides insight into the parable using Rembrandt's art as a guide.  While the monograph seems to also be a self-analysis of the author [who was a Priest, he died in the early 1990s], it should help the reader think about repentance and forgiveness.  The reader should try to obtain another picture of Rembrandt's Prodigal Son as the copy of the picture in the book is not that clear; the author references objects in the picture which cannot be seen in the book's picture, but are visible in better pictures.  Overall, a good book for a Book Club that is interested in exploring religious issues."
"A very good read, written a few years past by a Priest.  A great read for anyone in the Christian faith or anyone interested in Rembrant."
"I liked how easy this book was to read, and that I would continue to think about different aspects that I had not considered before.  I'm really glad I read this book!  I will be rereading it!"
"The item I ordered ""The Return of the Prodigal Son"" is in good shape, as the seller described."
"We bought this as a gift for someone because we love what Nouwen has to say in this book, ... BUT we sent the first copy back because of the poor quality of the paper, pages were not even, edges were VERY rough, felt like it was 'slapped' together by little kids ... So they sent us a 2nd copy --- which is almost just as bad!  Whatever happened to Quality Control?"
Henri’s writings are always very rich and rewarding to read. This book is a unique look at the story of the Prodigal Son in relation to Rembrandt’s drawing.
A life changing book that encourages intimacy with God and addresses those things which may thwart that intimacy. Nouwen uses his incredible insight into Jesus' parable in the Word along with Rembrant's work and his own personal journey. I'm on my third reading in as many months and have found it a wonderful study with others looking for being intimate with the Father.
"Henri Nouwen writes in such a way to challenge, encourage and inspire. In this work, he explores the attitudes and perspectives of the main characters in the story of the Prodigal Son.  This is one of my favorite works and so I highly recommend it."
"I have learned much from this book. I love the part where he says grieving is praying. I can also relate to the authors experience of recognizing ourselves as younger son, older son, and then finally the father."
"This is one of those rare books that can bring into sharp focus what is needed to live as a spiritually mature person and paints a picture of what that looks like. Nouwen speaks from the point of a struggling student of true Christianity, and slowly, meticulously, and with great precision, leads us to a clear view of loving as the Father loves."
"This work of Henri Nouwen takes you from deep to deep in your jouney with a God of forgiveness and grace.  Using the parable of the Prodigal Son from Luke 15 and the painting by Rembrandt called The Return of the Prodigal Son, he helps us realize that we are all like the younger son, as well as the elder brother.  But most importantly we are all called to become like the Father; full of grace and mercy.  This book is for anyone who desires to see the Father of Jesus Christ more clearly and journey into the depths of the Christian faith."

   The Return of the Prodigal Son by Nouwen is a great book. But what is this?"
"I consider this book a work of art as well as a wonderful devotional book, a profound book of psychology, and something as close to scriptural authority as any book I know. It speaks of the three main characters in the prodigal son parable, and each is done with great depth and insight. Using Rembrandt's masterpiece in oil, Nouwen's book enters that category of profound art value to me. Highest recommendation. Read this and learn about yourself in the process. Masterful."
"I bought this book on recommendation of Father Martin 's book. What a wonderful writer and  he opens up so much about himself through the masterpiece painting of The Prodigal Son. As I was reading this book and I go to Mass and guess what the gospel that was read ...yes The Prodigal Son. I love the writings of Henri Nouwen and am reading more of his insightful books. What a gem, I recommend this highly"
"Nouwen's reflections are worth reading for his unique insights into the attitudes and feelings of each of the people in the painting, and his own introspections about himself.  I was very disappointed that the depiction of the painting was so very poor.  I went to the internet to find a much clearer image of the painting which allowed me to get a better idea of just what he was reacting to.  For instance I could not appreciate what he said about the expression on the face of the Prodigal from the image on the book's cover.  I highly recommend that other readers do the same to get the full value of Nouwen's insights."
Giving this 5 stars because I like Nouwen and always get a lot from him. Just received this so - so far so good.
"A very personal and thought-provoking interaction with the text, yes; but (just as importantly) with the Rembrandt painting.  Nouwen studied it as one should study any painting: by sitting in front of it for hours, exploring it all and asking, ""Why?""  The result is an amazing new understanding of the prodigal son, his prodigal older brother, and the father.  I'm so thankful to encounter this book!"
Henri Nouwen had the uncanny ability to write in a way that makes you feel as if he is standing or sitting right in front of you and talking to you.  This book is no different.  He opens up about his own fears and where he feels he falls short of what God wants - and at times it feels like looking into a mirror and facing a part of yourself that you do not want to face but need to.  He is blunt and open without pointing fingers.  A very thought provoking book for everybody no matter where they are in their faith journey.
"Bought this book for the Abiding Together 2020 Lenten book study. It has beautiful insights that have prompted me to reflection many times. Notes are scribbled in the margins of many pages. Must read, at least once!"
"If you are touched by the Biblical account of the Prodigal Son, you will love this book.  It is small, but so moving.  Henri Nouwen becomes fascinated by the Rembrandt painting of the Return of the Prodigal Son, and this book gives his insights into the son, the elder brother, and the Father after hours spent with the painting.  These are lessons we all can take to heart if we put ourselves in the place of each of the three main characters.  I found it one of those life-changing books!"
My favorite religious author and Fr. Nouwen has a way of presenting his stories that you feel they were written just for you. This book is extraordinary and I feel should be a part of any home library.
"This story was quite an in depth look at the painting inspired by the Biblical story of the Prodigal Son.  Mr. Nouwen definitely does not focus solely on the prodigal, but in turn on the older brother, as well as the father, where our focus seldom rests when we read the story in scripture.  Yet everything he says fits so deftly with what I've learned, or want to learn yet, about the love of our heavenly Father for us.  He makes many valid points, and helps us to better understand what a relationship with our Father needs to contain.  I am very glad I read this book, and plan to read it repeatedly!"
"I believe this book would be great for all those people seeking to get closer to God.  The thing that I liked most about this book is the way of finding that darkness that lies within you, which prevents you from getting closer to God spiritually.  We must all face the darkness that lies within us in order to become a whole person in Christ.I gave this book a high rating because the author does a wonderful job in getting you to face the darkness within you."
"The book is one of the best!! I read it many times; however, it came not in the perfect condition. I ordered this book for a gift, and I’m really bummed. I need to give it to somebody this Saturday!"
"My husband listened to this book first as he was traveling. He enjoyed it so much, WE listened to it a week later as we traveled. It was filled with insights into each of the three characters: the Prodigal, the Father and the Elder Brother. We most often hear sermons on the son, but a deeper look into the Father - not only full of love for his Prodigal Son, but a deep yearning to enfold the Elder Son and bring him to His heart of hearts. The ending, just as stated in the Bible, is left for the individual to make his/her decision to come to the Father.........or not!"
A different point of reference for this Bible parable.
"How can one improve on such a familiar and endearing story? By sharing an unforeseen personal ""journey"", Henri Nouven provides an answer that pierces to the heart. After a routine positioning of the circumstances that led to his own revelation, Nouven unveils the topic that one expects to be the book's conclusion. What could possibly be left? Quite a lot it turns out as Nouven introduces the reader to a cast of characters we have always overlooked and in whom the reader will see many familiar faces, including their own. This book offers substance for personal reflection or is suitable for family reading."
I love the in-depth study and application of this parable
"I was required to buy this book  for a religion class I was taking. I was a nice book to read. We had to write a report on the book.Then review our classmates reports. I read 3 other book reports. Each person had a different personal experience reading the book. For me, it was an appreciation for the painting, some some it was a more personal , reflective experience."
"Being an avid Nouwen fan it is in the form of a confession that I have shared the Book with so many friends but had not really ever read the entire book as I got so enthralled with portions of the book that spoke so deeply into my life and some close friends at the time I first started reading the book.  Being able to listen as I drive to the entire book has brought out so many additional truths that I would have otherwise missed and anyone familiar with Nouwen's most famous book knows what incredible insight and wisdom is shared in the book in such an intimate and detailed manner that could only have come from a man that walked with the Spirit of Jesus. The thing that impressed me most about the book and audio version is better summed up by something Phillip Yancey said when he once described Nouwen as one of ""Holy Inefficiency"" and by that he meant that especially in Nouwen's later years with his incredible intellect he spent time with the mentally challenged ministering to those that would never know or understand Nouwen's reputation as one of the world's most profound Christian spiritual leaders and writers of our time."
"Very great story , this book makes it come alive"
Beautiful story of how God is always waiting for our return!
"No rhyming on this one, but simply put, this is a must read for any Christian.Henri Nouwen's analysis of the younger son, the older son, and the father within the context of Christian life is illuminating, insightful, and will really have a person really understand themselves more as well as God. He not only does an analysis of this, but brings in his own personal experience as well as deeply personal sharing which brings home the points that he delivers.  This is a Christian classic."
"I haven't finshed this book yet. There is never any need to hurry while reading Nouwen. His prose may be deceptively simple, yet the thoughts they invoke in the reader can be profound. If Nouwen spent most of his life contemplating this painting and the various persons he was throughout his own life, then the reader can take their time in absorbing it all, and reflecting on their own place in the painting. Highly recommended."
Great read! Nice copy with a reference photo to the painting.
I ordered this book as a gift for a friend.  I already had one and like it so much I wanted to share.  I think Nowen is an amazing writer.  The way he thinks and explains life as he sees it broadens my own viewpoint. The Return of the Prodigal pricked some sore spots in my own life and I came to consider some things in a different way. My life experience makes a little more sense to me thanks to Mr. Nouwen.  The book condition was a described and the seller sent it quickly.
"In this book, Nouwen explores the person that God has called each one of us to be.  Through the Rembrandt painting and Jesus' parable of the prodigal son, he presents what God reveals about Himself and our relationship to Him.  He explores how we are all offered God's love and forgiveness.  We are all accepted as we are.  We are all beloved.  Nouwen urges us to all be Christlike by living that unconditional love towards those around us.The author encourages us to take a clear look at ourselves, and see the spiritual choices that lie before us: Will I choose to live for the pleasures of this world?  Will I surrender myself wholly to the Father?  Will I choose to live in resentment, judgement and fear?Finally, Nouwen paints the life God would have for us, a life of security and peace, in which we are able to give unconditional love to those around us.  What a refreshing place to contemplate.  What a desirable transformation for our lives.I loved this book, and the gentle, humble approach the author chose in examining himself and considering the deeper messages of Rembrandt in the painting; but more importantly, his contemplations on God's message hidden in plain sight in the famous parable.  I would recommend this book to anyone seeking God's desire for their life."
Imagine my surprise when the cover didn’t match the book inside.I was frustrated when trying to contact Amazon about the problem.Impossible!
Fine Product. Quick shipping. Thank you.
This book was more a mirror for me took reflect on my own life than a survey of Rembrandt’s work. While the painting of s wonderful the book has changed how I live.
I remember the verse of the prodigal son from the Bible.  And I had no idea what it truly meant until now.  All I can say is wow what a book that challenges your thought process and your faith.
When you are ready to really digest this you will find much wisdom.  I recommend to those who seek compassion to give and to receive.
"Very good. It challenged a lot and the book make me desire to imitate the father, God."
"Loved it and very provoked by the issues it raises - will return to this book again and again over the coming years, I believe."
"Nouwen’s interpretations of the familiar parable through the artwork of Rembrandt brought me new perspectives as he examined the prodigal son, the elder son, and the compassionate father.I was challenged through his personal journey that I must continue to grow and let God transform me into a compassionate father like Him."
"I have read this book several times now.  Each time I receive some new insight, new way of seeing relationships and responsibilities to one another.  It is filled with genuine joy, as well as sorrow. It’s message each time I have read it is different as I am in a different place in my life to apply its messages."
"Enjoyed reading the book, but will need to read it again."
"I thoroughly enjoyed the whole book. It is such an in-depth study of Rembrandt’s painting and how it applies to our lives. Reading how it affected Mr Nouwen, helped me apply it to my life."
"Very insightful thoughts from the author on one of the most important parables in the Gospels. While the author starts with telling us how his interpretation of Rembrandt's painting increased his insights into what Jesus was telling us and on struggles in his life, you will end up focusing more on your own journey with Christ and how each of us actually plays each of the 3 main characters in the parable at different times in our lives. My men's group has been using this as a basis of discussion for 3 months, and it's opened us up to new ways of thinking about the parable, ourselves and our mission in life."
I have read three or more books by Henri Nouwen prior to reading The Return of the Prodigal Son and because of my previous experience with his writing this book took me on an unexpected journey.  Here Henri takes you through his own mind as he explores the reason he has been captivated by Rembrandt's painting The Return of the Prodigal Son. His depth of thought allowed me to look at my walk with Christ from a new perspective.  I would encourage anyone who is interested in growing their knowledge and thus their relationship with Jesus to read Nouwen.  This book is another master piece by a man with insight that can only be inspired by the light of Christ.
One of my favorite books
I am reading this through for the third time. It is so good and easy to read while being very deep. Love his writing style.
"I'd give it 6 stars if I could. I left the Catholic Church right after high school, and returned after being away 25 years, The Gospel reading the Sunday I returned was the Prodigal Son !This book is short, simple and profound in helping to get over the hump of low self-esteem and not forgiving yourself for past failures.  It doesn't sugar coat them - it just helps you to clearly understand that in order to love - we must allow ourselves to be loved and that can only happen by embracing the unconditional love of the Father as described in the book.But it doesn't stop there.  It goes on to explain how, in our spiritual growth, we are also the older brother in the parable, and to reach the ultimate in growth - we must strive to leave the child stage and reach the Fatherhood stage. To be able to love unconditionally as the Father does.This book will lift you and your spirit to new heights !JBDayton OH"
"Mr. Nouwen gave a real life comparsion between himself and the his personal understanding of the painting.  I thought it was amazing how a painting can cause such internal analysis of yourself. He explained the meaning behind each character's expression or facial expression or body language or the painter's use of colors and shading.  I really appreciated the thought provoking comparisons of the father's love, the prodigal's son's acceptance of his erroneous decision to leave home.  Then on his return to receive such love from his father, yet the oldest son's appearance of feeling unloved.The author's life, as he wrote, had more correlation to each character in the portrait. I have read this story in the bible many times, not analyzed the it in this much detail.It exceeded my expectation, and this was my 1st Henri Nouwen reading."
Beautiful interpretation of the parable and the painting.  The challenge to mature and take the role of Father is poignant and powerful.
The author presents a very insightful and thoughtful look at the parable.
For anyone on a quest to know the heart of our Heavenly Father...this book is for you. It answered so many of my questions about the upside down nature of the Christian Faith.
"A great meditation using art as a springboard for devotion.  I frequently buy it for friends as a gift,"
Great book - love it.  Shared it with a friend in crisis and she was comforted by this.
I'M HAPPY IN EVERY WAY WITH THIS PURCHASE
"Meditations on the figures and stories embedded in a famous painting, from a master of spiritual writing."
I savored this book.  It really affirmed for me that followers of Christ are all of the characters in the painting that so moved Fr. Nowen.  It was recommended to me by both a Pastor and Sprititual Director each of whom like I learned a great deal about the love of Christ and the communion we share with one another in life.
"Highly recommend this book.  It’s life lessons are so powerful.  Reminder that although there is bad in all of us, our fathers grace is unbelievable.  Tolerance of others is our mandate as God provided each of us His grace."
I enjoyed the development of the story from the two sons to the loving father. We are all called to be like the father.
okay
"Loved it-have always the parable what insighthe artist then the author  brings to us, the readers"
Amazing written and dialogued book.
"My spiritual director recommended this book to me. Knowing me well, he admonished me to read it ""slowly...and meditate on it frequently"". For once I followed directions. This is a short book, but I took a full two months to read and digest it. It is a breathtaking book. At times, I wept during passages that spoke to me in a special way. My heart would ache with the feeling of oneness with God our Father and Mother. Mostly, I was astonished and overwhelmed with a feeling of Our Father's/Our Mother's deep love for us. The realization of Father Nouwen that we are all called to become the Father/Mother is burned into my heart.Please pass along this book to others, as I have.Thank you."
As I recall this is a guide to a Lenten study.  Excellent.  Nowen is inspirational and an absorbing faith writer
A WONDERFUL INTELLECTUAL READ..  A good discussion group would be great!!
In my opinion it is the best of Nouwen's works. The reader will take a spiritual journey with many stops for personal reflection and for evaluating her/his intellectual grasp of the goodness of God communicated through forgiveness. The reflective reader may also have to deal with passing emotional states that involve a deeper level of her/his central core. It's a dangerous book because it challenges the faith-love of the reader. It is enchanting! A blockbuster! A MUST read for the spiritually serious!
Insightful and spiritually powerful journey with Nouwen as he connects the painting The Return of the Prodigal Son to his own spiritual life.
"Oh wow! This is a journey. From seeing oneself as the prodigal son, to grasping the concept of one as the resentful brother, to accepting the idea of being the father--Nouwen carries you along with him."
Excellent look at the father and two sons from the Bible story on the return of the Prodigal son
"This is a masterpiece!  Nouwen looks at the prodigal son through the perspectives of the prodigal, the older brother and the father.  It allows us to identify with each of the characters at different points in our lives.  Rembrandt's imagery of the father is very moving.  It gives a beautiful perspective of the desire, mercifulness, and love that our Lord has for us sinners. I highly reccomend this book.  It is one of the best books on spirituality I have read."
Profoundly insightful ….a journey beyond the painting that places all of us at the knee of the Father...
Great
Great book by a very brave author.  Comparing his life; his struggle with depression & life's direction with the story of the return of the prodigal son.  Emphasis on Rembrandt's painting of the return of the prodigal son.  Highly recommended
"This is classic--and under appreciated --wisdom from one who in his own brokenness--spent his life time reflecting on, searching for, and gradually finding the wonder of 2 things: the wonder of his own brokenness, and the far greater wonder of God's grace.He learned how to move from the 'shame' of his woundedness to the joy of watching that very same woundedness become a source of healing and blessing in the service of others.  That, truly, is the astonishing meaning of the ""Gospel"".  'By His stripes, we are healed', and by our wounds, others may be as well when we give those wounds to Him and let them transform them into something redemptive."
"A bit too detailed in some aspects - such as Nouwen's life at the time he meditated with the painting.  Still there is much to discuss, to weigh and from which to grow, both spiritually and in simple human relationships."
God bless Henri Nouwen
It was like the author took a key and unlocked the whole meaning of the story in ways I had not known before.
Great study of a familiar biblical story and a historical painting by Rembrandt.
One of the most important and well-written books I have ever read.
I read this for a book club. I had no idea what to expect. I found it ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS. Going in the re read pile for sure.
"The author provided many insights into the parable from Rembrandt's painting.  By seeing himself through the eyes of the character, he gives impetus to us to see ourselves from various points of view.  We learn about seeking forgiveness, resentment and striving to become forgiving like the father."
Fantastic book especially during these trying times!
The seminal and heart-provoking book from Henri Nouwen. I try to read it at least once a year. A beautiful story into understanding the grace of God through the story and the amazing Rembrandt painting.
"I never would have thought so much insight could be given about this simple story and painting of it.I learned that we can be all three characters (father, elder son, and younger son) at times in our lives.Very insightful, worth rereading at intervals(and the song, When God Ran, is another favorite, as it is also based on this story.)"
"Henri Nouwen meditated on the painting by Rembrandt and on the parable by Jesus over many years, and readers must be prepared to let this stranger's meditation become their own inward journey. It could take you years to really read this small, slim book. There is no psychological or spiritual or motivational ground left unplowed. Prepare yourself to question all your words and actions and desires---even the ones you believed were pure. Written during a time in Nouwen's life when he was ""downwardly mobile,"" brace yourself to be invited, challenged, to leave behind your life as you know it and to fall down into the one place we are all loved--the Deity's open arms.  Or, you can just read the book in a couple of hours, and go on with your life as it is."
I HAD READ THIS BOOK WHEN IT WAS RECOMMENDED BY A FRIEND AND LOANED TO ME. I ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH AND BOUGHT A COPY TO GIVE MY SON. HE AND I HAD READ SERVERAL BOOKS THAT HAD A PREMISE OF THE JOURNEYS AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE CHARACTER'S PHYSICAL AND PSYCOLOGICAL WANDERINGS. WE HAD GOOD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT OUR SHARED INTERESTS IN THESE BOOKS SO I BOUGHT ONE TO SHARE WITH HIM.
"Wonderful counsel for those who are seeking to understand themselves and their relationship with God,"
Have loved Nouwen's writings for many years.  This is a gift for our pastor...one of 15 or so I have gifted over the years.
I recommend this book to anyone willing to challenge their own l I feel and spirituality. It is  a book that is read slowly and with deep introspection yet understood so simply. It makes no difference if you are religious or not. It gives you insight to your deepest feelings. Will keep this nearby to read again and again.
This book possessed me like the painting possessed Henri. It moved me because of the depth of his feelings as he explored every facet of the parable and Rembrandt's interpretation of it.Beautifully crafted.
Thoughtfully focussed book that does justice to THE parable of all times.
"Nouwen shares his interpretation of the famous biblical parable as revealed to him through Rembrandts masterpiece which shares the same name, Return of the Prodigal Son. Revealing in his and our life's, aspects of the younger son, elder son and the Father. Ultimately challenging the reader to focus their life's journey on becoming like the Father. Unconditionally receiving, forgiving and sharing everything with God's children."
Best of Henri Nouwen.The author in search for the love of God will give the reader a taste of it.Especially worth reading for people who question their worth as human beingand their relationship to god - the Father.Excellent for Christians filled with anxiety and doubt.John
"This book was a game-changer for me. I've read it dozens of times, highlighted so much most of the book is yellow, I've taught multiple classes on it, and passed out copies to family, friends, strangers, even those in prison. Excellent, excellent and soulful read."
"Fr. Nouwen provided a clear in depth interpretation of the prodigal son.  Each character had a different part to play in the parable as we all do whether we are the unforgiving son, the prodigal, the observer and the father.  This is our story of a merciful loving God who meets more than halfway waiting in the field.  In my case the story of Rembrandt's painting enabled a friend who was living the later days of their life to understand the depth of God's Love.  Thank You"
"The author uses Rembrandt's painting to focus on the three main characters of the parable: the prodigal son, father, and elder son...the importance of each character is that it brings our relationship to God into focus..."
"Read this with a church book club and it was excellent for that purpose, provoked discussion and reflection!  The book is basically a meditation on the painting and parable. Although they are very familiar, Nouwen uncovers new meanings and nuances often in very personal ways."
One of the best books I've read! Insightful and challenging.
THIS is my all-time favorite book. I read it once a year. Highly recommended.
"Wow! Must read. Gives so many thoughts on this parable from the Father's, the Prodigal's, and the older Brothter's points of view. How life-changing and reassuring to know of the Father's unconditional love, His ever-watching for us, both based on Him, not us, so we can bank on Him being there."
Excellent book and excellent vision of the Biblical story. Highly recommend!
"Nouwen shares his ever-expanding view of what Rembrandt might have been conveying in his famous painting of the return of the prodigal son.  I always appreciate learning of others' inspiration and response to Scripture, art, movies, etc, and ""The Return of the Prodigal Son"" is one of the best at an in-depth explanation of revelation the author received regarding the painting and the parable."
"What a wonderful, raw, revealing look at a man’s soul as he struggles with growing in Christlikeness.  A struggle we all have to strive for."
"Treating each of the protagonists in the story of the prodigal son was a fulfilling approach to a great mystery.  The story was the equivalent of a thriller with expectations rising as Nouwen moved on to a discussion of the dilemmas and values associated with the prodigal son, the brother and finally the father.  I recommend the book to people of faith."
"Henri Nouwen, a Dutch priest and prolific writer, takes the parable of the Prodigal Son and the painting by Rembrandt and discusses its meaning, for him, of each of the characters-the prodigal son,who left home and wasted his inheritance, the elder son who remained home and worked on his father's farm and the father. He sees the father as a representation of God, the Father as well as the person we might strive to become for others. He asks us to see ourselves in each person in the parable. He also tells us a lot about Rembrandt and how his painting portrays them.  And shares some of the struggles in his own life.I found the book moving and helpful."
Great book
"To the unconditional love to the returning Prodigal Son, judged by the angry, judgmental older son, we find the Father loving each in a forgiving way. Great explanation of each character in today's terms and examples in our own daily walk. Much to learn and a heart that need to open further to God."
"Excellent book!  Author focuses not only on the prodigal son, but the brother and father.. Highly recommend!"
"Recommended to me as an opportunity to reflect on a number of family situations, I enjoyed this book a great deal for the way it unflinchingly looks at how each of us acts as both brothers in the story, and how we are called to be like the father in the story to our brothers and sisters."
My group reunion is studying this book with the free study guide we downloaded. The questions are very insightful. We are enjoying the read.
"Perhaps one of the most important books on redemption, spirituality and interior growth ever written."
"This book dives into the Gospel parable of the prodigal son and into Rembrandt's depiction of the parable (as the book points out, the painting is not 100% true to the Gospel and there are reasons for this).  Interesting facts of Rembrandt's ""prodigal"" life are examined, but more importantly the author examines his own actions and attitudes, which leads the reader to do the same.  This book has helped me realize we are indeed all prodigal children who can return home to a loving Father anytime we choose."
"This was a great book!  Nouwen's thoughtful and deep reflections on Christ's parable are evident in his discussion of Rembrandt's painting.  It challenged me to think differently of how to relate to God, and it spurred me to view Christ's parables from many different perspectives, not just the one intuitive or learned perspective I have developed.  Great read!"
The Return of the Prodigal Son shows Henri Nouwen at a time of extreme transition in his ministry.  His marriage of the Gospel to the Rembrandt painting is masterful.  His insights into the familial relationships in our own lives are extraordinary.  There is so much here for such a short read.
"The book, The Return of the Prodigal Son, is fantastic!  You thought you knew the whole story... :)"
"Having read almost all of his books, I found this to be the best yet. It has al the themes that made With Open Hands, Wounded Healer, and all the others so spiritually nourishing and empowering. In this one, more than in any of the others, Nouwen gets real and honest about his own wounded-ness. In writing that is at once passionate, humble and honed  to a surgical edge, he makes Rembrandt's gorgeous oil speak out its delicate message of welcome, forgiveness and renewal from the easle of his own experience of the brokenness of both brothers and their compassionate father.Excellent book, great delivery service. Very positive experience all around!"
This book makes you stop and think about what areas in your life really matter. It causes you to run towards the loving embrace of the Father and yet at the same time challenges the inward feelings of the heart as we see our selves in both of the sons. Great read. Nouwen at his humble best.
"This is the 4th or 5th copy I have purchased and have given as a gift.  In my very humble opinion, as I'm no critic of any kind, this is the best book on the story of the prodigal son.  Nouwen was a truly inspired by God when writing this book.  I pray that it will move you and bless you too.  I hope this book, never goes out of print."
A very thought provoking book!  The Return of the Prodigal Son causes the reader to re-evaluate their part in the story of life.  Do you do something because you are expected to and then resent others for their expectations?  All of us take on all three roles in this story.  This book is an easy read but you will think about it all day.
Wonderful read!!
"Just an amazing book. As struggle with my own personal issues and demons, this book has been a Godsend. It speaks to me like no other spiritual book as. It has given me new insight into my own struggles and the courage to combat my demons. Very highly recommended."
It was a gift and they enjoyed it very much.
"The actual quality of the book was terrible.  The book is new, but the pages are different widths, the binding is uneven and the bottom of every page looks chewed, as if caught in the printer."
"This is one of the most powerful treatments of the Prodigal Son parable that you will ever read! A life-changing book. Henri Nouwen, like C. S. Lewis, was a gift to us all!!"
Excellent book
Read before going to St Petersburg to see the painting in person. The book and knowing Rembrandt’s bio enhanced the experience greatly. I have to give my brother many thanks for suggesting the book.
"This powerful, moving book by noted theologian Henri Nouwen gives great insight into not only the Biblical parable but also in Rembrandt's artwork, his life, and Nouwen's life as well.  The messages will resonate in all hearts who wish to live life more fully.  I heartily recommend this book."
"Beautifully woven story around Rembrandt's painting and the Biblical account of the prodigal son, with many new perspectives and ways of looking at all the characters that I had never considered. If you're looking for new insights on this story, read this book."
"I have heard the story of the prodigal time after time, and every time I hear or read it I am overwhelmed by the Fathers love for his children. Nouwen has beautifully painted a picture of the father who is central to all stories. This book is written simply from the heart and is for everyone."
"My wife said I should read this book and she was right.  I saw the prodigal son in my life, because I have been treating her the way Henri described the prodigal asking for the inheritance from his father - that is, as if wishing he  (or my wife) was dead.  I have been doing this over and over in our married life, which has crushed her Spirit.  I am sorry.  God, help me stop leaving home and going to a far country."
"This book includes and interprets a painting of the Prodigal Son parable, as well is the scripture.  The author walks us through the points of view of the father, the prodigal son, and the loyal son.  The author stops short of over-analyzing, empowering the reader to examine the three characters as they dwell within the spirit and psyche of each of us."
this book brings the story and painting of the prodigal son to life. Many great insights and a wonderful book to reflect and pray on. Did this book with my small group and it was great for discussion
"In all of the parables this is the one I wrestle with constantly and have yet to come to a conclusion. If one places themselves in each characters position and envisions the others manners, actions, reactions, wishes and alternative outcomes this will assist you in coming to reasonable conclusions!"
This book gave me a new and profound appreciation for the Prodigal Son story. It is undoubtedly the greatest short story ever told. Nouwen is so spiritually reflective and insightful.
Seeing the alternative sides of our persona. Very informative.
"As a believer of Jesus, I have heard the story multiple times of the Prodigal Son, but never like this! This book goes into a whole new concept of the return of the prodigal son. It showed me that I can relate to the father in the story, the son that stayed with his father and the Prodigal Son. It was amazing how the author connected the 3 individuals and made it real to today. Amazing read and very simple and easy read as well. MUST READ!"
Such a wonderful book. This is a book recommended to me by my spiritual adviser when I went on retreat. I loved it so much that I purchased several copies so that I could do a book study. It is totally worth the read.
"This book lead me on a heart journey, through the eyes of the prodigal son, then the older son, and then into the heart of the Father.  So good!!!"
"Henri Nouwen relates the parable of the Return of Prodigal Son to Rembrandt's painting of the same name at the Hermitage in St. Petersburg.  He shows us how we all can relate to the Prodigal, his brother, and his father.  His insight into both the painting and scripture are powerful."
"This book is well written, fun to read, and spiritually thoughtful. A friend let me borrow his copy when I was going through a time of depression after a difficult death. I know it's hyperbole, but I tell people ""this book helped save my life."" It eloquently describes the love of GOD and our role in the story of the Prodigal Son. It's a perfect gift for spiritual friends, particularly those going through a struggle of any kind."
"It didn't hold my interest.  I found many parts boring and not at all interesting, repetitive . I would  not recommend this book."
"This is the second time I have read this deeply inspirational work. Father Nouwen shows in this, a multifaceted look at the well known parable of The Prodigal Son as never before explored."
"This was recommended by a friend and it lived up to the recommendation.  The reflections on anger, resentment, and despair connected with me.  I was challenged by this book and am glad I read it."
Life changing read
Although it was very old.  The pages were very yellowed.
"Much like Father Nouwen stumbling on the painting of the Prodigal Son during his life, I stumbled on find this book about four years ago.  Father Nouwen shares the many times in his life were he was the Prodigal son, the  older son or the forgiving father. I was able to relate to many if not most  of the personal examples shared.  My spiritual life grew from the years of  reading and rereading this book.  This book is a personal favorite to share  with friends seeking God's wisdom on the journary.  Father Nouwen rest in  peace, you have served the world well."
I chose to read this book because of a discussion my men's group on the subject and painting of the Prodigal Son. The story touches me personally because of my history with my own sons. I enjoyed the book very much I shared much of the same experiences with the a author. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to examine and strengthen one's faith.
I was sent the book with the correct cover and title. However inside the cover it is a totally different book.
This is a book that not only makes you see life differently but also live life differently. A must read book.
Nouwen authored so many fine books and this was one of his best.  I read this book years ago and continue to contemplate what Nouwen presented.  Last year I gave the book as a gift.
"This simple book recounts Henri Nouwen's life journey through the story of the Prodigal Son. Originally inspired to delve deeply into this story through the Rembrandt painting of the return of the prodigal, Nouwen interweaves scriptural reflections, personal anecdotes and art commentary into a compelling account of his life with God. In the end, Nouwen concludes that the goal for us all is to become like the father in the story. Nouwen has many excellent insights in this book to the scriptural account itself. I have seen some of these insights and reflections repeated and expanded on in other works, most notably Tim Keller's ""The Prodigal God."" For anyone interested in authentic Christian living, this book will prove helpful."
This book arrived quickly and was in great condition.  It is an excellent read into the parable and will expand one's mind into God and His relationship to man.
Specifically ordered book with deckle edges but received book with straight edge.
"It's a book I don't want to put down. The author Henri Nouwen, is one of my favorite author.There's a wonderful lesson to be learned for everyone.  Don't miss out on this book."
Wonderfully written personal story that uses Rembrandt paintings as a reference - unique and truly moving!!  This book introduces thoughts into the prodigal child situation which I had never contemplated.  Tremendously insightful and helpful.
"It was with many tears, conviction and grace that I finished Henri Nouwen's book on the parable and painting of the parable of the prodigal son.  It is only the Spirit of God that could bring such amazing insights tonJesus' parable and Rembrandt's painting of the homecoming of the wayward son.If you only read one of Nouwen's book,...read this one"
This is the most significant book Henri Nouwen ever wrote. He had an enormous influence on at least a generation of spiritual inquirers. He tells the story of how discovering Rembrandt's painting changed his own life. It is a beautiful and moving story.  Rev. Clarke Oler
"The book itself is excellent; however, the binding/cutting of the pages is terrible. The edges of the pages are all jagged and look like they were chewed."
Excellent!
"The Return of the Prodigal Son: A Story of Homecoming by Henri Nouwen is a must read for all strong Christians, struggling Christians,....and Rembrandt lovers. Fr. Nouwen has such a way with words that draws one into the Rembrandt painting and draws a person back into the folds of the Father's arms.A MUST read for ALL Christians... not just Catholics!"
Bought this book for some studies at a church camp (high school) with the week being centered on the Prodigal son. Definitely a good read and would recommend.
very good
Henri Nouwen is nearly always worth reading.  I bought this book as an aid to a Bible study lesson I was working on and found it touched my heart personally far more than I expected.  Highly recommended for ministers and laymen alike.
Good book
"In a gentle but persuasive style Henri Nouwen's compelling reflections on a very familiar story demands the reader to slow down and really ponder the implications of the storyThen it challenges the reader to apply that meaning to the reader's daily life decisions.with a new awareness. One cannot read this book quickly, every page gives a person plenty to ponder on.  A must read."
Me gustó su perspectiva y como te lleva a través del arte a entender el amor de Dios. Seguramente lo leeré de nuevo.
This is a story of Nouwen's spiritual (uncompleted) journey to acceptance of Grace. Rembrandt's Prodigal Son becomes the model for Nouwen.Good read and spiritually practical.
"Henri Nouwen gives a wonderful insight into the complex relationships of the father, the younger and the elder son. He brings Rembrandt's painting to life with his sketch of words. From an everyday as well as a spiritual perspective there was much to relate to and there were a number of take home messages. Such as, the overwhelming benevolence of the father for the shortcomings of both sons, recognising that their frailties are ours and that gratitude and trust are essential in overcoming the complacency of the privileged elder son in us also. Interestingly the long suffering father was also growing through the family difficulties with his sons."
Interesting although I found Nouwen ultimately depressed in his resignation to live the life that he thinks God has chosen for him.
a must have for anyone studying the prodigal parable!
"My chaplain gave me this after a heartfelt session. What a masterful reflection on art, sin, repentance, and God's undying love! It's Nouwen's best work."
"A wonderful study, full of insights into the characters in the parable of The Prodigal Son.  Incredibly thought provoking, and a new ""take"" on the story with which so many Christians are familiar."
Love it.
Everlasting picture and parable of life.
"This book is a beautiful analogy of the parable and our own lives.  Fr. Nouwen shares chalenges of his own conversion which are surprisingly similar to those within our own lives!  He shows how each of us chase the conditional goals of the world, and are never truly ulfilled.  Through humility he found the key to his own conversion, and he shares how we all can identify with both brothers of the parable, but how each of us are called to be the father in the parable- and the healing power of forgiveness!."
Take your time with this. There is a lot of detail and time spent on the trip to Russia and seeing the art work. But the message contains many levels of reflection and opportunity for introspection. Will revisit this work again after I finish all his other books.
This is a great book for anyone wanting to take a deeper look into their own heart and soul.  I think Nouwen does a great job of also describing the goal of our spiritual lives.
great book
"A great book that gets one in touch with one's own prodigal son, elder son and father characteristics...lots to ponder, lots to meditate on, lots to put into practice!"
This book tells so many truths about the parable and the painting and the gospel.  Easy to understand.  Highly recommended.
"The book cover was for the one I wanted but the content inside was the complete book called ""Untangled"" by Lisa Damour."
Brilliantly written book by a child of God who was a true and committed seeker of Christ.  It was very insightful and inspiring.
"This book was a gift for a religious friend of mine who was going through a special moment of challenge in his community and spiritual life. He told me that Henry Nowen helped him not only to come back home, but to appreciate the caring father and mother that we have in God"
"Nouwen has written a classic as he probes deep into the Gospel story of The Return of the Prodigal Son.  This book will appeal to all who have been touched by Jesus' words.  Through his experiences, Nouwen has developed insight from the perspective of so many hurting people whether they identify themselves with the lost younger son, the vengeful older son, or the loving and merciful father.If you have ever been touched by the healing hands of a forgiving and accepting father, you will be touched by Nouwens words as he delves deeply into the painting of the parable."
Product wasn't really in thaaat great condition (i dont know why but the pages were a bit uneven???) but overall it's not too bad!
"This is ny third purchase of this special book. It gives a perspective of our lives in the sight of the prodigal, the father, the elder son, and how we fit into the scenario. I recommend it's reading to all. Very impactful."
"A fabulous book to gain insight for your spiritual life. Nouwen's books are all good, but this is one of his finest."
The best book I ever read that presented God as such a completely loving being. So many passages related to my life and were very inspirational. A truly uplifting view of how to follow life's path.
"Henri Nouwen explores the parable of the Prodigal Son with rich insight into fathers, sons, and the things that divide us, wound us, and keep us separated from each other and from our Heavenly Father. Such profound depth in its simple clarity.  I looked at myself.  I looked at my brothers. I looked at my father. I looked at the Body of Christ.  I will read it again.  And again."
The cover of the book is The Return of the Prodigal Son by Henri J.M. Nouwan but the book itself is Untangled by Lisa Damour.
Advanced spiritual guidance worth discussion with other and long term study.  Some truly unique takes on scripture.
Most impactful book I've ever read!
"I had read the author's ""The Wounded Healer"" a number of years ago and remembered his caring and depth.  Once again, I found hope and joy  in this story of welcome, forgiveness and healing."
Bought a second copy for a friend. And gave the one I purchased to another. This book has changed the way I look at my relationship with my Father.Will have to purchase a couple more in the future for other people
"This is a lovely book, written by the late Henri Nouwen.  As with all of his books, it is powerful and encourages self-reflection in light of the gospel.  It's a ""keeper"" for re-reading.  (Try putting yourself in the role of each of the persons in Rembrandt's painting of the Prodigal Son.)"
"I will never hear the gospel of the Prodigal Son the same again.  So many deep thoughts went into this writing.  I identified with so many of the points and characterizations.  I have been the younger son, the elder son, and am also becoming the father.  Thanks for your writing Henri!  This is one of my all time favorite books."
"I've read several of Nouwen's books and they are all thought provoking.  This is one of his best.  He takes the painting by Rembrant and analyzes it in a spiritual context.  He looks at the story from the view of being the younger son, then the elder son and then the father.  It gives a lot of insight into what it means to be the one receiving (or rejecting) love and the one giving (or witholding) it."
Interesting book.
"We were created for only one purpose in this life, to give glory and praise to God through His Son Jesus Christ throughout our life. After you read this book, your will know God better, to love Him more and to serve Him with a warmer heart."
Henri Nouwen's lifelong meditation on and reflection on the parable of the prodigal son is rich and engaging. He offers a depth of interpretation that is thought provoking. This book helped me to come into the presence of the living Father who loves his sons.
I read this on Amazon Kindle and bought the paperback for my dad as a gift...it looked used.
Beautiful analysis of The Prodigal Son parable as expressed in Rembrandt's painting!
Henri Nouwen rarely disappoints. But in this book he exceeds expectations by providing multiple opportunities for spiritual growth.
Thought provoking book.
"Great book, deep but easy read. Gives you a whole new perspective. Love it!"
Insightful meditation on the parable of the prodigal son and Rembrandt's painting of it.  You can fold out the inside cover so you view the painting as you read.
Beautifully written.  Powerful
"I loved this book. My neighbor was telling me about it, so I decided to get it. I am very happy I did. It really makes you think about things in your own life."
"Wonderful book, thoughtful, intelligent, but also strongly supportive of doctrine I hold dear (God's grace.)  I bought one of these for my mom, my brother, and my daughter.  Love this book."
So relevant and applicable for today's families.  I used the story question guide provided by Henri J.M. Nouwen website it helped me to see other perspectives on this familiar theme. I enjoyed it a lot.
This is an excellent book for anyone wanting to challenge themselves to an expanded way of thinking about the meaning of this gospel reading.
"One of my favorite books!  Used it in a book study nine years ago using the downloadable study guide from Cokesbury.  I repeated the study this year (2014) but chose to use the study guide from the Henry Nouwen Society, which offers a more in-depth guide.  Nouwen offers beautiful insight to his life as the younger and older son, and finally realizing his true call as the Father.  We are invited to explore our own lives in the same way in relationship with God."
The condition on arrival was better than the described condition.
Read this for our ladies bible study group (now a monthly book club) I enjoyed this book very much and the subject matter made for a lively discussion.
"Typical of Nenri Nouwen, this is deep and insightful.  I have to read it a second time immediately, as it's a bit deep for me at times. A whole new thought.  I have a number of books by Nouwen and he never fails to deliver a life-changing message."
Excellent book by a well regarded author.  Causes one to think more in depth about what was going on in the minds and hearts of those individuals portrayed in the biblical account of the prodigal son.  Helped me have increased compassion/patience with myself spiritually!
"Excellent in every respect, except perhaps a bit longer than necessary"
"Attempting to grasp God's love and forgiveness is something we all struggle with.  Nouwen shars his own journey and ""hooks"" the reader as we find out the secret - who we really relate to.  Must reading for those who want a deeper understanding of this most wonderful parable."
Henri Nouwen's immersion in Rembrandt's Prodigal Son painting brings expertise to this book. What I really enjoyed was the way he related in very human ways to the story.
"Enjoyed the book, obtained renewed insights and direction.  Sometimes the message is repeated perhaps more often than necessary but enjoyed the book imensely"
"Nouwen walks us through the parable helping us discover ourselves in the younger son, the older son, and perhaps most importantly, in the Father. The parable calls us to come home, come in, and become spiritual mothers and fathers to an orphaned world. Powerful message."
Very good book - fitting and interesting viewpoint to consider
El libro aparentemente viene completo pero el material de las hojas muy malo y el empastado peor... todas las hojas son de un tamaño diferente
"This book spoke to depths of my soul I didn't know I had.Do yourself a favor.Buy this book,  you're welcome."
Insightful book.  Makes you think.
The pages were stuck together and poorly cut. The first page was also a misprint. Extremely disappointed.
"I really loved this book. For me, it was life changing.  It's very deep, but I highly recommend it. It speaks to everyone no matter where you are in your life or what you may be struggling with."
Just as advertised.  Shipped very quickly.
"Life changing uplifting and useful for those questioning whether they are truly loved by God. Not ""preach-y"" Author shares own journey."
"This was a great read I bought 6 copies and mailed to friends, what else can I say"
Very moving book about the author's relationship with Rembrandt's painting. I wish there was more info about the subtitles of the painting but thoroughly enjoyed the book anyway.
This book opens the eyes of the reader to the story of the Prodigal Son and to Rembrandt's life.  It is well worth the read to gain a better appreciation for the painting and family as well.
"Never thought of Rembrandt's work in this light. Author's viewpoint is quite interesting, but it may be of importance only to those who are intense about art or the Biblical story."
Another great book by Henri Nouwen.
Very informarive.  I am an admirer of Fr. Nouwen for a great period.
Fast delivery and great transaction.  Nouwen has interesting insights regarding the painting and shares it's impact on his life's journey.
WOW highly recommend this book - it will give you a new outlook on the parable of the Prodigal Son
The book is in good condition just like I expected.
"Very insightful look at the painting of the Prodigal Son with appropriate applications to real life.  Everyone can see themselves in this book in one way or another.  Easy reading, but deep and meaningful."
Excellent book!  I read it twice and passed it on to someone else.
Very inspirational. Description of the R embrandt makes you want to view it for yourself.
"This is a wonderful, insightful and thought provoking book that I would recommend to all. I read it slowly, highlighted it, reread it and underlined passages and return to it time and again. If you like Henri Nouwen, C.S. Lewis and the greats, don't miss out on this excellent book!"
Right cover...wrong book! Have never seen such a mess!
A must read for growth in faith. Perfect for classes.
This book is very touching. Using Rembrandt as a backdrop makes for a narrative that is captivating as it grips the reader and expresses the emotions and thoughts of characters in the return of the prodigal son.
"New insight into the three main characters. The father, the older son, and the ne'er do well. Before he's done, Henri Nouwen has shown you that you are all three. I highly recommend this book. It's one I will read again."
Every Christian should read this book. We all have both sons and the father in us. The author shows us how to become the father.
I had read this book several years ago and was glad to get another copy since I gave my last one away.  One of Nouwen's best.  And the service was great!
Heartening story by an awesome writer. Henri Nouwen is an excellent writer who puts you into his setting - in this case a museum with a private showing of Rembrant's Return of the Prodigal. He spends an entire day inspecting this painting from every vantage point and giving his expert commentary on meaning. I've given many of these as gifts.
"I read the book on the recommendation of a friend, and once started, I couldn't put it down.  For me it was much like looking in a mirror.  Not many spiritual readings are specifically for men, but this one is.  However, I also think women could benefit from it, especially in giving insight to mens relationships."
I know this Biblical story but the what Nouwen wrote about each individual in the story caused me to think more deeply about them.  I now want to see that painting in person!!
Full of grace.
"Right cover...another book inside!Same as others noted: ""Untangled"" was inside"
"I think you will be surprised at how human Fr. Nouwen is, he is very honest in this account of how Rembrandts last painting affected him.  This book is not doctronal at all, but a beautiful telling of a story within a story."
Highly recommended read.
Product is excellent.  Shipping was late.
"in true Nouwen style, a beautiful, deep and intimate look at how all of us have the characters in us of the Prodigal Son parable."
"Our parish women's study group read and discussed this book over a 7 week period. A parishoner brought in a large, 2' x 3', print of the painting for all of us to study up close. Thirty some women agreed this book had an impact and was very worthwhile!Elaine Wurscher"
Makes an interesting read and gives you things to ponder.  So enjoyed this book.
This book came to me in the best shape and it was so informative without being too intellectual.  Found it hard to put down--  I have lent it to a friend who loves both Rembrandt and the parable of the Prodigal son-- Keep the good books coming!
"Fantastic book, and great reading for all Christians regardless of their denomination."
I'm drawn in by the insightful depictions and applications of each character in the painting
Thought provoking.  Enriching.  Revealing.  Not a book to rush through.  Take your time.
Book didnt have and rip's or tear's. Only small pencil marks but they do not cover any words.
Good quality. Came when promised. Packaging was not excessive.
Book arrived promptly and as described.
"I enjoyed this story because it ""opened up"" the painting to me.  I never thought about the other people in the painting...only the son. Now I am able to place myself in ALL the characters parts and better understand God's compassion and love."
"Many thoughtful pages about the family relationship between father and two sons.  Granted me some insight, but author seemed very focused on the Rembrandt painting rather than scripture, e.g. focus on the ""blindness"" of the father, while the parable indicates father's ability to see the prodigal while a long way off.  The androgynous projection of the father as both father / mother based on Rembrandt's depiction of the hands seems to me another insertion into the story.The author takes great pains to identify with all three of the men in the story, and has a fine vocabulary and style which make his points understandable if not personally identifiable with the reader.  He feels each of the men -- I am not sure I can keep up."
This book has a very unique look into the story of the Prodigal Son as portrayed by Rembrandt.  It is very enlightening and it will open the readers eyes to the story of redemption in their own lives.
A different twist on the story we all know.  A must read
"This is one of the most significant, life changing books I have ever read.  I have read many other books by Henri Nouwen which are very thought provoking and have shaped my spiritual journey.  This book changed my life and set me on a path to freedom and joy in God."
good
"Nouwen reflection on the painting and the scripture bring him to the realization that he himself has lived out the role of  the repentant younger son, the resentful older son as well as the forgiving father  .  A beautiful reflection that could benefit each of us."
"This is a great tool to cover many aspects of our relationship with the Father and others, it is a tool.  The author hits many of the key relationship factors of everyone at the party.  This will be my second time teaching this lesson to our group - I can hardly wait!"
This book is a treasure. Such an unexpected source of clarification for an intense parable. Whoever happens upon this book (let) will be rewarded in its reading.
"This is a wonderful book to read, it give different in sight to the father and sons aspect and It was very hard to put down, you just wanted to read on until the end."
Nouwen presents some interesting interpretations on the Prodigal Son.  A definite read for all.  The author has a way of captivating the reader.
"While Henri Nouwen describes his own personal journey of faith, the story applies to each one of us.  His struggles are real; his revelations are awe-inspiring! The book is immensely refreshing and powerful from cover to cover."
"a deeply interesting analysis of the Scripture, THE PRODIGAL SON, ending with Nowen;s self-diognosis for his on-going ministry for our Lord.well worth your time to read to gain deepe  Biblical rinsigfhts into JESUS,S  teaching."
"I personally believe this is a great book. It helps you see the parable of ""The Prodigal Son"" from a different perspective and helps you realize that you can not only identify yourself with the prodigal son, but with the other two prominent figures in the story. Also, the book will help you see that it doesn't matter how far away from home or how many struggles you have in life, you are not so far away from your heavenly father. He will always be willing to reach for his son and bring him home."
Fabulous read!
Great book very good for Lent.
"Love this book!  Nouwen takes you into his inner life, is very open and honest, and thus, reveals the truth of God's love and our pilgrimage from prodigal son to the forgiving, loving father."
as in the parable the painting takes on something different in the individual who is seeing itI love it
"This is a classic. It gives such depth to not only the painting, the parable, but also to the insights into the human soul."
This dissection of Rembrandt’s The Return of the Prodigal Son is deeply thought-provoking.  I will read this many times through my personal journey of the prodigal to a spiritually mature adult.
Great book
Love the book. Quality isn't the greatest but the substance is soul touching.
This was exactly what we were looking for and completely met our expectations. We would order this product again.\ in the future.
This work was very insightful and meaningful to me.It is a work that I will reread again and again.I highly recommend it.
This is a nice look by Nouwen at the parable of the Prodigal son - a good reminder that the son that left and the son that stayed are both not without issues!
"Very interesting. I had heard the story, it confirmed all I heard."
"This is my favorite book of all time. I work with teens in a second year confirmation program and bought a copy for them. As of yet, none have actually made any headway but my hope is that it remains on their shelves as a permanent part of their library and that someday they will go back and flip through, discover its worth and wisdom and reference it throughout their lives as I have.I turn to this whenever I need some inspiration. It renews me the way a good mass does."
Outstanding read.  Gives one a different look on the meanings of the parable and the members of the family.
Some great new insights into the parable.
"An excellent book, a lot of excellent and powerful food for thought.  I immediately passed it on to my sister."
"I think this was a whole new way of thinking about this book.  I learn a lot about the meaning of the ""Prodigal Son."
Oh to be the always welcoming parent eager to celebrate homecoming. How our world groans for such reconciliation and resulting peace.
This is my #1 pick of all Henri Nouwen wrote for the world.  I have bought many copies of this book to give as gifts.  It has touched the hearts of every recipient.  It is a must read for everyone.
A thoughtful interpretation of and meditation on a masterpiece.
"An awesome book about one of the greatest stories ever written. Most people think the story is just about the prodigal son. But, this story is much much more than the son. Nouwen personalizes this story by looking at his own life in terms of the elder son, the prodigal son,  and the father. I have read this again and still find more about how my life captures the characters in this great biblical story."
Another great Nouwin book.
"Great story...one I try to remember every day.  Read it, it could change your outlook for the better."
Fr. Nouwen is a great apologist. This parable has marvelous lessons to teach and a wonderful message to convey. Fr. Nowen illustrates in a personal yet amazingly clear way. I highly suggest to anyone!
"This insightful book really does have something healing for everyone. As you read, you will likely see yourself at different points in your life. This book will help you forgive and accept yourself - as God forgives you and loves you."
Excellent discussion.
Book was too esoteric
This is an excellent life changing book. Presents the core truth of the Christian Gospel in a way that touches everyday attitudes and struggles. A book so personal and touching you may find that Nouwen is addressing your own unique circumstances. I certainly did. You may find yourself thinking about a new way to live. This book changed my life.
I loved this book.
Henri takes you right into the picture with a descriptive journey thru the biblical text. Delightful and inspiring. A must read for all art enthusiast.
Great spiritual read from a former retreat director. I highly recommend this book
This is a great book that can help us to critique our lives and develop a much better understanding of the person that God calls us to be. Helps to understand what it means to be made in the likeness of God. It also demonstrates how a painting can really move us if we give it a chance.
One of the most profound books I have ever read.
Parable and painting
"needed this for class, but actually a thought provoking book"
"To understand the nature of a Christian's - and that can mean everyone- inheritance, read this great book on the nature of God's fatherhood and compassion.It's a real treasure, a great serious Christmas present."
This is an awesome book that will definitely help any Christ-follower better identify with one of Jesus more well-known parables.
I received it in good order.  I enjoy reading it very much and pray that I can apply what I learn from this book in my daily life.  Pray that I can be more Christ-liked.
This is a classic by Henri Nouwen. Leading a group with this book always leads to wonderful discussions about family and faith.
excellent
I chose 5 stars because the book touched me on so many levels.  It so deepened my understanding of the parable.
Amazing insight and beautifully written. Goes to the top of my favorites!
Wonderful little book.
A very well written book.Gave much to think about from a well loved story.
"This book was enlightening and life changing.  It's a wonderful, and I believe, accurate picture of Who our heavenly Father is: I think that God is often and very unfortunately inaccurately/insufficiently portrayed by our churches and elsewhere.  The challenge is to become like our Father as Nouwen suggests.  (I tried it at my workplace)!  thank you so very much for making this book available at an affordable cost.Elizabeth Kaiser"
Excellent interpretation of a familiar parable. Thought provoking and profound.
"Excellent read, very interesting and insightful. Great book"
A must to read
Don't remember getting this???
i like henri nouwen books they really help me grow spiritual
The book looks new! Would recommend this book to everyone! Fantastic! Original! Educational re observing art by great painters like Rembrandt.
This book invites you to look at the all too familiar story of the bible with fresh eyes and glimpse the story from the different characters portrayed....time well spent.
What an amazing book. Challenges you to your core.
More than met my expectations
This is one of the best works Henri Nouwen wrote. Great for Lent.
One of the best books I have read
Really moving book that brings a whole new light to the parable of the prodigal son.  Great book the wrecks the way you see yourself as a Christian.
"Wonderful experience. I really recommend this. I love Rembrandt even more now, and I appreciate the Father more! Amazing."
Spiritual journey back home not only for the prodigal son but an insightful look at the self-righteous older brother. Short read packed with many tools for the spiritual journey.
"I have read and reread this book and find it tremendously helpful in my personal journey. I have also purchased and given away numrous copies to friends and family. It is wonderful combination of art, theology and psychology. Whether we are struggling with a sense of failure or pride, this book would benefit every reader."
great book!
This book is wonderful and I highly recommend it.  The author's thoughts from his own experiences were very helpful to me.
One of the most profound books I've read.  I bought three copies to give to friends.  Will order more of his books for future reading and inspiration.
Herni Nouwen does a great job on decribing the parable of the prodigal son.  A great book to read for someone who has had a friend or family member who has gone astray.
"Thoughtful, raw, revealing and infinitely kind - just as Nouwen always is. I treasure this book and will return to it often."
This was a great insight into the parable of the Prodigal Son
I am reading The Return of the Prodical Son with a book discussion group from my church. It is really a wonderful book! It inspires quality discussions. Henri Nouwen is a masterful writer.
Excellent work!
Wonderful! Thought provoking!  Compels one to look at this far beyond the penitent son.  Challenges one to search for Jesus' message from all perspectives.
"Solid reflections. Will get under your skin, as good authorship does"
Worked for me
love this insightful read
"Henri J.M. Nouwen, once again brings the Word and his personal experience into a wonderful weave.  There are study guides on the web."
"A must read on both a secular and spiritual level. A ""self help"" book that will change one's attitude on how to approach every relationship from now on."
"Nouwen, the author takes us on a personal and introspective journey as he wrestles with Rembrandt's masterpiece portraying ""The Prodigal Son.""  Very thought-provoking and challenging as the reader follows his thoughts and insights about each character in the painting and how he resembles or responds to them.  This would be great for a group study."
This is a wonderful book written about the many characters in the painting of the Return of the Prodigal Son.  Many lessons about forgiveness.
This is one of the best books I have ever read and I read a lot!!  Brilliant work!!  Can't wait to read other works by this author.
"Starts out slow, but if you can last through the first 40 pages it's very good."
I love reading anything by Nouwen.  He is a person who takes God seriously and loves him immensely as well.  A thought provoking read.
Perfect product
The book was referred to me by my pastor. I knew the story of the Prodigal Son but the book brought  up some new perspectives. I love it!!
This is a superb commentary on a wonderful painting and the author's incisive observations on the subject of forgiveness and reconciliation by our Creator God through His unique intervention in human affairs by assuming human form in the person Jesus Christis described with sensitivity and compassion. How much needed in this unhappy and confused world.
Awesome book--I intend to read it again soon!
This is Henri Nouwen at his very best.  I have read it over and over and shared it with many friends.  A must read for all of us on our journey.
"It confirmed my own child-father evolution and call to stay at home with the authority of compassion.  There is less to learn and more to live, to light, and to love."
"My thoughts on the parable of the prodigal son have been deepened by this book. It is very interesting, and I found it a pleasure to read."
Great book.  I have recommended  it to several friends.
Great book.
Life changing book. New insights to the story I have heard preached so many times.
"Henri Nouwen shares a new perspective on the story of the Prodigal Son. He reflects on each of the main characters in the story i.e. the younger Son, the older Son and the Father. Each of us can identify with the younger and older Son; and as we grow in our faith life  hopefully we can become the Father to others."
Thanks
We used this book for a study and it was amazing how this painting brought so much out about Christ
A thoughtful look at what the Prodigal Son is really telling us.
Brings out a depth of meaning from the old Bible story.
It is a great book!
This book reveals a lot about ourselves in ways we may not have thought of. It is also very humbling in the light of God's all-encompassing love to still be accepted in spite of anything we could possibly do to leave Him and hurt Him. There can be no greater Father than He.
Three different perspectives on the return of the prodigal son.
Dynamite!  Thanks Henri
lifechanging
I recommend this title to anyone who is interested in a deeper view of God's grace and toldwith a perspective seldom heard in sermons.
"Yes, it was exactly as I thought it would be"
"These are the words that I'm left with as I finished this book.  There is no loss, no failure, no suffering that is not converted into life by the immense grace of the father."
Had a study on this book and painting . Excellent.....Learn so much
Great book and a definite must read. I enjoyed the comparison of the parable with Rembrandt's painting. It was quite insightful and very compelling to start heading back home.
Everything
Great Book!
Great book to learn of the forgiveness God has waiting for you
Reading it for the second time!! Ever better then the first read!! I consider this book a life game changer!!
"Devotional, insightful, thorough, readable.  A great read for thoughtful reflecting beforw God."
"Spiritually enlightening and uplifting.  I'm sure that when I read it again, I will get even more out of  it."
Love this book; helps greatly to meditate!!
Highly recommend. Our pastor recommended we read this to go along with a series he was doing and as usual he was right. I highlighted numerous passages in my kindle and read some of them to my bible study group.
I have enjoyed the journey through a parable I know well through new eyes. Thank you for opening my eyes.
"This is a wonderful book about the Return of the Prodigal Son written by Mr. Nouwen.  A book of hope, a story of true redemption, how ""our Father"" can look at us at all times with mercy and love."
Best book.  Terrific service!
Poosibly my favorite book - I've read several times over the last 50 years and it reminds me who I really am - the Beloved of my Father.
"This definitely was a well chosen setwork book. An easy read, as well as being very topical, touching. Thanks."
Wonderful book I lived and learned a lot.
Great purchase!
"So moving, informative and meaningful. I love Nouwen's works, and now this is my favorite parable."
Very thought provoking and very deep. Could only digest a chapter at a time. But very insightful.
Henri Nowen has very good insight into both the painting and the parable.Reading this short book was time very well spent. (Especially the second time through.)
This is a beautiful book. I am so glad I got it
Re-read many times. Deeply meaningful and encouraging.
Phenomenal.
"A beautiful journey around a magnificent art piece, inspiring and utterly enchanting."
Thought provoking and heart rending.
great book great condition
"VERY GOOD, WE ARE ALL ..."
This is a great read as Henri Nouwen analyzes Jesus' story of the prodigal son.  He looks at the characters in the story using Rembrant's painting of the homecoming.  Mr. Nouwen provides incredible insights that I had failed to see just in reading the Biblical story.  It is well worth reading again and again.
I love this book so much.. How Henri describe are so wow..
Very good !
"Great book, a personal journey that we all travel. The story pf the prodigal son is one of the most healing parables for all of us that has traveled that road. God is greater than any of our sin, love is greater than any evil."
"The description of the condition of this used book seemed accurate, and we thought it a good value."
One of my favorite books ever. I keep rereading several parts
"A magnificent view of a famous painting which goes in depth of the story and finds meaning where the title alone leaves us;I was so impressed that I bought a 'poster copy' of the painting, framed it and used it for a Bible Study---recommended for those who want more than just the surface material."
"This book is a wonderful, personal look into the story of the Prodigal Son as it relates to every human and Father God. It cuts to the core questions of our existence as a  human race and the longings we have for acceptance and purpose."
Great Gift Idea

   This is a fantastic Bible. It is priced correctly at $60 and anything less than that would be a steal. The Bible is incredibly well put together, and appears to be quite sturdy.The other point of this Bible is how it ties into the filament Bible app. To that end it does so with aplomb. The app on your phone or tablet is dropdead easy to use and filled with insightful information about whatever page you were looking at in this Bible. It is, in effect, a study Bible without the hassle of carrying around the weight of a study Bible.I cannot recommend this Bible enough. It’s fantastic. Pick one up."
"I like this Bible so much that I bought 4 more to give to family members. I told a friend about how clear the messages were and the ease of understanding and she bought 2. I highly recommend this NLT (New Living Translation) Bible. Even if you have an older Bible, this is a good book to read for clarification. I have my pastor to thank for suggesting it to me."
"It’s a real beauty! I love the nice teal color, the look and feel of it, the fact that it’s linked to the Filament APP on my Phone, and the fact that this one is indexed which helps to find the books faster.  The font is perfect too not too big or small. The weight of The Bible is great too, not too heavy or light. I’ve been a KJV girl for over 30 years. Now my favorite is The Passion Translation first, and the New Living Translation second. I do enjoy all the versions during study though. I would encourage anyone to get this fine edition. I’ll cherish it always as the entrance of THY WORD gives light because THY WORD IS TRUTH!"
"Ten stars! Light weight, love the filament-enables references! The Bible Project’s videos are superb, so helpful for any age or level of experience/understanding. Great for Sunday School or Activities Directors—ready-made video summaries of Books of the Bible. Commentaries and articles! Lays flat for easy study, gorgeous! Thank you Tyndale & Amazon!!! I am buying these for a nursing home staff and for friends!"
Love this version and this style. It looks great and the way it is written makes it very easy to understand! Love the NLT version
"This is a great value for the price.  Compact, readable, genuine leather cover.  The thin pages lend themselves to ghosting, and nearly every other page was stuck together.  It was a time consuming process to free the pages, but once done it was fine.  There are better translations for detailed study, but this is a great option if you're looking for an easier read."
I love the Bible and I love the version.  I feel like am reading the Bible for the first time.  It's has turned into my primary Bible after using the NKJV for decades.  The binding seems well done and it seems like it will stand the test of time.  Print could be a little larger but that means a thicker book so it's a decent compromise.
Wish I could say 4.5 stars. Not exactly what I was expecting but pretty close. Nice and this unlike most Bibles I own. The pages are a bit thin but ok. The print is a decent size. Seems well made. The app is interesting. When you factor in the low price it's not bad.
this Bible is lovely and for my girls who love glitter the pages has like a sparkly reflection (oh maybe it’s just me lol). I truly love this Bible and I haven’t  even read it yet.
"The NLT has been my favorite version for many years. I love it so much that when my current one showed signs of wear I had it recovered. Recently I heard the fascinating story behind its development in an interview with John Oswalt, and I appreciate it even more. This particular version includes the filament which is a nice touch. There is a lot of attention to detail that makes this a great daily use Bible. Love the size, paper quality, and leather."
I like this bible because is not bulky and is easy to carry around. Also the app is great and easy to use. The quality is alright. Let's see how long is last compare to other bibles.
This Bible is GORGEOUS and feels SO nice! I'm not sure if the comentary in the app is very helpful but I do like not having a comentary bible that is several inches thick and weights several pounds!
"It’s a nice Bible, but it looks like the pages were damaged during printing or binding. The cover is fine, but the pages are bent and wrinkled throughout the entire Bible. This Bible shouldn’t have been sold this way. I’m very disappointed."
"I'm very happy with this Tyndale Bible.  It arrived well packaged, timely, and in perfect condition.  I'm so glad to have genuine leather, and the other great features of this Bible:  thinline, thumb indexed, lay-flat binding, and cross-references I've never seen before.  No more bonded leather for me!"
The gift I've been waiting for
"I love everything about this bible. The flexible leather like cover, the lay flat binding and the easy to read print. I recommend this bible"
I bought this for a friend and she absolutely loves this bible.
Great unisex gift. Good font. Pages not too thin. Red letter.
Bought this for a gift and they loved it
Beautiful Bible and so light weight. I love it!
Well made
"Bought this a gift for someone, they loved it.  The color and design is beautiful and the text is easy to read."
"I’m returning this item. I was excited about the apps and digital uses, but the paper is too thin for him to highlight or write.  It’s so thin he’s worried the pages are going to rip just from turning"
This Bible was a gift for my daughter. Bible is easy to read and the cover looked better than expected.
"Wow this bible is absolutely incredible, Thank you Jesus for the word!"
Ordered for my daughter. She loves it. Great condition. Soft cover. Very pretty color.  Print is small for “older eyes” but she has no problem!
Love It Compact Size!👍😊❤
The Bible was exactly as described and was delivered as expected.  Very satisfied with this order.
"High quality, modern, and intuitive!"
Bible came with yellow paint on the blue cover and package was covered in sand. So was the Bible.Still a Bible though.
So pleased with this Bible!  I highly recommend it
Print quite small but app seems wonderful.
Best all around gift Bible to have on you or in your car to give at any moment.
All I expected and more.
I bought this for myself and also gifted someone with it. I love it.
"I love my bible , super cute but simple . Very easy to understand version of the bible . Love !"
Its soooo cute.
I love this! It’s exactly what I was looking for.
Type face too small
Great quality!!!!!!!!Easy to read!!!!!!!!
"I love the NLT translation. I read from quite a few other translations, but I am always drawn back to the NLT because of how readable it is, and it is the first translation that I used to read through the whole Bible. My church also uses the NLT. So, I was excited to see that Tyndale was coming out with another format of the Filament Bible: a thinline reference.These Bibles are perfect to carry in your purse and bag for church, or wherever else you may be headed. It is a little bigger than my hand (I have fairly small hands), and contains the NLT text in a 9 point font. If that size font is too small for you, they also have a large print thinline that just came out as well (10 point font), and a giant print edition that is coming out in January (12 point font). I have the soft leather-look teal edition, and it has a nice design on the front, with the words “Holy Bible” under the design. The spine has “Tyndale”, “Holy Bible”, and “NLT on it near the top. It has a paste down liner, with the same swirl design that you see on the cover. It is Smyth-sewn, so it lays flat when you are reading it. It has one single sided satin ribbon in a matching teal/green color. The pages have really shiny silver gilding. The text is in a double column format, and it is a red letter text.What I really like about this Bible is that it is a non-cluttered reading experience. There is an introduction to the Filament app and NLT translation, and a few fun study aides in the back, but otherwise it is just the text. That makes it the perfect Bible for reading, or following along with during a sermon. But, if you want to dig deeper, you have that option because of the Filament app. You just have to grab your phone or other device, scan the page number with the little Filament symbol beside it, and you have study notes at your fingertips! The Filament app is free to download, and you get access to 25,000 study notes, over 350 videos, 40+ maps, more than 400 profiles and articles, 1,500 devotionals, and even a library of worship music. It is everything that you could ever want in a study Bible, plus some! I especially love the visuals that are included, and the videos from the Bible Project. The resources in the back of the Bible include a verse finder, and a visual overview of the Bible (includes maps and other graphics).Whether you are a new Christian or a seasoned believer, the Filament Bible would make an excellent addition to your library. It is portable, offers an uncluttered reading experience, and there is a wealth of information available at your fingertips with the Filament app. If you love the NLT, and want a fresh Bible reading experience, pick up a thinline or large print thinline Filament Bible, or hold out until January for the giant print version. It will add depth and meaning to your Bible study time!I received a copy of this Bible from Tyndale, in return for an honest review. All opinions are my own."
"I was on the launch team for the Filament Bible when it first came out. It was only offered in 3 colored bindings, one version (NLT) and one font size. They have come a long way!  First of all, I love the concept of this Bible. Being able to have a smaller Bible to carry and having an app that can scan the top of each page to get study material, devotionals, maps, and so much more is a great idea! I found the app to be very user friendly. It is something anyone can use considering we all carry phones or something technology-related with us at all times.  Second, are the versions. I received the NLT, but they also carry the KJV. This will definitely appeal to some people who only read that version.  Third, there are two resources included in the back of this Bible. There is a verse finder section, which includes numerous verses for specific topics. The feature that I love is the Virtual Overview of the Bible. People who are visual learners, like myself, will love the 14 different events in this section. It is beautifully done and it helps to put things in perspective.  The font size for the Bible is 8.75, which still makes it still very easy to read. There are only 2 cons to this Bible. One thing is that the pages are super thin. It can make it difficult to highlight or underline. The other con is that there is next to no space to write notes. There are translation notes and cross references at the bottom of the 2nd column, so if you like writing in your Bible, you may not like the lack of space.  Overall, I love this Bible. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to dive deep into Scripture. Especially people who are visual learners and love the technology side. It makes having all of this extra material easier to handle without having to carry a 5 pound Study Bible everywhere. I received a copy of the new Large print Bible from Tyndale in exchange for my honest review."
"First off, I'm going to keep this short and sweet. Not going to drag out the review.At first glance when I received my nlt bible by tyndale, the quality looked amazing.I'm gives you an amazing description about the bible before you start reading it.Would I recommend this bible? Absolutely.The nlt is written in today's language and super easy to read. I'm barely on Genesis and I'm loving how easy it is to read.If you're looking for a easy to read bible, I HIGHLY recommend this nlt bible. The wording is the perfect size and it's color coded so what is written in red is the words of Jesus. So amazing."
"Solid piece of literature. It was difficult to read through at times, but I got through it. The chapter names repeated themselves quite a bit. There were like 3 chapters of “John’s”. My favorite character was definitely Jesus. 10 out of 10 protagonist. I would have loved to have met him! The second part of the book was good until Judas came along. That part was a real heart breaker. The final chapter was very climatic. Overall a really good book. It is definitely not a light read."
"Awesome bible, really good quality leather too. Enjoy reading without the other writing underneath however, it’s available on the app so one gets the best of both worlds!!!"
We are not to add to or take away from. Are these scriptures in this Bible?
I found creases in the book of Jeremiah. Very disheartening.
"The Bible is great. The Filament app is great too (although there are theological concerns with The Bible Project and its rejection of the biblical view of penal substitution, which affects the nature of the atonement). But, I just thought that I should point out that this is not a Large Print Bible, but a standard print Bible. My wife has just received the Large Print version in a different colour, and this is definitely not the same size of Bible (3cm shorter) nor size of print on the page. Yet, personally, I prefer this size after all., even though I was expecting a Large Print version."
The word of god is always perfect.. very beautiful Bible!
"Sarah Young has a way of  elaborating  bible versus and wording it it into a format that speaks to us in modern world, it truly hits home for a deep understanding of the Lords word.I had an amazing experience that I want to share.I was experiencing a very stressful situation that was filling me with an incredible amount of anxiety and worry and of course wanting to figure out how to handle the situation immediately.I lived in this anxiety for a few days then I just sat down quietly and put this book in my hand, and usually I will just let the book fall open to a page BUT this time and instead of just trying to flip it open and see what page opens I boldly prayed to God to tell me a specific page number and within a few seconds all of a sudden I had number 132 in my head, I was shocked to literally be able to hear that number in my head at the moment I asked for God to give me a page number. I was apprehensive as to whether not I just thought of that number on my own so I open to a different page and it definitely did not speak to me so I thought well maybe that was the right number and when I opened the book up to that page 132, I was blown away, every word spoke so specifically regarding my situation, God spoke so perfectly, clearly and poignantly to me, it completely changed my way of thinking regarding my situation.Thank you God for giving Sarah the gift of elaborating on your word."
"Change is normally uncomfortable, especially when you don't understand it or anticipate it.  This Companion helps you stay close to Your Guide& Director of that change taking place within you & about you, to the extent you can take Joy as you feel the change occurring.True Trust is not an everyday commodity in this world. Your Guide is Truth Himself.So staying close is crucial.Sarah helps us do that."
"Her books are a must to keep your spirituality going between church services. Reading the Bible with it being worded as from one Bible author to the people in the Bible just didn’t do it for me. I would just keep getting discouraged, because the feeling didn’t last from service to service. It got to the point that I know longer trusted that the feeling would last.She writes as if God is speaking directly to you. The scripture is given, so what she says is based on God’s word.When you finish it, buy a different one and keep reading them over and over. Keep it where it is a habit to read several times a day. For me it is in the bathroom when I am a captive audience."
"I enjoy these books and struggle with arthritis in my hands and fingers so holding a smaller book usually ends up hurting me. I wanted the larger, soft version of the book that had the actual scripture quoted in there instead of just the book, chapter and verse numbers listed. I am not lazy but it makes it difficult when you have to juggle 2 books to read and understand all that the author wants you to glean from their writings."
"As other devotional books by Sarah Young, this edition is as inspiring, educational, and in this case, about hope.  Written while Mrs.Young was very ill from Lyme's Disease, it features daily devotionals rendered from Bible Scripture and Jesus' words to the reader in modern vernacular. I enjoy reading from this each day, and it is now a part of my ""Jesus Calling"" collection."
"This particular Sarah Young book is my favorite.  Not only does she speak through what she knows of the bible (which is a lot), but on the opposite page she includes a few bible references noting the book and verse, plus she often includes a short saying by someone famous, or not famous."
"I realized that we should be seeking the Lord in his word, the Bible, instead of trying to hear his voice through others. We are told to test the spirits to discern who is actually speaking. I know a lot of people who purchase these books (including myself and now regretting) are looking to hear from God maybe the easy way. But sometimes the easy way isn't the right way. Who knows where this woman got this word from. I want to be sure that any word I get is from the Lord and him alone from me building a relationship with him"
"I am going through a really hard time health wise right now and this book helps me feel the Lord's strength. I read it everyday before I get out of bed--and every night before I go to bed! I have also given this as gifts for people going through a hard time. The scripture is written out already in book, so it makes it easier to read! LOVE IT!"
"Another great book by Sarah Young.  As I'm going through my own family tragedy, both this book and her Jesus Calling have been great in reminding me of God's promises, of His unfailing love and that He is and always will be bigger than anything life can throw at me."
"I was looking for a book that I could read every single day before work.  I was looking for one that could inspire me even if I only read it for 5 minutes each day.  WOW!!!  I really got my money's worth with this book!!!  Every single page is inspiring...  So uplifting... Thought provoking... The author makes the scripture so easy to understand and appreciate, then quotes the verses where her inspiration came from.  Recommended it to a friend who loves it just as much!  Thank you for such a GREAT read!"
"This book is filled with uplifting devotions but one minor thing I wasn't too fond of was there are no dated pages and some pages are a large print scripture which isn't bad but just not quite what I was expecting after reading her first book in its entirely.I still very much enjoyed this, but not quite as much as I enjoy the first.I do plan on purchasing her others."
"absolutely love this little book! And its very well made. A neighbor gave me mine. I do read several devotionals each morning, but I read this one right before bed. I love the way its written. As if He was speaking directly to me. He speaks to me, then what He says is quoted with scripture verses. I've ordered several for people in my life. And you can't beat the price. The books showed up in great condition."
"Sara Young has such an amazing gift. This book is written in the similar style of her Jesus Calling book, spoken from Gods perspective drawn from scripture. After the amazing daily reading, she lists the scripture that supports the writing. I don't know how she has done it again, but every time I read it, it is EXACTLY what I need to hear. This was written in a time when she was struggling in her life and it very much focuses on hope. I recommend this book for anyone who is going through a hard time. When I am feeling too down to read it is when I need it most. If I could give this book a million stars I would!!"
"This Book is the best book for those in pain and those that want to start reading the BiBle ! I Love love this book, it was like someone was answering every question I would think about , if you have been falsely accused or seeking to start reading the Bible I recommend this book.  I bought one for my sister as well  I already had one  This book is worth way more then the money they ask for it.  Thank you from all my heart for this book"
"I have read JESUS CALLING by Sarah Young several times and decided to read JESUS TODAY.  Both books are outstanding as daily devotional readings, second only to the BIBLE.  Pass along copies of these two books to your friends and loved ones. They can have a positive impact on your life and theirs."
"I read this book every day.  The amazing thing is - you just need to read one page a day and you can ""feel"" a difference in your life!  Sarah Young's books are the best!!"
"Sarah Young always  writes thoughtful and reassuring messages that speak directly to me. After reading “Jesus Calling” several years as a daily devotional, I bought this book to have a change. Although it is every bit as powerful as her other books, it has only a 150 devotionals so I use it to supplement rather than replace the original book."
"I chose the five star rating for several reasons.  The book is leather bound, quality pages, easy to read, and included Bible scripture to reinforce every entry, and it speaks to the reader as if Jesus were right there speaking and offering love, understanding, encouragement, reassurance, and 'the way' to eternal life in Heaven. The author tells of her own difficult circumstances and howshe found hope and refuge in her faith in the Savior, Jesus. I would recommend this book to every Christian, as well as any onewho wants to learn about our only hope to be with him in the next life, in Heaven. The book offers inspiration, motivation, direction,encouragement, and instructions for experiencing the very precious Presence of Jesus."
"I later found out the author got inspiration from someone they shouldn't have. (I'll leave it at that.) I was always amazed at how the author managed to make you think the Lord was speaking directly to you, and then I found out how she accomplished that - something like channeling. Oof...stay away from this series."
Wonderful journal for daily pondering. Very encouraging and gives the daily message that helps tighten our relationship with Jesus. This is definitely a 5!  Shipped in a respectable amount of time with arrival when expected. A great gift that is very supporting to one who needs daily pickup.
I found this awesome writer from a friend who has a daily devotional book which is really good but I also found this book it is rally great if you need hope or just to get closer to God or  anything please go check out ALL of Sarah Young books you won't regret it hope. this helps 💖💖
Just purchased this book a little over a month ago and it is wonderful.  I also have Jesus Calling by Sarah Young.  All of her books are more than worth the read.  These books sure have helped me through some rough times.  I was introduced to them about 5 years ago and so very thankful for that.  Cannot say enough GOOD about these books.  They are now part of my life.  (everyday)
"How would you like to communicate and fellowship with Jesus today and every day?  This book is one of the most wonderful objects to accomplish just that;  a Relationship with Your Creator.  I start each and every day now with Jesus Today as well as Jesus Calling by Sarah Young.  Best purchase I've made.  I highly recommend you buy these books.  Buy them in the leather format so you can keep them forever because that's how long you will be using them,  if your anything like me."
Purchased this book for a friend who is going through some very rough times.  After i gave it to her she found 10 one dollar bills inside the cardboard cover. What's exciting is....i did not put them there!  Had just wrapped it up and gave to her.  And for the sake of a review this book has given her a lot to think about and focus on her faith vs her life
"I chose  to read this book during a particularly stressful time  in my life.  My sister  read  many  of the  books written by Sarah Young, and strongly suggested I  start with Jesus Today. I finished  this morning and can  hardly wait to begin the next book.  I read this on  my Kindle, so it's easy  to pick up and read  anywhere."
"After reading Sarah Young's Jesus Calling book the second time around,I had to order Jesus Today. Now I am reading both of them.They are the two books that I take with me even when I travel as I can't start the day without reading her message for the day. Many mornings they bring tears to me eyes as it seemed like she knew what I needed on that particular day. Words are hard to express how these books touch my heart and soul. After losing my husband of 50 years to stage four lung cancer,I need HIS words to fill the darkness that suddenly appears and these books fulfill that need every morning. I know that God is holding my hand every day and Sarah Young adds that special message to help start my day. She continues to bring His message to me in her down to earth style and then also gives me the bible readings that correspond to her message so I can read further if needed. I'm a certified Lay Leader of Prayer in my church and will share some of her messages when I hold a service and will recommend her book to all. Thank you,Sarah Young."
I do not like this book though I am more a “hit me hard with the truth” kinda person. It’s a peaceful and calming way to start your morning.
"I love this little book. It's beautiful to look at. just the right size to hold and feels really nice in my hands. It is beautifully designed and even has an attractive ribbon book mark. That's just the outside. The inside is full of love, wisdom and inspiration. This author feels like a good friend and I've never met her. I have ""walked with Jesus"" for most of my life and know him intimately but this little book took me to the next level of understanding. I highly recommend this book to anyone who needs comforting and specific ideas on how to get through each day stronger and wiser."
This book is good and came at a pretty quick time. My only gripe is I wish the devotionals filled one year like this authors other devotionals. The devotionals will only last 1/2 year but that’s not the sellers problem it’s the authors problem. Good inspirational words.
"I've sent these books to friends who have been going through some tough times and I always get a great response.  I have my own and find the hopeful verses she selected, very uplifting."
I read this book for daily devotion because I read her first devotional book.  The author didn't disappoint with the second book.  Great author and I would recommend her books to anyone needing guidance with a daily talk with Jesus.
"This book will cheer you up and make you appreciate everything you have.  There isn't a page that you will read that you won't find any hope.  When you are feeling low, reading this book and even read it daily and it will change your life.  Sarah Young has a few others, Jesus Calling and 40 Days with Jesus that are also encouraging.  Your walk with Jesus will change your life forever!  She has been there and knows what it is to feel helpless.  Order one of these books today and you will never regret buying them.  By two and give one to a friend.  They will be your friend forever!!!"
"I love Sarah Young books. This is not a devotional, writings of hope, love, etc. What I also love about the book is that it references the biblical passages, where the verses are written out.A MUST HAVE!!"
Nothing to dislike.  We read it every morning and are so inspired to draw closer to Jesus.  We have read most of Sarah Youngs devotionals and always impressed by her writing with morning devotional.
"Awesome, uplifting book! Love Sarah Young! This book has many truths and affirmations to assist in spiritual growth, spiritual health and well being. It's also beautifully covered and designed. It's small enough to bring with you anywhere :-)"
I cannot start a day with out reading a devotion from this book. I plan on rereading it and am sure it will up lift me once again
"This devotional book is for you or someone you love, if either of you is going through some particularly rough patches. Life is not always easy to deal with, but while Sarah Young was going through some really tough, painful challenges, God gave her assurance and encouragement from His Word and His Spirit. I am so glad she wrote it down! Thank you, Sarah, for teaching and encouraging us how to better cling to Him, the One who has always loved us more than life itself.  Because of the great purchase price from Amazon, I was able to get one book for myself, as well as give several away as gifts."
This devotional was just what I was looking for. To be honest im not much of a morning person and do most of my reading at night So I needed something I could read with the scriptures already there. The way this is set up is sarah young puts what God would say to you on the left page (As if he was telling you himself) with supporting scripture on the right page. Very interesting and refreshing. Would recommend this to anyone specifically if you don't have much time first thing in the morning. you can read it and dwell on Gods goodness all day!
Reading these messages each morning has helped me to enhance my love and faith in Jesus Christ ore Lord and Savior.
"Very special version of a wonderfully written meditation book.  Each daily passage is positive, comforting, and uplifting.  Especially good for anyone suffering."
I am so glad that I was introduced to this special and spiritual writer--- Our Father has a way of ordering our Steps and it was no difference when He led me to purchase these books and are eye openers and Spiritual fulfillment when you take time out to draw nearer to Our Lord and Savior-- He is Living in us and thank God He has proven Himself our Shepherd when He open our eyes and understanding with His faithfulness and love towards Us.  He Has Chosen Us and writers like Sarah to feed His sheep. God bless- Grace and peace.
"I love reading this book along with ""Jesus Calling""and ""God Calling"" every morning before I start my day. My day just flows after that. Meditate on the words and you will be filled with a sense  of well-being. It rubs off on others."
I received one of Sarah Youngs other daily devotional and enjoyed it so much that I purchased this one for a friend.  She loves it.  If you are looking for daily inspiration you will love her devotionals.  They will bring you closer to our Lord and Savior.
Have ordered before and love the book!!! Ordered again for gifts  and the price tag on front 😬and doesn’t come OFF !!!!  payed more for books than price 😬😬 please check into this amazon !!!!!
"Jesus Today offers practical ways to connect with Jesus at all times, especially when in turmoil, ex: Jesus help me, fill me withYour peace, show me Your way. Christ suggests asking the Holy Spirit to think through you, live through you, and love throughyou. Like the three other Sarah Young books, Jesus is totally available, ready and willing to come to our aid, and saysoutright that He is also blessed when we seek Him first, and make Him first in our lives. Jesus Today is a genuine guide andhelpmate to live a life guided by Jesus!"
"If you EVER wondered if God is truly as FAITHFUL and LOVING and MERCIFUL and DOTING and GENTLE and KIND and PRESENT...as anyone HOPES...This book will CONFIRM those realities and so much more!!!Written at an EXTREMEMLY L-O-W time in Sarah Young's life, she shares HER EXPERIENCE with God, through Jesus Christ and His Holy Spirit, in ways that i, for many years, secretly wished i could experience.  NOW I DO!!!Don't hesitate to invest in all 3 of Sarah Young's books:  1) JESUS CALLING 2) JESUS  TODAY3) JESUS LIVES."
"I have read this series before and I bought this for my newly saved daughter. She likes it, she reads and studies it a lot."
Bought as a gift for a friend.I have a copy and find Sarah Young's devotionals very inspiring and helpful. Are well written. Provide much introspective thought.
I purchased this as a gift and the person was very pleased.
"I picked this devotional because it was written during struggle, which is the most realistic writing for me, I most relate to writing that address human , and the solution we have that is documented in the Bible. Sarah pulls this out of the word in a very unique way. I have 7 years of sobriety and and have found Jesus Calling, and Jesus Today to be very useful devotionals during this time in my journey."
The reflections don't seem as deep and compelling as those in Jesus Calling.
Great devotional book.  Have been using it for years.  My husband got it for me.  Hits me right in the heart.  Excellent passages to meditate on.
"I have purchased six of these precious books for loved ones and purchased a copy for my Kindle. Can't say enough about this little book.  I read it every night before I go to sleep or when I need a pick me up during the day.  Must admit, I was a bit skeptical when I discovered she wrote the book to seem as though Jesus is speaking directly to you.  But, it is ALL followed by scripture and it's difficult to explain, but it is so comforting and assuring.  It is a treasure!"
"Inspiring, encouraging, spot on for each day. Just what I need. I start and end each day with this. A blessing."
"My wife LOVES this book as well as the Jesus Calling book.  I  have a BA in Theology and I am impressed at the approach of these devotional books...I have read much of the Jesus Calling book and it gave me a few new perspectives about our Christian life.  We highly recommend both books!  The Deluxe Edition is a nice touch, especially if you are giving this as a gift."
Great go-to when you feel you cant take another minute if the day!
This book is written as if Jesus is speaking directly to you I absolutely love this book
"Sarah Young's, Jesus Calling, Jesus Lives and Jesus Today, have ministered to me in ways that are miraculous. My life had been on a downward spiral and I felt alone and helpless. I now have Peace in my heart and no longer fear tomorrow. God speaks through Sarah Young, directly to your heart addressing all your needs. She even provides the Scriptural references.  I have purchased several of these books for Christmas gifts. Best devotional I have ever read! I have been richly Blessed!"
Live it I gave 3 of them this one is so calming and inspiring
"I like that it does not only give where the scripture is found to support reading for the day, but it also quotes three scriptures that support reading for the day."
I liked the reflections that are written as if Jesus himself is speaking directly to me. Then it is backed up by the passage and verse from the Bible that prompted the message from God. I am enjoying this book and savoring it by reading one passage each morning. I am presently half-way through and already I am dreading when there are no more new pages to read. I guess i will have to start reading it all over again when that happens. I might get something new from re-reading it.
"I have several of sarah’s Books and love them all!!!  I have given them for gifts also. This devotional is great for anyone who is experiencing a difficult season in their life. So encouraging and strengthening. As with all of Sarah’s devotional, Make sure you get the versions that have the corresponding scripture verses actually printed with each devotion (not just listed). God is moving  through His servant Sarah’s writings to deepen  relationships with our blessed Savior!"
"And, it was!Sarah's written inspiration from the Lord reminds me well of our promised hope from God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit in these uncertain times.Once again, the Lord has used her works to play a significant role in drawing me nearer to Him; to enjoy His Presence more, to be more grateful and thankful. She continues to be available to Him and He has used her for His good purposes. Thank the Lord for that!Sarah has been instrumental in the lives of million of people as she has also been an instrument He has used for His work in our lives."
"I'm about 69 devotions into this so (69 days or so?) and I've been enjoying this quite a bit. I would buy a hard copy for my loved ones because this is full of encouragement that totally sounds like what Jesus would say. Some of it is encouraging, some of it gently chastises but all of it is loving and reminds me that God is always with me not just through times of joy and blessing but through times of adversity as well.I find it to be a very personal devotional. This is not one that is going to help you deal better with people or to live a life of Christian service or to love your neighbour, this is rather a devotional to help you learn to depend on God in the hard times and build your personal relationship with Him which I think is the foundation for all other things. You don't have to be Christian to be charitable to others or do good works but to be strong in faith you do need a strong foundation of trusting God through everything and this definitely helps with that. The rest will come as you study the Word and obey His commandments of love.I drop one star from my rating only because this is not a daily devotional in the traditional sense. I do read one a day but I'd prefer a different formatting or for it to be expanded to a full year devotional. Also, some of the devotions seem a little repetitive which isn't too bad because I do need the reinforcement. I won't say that every single devotion touches me as profoundly but most I've read I can identify with and I've certainly taken a message from each one that helps me in my own personal walk with God. This is not the only devotional I'm doing but I try to read it every morning. I highly recommend this one."
"Sara Young does it again.....I had read Jesus Calling and really loved it.....while going through very big physical challenges, pain, hip fracture, medical bills, 3 moves in 4 years, lost home, lots of stress on lots of levels I was completely out of hope.....Sara wrote this during a very challenging time in her life so I could relate...very helpful for people looking for that light at the end of the tunnel -"
"I loved Sarah Young's ""Jesus Calling,"" and used it for my daily devotionals for a year.  I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find its equal for the next year's devotionals, but her ""Jesus Today"" is a close second.  I am enjoying it, though I admit ""Jesus Calling"" is without compare. I hope she has a third book I can use next year!  She's the best!"
This book has  a good daily message.  Each day is a different thought followed by a few passages from the Bible.  Some of the days seem like they're written to help you get over a loss or illness while most help you get ready to take on the day and deal with the stresses of life.
Loved it.  Would recommend
Came in very helpfully during a recent time when I was struggling and feeling alone. Was (is) truly a God-send. Brought me great comfort. Still read daily though I am past the crisis.
I have been going through a lot in life lately involving health and children and grandchildren problems.  This little book to be able to pick it up and read it like Jesus speaking to me........always touches my heart and helps me through my day.  In fact I bought one and mailed it to sister as a surprise to help her through financial and health problems.  She's not a Christian yet but I'm praying for the Lord to work on her heart.  Great gift too!
"This book is one that I enjoy reading every day.  It is very encouraging and full of truth from God's Word!  I have given it to many friends over the years, and they also enjoy it."
I love these readings so much that I'll read through and start over again. They're easy to read and good for the soul!
I love all of Sarah Young’s devotionals. The style is so personal and powerful. I always feel like God is talking straight to me. The lessons are simple yet profound.
Good product
GREAT BOOK
Wonderful way to start each day with Jesus speaking directly to the reader.  Can't say enough how this book reassures me of His presence in my  life.
Recommend!!Great quality!
"Getting older has its benefits... I read it through 3 times over the years, and ir us fresh every day. Whatever page I read, I needed to hear that message."
...and he loves it!
Great book.  This is my 2nd one by Sarah Young.  It will inspire and encourage you.  I read it every night before going to bed.  It is written as though God is speaking to you and she includes Bible verses at the end of each 'devotional.'  Another great book from Sarah.  I liked it so much I bought one for my best friend.
"Another excellent devotional by Sarah Young  has blessed me. I have given several copies of this book to friends because I know it can lead one into a deeper walk of faith. I love how her devotional entries always include the scriptures associated with them. Thank you again, Sarah, for your faithfulness."
Very inspirational.  Exactly what I wanted/needed.  Very encouraging.
"This book has helped me through some tough days (chemo and radiation), and through the good days in between.  I have given it to a friend going through tough times, and she has leaned on it, too.  Quiet, gentle reminders of hope and help with Biblical quotes to keep the author's thoughts grounded in deeper truths.  I recommend this for folks going through the rough patches in life, and for every day reminders of hope and the love of God."
"My husband and I recently got the 10th Anniversary of Jesus Calling and we love the daily readings. I recommended my husband gift a Sarah Young book to his mom for Mother's Day, and he settled on this copy. She absolutely loves this book!"
"This wonderful book not only bless me but bless others that I gave to or read it to, I have suggested it to many people. How found out about is this young lady as me to read and highlight and under what the Lord was giving me for her, I did just that and it bless me as I read for her, the Lord let me know that He touched the writers heart to wrte this  book. This is one of the best books that I have ever read. I want to Sarah Young for being to God. This book is going to cause people to be saved, set free and deliverd. Also to get throuh life each day . Thank you Sarah for being a blessing to me. I pray that the Lord over shower you with blessing. I am stil suggesting this book today. It is an honor to write a review. I also thank Amazon for it available . My prayer is that your book will always sale. Have a blessed and joyful day.  Your Sister In Christ,  Jarrette Hatchett"
Perfect reading
"I very much like this devotional - Ms. Young has done a superb job of culling truths from scripture and writing them as if Jesus Himself is talking to the reader.  I especially like that (unlike Jesus Calling, which I DO like) the scripture verses are printed out.I recommend Jesus Today: Experience Hope Through His Presence to anyone who wants a closer walk with the Lord."
Loving it
This is a wonderful book.  I have purchased it for myself and given it to people in need.  It is Jesus talking to us and giving us hope.Never give up!!He is here and ready to answer your prayers.
Sarah Young is an inspired author -speaking from God's heart into my very own.  So many times I was amazed how the daily reading meant so much to me personally wtih regards to what I was experiencing at the time.  I can bearly get through a reading without getting teary and always resulting in praising God for more healing in my heart and life.  This is a great companion to my daily Bible reading.
Beautifully written and very thought provoking.
Wife loves it
good
"Sarah YoungI’ve heard folks complain that this author is adding to the scriptures. No, no, no. In this book she supports everything she writes with relevant scriptures. People who think this is adding to the Bible don’t seem to understand that God DOES communicate with anyone willing to listen. Sarah Young apparently listens closely.I have been encouraged and strengthened every day by this book and the Scriptures included. The author apparently was experiencing hardship during the time she recorded the messages. What she learned and shared is helping me during a most difficult time in my life. I am discovering that God is with me during pain, is still very much in control of my life and is teaching me awesome lessons, such as perseverance, patience and realizing that during difficult times we may be sharing with the afflictions of Jesus. I am greatly thankful for guidance through the book Jesus Today and for Sarah Young’s experiences that she wrote down.A reader doesn’t need to be having troubles in order to benefit from Jesus Today by Sarah Young.Geni White, RN, MS (retired) (3rd generation Cancer survivor. One of 5%.)"
I recommend this book I bought 26 already for gifts and my friend thank me so much for it they say is been a real blessing!
"I didn't think I could ever love a book better than ""Jesus Calling"" by Sarah Young. I have read it daily for at least 4 years. I bought ""Jesus Today"" a couple months ago after the death of my husband. It has truly been a Godsend. It seems to help me with my present situation even more than ""Jesus Calling"" although I read both everyday. I highly recommend this book for anyone going thru a turmoil in their life especially."
This is a great book with encouraging references from the bible and helps me experience hope through Jesus' presence.  A very encouraging book that I highly recommend to Christians and seekers.
REALLY LOVE ALL HER BOOKS
Sarah Young is a blessing. Her devotionals are heartfelt and seem to speak to me I’m just the day that I need to read it. I often share them with my friends. I highly recommend you buy her books.
"Today, and every day.  Great book to supplement the authors devotionals.  The author lives her testimony and has had a very physically challenging life.  He books are simply awesome for the Christian."
"I felt God speaking to me each day through this Book, this book is a blessing. I recommend it to anyone and I know how much love is here."
"I am using ""Jesus Today"" for personal devotions, as well as with three others with whom I share inspirational and encouraging words.  This book equips me with hope, even when facing tremendous hurdles and challenges of health, loss, and life in general.  I find anything by the author, Sarah Young, to be reliable and trustworthy, as well as hope-filled and on the mark, as far as Scripture is concerned."
I love to read God’s Inspiring Word.  The way she puts it together it helps me see things clearer as to what I need to do to please God.  It rejuvenates me and helps me stay Focused on God.
"For those who appreciated Sarah Young' s ""Jesus Calling"", they will also be moved by ""Jesus Today"". ""Jesus Today"" focuses on the hope we have in Jesus Christ, hope that we need and long for every day. As in ""Jesus Calling"", the book is written as if spoken from the very mouth of Jesus. Each day's reading is backed up with Scripture. Often I found it to be what I needed to hear from Jesus for that particular day."
"This is a wonderful devotional.  I initially received a copy as a Christmas gift.  I was encouraged by each days  devotional.  Not only did it speak to me, but it often gave me words of wisdom and encouragement to share with friends and family. So, I decided to order a number of copies to share with friends and family.  I wanted them to experience the daily encouragement that I received and to grow in the knowledge of the abundant hope that God gives."
Such a great book daily reminders to keep spirituality and faith in your life when it's not easy to do. I was recommended this book from a family member and have since recommended it to others. An easy read with lot's of relatable thoughts on everyday life. I highly recommend it for those who need a spiritual boost.
"This is by far one of the best devotionals I have ever read!  Sarah Young is an excellent article.  She writes in a very honest, encouraging, and hope-filled manner that comes straight from her heart and real life experiences of walking by utter faith in the Lord through some very difficult life circumstances.  Awesome ten times over!"
Helping me through my grieving
"I really enjoy Sarah Young's devotion books. She writes them as if God is speaking to the reader, so it gives you a really cool perspective and sparks honest conversations between you and the Lord. I read Jesus Calling before this one, and I actually liked that one better. But this is still a good one because each devotion is short yet profound."
This book has been part of my daily devotional for a very long time. It helps to get my day started off right as I contemplate each message. It is truly part of my morning nourishment. I am so greatful.
I happy I purchased this book I gave them as a gift to my sister and family friend
Great book! It has been so relevant to every day focus during the craziness of 2020. I wish it was organized by the day of week/ day of the year or maybe the date with no year but that’s a personal preference to help me stay organized.
"Since I have been enjoying Sarah Young's devotional book ""Jesus Calling"", I was interested in reading some of her other work.  Her newest book, ""Jesus Today"", did not disappoint. I find it particularly meaningful and encouraging.It is laid out differently with numbered entries instead of calendar days or subject matter titles, so that would be important for people to know in advance. However, that has not taken away from the beauty of the subject nor the impact of the writing. She has scripture references at the end of each entry, and that is important to me.I highly recommend this book and will give it for gifts as well.Mary Lynne--FL. 10/28/12"
"This book is very inspirational throughout our everyday lives. I absolutely love it and would very highy recommend it to all. The readings definitely reassure you that you do not face your journey in life alone, our Lord certainly walks with you, giving you the courage and strength needed to face whatever comes up in life. God Bless all and may this book touch your life as it has mine. And a huge Thank You to Sarah Young for sharing her messages with us in our Faiths journey."
"An excellent uplifting inspirational book.Everyday I open the book randomly and read a page it is always heartfelt very encouraging just as the Lord would speak at himself.I am thankful I saw a friend using this book, and I am glad I bought one also, comforting when I'm alone and need encouragement.Also helps encouraging others.Definitely would buy this again as a special gift."
"This devotional is a great way to end the day.  I'm very impressed with this author and her ability to write such deep devotionals that can be done in 5 minutes or less. It feels like God is truly speaking though her in this book.  I also own Jesus Today, and this is another great devotional by Sarah Young."
Love Jesus Calling.  I think my friend will also appreciate this devotional.
I have nearly all of Sarah Young's devotional. This is a good addition to a faith library.
"I recently received this devotional as a gift, and I'm finding this book surprisingly enjoyable. Surprisingly, because I don't usually like mainstream Christian devotional books, and I had been unaware of the growing Sarah Young phenomenon. There is a reason this author's books are so well regarded; she knows the holy, and she writes from the heart."
This book is AMAZING!!!  I simply adore it!!  It's just beautiful!  I loved the introductions where Sarah shares that this was written during her struggle with Lyme disease.  As a fellow Lyme sufferer this was very uplifting and inspirational to me.
"I have both Jesus Calling and Jesus Today and love both books.  I start my morning with them and the Bible, of course.  It gets me off to a good start and doesn't take a lot of time to read a page and look at the scripture.  I have given these books to friends, who say they love them as well."
"I love the ""personal"" approach that Sarah Young uses in her devotionals (I have two others).  I would recommend this devotional for anyone who is desiring a closer, more intimate relationship with the Lord.  It is easy to read, and the scriptures referenced are a part of the devotional.  So you can read it anywhere because you don't need the Bible to look them up."
"This book is the best devotional when going through hard times.  It is a great wake up.  Some are just too flippant and happy when life is hard that is not what you can identify with.  This book is authentic and relatable especially when life is not going how you wanted, thought or expected. Yet leaves one hopeful and feeling stronger to hang in there and not do it alone."
Received in perfect condition. If you liked Jesus Calling you will certainly like this.
Love it!!
"Bought as a gift but I have a couple other of her books, love them!"
"My constant daily read!!!  This has been a difficult year for me, and I have found such encouragement in this book.  The theme is ""Experience Hope Through His Presence"" and that is what I have needed and experienced!  I'm reading it for the 3rd time, and still appreciating it. I've recommended it to many and will continue to do so."
This book was suggested to me due to the author having Lyme disease while writing it and the fact that I am currently battling Lyme disease.  The entries are very encouraging - particularly since I am dealing with a chronic illness.  The entries are also short and easy-to-read which allows for contemplation.  I'm very glad I followed the suggestion.
I highly recommend this book. I have been reading it for many years and I always get something special from it.
"Yes, I just got it, so I can write it and send it as devotionals to all the people I know. Very similar of ""Jesus Calling"" that I sent out for 4 yrs. Everyone loves these 2 books, they seem to fit everyone's daily problems and gives them hope, just wonderful book. Yes, Yes, get it! it will help one's walk with God."
"My Pastor recommended this book.It is written like Jesus is talking to me.I have found it very encouraging.There are no dates, so if I miss a dayI simply start where I last finished reading.I can also read more than one if I'm havinga hard day. I will gives copies of this as a giftin the future."
I bought the Kindle edition for myself. This is a beautiful gift for someone very special. Ms. Young knows what she's doing.
"This book has gotten me thru some of the saddest days of my life after the sudden loss of my husband. I began sharing it in Facebook and had people messaging me daily and some sent cards in the mail about how the book was helping them. It took on a ministry of its own. A friend had purchased it for me as soon as she heard the news, never realizing the impact it would have."
Sarah Young really put together something amazing with the Jesus Today books.I tend to be one that has turned to the books more when times are rough and have been amazed how the message hits true to your particular struggle that day.I have bought her books for all my close family members and highly recommend them.
Amazing and encouraging book!!! I am slowly collecting all of Sarah Young's books as Iove them so much!
This devotional is very helpful and up lifting. I like it a little better than Jesus Lives because there are no categories. Daily life does not always fall into categories. As with her other devotionals the reader must remember that the narrative is hers and always refer to the actual scripture on the opposite page.
"I have had Jesus Calling for years.  Every time I read it, I feel Jesus talking to me.I bought Jesus Today because of her writing.  Although it isn't set up the same, It goes hand in hand with the Jesus Calling book and shows the scriptures relating to each topic.She has such a passion for the Lord and it shows in her writing."
Have read this book two times-am going to start reading again-new insight of JESUS each read. All need to read
"This book has been such an encouragement to me as a caregiver!  Every day the scripture and comments have truly helped me experience ""hope through His (Jesus') presence.""  If you're going through a storm of any kind in your life, I would highly recommend ""Jesus Today."""
I love these books & read them everyday. I bought three different ones by the same Author already.
Love these Sarah young bible quote books i received mine brand new & enjoying reading it very well made
"I love Sarah Young's devotionals. This is my 3rd one. I like that it has the scriptures already provided, so I can have God's word close by so I don't lose the thought for the day."
I highly recommend this book and all of Sarah Young books.  Her talent and love in clarifying The Word for today's challenges is so inspiriting.
"Part of Mother's day gift!Mom loves the author Sarah Young.Came in protected packaging, perfect condition, spot on for delivery date!"
"Sarah Young Devotionals are always filled with strength, courage & wisdom. I always feel my prayers are connecting with Jesus. The Bible verses she uses with each of the Devotionals is spot on. I have purchased 2 of her Devotionals and plan on more. I love the idea that these are Daily Devotions to help me connect to Jesus daily.SEH PA"
Bought as a gift. They love it!
"Each member of our family at home has a copy of all of the books by Sarah Young.  These books have do inspired our lives through more love of the Lord that we have bought copies to share with friends and family.  Highly recommend any, and all of Sarah Young's books.  She is truly gifted by Our Heavenly Father."
"If you are having a rough time, things are going bad, you just feel discouraged, this is the devotional for you!  Day after day, you find encouragement from this book.  It is all based on Scripture, and it's written as though Jesus Himself is speaking to you.  I recommend it to anyone and everyone, but especially to those who are facing difficulties!"
Excellent daily reflections and I like that they are not dated- they are numbered.  If I miss a date I don't feel so bad.  I just read the nest number.
"I  had four surgeries this winter, beginning with open heart surgery.  ""Jesus Today"" was a gift from a dear friend that I cherished throughout my recoveries.  The book is more than inspirational - it was a true lifesaver as I suffered with intense physical and emotional pain.I recently purchased four copies to gift to friends as they face hardships in their lives.  This book can be valued and read by anyone at any age."
I have all Sarah Young's books. She has brought much to those seeking a word of guidance in many situations. Jesus Today protrays an even deeper amount of suffering in her life & God's words to her during these times have lifted me up higher when I was seeking relief also.  You read & reread the sections to feel the power. Don't miss this one!!
"I love the fact that the reflections are based on Bible verses that as shown on the opposite page. Although each reflection may notaddress a personal issue or concern of the day, there is always a word of encouragement and a new way of expressingan important principal for living with hope. (Examples: When out minds are not really focused on anything in particular, let Jesus be the default!;or, Minimize Worry, Maximize Worship)  These are not ""positive thinking"" quips, but are scripturally based. There is not one reflection that has not directed our minds to Jesus and living ""connected"" to the powerful presence of God."
"A friend of mine gave me my first Sarah Young ""Jesus Calling"" when I lost a family member back in 2010.  It saved me in my time of need.  My sister gave me ""Jesus Today"" when our older sister passed last year, and I didn't think any book could be better than ""Jesus Calling.""  I was wrong, this book is even better. She has a way of writing that speaks directly to you as an individual no matter where you are in your walk with God. I wish everyone would read these books."
The 2nd book I have read of hers and have enjoyed immensely!!! I lost my Daddy in October 2008 and now waiting on the last breathes of Momma and love her Books so Much!!!!!!
Well written and applicable to life today. I enjoy reading each day.
"Jesus is calling and I need prompting in solid scripture to begin hearing. I recommend for daily quiet moments in the presence of Father,Son, and Holy Spirit"
"We all have circumstances that we never imagined would happen. That moment when we feel angry, scared, and desperately saddened, is when our faith and hope is questioned the most. These daily devotions empowered me to face my difficult circumstances and be reminded that Jesus was right there with me. I found hope and Faith again!"
I love this devotional! It's like Jesus is speaking to me each morning. And it's nice that the scripture verses are already there.
One of the best devotionals for someone going through cancer.  I was given this as a gift and I've ordered multiple times for women going through cancer
I love this book. Sarah young really uses God's words to calm your inner spirit
i like the size and it is a wonderful book
Good
I read it every morning as I've done with the other Susan Young books. Easier for me to understand than the actual bible.
This book is the greatest comfort. I sometimes have trouble with reading regular biblical verses and figuring out how to apply them to my daily life. This book opens up the verses for me into a message in which I find peace and understanding. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to increase their spiritual connection with Jesus.
"A great gift! I love how it doesn't have the dates on like other daily devotionals. That way you won't feel guilty if you miss a day. When you read it, you feel like God is talking directly to you and writing you a love letter. Very encouraging!"
"I was severely injured 4 1/2 years ago. Since then, everything I took for granted has been turned upside down. I loved to work for my church. Gone. I loved gardening, not able to any more. Just shopping is an issue and exercising is not possible. So much loss, but so much growth as well. This book is a treasure for those in hard life circumstances."
A daily reminder of .Jesus' desire for an intimate walk with each of us.  So filled with truth and pointing to Scripture all the tine.
"I bought this for my Mother because she loves Jesus Calling. I was skeptical at first about it being as good as Jesus Calling, but she loved it just as much."
This book was like having Jesus speak directly to me. The Scriptures come alive in Sarah’s pen and land on me in a powerful way.
"I not only purchased one for myself, but also gave 3 people this book as a gift.  I have heard how much they each love this book.  One of them told me she cannot put it down.  And as always with Sarah Young's spiritual books, we have all concluded it is as though she is speaking to us directly.God Bless You Sarah!Diane from Raynham, MA"
Great reading
I love this book! I read a page everyday and it also gives me comfort and insight. I love that she writes in from the perspective of God and then gives Bible verses to back up what 'God' is saying to you that day. I would highly recommend this book to any christian that is looking for a simple way to implement a little more biblical reading into their day.
Got this for a gal who lost her joy and she sharedit with a gal who Satan has a foothold on her.  God and His word is always stronger and always wins.  Great little book for a quick read to start you day out with Jesus!
This book is very good.  A companion to Jesus Calling by same author.
Sara Young has the best books!!!
"Anyone who is having life problems. If functioning in your own world, this daily reading will help you through each day."
"I am so grateful that Sarah Young is courageous enough to share her intimate  God conversations with us. Her book is inspiring, encouraging and you can hear the love of Jesus reaching out through the words.  A great plus to have the scripture verses written out.I have shared several Sarah Young books with family and friends and was overjoyed to see their walk with Jesus become more intimate as they read her books.Praise the Lord!!!"
"Some days, most days, these words are what have kept me striving forward with my head held high. Thank you"
Delighted with this book from author Sarah Young!
Loved it
Mom in law loved it. Gave her the set of 3 for mothers day.
Loved just what I needed
"How clear and concise Sarah Young's writing is.  I love her perspective and willingness to share with the reader, how she has learned over the years to become what she was meant to be - which most of us that are honest with ourselves want, or be willing to do."
Sara Young has the very best
"An absolute MUST for daily reading.  This little booklet is perfect to read before my cup of coffee and gets me started in the right frame of mind, remembering what Jesus has done, is doing and will do for me always!  I like the fact that the Scripture verses are not only listed, but written out so I don't have to look them up at that particular time - can do at any time.  Love this little book."
"Very inspiring. Great writing and insight from the author. She pairs her personal experiences with appropriate Bible verses, all written out. Compact enough to carry with you. Great book for a gift, as well."
"Bought as a gift for my wife, she loves this book.  She had a copy already but not one with the upgraded format that this one has.  Her other copy will be passed on to our daughter."
Love Sarah Young's teaching
"This is one of the Sarah Young books that I read every morning to start my day.  I can't imagine not doing this.  It's calming, hopeful, and gives me strength to get through whatever may be going on in my life.  I read another one in the evening before going to bed.  Just a conversation with the Lord; just 2 people.  PERFECT!"
"As with Sarah Young's bestselling ""Jesus Calling"", this small book (just the right size for your hand, and to carry with you when traveling or even in the car) is a gem containing a great and powerful depth of wisdom.  The theme of hope in Jesus Today is one to which most of us humans can well relate, as challenging experiences are a part of pretty much everyone's life experience at some time or another.  Here are ""faith, hope and love"" - the three greatest things in our world.  Buy this, and give it to most people you know!"
Just got my new book and plan on reading it tonight.great auther
"""Jesus Today"" has become my morning devotional, its' content speaks to me like no other book I have ever read.  It gently lets me know my own wishes and thoughts during difficult times, it reminds me that what I am feeling is felt also by the Holy Spirit that is in me.  The book lets me know that I am never alone, the Spirit within is the ultimate power who is able to lead me to higher ground when the time is right.""Jesus Today"" speaks to my soul, the scriptures provided are the words of God.  I give God all praise for  inspiring Sarah Young to Chronicle her journey as a believer in our Lord Savior Jesus Christ!."
"Sarah Young is an exceptional Christian author.  I have both Jesus Calling and Jesus Today and will not hesitate to order more of her books in the future.  Sarah's love for the Lord shows through her work.  Her books are filled with hope, encouragement, inspiration, love, and peace.  I highly recommend this devotional for anyone.  It would make a perfect gift!!Trish"
Arrived in good condition as described. We really liked her first book. As if listening to what Jesus himself might say to his followers. Looking forward to reading this book throughout the new year.
"Beautiful book, as all of hers are! Like this one especially since scriptures are written out for you!"
"A friend had purchased this book for me to help me through some difficult times, and I loved it! I purchased it for another friend to send her some encouragement for the struggle she's currently facing. Very inspiring and well written."
Great gift to give.  Thought provoking!  Highly recommend!
"I love the way Sara young write as if the Lord is talking directly to you , I have two of her Devotional's that help me every morning draw nearer to God ! Her writing are anointed for sure ."
This daily devotional was purchased for a friend going through hard times. I started to read through and was immediately hit with how profound the insight was on our daily experiences and how we react to them. This devotional hits the issues and our ways of dealing with what God wants for us out of our daily struggles and glories.
Absolutely love this devotion
"I love Jesus Calling, but I love Jesus Today even more. It's not by calendar days, it just has lots of entries that can be read any time. This book really speaks to those who are suffering. If you are having a hard time, I can guarantee this will speak to you."
"I love the way Mrs. Young writes as if Jesus is caring on a conversation with me...and it's all from The Word! What a blessing we receive when we read it. My husband now joins me as we have a morning devotion. Her book is a constant, that we've added to our time with The Lord."
I’ve gotten all of these books for gifts and they love them.
Excellent
Absolutely fantastic! This devotional is so powerful and so applicable to whatever situation your facing. I read it and Jesus Calling everyday.  It really is as though Jesus is speaking to you personally. A must have for your devotional library!
"Sarah Young is always able to give me practical, encouraging thoughts, centered on Scripture. This is the 4th devotional I have purchased of her inspiring writings."
"I live this book. I really like the author's style. I have the book ""JesusCalling"" and love to read it each day.  I was sure I would like this one too, and I do. She has a lot of insight and a great relationship with the Lord. I would recommend to anyone looking for inspirational reading."
"Daily devotions speaking directly to me in so many ways brought me through recovery from chemotherapy.  As a fellow Christian said, all you have to do is turn to Him and he does the rest. When I was too weak to even pray, these daily thoughts kept me close. Thankful to God for this gift."
Awesome book. Jesus talking and offering hope. All Sarah Young books are awesome
"I read this devotional book every morning. It is a perfectstart to the day. Sarah Young provides words that Jesuswould say about who we are to Him and who He is to us.It is uplifting to read this combined with Sarah Young's otherbook, Jesus Calling."
Great read
Highly recommend this book to all!  I purchased additional copies to share with family and friends.  A favorite source for reassurance and hope.  Don't want to start my day without it.  I like the fact that scriptures are printed out with reference as well.
"Amazing as each time I really from this book, it ties in with just what I need to hear at that time."
Great devotional
Sara Young has written a great devotional that you can go back to over and over. It gives you so much comfort and hope to help deal with the difficult world we live in.
Wonderful devotional
"Bought it for a friend, she loves it"
As usual Sarah Young has done a very professional job with a very personal subject. I feel like is sitting with me in the room talking with me while I have breakfast. I look forward to each new day's devotional. This is a great book. The first book I read was Jesus Calling which was equally as great! Great gift for those you love!
"I like to use this devotion book in conjunction with Sarah Young's ""Jesus Calling"" devotional book. When I finish, I like to start over. No matter how much I read these books, there are always days when the lesson is a perfect fit for my needs! They both provide encouragement and suggest ways to strengthen your relationship with God."
"Devotionals are inspiring, comforting and soothing.  I read a couple a day.  Gets my day started on the right track."
Wonderful devotional that touches the heart and gives hope through knowing the Lord. Shares deep insights  and scripture which encourage the mind and heart.
Another wonderful devotional. A great way to start your day with Jesus. Love all her devotion books. Keep listening to the Holy Spirit.
"I have several of Sarah Young's devotional books. It's a perfect way to start every day, stay in the Word &'hear what God has to say to me."
Sarah Young was gifted to write this book and it speaks to me everyday.  It's a heartfelt message from God to us and I love to give it to friends and family for gifts.
This is a great book!! I recommend this book to anyone who desires a closer walk and understanding of Jesus devotion and love for us his children.
"I feel Sarah Young is one of the best authors , she has a way of writing that makes you feel Jesus is right in the room with and it helps me to more fully understand the better and what Jesus wants from us and that is our full attention. also helps understand His Grace, that is truly a gift , not by what we do, but how we receive it in our hearts , for we are all sinners , born with sin from Adam and Eve, the first sinners. All of her books are excellent and you learn so much from them."
Sarah young is a wonderful writer for a daily devotional.  I have ordered several of her books for gifts.
"Not able to rad after page (or location?) 150.  I understand that the author was have some personal problems when right this, which could explain why it does not have pages for the entire year."
I gave this to a friend battling cancer. She tells me she loves reading it daily!
"As a Stephen Minister, I have used the book Jesus Calling by this author for years and it is a wonderful, encouraging Christian devotions source.  However, the abusive backgrounds of some people do not allow them to relate to the joy of that book.  Finding Jesus Today was a Godsend, as it was written by Young from a place of suffering, pain and fear, the very things to which many care receivers relate.  Still encouraging and joyful, this book approaches problems from a different place and was just the thing I needed to reach those people.  Sarah Young's instincts were perfect in writing this volume for hurting believers."
Lovely devotional to encourage and uplift your soul
"This collection of commentary based on the words of Jesus was borne out of intense suffering due to illness. In Sarah Young style, Jesus is speaking directly to the reader from Scripture words of comfort and encouragement. It is beautifully done. I recommend this book for anyone desiring a closer walk with the Lord, but it's a ""must read"" for those who are going through trials, especially illness. It helps to shift the focus from the trial to the Great Physician who heals mind, soul and body."
"I like this book almost as much as ""Jesus Calling"" by Ms. Young."
I read it over and over.I feel so much closer to my God by reframing the events in my life.  so much packed into a small book.
Wonderful book. If you are sad or depressed these are great to give an encouraging words of hope and peace.
"I wake up every morning ready for the messages I receive from this book. Thank you Sarah Young, for this so much needed message."
I read this book every day and I find spiritual strength and inspiration. I have bought copies for friends who need some healing in their lives.  The author is to be praised for her dedication and the insight God has provided
Excellent book..Excellent author!
"I love how it fits each day.  I read it regularly and am amazed at how well it fits into my life situations, just as Jesus Calling does."
"I bought three of these. 1 for a person dealing with trauma to her grandson, 1 for my sister for Christmas and 1 for myself. Sarah Young's books are amazing. They really speak to me."
Beautiful leather and silver writing. This little book of devotions will lift you upAnd carry you threw the difficult times. Make you laugh in the good times.
A great follow up to Jesus Calling.  Highly recommend
"Love it!  The devotionals are very well written and every time I pick up the book, it applies to my life."
Great gift
I am finding that these devotions are comforting and uplifting. They are short and can be added into my day very easily. It is a must read for anyone that needs a bit of encouragement.
Love her books. They are like daily devotionals
A lovely every day ecourament readings.
This is a great daily devotional!
I've been going through this book daily and have now bought the Kindle version for a number of friends. It truly does offer hope every single day and is an excellent uplifting short devotional to help support those going through a difficult time.
"Fine, but I like the Jesus Calling with the bible verses imbedded much better"
"I prefer the first Sarah Young daily reader.  There is some talk of these guides as a form of channeling.  There is a conversation taking place here, not unlike the conversations many believers have in their personal walk."
very encouraging devotions especially if you are going through some hard times
This is such an encouraging book!  It came at a time I really was struggling and her personal story encouraged me so much to keep fighting the good fight of faith for we reap if we faint not!  I highly recommend this book. I have passed out to many people. Nancy
I read one devotional every morning and appreciate how it amplifies and brings clarity to the scripture.
"Friend gave me Jesus Calling (still rereading it; good one too).  If you want to know enrich your daily personal relationship with Jesus on a one to one basis, get this book.  Scriptures are already with each reading.  Makes it a bit more convenient."
"I received this as a gift. It was so meaningful that I bought several others for gifts. If you or someone you know is in need of hope, then this devotional book is perfect!!!!!  It has been a blessing to many people."
"Going through a grieving period at the loss of my husband, this book has encouraged me daily."
Please read.
An excellent devotional book. I have really enjoyed it. It's written in a way that is easily understood.
A must read! Wonderful devotional.
"I am a pastor and missionary, and this is the best devotional I have ever read. It makes the scriptures come alive! I read it every morning and it is a great blessing in my life! Thank you Jesus and thank you Sarah Young!"
I had read other Sarah Young's books so I wanted to give this one a try.  It is fabulous.  I love her style of writing and the content.  It is uplifting and inspiring.  I would suggest you order this one and any of her other books.
Down to earth and inspiring. Reminds you just who Jesus is and His heart for each one of us. I love that her writing iin each debotional is directly inspired by scripture. Brings the Bible to you as a simple conversation with God.
"I gave this as a gift, last year I gave Jesus Calling, and they ask for another book by Sara Young."
This book is supernaturally ministering hope and encouragement! I am most blessed!
Amazing totally changed my lifeI can t thanks enought Sarah Young for writing those books 🙏🏼
Daily 1 minute read with Jesus keeps teen son on the track.  What more can I say?
"I have been reading devotional material for many years, and Sarah Young 's books are some of the best I have ever read. I have all of her books, and often read two at the same time. They are very encouraging, uplifting, and always pointing to Jesus."
All of Sarah's books are wonderful because it is Jesus talking to us!!!
I love that it is a part of my morning routine. Starting my day with connection with God and peaceful thoughts.
Another inspiring devotional written by Sarah Young. What she shares is very uplifting.
I am a recent widow and this devotional brought great comfort and peace.
Love this devotional by Sarah Young.  The words of encouragement are such a great way to start the day.  It was amazing how the reading of the day fit me; either it fit the scripture I was reading or what I was facing that day.
"I really enjoyed this digital book. Just like its predecessor, Jesus Calling, this devotional seems perfectly appropriate for each day as I read it. The entries are written in such a way that I think it would work well for men or women."
You can never go wrong when you're meditating trying to get closer to God. Thank you for this book
It is wonderfully updated and Scriptures are written with the pages.
nice
"This book has allowed me to hear and receive God's peace and blessing through these daily readings. I love the simplicity of the message, just proving it doesn't have to be so complicated and time consuming to set aside time with God everyday! I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a daily devotional to stay on track with hearing God's voice in such a hectic schedule."
This is another home run for Sarah Young.  It puts one in a first-person relationship with The Lord and it's as if He is speaking directly to you and your everyday situations.  A wonderful devotional to start or end the day.
I have used this for 3 years because I like it so well
This book is extremely uplifting and touches the soul.  Sarah Young is a wonderful writer and is definitely inspired by the Holy Spirit.Anyone needing encouragement or facing difficulty in life will find her books helpful.
"Jesus Today is an inspirational devotional in which I like to begin each day.  Each day's reading is as if Jesus, Himself, is talking directly to the reader encouraging him/her to draw closer to Him.  The theme is HOPE for us today and the HOPE we, as followers of Jesus, have in the future.  I am blessed by it every time I read it.  I recommend it to everyone."
I like the entire series of the Jesus calling books ...
What a nice daily reminder of God loving us daily.  Thank you Sarah for this reminder.Don't start your day without it.B. Green
Just what I wanted. Nicely covered
Excellent book...very comforting.
Can’t go wrong with Sarah Young but my daughter loves it.
This is good for every teen and adult.  Makes you be uplifted after reading and meditating.  I love this devotional
"I love it but wish it had a date for each day as Jesus Calling does. These books have ministered greatly to me during a year when some great disappointments had occurred in my church. They kept my focus where it should be - on The Lord, the One who never disappoints."
"I loved the original book Jesus calling and have given as a gift to several friends and family.  This new devotional also has the scripture verses listed with each day, which makes it a nice addition.  i would recommend it highly."
I have Jesus Calling and it's wonderful.  I added this book and read in both every night before I go to sleep.  These books really help me to put my mind in a good place.  I recommend them.
Sara Young writes this daily devotional as she is going through her own medical problem.  I love these daily devotional books by Sara Young (there are 3 that I know of) They are basically her insights that she has received during her own daily devotionals.  Very down to earth and easy to relate to.  Each day lists her comments and scriptures to back them up.  Only drawback to this book was that there was no place to write my comments like there was on her Jesus Calling book.  A small (in size) book with a big message...HOPE!  I likes these books so well that I bought extras to give as gifts.
This book feeds your soul and gives hope to those who are in the midst of difficult life experiences. It contains words of encouragement directly from Scripture that lift the spirit and focus attention on the love of Jesus and the hope He gives those who trust in Him.
I really love to read this book everyday and see what God has for me. It's so amazing that it applies to me as if it were written to me.  But that's the way Gods word is. Always applicable to the one reading. Great book!
I enjoyed this book over the days I've read it. Now I'll go back to the beginning and read it again. My devotions are what get me through the day. I like the format as if Jesus is speaking directly to me.
Excellent daily reading. Almost to the end and once complete I am going to start it over again.
"My sister has this book, a friend bought it for her. It is a great read and very uplifting for anyone and everyone going through a rough patch. No mater how small or large."
"I bought Ma three of Sarah Young's books. She loves to read but often resorts to odd stuff randomly pulled from the shelves just to pass the time. Now she has these and they make her think, a good thing. The beautiful binding encourages her to pick this book up and the smaller size is easy for her to hold. I think there were exactly what she needed, especially for early mornings before the house is roused and for porch time. She says she appreciates Sarah's friendly way of writing, and that she has no trouble understanding the themes. Very good."
"I read this every day for my devotional.  I like it, but I think I liked her first one better.  That one was awesome and I don't use that word lightly.  After the first one, it's pretty hard to get better than that."
Wonderful book. Will be used a lot and recommended.Fast shipment
"I do prefer the ""large deluxe"" version with a ""leatherette"" type binding.  See that book's review for more details."
This was a gift for my brother-in-law. I believe he likes it very much.
Awesome!  I love this book and have bought several other copies to offer encouragement and hope to others
A daily message of personal hope and love through hard life of pain and abandonment.
"A delightful, inspiring daily read. I was given this book as a gift after my husband passed away & I found it so helpful in my healing. I read it every day & am on my third time thru it & continue to receive new insight each time I read it. I have bought over 12 & given out as called or needed.Excellent book. Can't go wrong."
why wouldn't you love these books?
"Excellent bedtime read. Short, sweet,  and no looking up verses to keep you up. It's all right there and it speaks to everyone about that day no matter ilk or experience."
We have them all.
Very good devotional....great personal devotional.
"I share this book with others and read it to my hospice patients.  It's a wonderful devotional book, andso good for cheering those folks up.  A good companion book with 'Jesus Calling'.  Kathryn Potter"
What a great inspirational book. Has helped me each day to get started. Of all my devotional books this is the best and sent Sarah's books to my grandchildren to help them to tackle the day.
Good gift
Good gift
Good reading
"Jesus Today was given to me as a gift.  I bought this copy to share the message with someone else.  If you are going through a difficult time, this book is amazing.  Reading an entry each day reminds you that you do not have to handle tough times alone.  In fact, as a Christian, you are supposed to lean on Jesus and allow Him to carry the weight for you.  This book also reminds you that, as difficult as your situation is, Jesus suffered a great deal more in order to save your soul and give you the gift of His peace.  As a result of reading Jesus Today daily, along with praying fervently, I was able to accept my cancer diagnosis, and I now feel that I have attained a much closer relationship to our Savior than I ever thought possible.  Jesus Today makes a thoughtful gift for anyone who is suffering."
"Wonderful devotional-- very personal to the reader-- makes a fantastic gift to anyone-- even for  those who are not ""church going""- great ""witness tool"". Thanks to Amazon for offering this item."
This is a great daily devotion book to help you through difficult times and help you on your journey of faith.
It is one of the best books I have ever encountered.A true gift to my soul.I feel closer to Jesus as I pray these precious wordsMary S
Awesome!
"Sarah Young devotionals are amazing! I would highly recommened them for anyone looking for encouragement daily, and to deepen their faith. This is my third book of her's and ecah one gets better and better. Each morning I read them, and they inspire me and give me peace. I hope she comes out with more books! I love them! thank you Sarah Young for expanding my understanding of faith through trails and triumphs. peace be with you, kateri m. walsh"
It is a must . A wonderful devotional book.
OMG THIS BOOK IS SO SO MEANINGFUL
"I have loved the Jesus Calling and this just picks up where the other leaves off. It has been a great encouragement to me more than on one occasion. God always seems to know just what I need for the day. Thanks Sarah, for listen to the Spirit of God speak and being His pen and paper."
I am presently dealing with a terminal illness a d this book has sustained me through many nights when I needed encouragement. I would recommend to anyone needs encouragement and a reminder that Jesus is an ever present help in a time of trouble.
Her books are life changing !!!!’
spirit filled pages very uplifting and amazing Grace
Very profound and compelling...I was given the book as a gift and have since bought several copies for friends.  Sarah wrote it at a very low and challenging time in her life both physically and emotionally.  I could totally relate.  Our stories are different but the pain was the same.  I was battling cancer and treatment just after my son who has a severe disorder almost died and was in ICU for two weeks.  I read a few pages every day and specially on dificult days. It has taught me to turn to God and have a closer personal relationship.  A big thank you to Sarah.
"This book is filled with hope from the Scripures.  Sarah Young has shared her own journey through the most difficult time in her life.  Through her God given ability to express what Jesus is saying in scripture,  she has helped us understand what His plan is for our lives, and to persevere through hard circumstances with trust and peace from Him."
"Together with Sarah Young's , Jesus Calling : Enjoying Peace in His Presence , we experience a daily dose of inspiration which prepares you for the daily tribulations of this world . Thank you Sarah for new perspectives in listening to Jesus by direct translation through His Holy Spirit ! Vic and Alta Peenz"
Nice little book to have.
I love Sarah Young's style of writing in her devotionals and this one definitely does not disappoint. I recommend this one highly for anyone looking for a devotional with a different approach.
"This book is essential for those facing major life issues,more specifically medical issues. Helps you understand your place in life and to recognize what is important in life."
Very nice book I love it
The author is very gifted
"Wow!  Sarah Young is filled with the Holy Spirit.  Thank you, Lord for the gift of writing you have given Sarah, you are truly speaking through her."
"This book was referred to me by a friend.  I have enjoyed its simplicity, yet depth.  I especially like the scriptures attached to each daily read.  I recommend this book to those who are busy but committed to read the word of God each day."
"Love it!!!!!!I have no idea why amazon now requires a certain number of words but, I don't have time for this nonsense.  Sometimes you just want to hit stars and be done with it."
"New to this author, but she's fantastic.  She really touches your heart and brings you to your knees and more in love with Jesus."
"Although I haven't fully completed the book, as I'm using it as part of my daily devotions each day I read seems like Jesus is  speaking to me for what is happening in my life at that moment. I even find myself reading ahead as I want more. Yes, I would recommend this book."
"It is the best daily devotional that I have read.  Each days reading can have a special meaning for you. That is why you only read one day at a time. It  gives me hope for each day of better things to come. The scripture that is noted at the end of the reading makes you want to go to the bible and read that verse, which in turn you will read the before and after verse.  I highly recommend this book."
"I read this recently, it is very well written, with good interpretation of my understanding of the verses.  She does a great job, great inspiration."
I love this book really comforts me
I love this devotional !
i read this devotional every morning to start my day and decrease my anxiety.
Very good devotional.  You can’t go wrong with a Sarah Young devotional.
"Great daily devotional book. Really, it's good for opening anytime. Love the format. Very impressed with the author's personal story. She knows the importance and struggle of hope."
Nice for encouragement everyday
"""Jesus Today"" by Sarah Young is one of the most inspirational books I have read.  I will definitely re-read it many many times!  Books like these help my faith grow by leaps and bounds.  It is a must read for old and new Christians alike.  I highly recommend it.  Get Sarah Young's book ""Jesus Calling"".  I give that a 5 star as well.  God bless!Millicent Graham"
"Purchased for friend that is home bound with illness.  Comfort for the soul, and body."
God truly uses this woman! Great gift
I like this book.  I confess I've read only a few pages.  I prefer Jesus Calling by this same author and am reading that daily along with reading the Bible through in a year.
was a gift. friend was happy to add it to her Sarah Young collection
"I needed a change, I had done ""Jesus Calling"" 3 yrs. and this turns out to be a good devotional, not quite as strong as ""Jesus Calling"" but very good.  Thank you Sarah Young."
"For those having trouble in life, this is a great read. Wonderful if you do it with you wife so she can help, too. God's wisdom goes a long way when you have His knowledge, too."
Awesome
Bought as a gift. It is very nice quality.
Excellent book and applicable any day of the year.
I enjoy this book as much as my Jesus Calling.... very very happy that I purchased this!
It was a gift for a friend.
This book helped me remember to make sure to make time for God each day and helped me remember that God is ALWAYS there for us. We just need to ask for help and look for it.
i enjoy reading Sarah young.
I read a page per day. Sarah has been blessed with a special gift. I look forward to the start of each day.
Excellent book/devotional. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is seeking growth and inspiration. I also enjoyed Sarah Young intro to the book and how she got her insight on this book. Very very good!
This is a great devotional book.  Sarah Young is a very good author and really touches on everyday life.  I recommend this book very much.
Sarah Young has a unique approach. She words each daily devotional by rephrasing scripture as if Jesus was personally sitting down and chatting with you. Hope abounds!
Beautifully bound devotional.  Includes not only scriptures written out in full for each daily devotional but also an index in back with subject categories. Nice for personal use and a wonderful gift.
Such a great inspiration to my life .
Sarah Young's books have the ability to bring the Lord into your life as if He is speaking to a person. I start my morning every day reading her books.
Very inspiring.
This book is not laid out for daily reading. Each reading is a two page spread. I use it at night b4 bedtime because the Scriptures are written out and I don't have to look them up.
One of my favorite devotional books
"I can honestly say that this is not as good a ""Jesus Calling"" but it is a very good devotional if you're looking for something different to add to your daily Quiet Time."
I read this book everyday.  It is so inspirational and a great way to start the day. Perfect little book to start and end your day!!!
Absolutely love this book! Very Inspiring.
Wonderful and Inspiring!Words of life and renewal with hope for now and for the rest of our lives! Amen
Highly recommend this book to everyone .
"This is a beautiful reminder of God's love and protection in our lives as we are going through a difficult time. I really believe that Sarah Young is blessed with a gift writing and expressing messages of love. She is so clear and the messages are so relevant and encouraging. I also love how Sarah incorporates Bible verses to accompany her messages. Whenever I feel overwhelmed or just want a positive spin on my day, I pick up one of Sarah's devotionals and it changes my day and continues to change my life. I love buying these books for friends who always thank me for introducing them to the blessings of these devotionals. Highly recommend!!!"
I love her books.
I really enjoyed this book.  It has truly be a blessing to me.  I was going through some trying times when I started the book.  This book has giving me hope for now and the future.
"Really great way to start each day. In this version of Jesus Today all the scriptures are printed out, not just the reference to them."
"I read this book daily ,it get me through my day.Everyone should have one. I also purchased the one for children for my grandson. I wasn't sure how he would react, when I pick him up for a visit her always packs it."
Excellent read.  I love Sarah Young and all of her books!  My daughter has several of her books as well.Great gift for friends too.  Inspirational and devotional.
Wonderful writer and such a wonderful book.
"I lost my husband 5 weeks ago, I was 4 months pregnant with twins and lost one of the twins 12 days after he died. This book some days, is the only thing that has given me light on my very dark heart. Anyone that is desperately yearning for hope through Christ, this is a book you should have."
I started with Jesus Calling and now read Jesus Today and Jesus Lives.  I can't go a day without these amazing words to help me through the day.
Great
"I love Sarah Young.  Her daily meditations are excellent and on the mark.  They are short, but based upon scripture.  I have bought this book and some of her other books for myself and family."
"I enjoy her work, especially her daily devotionals,  and always look forward to her next book."
This is a fantastic accompaniment to her Jesus Calling devotional. I especially suggest this to anyone experiencing hardship in their life
This is my second devotional book by Sarah Young. She has a God-given talent for making the scriptures personal. I highly recommend Jesus Calling and Jesus Today.
I love this author and the way that she words it is as if Jesus is talking to you.
This book reminds you that you are never alone. GOD's love will see you through
"Just starting the book, but love it. A good Christian read."
I enjoyed the encouragement for each day and the Scripture readings included at the end of the readind. Thank you!
I keep this and 2 other Sarah Young books on my kindle to read and re-read each morning.  These devotionals are inspirational.  I would highly recommend.
Sarah Young is truly a gifted writer. This devotional is a wonderful way to start the day. It is such a reminder that Jesus is with us every day.
Excellent!
Great book also!
It's a great book that I keep on my bed side table. It's the first thing that I reach for each morning when I get out of bed. It helps start my day in the right way.
I already had one of hers and now this one....wonderful!
"I look forward to Sarah Young's devotions every morning to begin my day.  Her spiritual journey has enhanced my journey, too.  I have given this book to many of my friends who are looking for deeper relationship with Our Lord."
"Gave this to my wife, she loves it."
"Jesus Today, is great short devotional. It is written as if Jesus has sat down & is talking directly to you."
Great book. This book has helped me alot. Great buy.
An excellent book to bring you close to Jesus and give you comfort
Great passage daily.
Love Sarah Young very inspirational!
"I haven't begun this book yet, but her first book ""Jesus Calling"" is excellent.  It is as though Jesus is talking straight to you.  WoW!!"
i have one gave to a friend
It's like having Jesus sitting beside you on the couch in your living room. The Devotional books are so encouraging and uplifting. It's exactly what I'm feeling or going through that day.
Jesus today is an awesome book for anyone who needs to grows and experience Jesus in it's fulness
"In tandem with Jesus Calling, Streams In The Desert, and Power Devotions, each chapter was something I needed to be reminded of!"
"I am excited to have this devotional as well as Jesus Calling for me, and the Jesus Calling edition for children that my kids read from everyday (ages 10 and 13). The message are simple yet profound."
Wonderful book
"I read one page perr day just to get started on a positive note and it has helped out a lot, I am very happy."
[[ASIN:1400320097 Jesus Today: Experience Hope Through His PresenceAwesome book I use it as an evening devotional and it has helped me to draw closer to the Lord. Thank you Sarah Young.
Love this devotional especially since it ha the bible passage included in the daily readings. Sarah Young  is a favorite author of devotionals
"Love the book, read it all the time."
"Unbelievably uplifting, encouraging, and life-changing. I look forward to Sarah's passages from her books more than almost anything."
"I read this devotional every night before I go to sleep.  It's a good way  to end the day. I've enjoyed Sarah Young's other books too, and find that I re-read them."
"Another one of her good books, along with Jesus Calling, I believe it is a must have if you want a closer walk with Jesus."
A great little devotional  -  this is my 3rd Sara Young devotional and I really enjoy them.  Always good words for the day and quite often very applicable
Love starting my day with these devotions!
"I love this book greatly. After reading this book, I begin to talk to Jesus everyday whenever I am with myself and God. It make my alone time so sweet and full of meaning. Thank you, Sarah for writing this book."
Lovely gift and follow up book to Jesus Calling from Sarah Young.  Got my mom and myself a copy.
excellent!!!!  I loved it!
Great Devotional
"This is a wonderful book. It gives you hope for each day. My brother, who was just diagnosed with cancer, finds it keeps his spirits up and hope for the future.  Would highly recommend as a gift.."
She is amazing  author and how beautifully God uses her talents!!
I bought this as a gift. The recipient was uplifted and blessed.
"I have all Sarah Young's books.  I read them every morning but I have to say that ""Jesus Today"" is my favorite!  It really hits home when you are struggling.  Reading the preface you will understand why.  This is an amazing book and an excellent gift for someone who needs enchouragement.  God Bless you Sarah!"
Love the book Jesus Today.  Read it every morning.  It is very inspirational and encouraging you towards Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour.
Wonderful reading
Awesome Book!  A+++++
Sarah Young has a way of putting into words what you want to be true in your heart. We loved this book and would recommend it to anyone wanting to grow.
"Was as good as ""Jesus Calling"".  Not disappointed in Ms. Young's work.  It feels as though these are the messages God would be giving us if he were here on earth."
"I love inspirational books for a daily reminder to slow me down and get the day put into prospective.  I can start over from the beginning tomorrow as I've done with a couple other books such as Jesus Calling.  So easy to wake up and feel the presence  and the power of the spirit within.  Thank you to the author,"
"Books by Sarah Young are definitely written under the Anointing of the Holy Spirit.  Such uplifting books, you will never find any place else!  Love her books!"
This is a awesome devotion book. This is a book that you will use for many years.
I really like this book. I have put this book into the treasure list in my library as Jusus Calling. So I can read it again and again.
This is the best uplifting book I have ever read. Every page has an inspiring message; it feels as though Christ himself is speaking to you. Everyday I feel connected with the message. I can't wait to read Sarah Young's next book.
I bought 3 of these books for a family whose daughter is suffering with cancer. They are all moved by the daily readings.
This is just as good as Sarah Young's other devotionals.  A great way to think about your relationship with our Creator.
Wonderful book
"I love her Jesus Calling, but didn't like the layout of this particular book as it wasn't set up as a daily devotional."
Love this author
It is the best way to start the day and keep my focus on my relationship with Jesus Christ.
Read it everyday and share whenever I can
This book is filled with encouragement and hope.  Every day I have looked forward to reading what God says in his word.
This is an awesome devotional and at a great price!
"One of my favorite devotionals.  It was a very welcome gift.  I will give this as a gift to others, too.Practical, uplifting, scripturally accurate."
I was so disappointed to receive 6 of these today with $7.49 STICKERS on the FRONT (that don’t come off without ruining the “new” condition the book was bought. PLUS I paid $11.89 EACH not $7.49. These are for gifts. Will be returning. Would LOVE them without the stickers!!!! Thank you !
"I thought I was going to get more insight to the wonderful journey and relationship that Ms. Young described in her preface of Jesus Calling.  That was very fascinating.  So I was very disappointed when I purchased this and thought I would gain more insight with her wonderful relationship with our savior.  I will keep looking for such a book from her. The book that I am reviewing has only little snippets of things, leaving you panting for me. Not a bad little book, just not what I was looking for."
Hooked at the first book Jesus Calling! This is an even more personal version and has the scripture references written out. There is a page that will speak to you daily no matter what your circustances.
This devotional is perfect for the person who lives a crazy busy life and is on the go all the time. I find that it grounds and reminds me of what really is important. You will be filled up and charged for the day by reading this devotional.
"I love how the author makes Jesus's words so clear and how He is speaking directly to me!  It makes it so personal, like He truly is guiding me alone."
I loved Jesus Calling and this book is also superb in my opinion.  Reading as if Jesus were talking to you is the best way to start your day and keep you focused on Christ all day long.  It amazes me how perfectly the message fits each day with what is going on in my life.
I was given a copy for Christmas and love it.  This copy I purchased for my son who is going thru some tough times.
good book
Love this book!!!!!
"Like Jesus Calling, this devotional highlights messages from the scriptures in a personal way. The messages are relevant, encouraging and challenging, and the Bible verses they reflect are key verses for every believer. I've been so blessed by Sarah's devotional writing!"
This devotional is a uplifting read. You will surely be blessed by the words of encourgement found in this book. As with all of the Sarah Young books I have read this one will not disappoint.
"This book really helped me through my dark moments.  There were times when i cried out to God and I wonder if He cares.  But this book reassures me that God cares, and i just have to persevere in my prayer.  Thank you Sarah"
"I always love the books Sarah Young writes, this one is good just like all her others, my favorite is Jesus Calling, a great way to start the new year, a page a day!"
"I read this for comfort and daily support. My book has been read cover to cover so many times, I'll have to replace it soon."
Love anything by Sarah Young.
"No matter what kind of day you are having, you can open this one and find that special something to pick you up and help you to see God in the situation."
Great devotional
"This was a nice devotional. It did not have a whole years worth of readings though so I bought ""Dear Jesus"" to finish out the year."
Made a great gift!
"This, along with my Bible gave me new hope every morning. The only request I have is that you not use The Message Bible in your scripture reading. I would recommend this devotional to everyone."
"For everyone that has read Sarah's daily devotional, they will not be disappointed with this second one.  Sarah's journey of faith is publicly shared for all to accompan her."
"Another inspiring, encouraging book written as if the Lord is talking directly to me. It has the scripture references and scripture in the book. I think it is a perfect gift book for anyone."
Such a great devotional with many scriptures all tied up in one book that really speaks to my soul.
a blessing
I have all three of her devotional books and love the encouragement she gives straight from Scripture.  I have shared many of them with Bible study groups I teach.
"I love this book. I shared with my mother. She likes it alot. Family members recommened it to me. I would buy again if needed. Nice book, a great buy overall."
I start my day with this book.
There are many devotionals in my library but the ones written by Sarah Young are my favorites. Short devotions but so full of rich meaning. Love them all.
Great devotional for trying times
"Sarah Young is a very blessed, talented writer..Jesus speaks clearly if you open your ears and heart to listen."
"LOVE this book, Sarah Young has written another wonderful book for us who need encouragement.  She writes with such love of her Creator- God our Father.  Jesus Today is one of my favorites!"
I am using this book in conjunction with the Jesus Calling Devotional by Sarah Young.  I love this book.  Thank you Sarah Young.  There is hope.
Very nice cover.
Totally inspirational.  An excellent daily read. Have purchased several as gifts.
"I cannot express how much this book has helped me through my toughest time. Every time i picked up the book to read, it would tie into the kind of day i was having. Truly fantastic!!!"
The best book
"I recommend this devotion book to uplift your mood, hope and most of all your faith. I know that everyone will enjoy this book."
"This book arrived on the last day of the  alloted time period. However it was  well worth the wait because this book is just wonderful! Every ""believer"" should have it. In the past I've been giving out ""Jesus Calling"" books to people I thought would be blessed by it but now, this new book(by the same author)  is so wonderful I believe I will look into giving them out as my new ministry. I can't recommend it highly enough.... if you don't have it, order it! You will never be sorry as it feels like Jesus is talking directly to you addressing the very problem you are having that day! How much better can it get?"
Beautiful book. A spiritual gold mine. Tops all of Sarah's previous books. I read some passages every day for a great daily insight.
nice
every single time I open a page it is as if God wrote it just for me and what I amgoing thru exactly at this moment.  What a wonderful blessing.
highly recommend
I love all of Sarah Young books. This has a special emphasis on hope. I often read it before going to sleep.
Another great devotional in the style of Sarah Young.  The ease of application to personal life is excellent.
After using Jesus Calling for over two years and finding that it really me my needs.  I am finding that Jesus Today is the perfect next step.
Marvellous stuff; this book allows you to take your mind into the times of Jesus and his disciples. The step by step guide over the territory that Jesus covered and the ability to recreate these moments in our mind was so powerful. Thank you.
I like the fact that the scriptures are written out completely along with the message.  I find the messages seem to  apply to each person.  I use this book as a daily devotional as well as in my Prayer Group coffee that meets at my house once a week.  It is truly inspirational.
The book inspires you and encourages you to live one day at a time in the arms of our ever loving Lord and savior Jesus Christ. Curt
"Love this book and have given it to a friend, as a gift."
"I bought this Bible 9 years ago. I always had a hard time reading/ understanding most versions of the Bible and therefore didn't pick one up very much. This version of the amplified Bible with Joyce's  commentaries, explanations and life points changed my life.  I bought a beautiful fabric cover for mine and  it is very personal and dear to me. I write in it and store notes in it – it is a living, breathing thing for me. I would be devastated if I ever lost my copy."
"Joyce Meyer is by far my most favorite minister, preacher..what ever she is!  I watch her videos on YouTube everyday, and I read this BIBLE everyday.  I have to tell you, Joyce has inspired me into a closer relationship with Christ.  I'm not talking spiritual nonsense booha, I mean really spending time with him ever single day of my life, weekends and all; the first hour of my day as the sun is rising and a cup of coffee (or a few).  This BIBLE is perfect for me, and Joyce has changed my life, she has reached a part of me that no one else has been able to, and I mean that in before Joyce I was a Sunday Christian.  I knew deep inside it wasn't good enough, what Christ did for us on that Cross....it just wasn't good enough what I was giving him in return for the price he paid for my salvation. This is getting long, so to sum it up: This BIBLE is very intimate, Joyce has a sum it up that describes how she understands specific passages, her thoughts on passages, and Prayers to say out loud.  It's like having a friend in your head to give thoughts on what you just read, I find it very intimate and personal.  The pages are pretty thin just like a real bible, but it's pretty thick, my first ""Amplified"" BIBLE.  I love to highlight really meaningful passages and it bleeds through but that's with any BIBLE, and the pages get crushed but that's because I read it so much and it's constantly open and closing. If you're thinking about getting this BIBLE (no I don't get paid hehe) I would highly recommend you get this one. I honestly can't say I am not biased at this point but in my 100 percent honest opinion, it's the easiest to understand, in depth, most personal BIBLE I have ever read (I have read several different versions). That's my two cents, and I hope it helps. It's just a review, no words, or testimony can really describe how my life has changed since I bought this BIBLE, and started giving my time to the LORD. each. and. every. day. I have Joyce to thank for starting me on the right path, and once you go down the Path and really accept Jesus into your life and heart, you can't ever go back, you won't want to."
"A Pastor I know gets a new Bible every year, each year getting a different version. Every year I attempt to read the Bible in it's entirety, but never follow through. So in setting a new resolution for the coming year, I decided to try this version of an Amplified. I chose the soft cover, because I already had a Bible Cover to put it in. Contrary to other review, the print is a good size, readable with or without my bifocals. As with most Bibles, the pages are thin, so if you are like me, and highlight passages, it's best to use a gel highlighter. I'm getting a set of Bible Markers and a set of Bible Tabs with my next Amazon order. I love the commentary from Joyce Meyers. I have had a number of different Bibles, including Study Bibles, and feel that this is the best of the lot."
"This is an incredible study Bible for those looking for a good Amplified Bible. I appreciate the personal notes and commentary from Joyce considering I watch her sermons all the time. I will agree with some of the comments, mine did have some bent pages and the cover as well was bent. Honestly though, it’s the Message that counts. Not how it looks. It’s bought to be thoroughly used and loved. I’d recommend and buy this for new Believers or those trying to understand the Bible in a clearer sense with bigger print, this is perfect. I recommend using color pencil to highlight or underline due to the thinner pages (most Bibles are made this way, this isn’t a fault)."
"Content is superb!  As usual, Joyce Meyer inspires one with her notes and commentary in this Bible.  Were I rating the content, I would give it a 10 star review.  However, the ebook designers built in a glaring, serious fault:  They failed to put any chapter hyperlinks in this Bible.  This makes using this ebook version problematic at best and highly annoying at worst.  This is something so basic to ebooks that the ebook editors/creators should have noticed this right away.  If I am in a Bible study, how can I keep up with my group when I have to flip constantly until I find thw chapter in question?  The Hope For Today Bible has the same serious flaw, which is why I rarely use it.  Publishers need to correct this serious oversight and release an updated version with chapter markers or I won’t be able to use this version in serious study either."
"Beautiful! This study bible is filled with the just filled with the Holy Spirit. I've never had much of a desire to read the old testament till now. I love it because I can understand it. It's so much easier to get what's going on in the conversations and to understand what's going on in the though process of the biblical characters. I can't put it down. Absolutely worth the buy. But I do suggest getting a bible cover due to the thin cover & pages. Still, this bible is such a blessing!"
"This bible is a game changer for me.  Previously reading my bible felt more like a chore, and I wasn't getting as much out of it a I would have liked.  This version is much easier to understand and follow.Plus all the additional content from Joyce.  I love her explanations and stories, they add so much to my life and my heart.  I also really like the prayers she puts at the bottom of the pages that are related to the readings.I really urge you to try this.  I also have a student bible with additional texts added, but Joyce's words are so much more personal, and real life examples.  They speak to my heart in a deeper way.  Her personal examples help me pull more out of the bible and apply to my life."
"A friend at church had this bible and kept reading from it whenever we were comparing translations in bible study. Every single time that we compared her passages to ours, I loved the expanded wording, and the way it just seemed to flow together.Fast forward a month and of course I had to buy my own! This coincided with a personal challenge to finally read the good book all the way through, cover to cover, and it seemed perfect to start with a new translation in doing so.I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this one through. There are little blurbs throughout the pages that will provide an inspirational message relating to the passages you're reading. There is a short little prayer at the bottom of every page - and sometimes when I would sit back and just think on the page I'd read, my eyes would go to that prayer and I'd have to smile, because reading that little bit always seemed to sum it up beautifully.The only issue I have (and this is a VERY minor one) is that after a while all the expanded words do tend to be repetitive. I understand that not everyone is reading it straight through, and to have the definition of a word like Grace in the middle of a random passage will certainly help when you're just reading that passage as a standalone. But when I was thoroughly and carefully reading through chapter after chapter, I found myself skimming through the parenthesis'ed parts.BUT. Well done and Beautiful articles from Joyce Meyer all the way through. Expanded meanings added in carefully while preserving the original text outside the parenthesis so that it could be read with or without the amplified portions. Good quality pages and sturdy binding.This is a bible that I will cherish for years :)"
See picture i posted....  This is ABSOLUTELY WRONG! The believers will be taken and the non believers left.  I have found several other things that do NOT coincide with the king james bible and makes me wonder what all else if COMPLETELY wrong in this Bible that I am not aware of. I even bought my grown daughter one of these Bibles but now I intend on getting it back from her. I will not be responsible for handing down nor recommending wrongful teaching of God's word as it is apparent this Joyce Myers bible does.
"I love this Bible. I was having an emotional breakdown with battles of everyday life and having another unwanted suprise, I opened it up to psalm 7 and then read Joyce's devotion on God dealing with our emotions! So perfect!"
"I purchased this a month ago and I am already looking for a replacement Bible. There is exaggeration in some of the verses and it's not due to the amplification.  If the KJV says...""and He loved Him...This Bible says ""and He loved Him and honored him and favored Him...Why all the incorrect extra? plus some verses that are in the KJV have been omitted from this Bible. I purchased it because I enjoy watching Joyce, but I need more accuracy when it comes to the Bible."
"I have used this wonderful Bible for 5 years now, so when my friend had a birthday, I bought her a copy too.  I have grown closer to God from studying with this Bible, for the explanations and the Greek and Hebrew translation is written for the common man.  Joyce Meyer also adds input throughout and somehow, this makes the Bible more personal for the reader."
"I do love this bible sooo much that I ordered one for my mom.  I just opened it as I am now going home to see her in Texas. This is what I saw when I opened it.  Heart broken.  It was for her 80th birthday. I’m going to give it 3 stars to see if customer service notices it.  This was a packing issue, not an in transfer situation. They must be more careful.  This was to be a specialGift."

   I have always struggled with reading the Bible because of the translations that are available and navigating in the Bible app is just as hard. I love what Joyce did with this by having life notes and blurbs about specific scriptures its really great for students, young adults, and anyone who just wants to dig deeper into His Word. Best $30 spent ever. Get this book, at first I was upset it was a hardcover instead of a paperback but the hardcover is so much better (I've seen people with the paperback)"
"This is the Best bible I have ever had. The print is Large print, which is excellent. I love the flexible binding.The notes, it is an excellent addition. And not a study bible, So you Learn from the Holy Spirit. I like the pages, you can use the specialpencils now available, that doesn't leak through.I am on my way to conf in phx and this was my gift to me.didn't think I would like amp. bible, but it is excellent and helps me grow."
"Didn't even KNOW it was in slightly larger print that is friendly to sixty-something eyes, but my sister was thrilled to receive it and said that she hadn't even realized that her previous study bible was getting so much harder for her to read. She'd never read anything by this author before and I'd gotten a recommendation from a very kind work colleague (I'm an atheist, but I LOVE my sister and we respect one another and I wanted to get her something she would love and cherish for Christmas). She LOVED it and has been telling me for weeks how much she's enjoying her new study Bible!  So, this bible is so popular it has even been purchased by happy atheists!  Highly recommended. Large book, but not too heavy, suitable for older adults. Pages are thin but seemed sturdy enough. Makes a great gift."
"I can't imagine having a Bible that you can't pull up any chapter and verse you want  without going to the beginning and turning page by page to get to chapter and verse you want? I love the Bible itself, but it's horrible to use for Bible study or even with church, takes forever to find a chapter and verse you want. Please help...I cannot find anything about this Bible anywhere. Thank you"
"I love the Everyday Life Bible, Amplifed version, with Joyce’s notes. However, the Kindle version is frustrating trying to get around in. There are no chapter/verse hyperlinks to click on to take you to a specific chapter or verse. Come on publisher, fix this!"
I use to read the bible here and there but some parts were so biblical and over my head I just would close it and sigh.  Joyce's bible is everything I was looking for.  She explains each section in layman's terms.  Easy to follow and understand now.  I wish I found this sooner.
"As a new follower of Jesus, this bible was the perfect bible for me! I have always found traditional bibles hard to understand and perhaps that is why it has taken me so long to find Jesus in my life! This bible makes everything so much easier to comprehend with translations of old words that are no longer used in our language and with blurbs throughout from Joyce that sum up each area and how the message applies to modern day. And for those who aren't quite comfortable with prayer yet, the ""speak the word"" found at the bottom of certain pages are a great place to start.This is a wonderful bible and I foresee gifting it in the future to friends and family!"
It is worth the money. So pretty. And. The words are not too small. My aunt loved it for Mother’s Day. $60 was a lot but it was worth it because she absolutely loved it. She took it out the box and started using it ASAP. She sat on the deck and enjoyed it. So pretty.
"I just got my copy of The Everyday Bible in the mail yesterday and started studying it last night.  Wow!  After a long, busy day, Joyce's commentary on the expanded content really helped me consider what I was reading.  She's effective and complete in her thinking.  I am loving the font of the text and the overall layout.  This is Bible is informative and gets you thinking in new directions about the Word.  My only complaint is that I wish the paper was a little more substantial.  However, the texture is similar to a leather-bound Bible.  I've been reading the New American Standard Bible since I was a teenager and have loved it.  Now I have another way to dig into the scriptures and expand my understanding.  Definitely a must-have!"
"Already have a hard copy of this Bible.  I like the digital version, because it is easy to hold and read on my 8-inch tablet.  Very much like all the features that are available for highlighting and bookmarking, etc. that are available when reading using the Kindle app.  Also easy to take on trips.  An excellent product - especially if you like the comments, explanations, and observations by Joyce Meyer."
"This version of the Bible makes reading FUN again.  The amplified edition gracefully slips synonyms and word meanings into the text where I would've previously been confused.  Plus, Joyce Meyer's potent insights help to make certain topics  really 'pop' in your mind and spirit.  I can't enough.  Joyce Meyer and her editors did an excellent job with this Bible."
"********* 8/8/2012 Update!**************************Just purchased my second Everyday Life Bible! I wanted the Pink and chocolate version and gave my hard cover to my sister who loves this bible! I take this bible with me to church every Sunday for my sister who loves this bible. I decided to go ahead and give her my hard cover bible and purchase me another one.. My sister is so happy! I am so happy with my pink and chocolate soft cover.. every thing is the same except for the cover.This bible will help you grow and keep you walking and loving in the spirit instead of the flesh! I use this bible with my bible studies. I have so many bibles, but lately this has been the bible that I carry to work with me everyday and use everyday.  We are both so happy! Now my sister, my aunt and I all have this bible and we all love this bible. I plan on giving this bible out a gifts, this will make the perfect gift! If you have not purchased this bible, you are missing out! The bible is the best book every written and it is so full of everything you need to know! Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth B.I.B.L.E****************first review**********************I absolutely enjoy this bible! So much that I am thinking of purchasing a second one to leave at work. I Have this version in hard back and I carry a small women's devotional bible with me to work, however this bible seems to come to life and speak to me and I have started carrying this bible to work with me everyday..This bible is so understandable and the foot notes and commentary are so right on time and to the point! You will learn so much from this bible! While at work when it came time for lunch, I did not eat anything but the word! Went home and ate dinner with my family! All this week all I have wanted to do was eat the word!Well back to more of the living and true word of the Lord!You will not be disappointed!"
"I love to read anything that Joyce Meyers publishes, this amplified Bible makes it easy to understand the Bible better, and her notes that she adds helps to put examples to what this or that means. She uses many examples but a lot of them are stories out of the Bible and stories of her on life experiences. It really gives clarity to a lot of things in the Bible that can sometimes be hard to understand.👍"
Very disappointed with this paperback the font is so small can't read it even with my glasses on. Want to return but Amazon won't allow me to cause its pass the return window. I should stop buying products from Amazon
"I love and admire Joyce Meyer and have been following and learning from her for decades. I saved up for this Bible only to find that when it arrived, the pages are way too paper-thin. I was afraid of ripping it every time I turned a page. The content was wonderful and easy to read, but I returned it because of the thinness of the pages and had no problem in doing so."
"I found this Bible a little cheaper here on Amazon. I ordered the hardcover, & it’s in great shape. I love Joyce Meyer’s ministry & wanted a different type of study a Bible to go with others I already have. This will get a lot of use.I’m not happy about the delivery, though. The package was handed off to the Post Office & was placed in a mailbox that our office doesn’t use instead of being brought to my desk (in the lobby) like all other packages that are delivered here. I had to call Amazon to figure out where it went, and then walk outside for 10 minutes in the cold & wind to retrieve it from that mailbox."
"Every book of Joyce Meyers that I have read has ALWAYS been extremely helpful and pleasing to me.  She is a great teacher and her life mirrors mine is sooo... many ways it is not funny. This bible is a really helpful tool to have in the way that she designed it. The life applications, challenges, revelations and inspiring commentary helps me tremendously to understand what the Lord God is saying to His people in each chapter.  Truth that I need to understand for myself as I move forward each day in knowing Him more, understanding His will for my life and walking victoriously as a Believer in Christ Jesus."
This is my favorite Bible ever! I love how it breaks everything down for you so you can understand what the Bible passages are saying and how it has life lessons and little prayers that relate to what your reading. It really helps me focus more on the Bible chapters that I’m reading and really retain it. I love getting Joyce Meyers perspective on things. She always inspires me. It’s just a great way to really help you study the Bible especially for those of us who aren’t great at doing that on our own. It’s like having a Bible teacher at your fingertips any time you want to learn about the living word.
I like this Bible Joyce Meyer's offer it's easy reference on my Amazon Kindle when I don't have my Bible handy she has notes that also explain scripture I did downloaded the sample 1 St I actually seen the book in hard cover That's why I got the this on Kindle because of traveling & cheaper on Kindle than to buy the book its self & you can highlight on the Kindle I have in color I have a very update tablet Kindle
"Great study tool. Not because it has Joyce Meyers notes (which are pretty much the same from some of her books); but because it is an Amplified version of the Bible! The Clarity of the scriptures come to life through this version of the Bible. Love it!!!UPDATEI bought a second bible as a birthday present to a friend. Even though beautiful, the Bible was shipped with no wrapping at all. Just placed in a box and left on my front porch on a rainy day. Books are precious... they should be handled with care."
"Okay I have a list of bibles and books I plan to purchase so for this month I choose the amplified Bible. This is one of my favorite 6 translations, I absolutely love Joyce she is just so funny I like to watch one of her sermons once a week, I have never had the Everyday life Bible and desperately wanted my own copy so I got a used hardcover copy which is excellent with a few highlights but that’s okay!!! I love the way this Bible Reads I feel I can actually Understand The Old Testament which is amazing...  This Bible is Awesome and I’m working on Reading it through!"
"I have prayed with the Amplified Bible for well over a year - it is my preferred version - and I hesitated for several months as to whether or not to buy the Everyday Life Bible. Many a times the Holy Spirit has used Joyce Meyers as a channel of encouragement, instruction and needed correction in my walk with the Lord, but I didn't know how much this version of the Amplified Bible would be different to the ""regular"" version of the Amplified Bible. Although the scripture is the same in both versions, Joyce Meyers has added a lot to make the Everyday Life Bible a buffet for Christians! Throughout the scriptures she takes a verse or two and makes a little prayer nugget that makes the verse(s) applicable to today. She has also written several short teachings on several versus that again brings the scriptures alive and that alone can be used as a topic/teaching for one whole time of prayer since it is condensed but says so much. I can't recommend this Bible enough. If you like the Amplified Bible and find Joyce Meyers to be a great instrument in deepening your walk with God, you will not be disappointed with this purchase.On a practical note, the hardcover version is a lot thicker than the bonded leather version because the pages are a little thicker. It is the same material. Even though they are a tad bit thicker, I still find that the pages fold too easily and can get crumpled when flipping through it to move between Bible books if you are not careful. I find this aspect frustrating, but I can deal with that because the content is so rich."
"I have been trying to read many bibles and having a hard time. I just received this bible and I am understanding what I am reading and. I feel really good about that. It also gives you insight about how to use it in today’s world. At 60 yrs. old, I sat in church ( Catholic ) all my life and started to question myself about being there. Out of nowhere I felt lost. I have faith ,believe and know how blessed I am and how much God has done for me and all the prayers he answered.I owe him more by accepting Jesus Christ as my  Lord and Savior.  I know this book will help me get there. I want to live through him in his likenessLIVE THROUGH THE WORD AND NOT THE WORLDNO PEACE- NO GODKNOW PEACE- KNOW GOD"
"What more can I add to what has not been positively mentioned in previous reviews?  Combining the 

  
Amplified Bible









  
  
    
   with commentary from Joyce Meyers is an inspirational and affirmation to faith.While admittedly I am not regular viewer of her television program, I nonetheless have to laud Mrs. Meyer's contributions to this Bible.  Scattered throughout the book are articles and commentary as short as the single sentence ""Speak the word"" confessions to page long ""Everyday Life"" articles that elaborate on the circumstances of an event and how it applies to believers.  Like her program, all of the commentary is meant to inspire believers and have them apply those ethics into practice.  If you enjoy Joyce Meyer's teachings or just looking for an admirable Bible of Amplified text, this should be itAbout the only negative I can see is the materials quality.  The Everyday Living Bible perpetuates the tissue paper-like pages in most Bibles that make it dubious for marking in thin inks and highlighters. I will admit it is a small matter - comments to similar declarations resulted in replies to use colored pencils."
"Delivered in the suggested timeline. The Everyday Life Bible is exactly what I was looking for! It provides practical life applications which is very, very helpful."
"The Best bible for every day reading. I've passed this bible onto my grown children and they too enjoy reading it. There is never a substitute for the tried and true ESV or King James Bible, However; any bible that prompts the reader to pick it up, enjoy the time spent reading it, is well worth it. Would highly recommend."
"This Bible is worth its weight in gold.  Its set up & presentation is excellent for reading (even for me, a senior).  Joyce's insights & challenges to live in the Word are awesome.  I am very pleased with this Bible"
I had not bought a bible in decades.  I used to watch Joyce Meyers and was attracted to her personality and message.  This bible is perfect for me and use it daily.  I really like the addition of all of Joyce's comments and guidance.  Easy to study.
"I really love the weight of this book.  I am especially enjoying Joyce's notes as another educational tool. The print is a little bigger, so no squinting (I don't wear glasses but I don't want to be squinting either)."
"I absolutely love this Bible! Joyce makes reading and most importantly understanding the Bible so much easier. There are sections that give you practical suggestions of how to put His word into practice in your everyday life, specific explanations of certain words or verses l. There are even places in the Bible to make your own notes. It's the perfect Bible for anyone, but especially for someone like me that sometimes needs that bit of extra help to understand exactly what is being said. I wish I had been introduced to this Bible years ago...but better now than never. Truly an amazing Bible at a truly amazing price. If someone you know needs a new Bible...this one is the one. Enjoy reading!!"
I really like Joyce Meyer and I love the amplified bible. Her commentaries in the book are classic Joyce Meyer. She's very knowledgeable when it comes to scripture. So glad I have this bible on my tablet!
"I purchased the paperback edition, which works well for me. It is very thick, but the biggest bonus is the commentaries by Joyce. They are kind of recap or introduction to each book of the Bible. Includes references to scripture. I highly recommend purchasing."
Nothing was wrong with the Bible itself. The came with the Bible that it was unwrapped without plastic and the Bible came in with another item that was wrapped with plastic on a rainy day. The pages was wet. Very upset because I was gifting that Bible to someone important to me. I decided to just go to a book store afraid to order another book to come in destroyed from it not being wrapped.
"I got this bible for myself 6 yrs ago and have been blessed beyond measure b/c of it.  I've bought them for friends numerous times and have been told that they found them to be just as helpful.  Joyce Meyer's insights and her personal words of knowledge from the Lord are captivating.  I thoroughly enjoy reading the scripture, getting what I get out of it, and then reading her .02 to it.  She has a way of making one feel built up and wanting to take ownership over our flesh so that we can glorify God and we should.  I enjoy the amplied b/c it gives all the other possible definitions for the original greek and hebrew words so that nothing is lost in translation.  Even my husband enjoys reading the The Enjoying Everyday Life Bible and that is a miracle!!!  Thanks be to God for continually calling His children to Him especially when our hearts have become hardened to Him due to our disobedience.  HE LOVES US no matter what we do or say.  He could never love us more OR less.  He is what He is, and Joyce has an amazing gifting from God to help those who read this bible to see it.  God Bless!"
"Very nice.  I already had this but like so much that I bought this one as a gift.  Nice pink leather, love the insites and study guides.  Very easy to read. Can spend 15 minutes of devotion or hours in study with the study guides.  Very nice."
"Where ever you are in your spiritual walk with God.... a lifelong Christian or new Christian, this is the easiest and most understandable Bible you could ever have. Joyce’s commentary and notes of life points and how to put the words to work truly help drive the scriptures home. This Bible has blessed me in more ways than I could have ever imagined and I look forward to my daily devotions more now than ever. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
Gave this to my sister and she loves it. Says the print is easy to read and she used a yellow highlighter with no bleed through to the next page (which was a concern to me after reading several reviews). I couldn’t be more pleased!
"FINALLY a Bible I can understand. I've always wanted to read the entire Bible, and this one is it! I love Joyce Meyer, and  her words of faith and encouragement within this Bible are wonderful.  I very highly recommend  this !"
"This is a wonderful Bible that is so easy to read. It is the Amplified Bible with Notes and Commentary by Joyce Meyers. This additional information helps the reader understand what passages mean in context to our everyday lives right now. It is a Bible that once you start reading, you don't want to put it down. It is a little thicker than the standard Amplified Bible but it is easy to handle, the pages are good quality and the print is very easy to read especially if you have older eyes. Another very big plus is that Joyce Meyers has done the research using cross references etc. that takes much time and effort so when you open this wonderful book the research has already been done for you. All in all, it is a great value, a worthy produt and the context is life saving!"
I love Joyce and I have really been intentional about getting deeper into Gods word.  The bible is the perfect resource as Joyce provides great commentary and explanation throughout.  I highly recommend this bible!
"Such a great Bible, I love the Amplified version of the Bible, so easy to read and helpful. This version makes me look forward to reading it because Joyce Meyer has such encouragement and great insight into passages. This Bible is so full of advice, stories, encouragement, on every page she has multiple side notes. I'm surprised this Bible isn't 1 million pages long!"
"I am a big fan of Joyce Meyer, and the Every Day Life Amplified Bible is the best Bible I have ever purchased. The print is perfect, I love the size of this Bible, the individual Book introductions,  life lessons are very helpful, and I love her commentary throughout the Bible. The Bible is written so it is very easy to understand."
"What a great way to take your Bible on vacation with you, instead of having to worry about your luggage being overweight!  My vacation recently was so enhanced having my amplified version with me in my Kindle.  This Bible is the best one I own.  It explains and comments on various chapters with a focus on today's living in relationship with God's word.  I love that each book begins with the focus and overview.  It sets my mind to the mode for more understanding.  l love this Bible.  I have grown so much spiritually because of the commentaries. If you want easy access to your Bible, I would highly recommend getting the Kindle version of Joyce Meyer's amplified version of The Abundant Life Bible."
This Bible is so very helpful with the side notes of Joyce Meyer throughout. She takes everyday issues and circumstances and shows you how the Bible correlates to how it relates to todays's culture.
I love this version of the Bible! I'm in a bible study and it really helps me understand the text. Meyer's does incerts through out which help you gain a deeper understanding of what you are ready making it so much easier to grasp. It's very thought provoking and speaks to me at a level that I can better comprehend.
"I LOVE anything Joy Meyer writes and this is no exception. It helps me to understand the Scriptures. I think it's important to remember that this study Bible was written by a human being, so keep your mind open to what she shares and what God is ALSO saying to you through the Scriptures themselves."
"I purchased this bible for myself quite a few years ago was the 2006 edition.  Purchased this new edition to give as a birthday gift.  While Joyce's message is on point, the quality is really bad,  very thin paper and smaller text and printed in China versus my 2006 version which was printed in the USA."
This is one of many bibles I use.  Joyce give really helpful notes.  I am blessed to facilitate at our men's bible class from time to time and when I have the opportunity the note and comment help with my preparations.
"I wish I had noticed, somewhere in my researching this bible, that Jesus’ words are not in red letters.  Aside from that it is written in easy to understand vernacular and Joyce Meyer’s notes and commentary is done in such a way as to bring me to where I understand and can apply the word to my daily life."
This is a beautiful Bible- much larger than I had expected. Looking forward to reading it thru; almost finished reading Women’s Devotional Bible. Anxious to read Joyce’s commentaries.
"I LOVE JOYCE! I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS BIBLE A 5 STAR REVIEW, EXCEPT FOR ONE THING:  THE THINNESS OF THE PAGES. I LOVE THAT ITS LIKE THE OLDER BIBLES AND THE PAGES SEEM ALMOST VINTAGE, BUT THEY ARE NOT GOOD FOR HIGHLIGHTERS OR EVEN GEL PENS! THE COLOR RUN THROUGH TO PREVIOUS PAGES AND I'M HAVING TO BE SO CAREFUL JUST TURNING THE PAGES MOST TIMES. OTHER THAN THAT ITS A BEAUTIFUL FACT FILLED BIBLE. AND I LOVE THAT SHE GIVES YOU MESSAGES THAT PERTAIN TO WHAT ON THE PAGE, SHE BREAKS STUFF DOWN AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT!! SORRY JOYCE OF THE 4 STARS!"
"The Enjoying Everyday Life Bible is one of my favorites.  Joyce's teaching notes is one of the main reasons.  They are in just the right places and bring a practical application and inspiration.  It also has a Sinner's Prayer in the back if you are looking to give a gift to an unsaved loved one.  Also, a lot of themes to look up such as Depression or Prosperity with lots of Scripture references underneath.  A must have for your own personal use and/or library."
"This is a really good bible for those who want in addition to the bible, all the insight that Joyce Meyers offers tucked in some of the pages as commentary.  This is the amplified version, introductions in the front of each chapter, nice size print but not huge, footnotes, Life Articles, Life Points and much more in this great bible.  It is 1 3/4 thick hard back book, about 9 1/4"" length and probably weights a 1-2 pounds (not sure of exact weight)I have one and I buy it to give as gift as well."
"I use this Bible every day.  Initially I thought it would be helpful to use in situations when I was uncertain about the meanings of different passages.  It has proved to be a wonderful tool that I use every day.  I didn't realize how much of Joyce Meyer's study notes were in this Bible.  She has a way of explaining the Bible that I can connect with.  Easy to understand everyday language and Joyce's easy way of explaining hard concepts is a win-win for me.  It is not a very portable Bible.  Considering the amount of information included, it is bulky.  The print it not overly large, but then again that would only add to the size of the Bible.  Truly a must have if you are trying to understand and apply the Bible to your daily life."
"I have been looking at this Bible for a while trying to decide if I would like it.  Well, I absolutely Love it!!  It is easy to read and understand and the notes from Joyce Meyer are exceptional.  She has so much insight and knowledge and really brings out good points and it does teach you how to use it in everyday life.  I will have to say this is my new favorite Bible, before it was the Life Application Bible.  You won't go wrong with this Bible if you want to study different subjects or just read.  In the back there are different topics that she has listed all the scriptures that pertain to that subject. The only thing I would change is order it in Leather.  I encourage you to get this Bible."
"This was a gift for our sister. She got it today and was so excited about having it she stopped eating lunch to read some of it. This edition is updated from my version, but it is the best study bible I have ever used."
I love Joyce Meyer. But I’m not so keen on this bible. It just has so many interpretations in parentheses that for me it takes away from my reading the scripture.

   I like the fact that shipping was veryyyyyy fast!!!!!!I must say I am in love with this book you must know however that’s it’s very huge and weighty however it’s a must have."
SO FAR I LIKE THIS BIBLE. SOME OF THE WORDS ARE NOT IN SIMPLE TERMS. HAS MORE VOCABULARY THEN YOUR NIV VERSION. IF YOU NEVER READ THIS BIBLE YOU NEED TO LEARN HOW TO UNDERSTAND IT. IT DOES GIVE YOU MORE DETAILS TO UNDERSTAND THE VERSES BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT CAN GET REAL WORDY. I CONSIDER THIS MORE OF A PERSONAL BIBLE NOT A BIBLE TO USE TO READ TO A CONGREATION OR PREACH WITH. BECAUSE IF IT WOULD TAKE YOU 5 MINTUES TO READ A CHAPTER IT MIGHT TAKE YOU 10 MINTUES NOW DUE TO ALL THE EXTRA EXPLANATION THEY GIVE YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE VERSE. (MY OPINION). IM STILL ADJUSTING ON HOW IT WORKS. I LIKE IT BUT ITS TAKING ME SOME TIME.
Sent these to a prison and had to order more because the inmates loved and understood the bible for the first time.  Joyce has a way of explaining each chapter and then these individuals can apply what they have learned.  They were very impressed.
This a great bible. I have used it for years and gave this as a gift. The person who received it said they lived it and was so helpful in understanding what they read.
"I love this book. It gives new, clearer understanding of the Holy Bible. I have gifted others with a copy because it is so easy to understand. Joyce's comments & explanations are welcomed."
"This bible reads simply and is a good study bible.  It is also a good ""first"" bible for those seeking God's word. It is missing some information like maps and concordance. Beautiful cover and font size."
I have probably 10 different Bibles sitting around in various places in my home.  I really have a hard time understanding most all of them.  Joyce takes a great version and makes it even better by adding everyday experiences that relate to certain passages in the Bible.  This really hits home for me and makes it all much easier to understand.  Joyce also gives you advice on how to apply this to your everyday life and I love it.  I am finally feeling like I am getting it and believe me I have been trying to read the Bible for years.  This is the one I pick up everyday to read because it is enjoyable and I it makes me think and apply things to my current life.  This is a great Bible and I have nothing but good things to say about it.
love this Bible. The additional teachings and insights help the reader stop and take the time to really think about what the Bible is saying and teaching us.
Excellent. I listen to Joyce Myers on the Christian Chanel and have always appreciated her contribution to Christian teaching.  The bible is easy to follow along with its commentary and her input on various topics.  The outlining of scriptures at the bottom of each page is a useful way of learning and memorizing important scriptures which may be of great use along the Christian Journey.
This bible is wonderful to learn the word of God.  Joyce Meyers is a great teacher and her input about all the books of the bible are very helpful.
"Love the Amplified version of the Bible. However I wish this would have been the newer version of Amplified. Also, I prefer when a Bible is written in paragraphs where the thoughts of the writer were grouped together instead of being broken into verses (which breaks up the sentences). This one is written by verse. The font size is really nice and easy to read. Like Joyce's messages included in pages."
I am really enjoying this bible.  I use it everyday for devotionals. I love the extras it has for believers to make their time more memorable.
Pages are very very thin. Would not have purchased it if I knew how thin they are.
Reading and studying this version of the Bible is wonderful along with Joyce Meyers notes and extrapolation made reading and understanding the Bible much easier great version of the Bible to read and study
I love the amplified Bible! It gives clarification of word meaning is based on the original language of the Bible which is Greek and Hebrew
I do love it but wish I would have ordered it in big print. It is very small print. Even if you don't wear glasses I think you will be disappointed in the fine print. Other than that I do love it.
Absolutely love this bible. It is easy to read and Joyce’s personal messages add a lot to the content. Would recommend it to someone just starting to learn the Bible
"I have been watching Joyce Meyers on Tv for some time and I am going to go to her womens conference in Sept. I was interested in this bible because it has her commentary. Bible is nice, leather bound, pages are nice and I like the print, it is larger then normal. Of course Joyce Meyers has some great insight. I have never had an amplified version before I prefer the NLT but this is an easy to read and understand and its very nice because since it is amplified, it just explains with a different word what you read, so very easy to understand I am happy with my purchase and would purchase this for family or friends! A+ and I am thinking about taking it down to the Christian book store to get engraved, this is about 15-20 cheaper then buying at our local bookstore and the amazon staff was very prompt in answering my emails as well as the book arrived before it had been promised.Very Pleased!"
I love this bible and Joyce Meyers lessons this is the best of both words I love how it broken down and that this bible the wording is so easy to understand i look forward to how God will speak to me through this
"I really this like easy to read Bible with the highlights and comments. Only negatives: even though the pages are very thin, it is heavy."
Misleading writer and words. Do your research on the writer and their beliefs before ever buying someone's book. Lesson learned
"The Everyday Life Bible is written in straight-forward language making it easy to read.  The ""30 years of study notes"" which have been inserted by Joyce Meyer periodically throughout the book are really helpful to understanding not only passages but the individual books in general.  Many of the personal notes help the reader understand how biblical principles relate to everyday living.  The topical index at the end of the Book is a truly wonderful aid in referencing needed passages in good times and in difficult times.  I highly recommend this Bible.

  
The Everyday Life Bible: The Power of God's Word for Everyday Living (Bible)"
"I love her explanation of how the descriptions of each readings mean because I have a hard time understanding things she just opens my eyes and makes it a pleasure to want to read the Bible without making it sound so boring and tedious, because I never thought I would understand she opened my eyes! Thank God for her and her books and everyday living shows!"
The commentaries to help me understand what I am reading is so helpful.  It makes my study more comprehensive and enjoyable when I understand what I am reading.
I got my Bible just 2 days ago and I am already in love with it. I have liked Joyce Meyer for a long time and always appreciated her humor on Television. I am reading the Left Behind series because I had only read half of them before and not in order this time I read them in order and I have one more book to read after I finish the one I am reading.I have used The Everyday Life Bible to read the bible verses in the book. I love how easy it is to read and understand. I also love all the additional information that is available.  Thank you Ms. Meyer
"I met you on TV. I am Catholic, but Ms Joyce (I like hearing about Dave too) you have such a gift. I just wish you knew how much you mean to a lot of people by giving us the messages God wants us to have. I email my cousin about you and he has had connections with JD Jakes and I read his book ""I am Loosed"". I have 3 of your books including the ""Bible"". And Mam, I could use a little shot of you about every 2-3 hours, you set my day. But I thank God for you, you put it where it should be, to me the way Jesus would have talked to us if He were here now. You have a big place in my heart, I will always be your cheerleader. Thank you and I have learned from you, not to give glory to you, but our Lord--but He did good with you."
I love that Joyce has given her interpretation and meaning. Helps me be able to read and understand the word.
"This version is easy to read in simplistic terms for someone like me that cannot understand King James version.  I've always wanted to read the full Bible, but have been neglectful because of the difficulty in understanding. This is refreshing. The book also provide key points in the chapters and how to apply to our lives."
"Love, love Joyce. Paperback cover, wish it looked a little more like a bible. Content is great."
"Very good for every women because Joyce Meyer teaches to put the Word of God in practice, using real life cases as example.Good size letters, dinamic layout.I love to read it and highlight my favorites verses and comments!Excellent Bible! God bless Joyce Meyer! God bless you!"
This book is very helpful it helps you understand a lot of things in the bible. Joyce Myers is a great person I love all of her books!
I personally love this bible and decided to buy one for a friend... I hope she loves it..
I have been looking for a bible like this for years and years.  Something in plain English and something I actually like reading.  The way it is set-up with the life points and the explanations of each book it actually reads like a book and I can see the correlations to the stories in the book and my life experiences now! This book is a great for people who are beginning in studying the word and veterans in word!  I hate to put the book down sometimes but life always interrupt a good book!
Love love love Joyce Meyers and her version of the Bible.
I have been having a hard time understanding the bible & this bible has put it in wording I can understand. If you are having a hard time getting the bible this will help. Plus there are notes and joyce kinda gives her own input on it as well.
Love this Bible!  Love how Joyce comments and bible studies help go more deep into the scripture and how to apply what I learn to my daily life.  Recommend it a 💯 %
I’m unbelievably pleased with this Bible. I am trying to get closer with God and spend more time with him.
"Nice big book, but for ME the print is too small. I should have check that."
Was recommended by a friend. Really like it. Bought for my sister too. Love the side notes. Leads to positive discussiin.
"My best friend sent this bible to me a couple of years ago, and then mentioned that she would love to have one a few weeks ago.So, I sent her one.  Now we both are reading Joyce's bible everyday.Besides the easy reading of the bible, Joyce adds her comments.  It's almost like hearing her everyday, as I do on her Enjoying Everyday Life study.  She is the best, and really brings alot of things home for me, and my friend.  She tells it like it is!I would definately suggest anyone that wants a closer relationship with Jesus to get this bible.Take care, and God bless you all,~Lynda~"
"I love it, I use it for bible studies and Sunday School classes.  Wealth of information ,easily  understood reading."
I love this Bible. It is easy to read and the little inspirational remarks by Joyce are spot on.
"Joyce allows the reader to understand the Bible as it can apply to everyday life.  But keeps to the integrity of the Word without diluting or interpreting it in any false way.  No matter if you are new to Christianity or a life long believer, the Amplified Bible provides the reader with a richer and more meaningful way to view scripture.  Comes beautifully gilt edged, leather cover and boxed.  Very happy with this seller, item arrived early, in excellent condition and would purchase again from them."
"The Everyday Life Bible is interpreted and written in such a manner that it is very easy reading.  I had scheduled an exact number of pages to be read so that I would complete the whole bible in one year.  However, I enjoy the story content so much that some days I just can't stop reading and am ahead of my own set schedule!  Joyce's insight and explainations seem to hit home on the days when I need it most.  I had also purchased as a Christmas gift a copy for my daughter--she absolutely loves it.  Her husband has picked up her bible and become engrossed in the way Joyce explains the details and stories in the bible.  I would definitely recommend this book for those who are truly interested in the every day language and enjoyable reading of God's word."
Joyce always puts out quality products. I have loved everything she has done. Shes honest and easy to understand.
"I have not only purchased one of these for myself, I have also purchased two as gifts. It is a normal Ampified Bible, but with Joyce Meyer adding in how she has personally interpreted/applied the lesson to her own life, which can be helpful for those trying to figure out how the Bible can be interpreted into every day life."
I really enjoy the added notes. It helps to understand the Bible better. Joyce Meyer has a gift from God.
the Bible can be difficult to understand but this Bible is much easier to read especially when Joyce Myers helps explains what your reading ..
A lovely Bible.....Joyce Meyer's insights are wonderful.  As always!
Love love love this bible ... it keeps me interested and easy to read...
Recommend. Love Joyce Meyer and her amplified Bible is a must read!
I really like this bible. It's easy to read and I love the side notes by Joyce. She did an awesome job relating the scripture to our everyday life. I have several translations of the bible and the amplified version is definitely my favorite.
This Bible is great easy to understand and also has pages in the book that break it down to better understand
This is exactly what I was looking forward.  Reading the bible on a two year schedule.  Love Joyce's commentary.  I am encourage and look forward to reading my Bible everyday.
This Bible is wonderful to use as a study Bible. I love to read the commentary by Joyce and really see how the situations are related to things that we face today. Anything that is true to the Word and can strengthen your relationship with Him is definitely worth investing in. This is also an amazing gift!
This bible is so easy to read and understand! Love Joyce's words helping you study.
I love this Bible!  I plan on buying one for each of my daughters.
"I found that this Bible is not really a study Bible per say - but as I am new to the AMP version it was a God-send. It is very easy to follow and read, in that capacity its easier to study on your own instead of looking up verses for better explaination - as I do with other versions. The only notations are direct notes from Joyce Meyer - she is an amazing teacher and her teachings are based heavily on the written Word so to me she has clear understanding on the books of the Bible and with her commentary, you can look at passages from another perspective. All in all a great investment. Its a everyday Bible with smooth reading format. The only thing I would complain about is the size. It is somewhat cumbersome."
Love the book and so pretty as well. Easy read and love how it gives you her perspective and understanding of the scriptures.. love it ❤️
"This is a great bible. I have purchased it for 5 people in the last few months from non-belivers, new believers to those who have been in the Word for years. I even bought myself one but know it will be passed on to someone new soon!The amplified helps define many words in the Bible. I used to stop and look up the meanings of words all the time so that is what lead me to this Bible. And Joyce Meyer is so strong on God's Word that her lessons written on the verses seem to hit home.Well worth the purchase. I hope I get to keep one of my own someday!!!"
Joyce breaks the Bible into explanations. Very helpful for me. I have recommended this one to many others.
Wonderful bible I love it
Bought this for my mom. She loves it. Wishes the front was bigger
This is a wonderful  learning Bible for everyone.  Joyce Meyer is so explicit on explanations  it is so easy. I enjoy Joyce and have always wanted to read the Amplified  Bible. Read it everyday.  I have given 3 away for gifts and plan to give more.
"I haven't used it much since I received it because the pages are stuck together...and Bible pages are made more thin than the average page in books... kind of like tissue paper. Therefore, it's kind of hard to separate some the pages so, I'm going to try to get a brand new one later..."
Received bible. Some pages were bent. Amazon needs to ship more securely. Now the bible itself is incredible! It's easier to read and fine print is large great bible
Love the everyday life bible I ordered another one
More Joyce Meyers and her Church than I expected.
I love this every day Bible! It’s so easy to read and absolutely live the life points that Joyce has included!
"This is a lovely study bible, a must have for every christianHighly recommend, and the additional notes from Joyce are absolutely illuminating.This is the bible you need on your journey of rediscovering God and His Word.Getting more copies for my family"
"A+++. The item came as promised.For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. Jesus is The ONLY WAY. No other name under heaven you can be saved.  Accept HIM today.  Amen.Fritz"
"Joyce's Everyday Life Bible is such a great study tool, offering such insight andproviding facts that put God's word in perspective.  It helps to go 'deeper.'I enjoy reading this Bible."
There are two books of this Bible that are upside down!  Right in the middle of the Bible.
"Ever tried picking up the King James version of the Bible and trudging through the thee's and thou's and other what-nots in there?  Not an easy read by any stretch of the imagination.  This Bible version lays out God's word in a manner I can more easily understand.  I've read the Bible several times and read  a verse here and there daily.  This version sticks to the meat of the matter while providing modern, real-life references in plain ole modern day English.  I highly recommend it."
"I love Joyce Meyer, I am constantly buying her books ... so it only made sense to buy a bible that had her notes and commentary in it. The bible is a lot bigger than what I expected it to be but it is very nice. The pages are thin, the print is big enough. Very happy with my purchase."
easier to understand love the additional notes
"I love Joyce Meyers. She inspires me, makes me think and I would usually watch her after or before reading the bible. So having her comments and thoughts right there is so great for me. Has helped tremendously in understanding and maintaining focus on reading the bible! Makes study time that much easier to digest. For me it has made a world of difference in how I study. I love her comments and breakdowns. Would recommend this bible!!"
"I ordered this bible because I love Joyce Meyer and it has really made me want to read my bible more and get more out of it. I have always read the King James Version and never had an Amplified Bible. I really enjoy reading Joyce's teachings/life points, putting the word to work, that are mixed throughout the bible. It makes reading even God's word even better!!!"
"I purchased this for mother & she loved it! She said it is the easiest and most helpful Bible she has ever read. It has its own box to store it in, and has a black leather cover. Very nice product.This would be a great gift for anyone."
"Love  Joyce's notes ,would be 5 stars if Gods words was in Red. .Also if chapters was tilited .If your new to bible ,you may not know what chapter is trying to tell you ."
"Easy to read. Larger that typical font size. Easy to understand. Joyce Meyer has really made this an every day study bible. Her teaching points and explanations are, as always, simple and meaningful. Every one should have one. Bought more than one, all used, and gave them as gifts."
"I am truelly enjoying this bible, Joyce does a great job!"
"Amplified version makes it hard to read at times - amplified text is in parentheses, can interrupt the ""flow"" of reading and can be much longer than the bible text. I do love that Joyce has put many additional pages of her stories and takes and teachings along the way. I actually read start to finish just her add-in pages - good stuff."
I am a big Joyce Meyers fan and have always wanted to purchase this Bible.....I finally did!!  There are so many things that I enjoy about this Bible.  She breaks down everything for easier understanding and then throughout the Bible she has sentences that she recommends saying allowed or say to God himself.  You do not need to be a fan of Joyce's to enjoy this Bible....just a follower of Jesus!!  (not a fan!)  I am going to give it as a gift as well.  Buy it now!!!
"Helped me gwt more interested. Joyce Meyer is candid about her own struggles and includes experpts that help relate specific scriptures to daily modern life. The amplified version made the Old Testament easier to read, but Paul's writings I prefer in the Holcomb version."
Good sized print. Easy to understand version of the Bible. The commentary is very clear and actionable.
I like this Bible. It's a big help to understand the word of God and putting it in practice every day.
I highly recommend this Bible.  So easy to understand
"I have tried many times to read the bible... after several chapters of the Old Testament I'm out, frustrated and bored.  In The Everyday Life Bible Joyce comes shining through and makes the material revalent and more importantly clears up issues I have with some of the writing-answering all my questions.  Like other posters have said, it's like having Joyce right there to help you interpret God's word and apply it to your life.  HIghly recommend--wish I would have purchased it long ago."
"Oh my goodness,  I love this bible. It has a good size print and is easy to read. I really like the sections that are Joyces's specials parts that she explains the Bible to you. This is definitely worth every penny. Great for a gift. Will be using for a long time to come."
Bible still in excellent condition
"LOVE THIS BIBLE. PURCHASED IT FOR MY SISTER'S BIRTHDAY GIFT.  EVENTUALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO GET MYSELF ONE. IT'S A BIBLE THAT IS VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND, AND JOYCE PUT IN MANY GREAT NOTES. VERY HAPPY WITH IT."
This was for someone else.
Easy to read.understand.
Joyce Meyers comments make this bible easy to understand in relation to one’s own life. My only problem is that it is very heavy. Might be nice to have it in two - or even 4 volumes
"Of all of the Bible translations available today, the Amplified is one of the two I go to most.  The other is the Life Application Bible in the NIV translation.  I believe when entering into a serious study of God's Word, it's important to have at least a couple of different translations at hand for clarification.  I like the Amplified because of the alternate phrasing used to enhance a passage and make it more understandable.  If I had to chose only one Bible to own, it would be the Amplified simply for this reason.Having Joyce Meyer's insights as well is just the icing on the cake for me.I've listened to Joyce for many years now so I've probably heard the same message over and over again but I've never gotten bored listening.  I always get something new out of it even if it is the same story being told.  It's clear that she has deeply studied the word and can speak it with authority.  Her background gives her the credibility to reach a lot of hurting people and I truly believe that God speaks through her.  Her notes and articles are sprinkled throughout this Bible and really make study that much more meaningful.  She brings things out that would not have occurred to me and I can understand what God is saying - to me, personally - and how to apply it to my everyday life.  I don't believe this would be possible if God's hand wasn't in it somewhere.I highly recommend the Amplified version of the Bible and this edition of it in particular."
"In my life, of 50+ years, I've used many different Bible translations for my daily study & reading, but never have found one that made it as enjoyable as the Everyday Life Bible. Not only does the Amplified Bible translation expand on an make the scripture more understandable, but Joyce's Everyday Life articles & Life Points spread throughout have also proven heaven sent.

  
The Everyday Life Bible: The Power of God's Word for Everyday Living"
I would definitely recommend for those who like Joyce Meyer and who struggle to read or understand the bible.
One of the best bibles available. It gives you Prayer and breaks the passages down into the current thinking/vocabulary.
Product was in good condition! Loved it !
Nice letter size and print. Love the comments which make Bible easier to understand and to relate to our lives today. Everyday!
delivered on time..
"EVERYONE SHOULD OWN ONE OF THESE!!!!!!  item arrived as described, If you want to make a good investment into your life...get this book."
Nice book easy to understand
Great study Bible
Good for learning
Easy read sturdy and inexpensive
So far I am very satisfied with the Bible. It has the new updated amplification which is important to me.It has a very pretty cover which is nice.
Love the notes and commentary
Makes such a big difference in fully understanding the Bible. Joyce Meyer's added insights are a wonderful plus. Well worth the price.
Now I can read the Bible and have a better understanding. I love JMM’s comments.
Such a wonderful bible with Joyce’s  brilliant wisdom.  Love love love this
"After years of going to church, I have never understood the Bible as I do now, thanks to Joyce. She shows you that the scriptures are not just a bunch of commands; they are practical, life changing words which you can apply to every emotion or situation in your life. She shows you how the scriptures can be used to make yourself a better person and work towards correcting all the things that are wrong with your personality whether it is a critical or judgemental nature, a worrisome attitude, doubtful or disbelieving mentality, negative outlook, stressed out attitude, easily offended nature, etc. Many times, it is not our circumstances or the people around us that are problematic, rather the problem usually lies in how we behave and respond to things. Joyce teaches practical wisdom, supported by scripture to help take care of the problems within ourselves. The Word truly is ""medicine for the soul"" and Joyce's notes and commentaries show you how to use that medicine.  Her references contained in footnotes illustrate that her interpretations of scripture are also based on the writings of Biblical scholars and he never twists the scriptures to suit her own meanings. I have already begun to experience the Word bearing fruit in my life thanks to Joyce's advice and commentaries.  I highly recommend."
good read
There's nothing to dislike. It highlights the parts of the bible that are important.
For my studies
"This bible is awesome! I love all the insights from Joyce inside, they really enhance your devotional experience when reading. This is my first amplified bible, and all of the extra info you get (meanings of words, etc.) really makes me want to read and study more! And I love that it is hardcover. Love it!"
"Great bible. My teenage girls requested this particular bible... for note keeping, and better understanding. The perfect bible to get our youth to READ!!"
I needed a Bible that I could understand and I love ❤️ watching Joyce Meyers so when I saw this Bible I purchased it and it’s easy reading and I can understand better and Joyce has her own notes taking included.
I love Joyce Meyer. Her bible is amazing & very easy to understand. It makes you want to read the Bible more.
Paper thin pages
I did not know how to truly study the Bible.  I love Joyce Meyer and her teachings.  This bible has helped me concentrate on areas I struggle with.
Excellent condition. Thank you..
I am enjoying the comments by Joyce Meyer in this Bible.  I have been using this Bible for 9 months.  It has held up quite well for a paper back.
"This is the best Bble I could ever have chosen.  For all of my life, I have struggled to understand the Bible and so I avoided trying to read and study the word of God.  Now that I have found this version, I no longer have to do that.  It is in language that I understand but the meaning is the same as it was intended to be.  Also, Joyce Meyer goes on to explain more in depth about each chapter and alot of times, each verse.  Joyce Meyer speaks on my level and I always understand what she is saying and her meaning is clear.  My life has already changed just since getting this Bible.  The price was more than worth it and I consider this Bible to be ""priceless"".  I would have paid more if necessary.  I wish I could get it in a pocket size paperback version to carry in my purse or pocket.  Then I would be completely set!!!!"
I love love this Bible. It is so easy to read and enjoyable.  Makes you want to keep reading...hard to put down.
really love this bible
Thank you for publishing this book. It is very God revealing. It’s  a dose of fresh air to read it. God bless you richly Joyce Meyer.
Easy to find what I am looking for
love this edition and the Joyce Meyer tidbits
Love it
Great for the price just wish the paper leaflet was more thicker
I absolutely love this bible. The commentary from Joyce Meyer really helps bring things into perspective and helps with understanding what is being said and how it applies to everyday life.
"It comes in large print and is amplified to break down meaning of words in each scripture. It has daily life topics with scripture to look up such as fear, anger, joy, in the work place and so forth and scripture to go with each subject. It also has blank lined pages in back for taking notes. Joyce puts in her own notes for certain scriptures in each chapter as a life principle to live by. I like it."
"This is a great Bible. I am doing my annual reading in it this year. Joyce Meyer's articles stimulate new thoughts. I have given a copy of it to my daughter also, and she too is really enjoying it. I would highly recommend it. B.ward"
Excellent book. More than I hoped. Ms Meyers gives great insight and very easy to read.Book is like new. Very clean
I absolutely love this bible! I enjoy reading what Joyce Meyers thoughts are each chapters. It really helps me to better understand the scriptures. I totally recommend purchasing this bible. It motivates me to read it everyday. Praise Jesus!
Love it
Great !!
A good book and down to earth.  I like it because it is easily readable and explains a lot that makes it easy to understand.I received the product in a timely and excellent shape.  This is what can be counted on from AMAZON.  Everything was handled very efficiently and easy to do.  It is nice when it is delivered to your own home.
I love this bible because it gives you everyday situations.
It was ok.
"Truly is an everyday study bible. Easy to use, notes & commentary from Joyce Meyers edify the verses read.  Great quality and for such a fair price! Can't wait to start using it. May God bless you greatly through he's word."
It was a gift she loved it
So good
I love love love this Bible...love all the details that are on each page that explain things you may not understand of the Bible. This was well worth buying
I have it in hardback and ebook so that I am never without it. Love reading the parts by Joyce as I go. It's like we are reading it together. Enhances it very nicely.
Like joyce's insight on messages
Excellent literature for Bible Study!
A simply wonderful Bible for today's times on my Kindle and at my fingertips day and night!
Love this Bible
I have the leather one and bought this one for my grandson.  Love her 'interpretations' on manyof the verses.  Anyone that follows her knows she is wonderful in explaining some otherwise hard tofollow verses.  I am hoping this  understandable wording will encourage him to not only read morebut make it easy and interesting.  I love mine and feel good about sharing it with him.
Very nice Bible good quality I love Joyce Meyer
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
        
    










  
  
    
   Absolutely love it!"
Lots of helpful information from Joyce Myer which I liked to read but the extra wording in the actual scriptures did nothing but distract me; (I skipped over the synonyms) - I have now returned to my Macarthur Study Bible for my Bible study time.
I finally understand the Bible. I cant put it down. I cant get enough of it since I understand it. I really like Joyce's notes on there.
Absolutely the easiest Bible to understand.
Easy to use with with commentary.
"The Everyday Life Bible makes my study of the word easier to understand and enjoyable.  I love the Amplified version and Joyce's personal notes.  I don't have to read far before I get some insight on how I can better apply God's word to my daily life.  As an added bonus, the text is large and visible so i dont even have to wear my reading glasses.  I've wanted to purchase this for a while, as I really enjoy listening to Joyce Meyer, but I kept putting it off since I have probably every version published already and just couldn't justify buying yet another Bible that might spend more time on a shelf.  I'm very glad I decided to go ahead and order.  I believe God wanted me to have it."
"I love this version, I love having her notes on the side. I bought one for my niece and nephew also. I love mine."
Do not like the paperback edition I purchased as I can see the printing on the other side of the page...its distracting. I dislike hardbacks due to hard corners. Also I purchased paperback as over $9 cheaper then the EBook edition...why eBook so high I don't know. Love the bible itself..comments helpful.
"this bible was perfect, really excellent and great price fast shipping"
Excellent Bible simple English she writes sections with special explanations
I love the way the scriptures are fully explained.
Devotional plus bible plus prayer book. All in one. Practical ways to read and apply God's word.
"This is the most beautiful, easily comprehensive Bible ever!!  Joyce Meyers puts her spiritual, life experience and love into this absolutely wonderful Word of God ~"
It is like Joyce Meyer is right next to you while reading it! The only disadvantage to this Bible is that the words of Jesus are not in red.
"Arrived on time in perfect condition, was advised by my friend that Joyce Meyers Everyday Bible was going to be the best one for me & she was right ❤️🙏🏻 Love this for my daily study and prayer"
"Easy to read, love it!"
Awesome Bible.  I really like the commentary and gain so much from Joyce Meyer's insight.  Probably my favorite Bible.
"And then... so glad my box ended up on a friend's doorstep (their package arrived on my doorstep). Got It=DI love Joyce Meyer's books, and this is a wonderful study Bible!!!"
I read a review that the pages were thin and they are very very thin.If you're looking for a daily light read this is it and prayer this is it.
Just perfect
Really good bible
"I bought myself Joyce Meyers Everyday Life Bible because I am a huge fan of hers, I read all of her books and watch her on Tv, I bought the second copy for a friend of mine who also is a fan. It's a excellent study Bible with many interpretation's of each chapter & verse by Joyce Meyers. A must have for anyone who is interested in understanding the Bible."
Letters are large
"I love this bible! It's so practical and relevant for today's times. It's an easy read. The life points, speak the word and putting the word to work are great helping tools. Pastor Meyers did a phenomenal job on this bible. To God be the Glory!"
beautiful!!!
This bible is just what I’ve needed. I look Forward to having my quiet time. The commentary really helps! Such a great purchase!
I bought this bible to deepen my study and walk with the Lord. It is very down to earth reading. Not complicated at all! There also is examples for short prayers based on scriptures. Also Joyce Meyers has comentary on certain areas of scriptures which is great!
Joyce breaks down His word and makes reading the Bible doable.
I like this bible for ease of studying The Word. The inclusion of various adjectives and nouns help to explain a passage and creates a better mental picture of what the writer wanted us to understand. The quality of the soft cover and printed pages was very good for the price. This is my second one. Gave my first to a friend because she liked it so well.
Great gift
USE DAILY
"I bought this Bible for my college student who actually asked me for it :) She totally loves this Bible. She told me it's the best Bible she's ever read or used as a study Bible. She said it was easy to read, understand,study and take notes. My daughter said this Bible will be her ""go to"" gift for others.As a Christian parent...that's a thumbs up from me."
"I love Joyce Meyer's she is a phenomenal teacher.  If the bible is hard to translate you definitely want this book!  It is very, very good and it will save your life literally."
This is a great study Bible! Large text. Lays flat. I highly recommend.
"Shipped was as expected, nicely packaged. Easy to understand Bible, very user friendly."
This book is a  GOD send. Not meaning to be a pun. Joyce is wonderful. She clears up confusion and puts to rest the questions we have about what God wants from us.  I'm enjoying it so much.M.L. Michigan
I would recommend this bible. I can see all the efforts that had been put into it so it would make a difference in people's lives. Thank you Joyce
I absolutely LOVE this bible!! Has references to KJV so I can refer to and the personal add-ins make it so much easier to understand and connect with.
"I have used this book alot. I am VERY new in my walk with the Lord and I needed these interpretations. I love this book. I happen to really like Joyce but even if you don't, it is still a Bible. A relate able one at that. God bless."
Since this site will not give me another place to add my comment: The box in which this product was completely ripped and the gift wrapping was also all ripped up and I have to re-wrap it myself. This is a gift I want to get to the recipient as soon as possible so do not have time to send it back and have it re shipped.  Very unfortunate handling of this shipment. :-(
I’m thankful I was put in the path of this book. Thank you Jesus
"This particular is easy to read and with the life, points make it easy to understand as well. I enjoy spending time reading the life points and being able to apply them to my life."
It was a gift for my brother. And I love that it is very simple to read and understand the Bible.
"Commentary and adapted content are excellent, as you would expect from Joyce.My only criticism is the thin, THIN, pages.... I feel that I have to be as careful as if they were tissue paper flipping through the book."
This is a good study Bible.  I love the commentaries throughout the book.  The explanations at the beginning of each chapter help you understand the content as well.
"The book is great. It’s large text, so it’s easy to read. Was disappointed in amazon shipping. The book I bought was new and the back cover was torn. I would be okay with this if it was supposed to be used but not brand new."
Excellent Bible with great study notes and commentary by Joyce Meyer.  Highly recommend this version of the Word of God.
Very nice bible
"Great book, a bit larger then expected though. I am trying to find a cover to fit the hard cover."
"It’s the Best investment I’ve ever made. Thank You Jesus. I also want to thank Mrs Meyers for the time she has spent with our Lord Jesus to have the insight to see the areas we need the most help & the knowledge to be able to explain the Bible in layman terms, so everyone can understand the greatest Book ever written. Thank you, God Bless."
Nice
Great resources. Great quality product and good packaging.
Gift for a dear friend!
"I love her little notes. they are very helpful and easy to understand.The Bible arrived in excellent condition, and in goo timing."
Enjoy this Bible. Easy to read
"The devotionals are Joyce's trademark, positive messages.  The Bible itself is amplified and is helpful in a Bible study or quiet times when read alongside another version.  It's not my only Bible but it's a welcome addition to Bible Study--giving me new angles to think about regarding everyday issues."
"I read this version of the Bible every day.  I appreciate Joyce's commentary as I go along.  I enjoy other versions as well and, at first, did not enjoy the amplified butI have learned to appreciate it."
Bought as a gift
Highly recommend and Happy with this purchase.
"This is the best book I have ever purchased up to date, this bible is for anyone who is looking to understand the bible more and no one better could have illustrated the underlying interpretations like joyce has in this amazing bible she complied. It's like have joyce meyer at your side explaining some of the many mysteries of the bible. It will change your interpretation of the bible in many ways and help clear up any misunderstandings by far."
Beautiful and thank you
I sent it back because I wanted a cover that would last.  I ordered the same bible with a leather cover.  I love it. There are notes by important things that happened in the Bible all through the books.  I will keep it and pass it down.
I love this bible - it's the amplified - which helps me understand what God is saying to me - Joyce Meyer has a lot of input also - very encouraging to me!
Easy to read and understand!
Great bible. This bible is great for new believers who need to learn how to apply the bible to daily life.
Perfect gift for my daughter.
"I love, love, love this Bible. It is easy to read and understand. Thank you Joyce Meyer and Amazon. I would highly recommend this Everyday Life Bible."
"Very nice Bible in amplified version, plus articles by Joyce Meyer. Book in perfect condition"
Love this bible and so did my sister. It tells things from today to explain things and has other little info pieces in it. I really enjoy this bible.
Wonderful all around.  Joyce gives power thoughts and there is a great overview of each chapter as well as notes included to give me something to think about.  I got the large print and could not be happier.  It also arrived BEFORE the first expected delivery date.  Yippee!!
Love love love
Does not highlight the lords words in red but good study bible
Love Joyce Meyers and love this Bible.
I love love this bible it breaks the word of God down I lame a terms so you can understand . I use it along with my KJV when studying. Joyce's excerpts are excellent also.
"I read the reviews on this Bible before purchase. There were some negatives, but not everyone is going to like everything, for a  variety of reasons. Most of the reviews were positive.  They were not  helpful with my DECISION  to get the Bible.  It was because of  Joyce herself - her teaching and how she puts things in a way they are better understood,  and after much prayer about it.I wish I'd had this 40 years ago when I was first saved!  I do use the KJV as my main course of study,  and always compare other Bibles with it.I love the way Joyce puts her personal experiences in, not in the text of the Bible, of course, but  in addition to the text - it makes you feel as tho she is in your living room, helping you study.  I believe  she is a dedicated Christian which helps me trust her opinion  on Bible subjects, however I do read for myself as no one is infallible in this life!I would reccomned this for anyone who would like an indepth study GUIDE for the Word.  I am impressed with the openness of her prayers she has included, I do not feel they were added to 'sell a Bible'.I just got the Bible  and already I find myself not wanting to put it down. The way Joyce applies her experiences to the text encourages me to want to better understand what I have read for the past many years.  I believe I was led to purchase it or I simply would not have.  I am satrisfied that I did!"
Like it
Fantastic
Bible is excellent! However it was supposed to be in good condition and it wasn’t. Very dissatisfied!
Great bible you can understand..has the thin bible pages which I like but the pages do seem delicate.
Love Joyce Meyers! Her commentaries and references thru out make it so much easier to understand.
Great commentary Bible
Beautiful. Thank you!
Bought this for my wife who is a fan of Joyce Meyers. This bible offers personal insights and clarity not available in other bibles. She loves it! It makes a great present too!
I use this as my prayer bible. It has provided comfort from the life application commentary.  I wish Joyce would consider adding more commentary.  This bible has provided such intense revelations to me!  Thank you Joyce Meyer for being such a wonderful teacher.
I have been really using this bible for the last month and really do love how easy it is to read and love the break downs of things. Perfect condition when received.
Wonderful!  Makes reading the Bible so much more enjoyable and understandable.
Nice bible.  Print is a good size which makes it easy to read.  Only fault is the spine on my book separated from the book.  I just used strong tape to fix it and had no other issues.  Quite a large bible so not a keep in your purse version.
I am very pleased with this Bible. I enjoy Joyce's notes & comments through out. It helps getting some understanding on what you have read. I also like the print size making it for easier reading. This Bible arrived quickly & in the new condition as stated. I would order from this seller again. I would recommend this Bible. Joyce did a great job with this.
This Bible is more than I expected.  It is a wonderful way to study the Bible
Amaxing Joyce breaks down the complicated word into simple understandable today's life situations giving examples on certain highlight areas
I love everything about this BIBLE.
what am I going to do every moment without it? best study Bible ever
The best - great Kindle version. Wonderful study aid which incorporates Joyce's insights with the Amplified bible.
Best bible ever! Love the tide bits of wisdom she includes throughout. I also love the paperback because it easier to move around it's not bulky like the hardcover one.
"I bought this for my son, because he really liked mine from Joyce. She explains a lot of the confusing things in the Bible. It arrived promptly and in good condition."
I love this Bible. My only complaint is that the pages are really thin.
"If I could give this ten stars I would.  Joyce Meyer's commentaries are concise, well-written, and pertinent to every day life in the modern world.  My Bible study time has been enriched beyond words since receiving this Bible!"
"Great information, tips, opinions and Amp translation"
"This is my first Bible that I bought myself.  I have had others but they were gifts.  I have always had trouble getting into it because the language was confusing or I didn't know where to start but this version is great.  It has the word, but it also has explanations, prayers, and it is sectioned off in the back to tell you which scriptures will relate to common things you may be going through."
"Very easy to read and has been an enjoyment.  I can understand much more, compared to the King James version of the Bible."
She loves it
"Joyce is a powerful speaker and I just had to have this everyday life bible, I like her life points and her idea's, I am glad I bought this bible, I cherish every word in it."
everything I expected
"What a great Bible, Joyce has taken the time to bring home 'Life Points' so readers can have a deeper understandingof how the Bible passages relates to our daily lives, its like she is there explaining the word to you.  This Bible makes me want to read more and more. Joyce Meyer truly has a tremendous gift.  Thank you."
"I love this Bible, this order was a birthday gift for my sister. I was slightly disappointed that it took so long to arrive."
I like Joyce's style in her writing and refering to scripture.
Love this study bible
"I wanted a study bible that was easy to read. I asked for recommendations and this is one mentioned. I took a chance in it and it has paid off. It has larger, print, excerpts that are both historical and relatable to everyday life and the wording is easy to understand. I highly reccomend!"
"What I love about this no b me is it makes it so easy to understand! I actually love reading the bible, where as before I would get so frustrated.  I bought extra copies to give to my children.  Would highly recommend!!"
I love this Bible. Second time purchasing. No regrets.
"Great first Bible of its kind, very easy to read and understand with footnotes. The one I received in 1963 from the church was very difficult to read and understand what was being talked about."
Purchased this Bible as a gift. Previously purchased the Everyday Life Bible while a member of a bookclub. Found it easy to read and loved Joyce's commentary.  My pastor friend flipped through mine and liked the simplistic language of the amplified version.
I cannot top this with any words
I absolutely love this Bible. I love the way Joyce breaks it down and explains things in it. There is an index in the back with different topics you can look for and it will tell you what chapters to look at to read about them. I would highly recommend this Bible.
Just right
If you don't understand the king James Bible this Bible will help you as you read them both together. You will most definitely get a greater understanding.
The book arrived overnight- I was excited!!! The book is everything and more of what I expected! The value was excellent! I saved $30 from the average cost of other websites and bookstores.Joyce Meyer speaks in terms anyone understands! She makes the Bible interesting and compares it to real life situations. Highly recommend this Bible to all!Very Pleased!
Feeding my soul with Gods word.
I love this Bible!
Awesome bible. Even though it was used it looked brand new.
"I bought this Bible for my husband and he really loves it..The interpretations are such a help when you are studying the Bible.  Words in the old editions hard to understand and don't have the same meaning today as to the meaning when it was originally written..The only con is that he wishes the pages were on thicker paper..They are so thin that it is difficult to turn pages.  Other than that, he is really enjoying it...and I do too.."
Great
Great bible and the amplified version is one of my favorites.  Joyce's notes throughout are wonderfully inspiring.The only thing I wish it had is a concordance in the back.  Other than that it is the perfect bible.  Wish I had splurged and got thehard cover on this one......
"I have a number of Bibles, but this is my favorite because it is all I could've hoped for in one place."
I love my Joyce Meyer Bible. I love how she explains everything. You can never go wrong reading the this Bible
"Love this bible, easy to read. Also I love the little sections that explain how you can use it in your every day life."
"I bought this for myself, loved it so much I gave it to a friend, and bought myself another.  The larger clean print and quality paper really appeal to those with older eyes.  The resources and helps inside are a special bonus for those who want to seriously study God's word."
I like to have 2-3 versions of the Bible. The Amplified Bible is very good. Joyce's notes are thought provokingand helpful.
Seller provided a high quality product.  As usual Joyce Meyers never disappoints.
No table of contents and very difficult to navigate.
"Thankfully it was not a gift, but I literally just opened the box and the cover is ripped and there are several pages are bent. Yet I know the content will be amazing!"
I love this Bible; I use it everyday. The Amplified Bible gives great detail and insight into the original Hebrew/Greek meaning of Scripture. An additional is Joyce's Notes and Life Points that are very helpful as they give greater understanding of particular Scriptures and also helpful tips and life-changing messages to enjoy everyday life. I would definitely recommend this.
Great
"I have and use several different Bibles in my studies, each special in their own ways.  Joyce's Bible is by far my most favorite! Her commentaries, prayers, and defined verses provide the reader with a greater understanding of what is being read.  I have given this Bible to several others who are searching in their walk with God.  I highly recommend this Bible to anyone whether you are a seasoned pro or just starting out in your desire to know God's words, directions, and promises for your life.  By understanding what you read you are on your way to a closer relationship with our Lord and His blessings.  Enjoy!"
It’s an easy to read bible full of extras that really inspire me.
"Love the commentaries, extra scripture and additional stories."
"This Bible is everything I had hoped for and more.  I have several Bibles, all of which I love.  I greatly enjoy watching Joyce Meyer.  She starts my day out on a positive note and usually has me laughing at my human-ness.  Recommend this book highly.  Amplified and with additions from Joyce."
Perfect for late night reading when I can't sleep and don't want to get out my paperback bible.
A bible with helpful extras. I enjoy it.
"BEST BIBLE IVE EVER USED!!!!! The extras are so useful and expand on the scriptures in a way I easily understand, Highly Reccomend this bible"
I love this Bible. Very Good!!
This is not like any other bible I have. I prefer to call it an insight bible. It is the insight given to Joyce Meyer throughout God's Word.
"Great bible, I love the extra teachings/notes that are included in the bible. Provides great explanations and examples."
"I recently purchased ""The Everyday Life Bible"" with the leather cover.  This was purchased as a gift.I am very impressed with this Bible.  The overall size is good; not too large; it could easily be carried to church, Bible study class, etc.Although the print is not classified as ""large"" or ""giant"", it is a good, comfortable-reading size, and it is dark enough to make for easy reading."
Love it.
Have once of these.  Purchased this one for my granddaughter in Liberty University.  Nice bible and good commentary by Joyce Meyer.
Best Bible I’ve ever had easy to read excellent comments just wonderful I suggested for anybody who’s at the beginning of their journey
This is my first Amplified Bible and I absolutely love it Joyce added her little life points and quotes to it that make it just remarkable and easy to understand I highly recommend any believer
Amazing clarity
I have been looking for a easy to read & understand bible with relatable side commentary.  This bible is perfect!
Excellent everyday Bible
Has become my favorite Bible. Great explanations/translations.
I love everything about The Everyday Life Bible!!!
Great to study
"Love this Bible!  I really enjoy how the amplified gives us a little more clear understanding of what the authors are trying to say.  I also like Joyce Meyer's added insight, life points, and prayers.  Also on the bottom of every page is a little note as to why Jesus' name is capitalized.  I love it!"
The best bible to actually understand what the Bible is teaching is. Easy to interpret and Joyce Meyers Commentary helps it all make sense. I won’t use another bible.

My Amplified Version by Joyce Meyers was received many days ahead of schedule which overwhelmed me and I actually jumped up and down when I saw it in my mailbox so soon.  It was in perfect condition and very well packed for a safe shipping.  I am enjoying this Bible so very much.  It makes everything more simplified and understandable.  Thank you so very much!
I love this book
"My Mom loved her amplified bible, I got her. It arrived in great condition, brand new. (her old one was falling apart) The print is pretty good sized, I went back and forth between ordering this or the large print. The print on this was just right. I have no complaints. I wanna buy one for myself, I love Joyce Meyers and her style of teaching."
Excellent bible for daily use. Written by Joyce Myer.
My favorite Bible. I am learning more with this!
I do use this Bible for my everyday reading and it is a goof translation and also good commentary from Joyce Meyer.
"She wanted a women's study bible. I love the Amplified version of the bible because it feels more complete by using all translations and has more interpretations. The added content is very simple. But I appreciate that from my limited experience it seems to not be dogmatic, but supportive."
really enjoy reading this Bible.  Have used it over and over to refer back to
"Very happy with this purchase. Although I have several other versions of the Bible, I've found that the amplified is exceedingly helpful, as are the notes from Joyce Meyer. Highly recommended!"
I really like Joyce's notes and thoughts but I'm not fond of the amplified bible and didn't notice when I ordered.
Joyce Meyers every day life bible was perfect.  Her insight and advise phenomenal.
"I bought this as a gift for my wife.  She's been interested in a study Bible, and with the reviews on this one, I thought it was worth a shot.  I can't tell you yet what she thinks about the content and structure, but I can at least tell you that if you buy the paperback, expect lightweight, thin pages that are easily torn and/or folded, etc.  I did have to return the first one as there was not enough packing material to keep it looking decent when it arrived, but I had no problems getting another one.  I would think that this is a book that may not allow for too much personal writing/notes, as I would imagine ink bleeding through and/or tearing.  Of course, until she has a chance to do some reading with this, hope this information helps in the meantime."
I'm very pleased with this Bible by Joyce Meyer.  Glad I bought it.
"Just what I wanted, thank you"
"Beautiful Bible!  Not the most recent Amplified Bible, but I like this earlier AMP version better.  Very happy with purchase"
"An excellent Study Bible! I’ve always liked my Amplified Bible (in large print). I’m enjoying my new Amplified Everyday Life Bible (both Old and New Testaments), which features notes and commentary by Joyce Meyer. The print is perfect for me without needing it in large print. In the back is a list of topics to help find scriptures for needs or situations, and several pages for note taking. There’s also a page written for, How To Receive Jesus as Your Personal Lord and Savior.In the front is a 2 page ‘Personal Word from Joyce Meyer’ about God’s word (The Bible), Jesus, His love for us and more!So far I find it to be an excellent Bible and study source and I’m glad I came across it when looking for a new Study Bible."
"HAVE IT ON PAPER, BUT ALSO WANTED ON MY KINDLE.  I LIKE IT, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
Have not had a chance to thoroughly use it yet because I am a student and very busy til June . However this summer I will begin studying it more. I did browse through it and it is a great Bible for studying that was highly recommended by my best friend.
Love this bible!! It has parts within the Bible that gives you insight from Joyce on particular books of the bible.  I love this because it is like you are getting teaching while you are reading.  My sister shared with me just a piece from her bible and I had to find it and buy it.  I love this bible more than the bible that my husband spent over $60 on.  I only spent 10. Glad I did.  My only problem with the book itself was that I was not told that it did not have the cover.  I truly would have loved for the cover to have been on the bible.  But I still can't complain.
"Great bible, however it is supposed to be brand new and it came with a crease on the front page!"
I like the way the Bible is set out. The one downfall is navigating between chapters and verses and verses within a book. You just have to go page by page.
I love the design of the book.  It gives explanations and makes it easy to understand
Just received today and so far it's exactly what I was hoping for. I look forward to deepening my study of the Bible and with Joyce's notes this appears to be the perfect tool.
Great Bible for self study & life lessons.
"Enjoy this bible but  in  table of content the book of Psalms only shows up to Psalms41 but should go to Psalms 150.  It is time consuming scrolling to say Psalms91 etc. Also, wonder when work out problems can they put a spot for Old Testament and New Testament to click on eventually? The big correction mainly needed is in table of content so far is Book of Psalms ."
Use everyday. I enjoy understanding the bible now. Had mine since 2012 .
"Love this translation, plus the commentaries and explanations add so much to my understanding."
fast shipping product as described
I have had for many years now and it’s held up.
Love the commentary
Joyce makes it easy to navigate the scriptures and find answers to life's problems. I understand now why The Bible is called the Living Word.
"I really enjoy this bible and I have a few bibles that I like but this one really helps us to live or try to live what we learn in God's word. I really like Joyce's input in this bible, it is like we are in a bible study with her. I have at least 3 books going at the same time and read what I feel like each day and I have two other books of hers going at the same time. I stopped reading her books long ago but am back reading her books again and I do see how she has changed over time and I now enjoy listening to her now and watching her on TV as well as her books. I read about 2 to 4 hours in the middle of the night from midnight or from 2 or 3 in the morning, that is when I wake up automatically and go to my chair and read and my time to be with the Lord. Keep up the good work Joyce and God bless you dear!LDYnGlenAZ"
Loving this bible
The best Amplified  Bible around.  Joyce Meyer input is fantastic.  I absolutely love this Bible.  It is the Bible I read all the time.
"The insight the writer includes in the, already best Bible translation ,is remarkable and very enlightening.  The inclusion of ""Life Point"", ""Putting The Word To Work"", and the other commentary of Joyce Meyer makes it the greatest study bible available, not only for new Bible readers but for ALL Bible readers"
The best Bible I have ever had.  The Amplified version is so much clearer and easier to read. Joyce's comments and discussions are very important to me
"I love this bible!!!!  I believe I purchased it a few years ago & continue to read it regularly.  I got so much out of Joyce's comments.  She really does give you a very clear understanding of scripture.  I constantly found myself saying, ""oh, so that's what that verse meant"".  I have purchased more copies & have given them as gifts.  Beautiful, just beautiful."
"Being a new Christian, my wife had a very hard time understanding the Bible. She loves this Bible and has learned so much. This is a great tool for her to grow with the lord"
"Wonderful, easy to read Bible, with notes of interpretation by Joyce Meyer."
"Love Joyce Meyer, the extreme effort she does explaining and bringing this to real life. This bible is so helpful."
I love the amplified Bible. I read it and take notes everyday.
I love and enjoy my bible a lot. Well written with words of encouragement from Joyce Meyer ! The best book ever !
"Love this Bible, easy to follow with excellent words of wisdom by Joyce."
Wonderful
"Easy read, plainly explained, God's word is always enlightening! No matter what version you read!"
Best bible I have ever had. It explains everything. It was always so hard for me to read the bible as it was so hard to understand. Joyce explains everything. I love it. Wish I could buy one for every one I know.
Awesome
Bible is easy to read and understand. Love the little input boxes Joyce puts in. Makes you think more on certain scriptures.
"I love joyce Meyer, and this bible has many study aids and encouragements in it."
what a great bible!  i recommend this version as the words are more understandable for me...joyce meyer explains what you are reading...a great read and now i am understanding it better....totally recommend.
This Bible is AMAZING!!! I highly recommend it to anyone just starting out with a bible. It has helped me to understand the different books of the bible as Joyce writes and explains things very well. I recently bought one for a friend and he is loving it!
Easy to read and understand
Excellent - easy to read and follow. Love this Bible!
I bought the Everyday Life Bible as a gift for someone and they loved it. With the way Joyce Meyer ties everyday life into the scriptures really helps when you are going through some kind of battle.  It really makes this Bible worth the money and helps you apply the scriptures to whatever situation you are going through.
"I love the way it's written in modern English, very easy to read.  I also enjoy Joyce Meyers writings."
The best I ever have received.
Was a gift! She loved ot
"I like this bible it very informative,easy read,I love the way it explains passes.Great readings"
Excellent
gaev as a gift and the person loved it
"This really is a beautiful Bible.  The content is designed well with the devotional/readings parts scattered about but not blatantly in your face to become overwhelming.  The binding is beautiful, the font is a good medium to largish size that doesn't strain the eye like smaller print usually does, the pages are thin, but it is a Bible, the pages are going to be thin, the margins are enough for a few notes, not an essay, and the amplified part is done well so the reader isn't too distracted by the interjections.  I wanted an Amplified Bible, but also wanted commentary/study work on the background of the books and a beautiful binding that truly lays flat when opened for studying. There is a small concordance, but again, it is a Bible and not a full on research item, that would make for a very large book indeed.There are also some pages at the back of the Bible for taking notes."
The Bible isn't written as well as I'd like.  She uses too many translations at the same time and it doesn't read well. I find that a nuisance.  Mine also came incredibly wrinkled with several pages torn. That was a major disappointment.
"Great study Bible.  I watch Joyce Meyer every day, Good helps to learn."
"Easy to understand and has some good messages from Joyce scattered throughout. Bought at great price, nice leather bible shipped in a nice storage box."
"This is a good reference & study Bible. I prefer the King James version, so I use both to read Joyce's interpretation & review the King James actual text.  It's a good resource to read Joyce's explanation & the actual scripture."
"The Everyday Living Bible is the best Bible I have seen to date.  It is excellent for those seeking a better understanding of the Word, and to enhance your personal relationship with the Lord through Jesus Christ.  I am forever thankful to Joyce for having taken the time to add her personal notes/reflections that are very honest and extremely helpful to the average person to pursue a deeper personal faith life and to help us with daily issues.  I purchased one for each member of my family, and they also have expressed how much they enjoy reading scripture in this Bible"
Like Joyce's comments and expanded text. The pages are thin and tricky to turn.
Awesome bible . Just what my mom wanted for Xmas . Print is a bit small that's my only complaint. I'd totally order this again.
"The Amplified version has been my ""go to"" Bible for 47 years.  In the darkest hours of my life the Lord has spoken to me through His Word and my Amplified Bible is my most treasured earthly possession.  Now that Joyce Meyer has published it as a Study Bible, you cannot get a better understanding of the Word of God as it applies to you in every area of your life than with The Everyday Life Bible.  I have followed Joyce's teachings and read several of her books over many years, and I have found her to be scripturally sound and her teachings according to the Word of God without compromise.  Allow yourself the joy of knowing how much the Lord intimately cares for you through reading this Study Bible.  You will receive comfort, direction, peace, rest, forgiveness and eternal life.  Go ahead.  The Lord is waiting to bless you through his Word."
Absolutely LOVE this!! It’s exactly what I need for Bible study and spending time with God daily.
Great Bible!
Great study tool.
"First bible ever that actually makes sense, that I can relate to, that I’m able to understand and that I’m actually excited to keep reading. Changed my life!"
"Made for those of us who have a hard time ""understanding"" the bible. I have now purchased 2 of these."
Was a gift to my Aunt and she loves it. Her only complaint is the thin pages in the book.
Love Joyce!
Awesome product
"I got this because it was the cheapest leather bound amplified Bible I could find--not necessarily because it is a ""Joyce Meyer Bible."" I read it when I want to break apart a passage or meditate on it. I find that the amplified version clears up confusion."
It came sooner than expected and just as described!!
So helpful with reading the bible!
Joyce helps the readers to understand what they are reading by including short studies of different stories. definatly a awesome version of the bible !
"The best! love this bible, Joyce Meyer is excellent at making you understand the Bible more"
"First, I do like the Bible, I like it very much.  My issue is that the pages are very thin, and I like to highlight important points and underline.  So it's not the Bible itself (which is great!) but the quality of the paperback version of it (not so great.)  However, I was very pleased with the Bible itself.  I'd never really heard of Joyce Meyer much before or paid attention to her ministry, but having read this Bible, I'm pretty impressed.  IN other words, great quality in the content, not so good quality on the materials."
I purchased this as a gift. The recipient loves it.
I enjoy listening to joyce meyer
Well done and very helpful for study. But then I'm a word person. Could get non word people interested in the importance of words in the Word.
Very helpful for beginner readers!
"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  Everything that I order about Joyce Meyer products is always a top product and I will continue to order her products.

  
The Everyday Life Bible: The Power of God's Word for Everyday Living"
The extra notes in this bible goes a long way  to give you a better insight on the word.I love it
i have been saving so i could get your bible and know i have it thank you Jesus.praise god and bless you and everyone that works with youthank you Jesus for making this possible for me and the whole Joyce Meyers foundation
Very good  Bible easy to understand !
"Gave as a gift, very well received"
Great transaction and very timely too. Joyce Meyer is a great teacher of the word in our generation! Great buy.
This was for my mother-inlaw and she loves it.
Best bible ever. Joyce gives a lot of commentary throughout that helps you study and apply what you are reading.
Very small print.  But nicely made.
"This Bible opens up the Word of God in a way no other version does.  As an Episcopal priest I have read many Bibles, but none like this one.  Joyce's comments and insights make it practical and very easy to understand and apply.  The amplification digs deeply into the meaning of each word.  It is an invaluable resource for preaching anbd teaching."
"Since coming across the Amplified Bible about a decade ago in a Christian Bookstore in Sydney, Australia, I have always included the Amplified version amongst my favourite Bibles.  Though a little harder to read (especially aloud), due to the system of brackets and parentheses in which additional and/or clarifying words are used, the Amplified is an excellent Bible version for deeper study.So it was with some eagerness that I picked up The Everyday Life Bible with notes and commentary by Joyce Meyer.  Let me say that I believe that most devotees of Joyce Meyer will enjoy this Bible, as will those who may not be familiar with Joyce's work, but who are looking for a solid, reliable Bible text with useful, practical commentary on how to live for Jesus everyday.What is this Bible like?  Well, those who have read Joyce's books, will know that she intersperses the Amplified Bible text within her written words.  With this Bible, that practice is reversed:-  Joyce's teaching is interspersed within the Amplified Bible text.Amongst the features are Book Introductions, which include an Everyday Life Principle for each individual book of the Bible.  Everyday Life Articles are another feature, some of which have been written especially for this Bible and all of which correspond to specific verses and situations in the text.  Speaking the Word shows readers how to personalise the Bible text and apply it to themselves and Life Points and Putting the Word to Work apply the Bible's lessons and text to everyday life.At the back of the Bible, there is a section called, The Word for your Everyday Life, which is essentially a topical index, where you can look up texts for specific situations and topics.  There is a full index of all features, together with a Prayer to receive Jesus as Lord and Saviour.The font size is good for reading and the features are tastefully presented within the text.  There are also several lined, notes pages at the back for personal notations, prayer requests, etc.  Both the bonded leather and hardcopy versions are well crafted and sturdy.Prospective buyers should note though that this is not a traditional Study Bible in the manner of the Life Application or NIV Study Bibles.  Rather, its sub-title is, ""The Power of God for Everyday Living"" and that is exactly what this Bible helps us to do - bring the Word of God into our everyday lives in meaningful ways.It should also be noted that both the hardcover and bonded leather versions are large Bibles.  The size is suitable for study and going to Church, but are too large to carry in handbags.  Some people might prefer a smaller, lighter Bible.One disappointment I did have was that the usual concordance featured in most Amplified Bibles was missing.  The Amplified has one of the best concordances of any Bible, so I was sad to see it was not included.  However, the number of pages - 2200 - may have precluded adding the usual concordance to this version.I have given The Everyday Life Bible 5 stars....the Amplified text, together with Joyce's commentary have helped me to bring the power of God's word more into my everyday living, so it is true to its claim.  Another reason for the high rating is that I believe it has wide appeal - even to those who are not familiar with Joyce Meyer's work, or who may not buy her books or tapes.  The lessons and notes contained within help to expound the Bible truth and complement the Amplified text well."
This is my 2nd time buying this bible.  Either I lost or someone stole my other copy.  I really like the size of the text and Joyce's commentary.  Plus the Amplified bible really provides detail and description to the passages for clarity.
Bought it as a gift and she lovessss it!
It's very good for me and have good understanding. Love joyce meyers comments. But the pages are very thin
Struggled understanding what I was reading in bible... the summaries Joyce Meyer includes has been helpful to me to understand more.
"The Everyday Life Bible by Joyce Meyer is an awesome bible. It is the Amplified Bible which is a good translation that expounds on the word of God  and is easier to understand. Also, Joyce expounds on different scriptures and or topics which makes it extra nice and deals with everyday life."
I so love this book..so much easier for me to understand..
An inspiration and uplifting to read and absorb this beautiful scripture!! I now know THE WAY on my journey of a relationship with my Jesus!!! Joyce Meyers is gifted and caring!!!
Great Bible!!!
Thank you!
"Love it. Got my grown daughter one, saw it & I got me one & I love it!!!"
Great  book Joyce rocks
This Bible is beautiful and I love it♥️
"My mother had bought this bible a couple years ago and it really blessed me. After moving around quite a bit the bible got in bad condition. I usually use YouVersion.com for my bible study, but I wanted something more accessible. Joyce Meyer really put a lot of effort in to this bible. Love the Speak The Word at the bottom of the page and the Everday articles, Everything you need for your bible study is in this bible!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it..."
"I have many bibles with different versions, I love all my bibles, however this one is my absolute favorite. Love her commentary and insight  for everyday living."
This book is great quality and ships fast
Clear understanding of scripture and references that point you to an everyday walk with scripture and relationship with Jesus .
Best Bible for study.  So simple and fun to read.
"Love this Bible! Although I have several translations I use for school (NKJV, Chronological, Catholic, KJV), this is my first Amplified and I love it. The additional resources and commentary by Joyce Meyer give a unique insight into applying the Word to your daily lives. The Bible is large, which is never a deterrent for me but may be for some, and this means the text is large enough to read comfortably. As is the case for every Bible, the pages are thin so highlighting or marking up must be done carefully or with only colored pencils (my choice to be safe). All in all this is a great Bible, particularly for those who may find standard KJV difficult to understand or for those who may be looking for a good study Bible that uses the Amplified translation."
I've wanted this book for awhile got it for Christmas and reall am happy with it.
What an amazing Bible! Beautiful.
In love with this bible! The best one I have ever had! Highly recomend it
Excellent
"I am old. I have read much. Yet, at 71 I have learned about love and loving in a new and better revelation through this author.  I am astonished to find that there was so much I had not put together in such a constructive recipe for the most fundamental thing in life.  Too bad there are no do-overs...we get only one life.  This book will help you get it right the first time."
"My brother-in-law recommended I read the book and I am so grateful that he did.This book is not just for married people. It is a book about ""owning"" your part in interacting with people (constructively and destructively) and learning how to become powerful without destroying the ones you love. It explains SO much on how I messed up (destroyed) so many relationships in my past (familial and friends). I really have a whole new depth of reality. I will probably read my copy of the book at least 2 more times. And, I will recommend the book over and over again - to anyone struggling to love someone and feeling frustrated and powerless. Although, I will never be able to loan my copy to anyone, because I underlined, circled, and wrote so many notes, that the book is now a journal of my inner most feelings and revelations.Lastly, I am married. And, my marriage is fragile. There is a WHOLE lot of work to be done to change the tides from choppy waters to smooth sailing. The difference now is that I have hope. I no longer have fear or defeat. I will take a chance and be vulnerable and communicate what it is I want and need, without critism to my husband. I WILL listen to what it is he wants and needs, regardless of whether it is a task I am responsible for - or not. No matter what happens from this point forward, I KNOW how to love the person without demanding that they change. Ultimately, I can only control myself. It is no longer my job to change or critique others. As long as I keep God first, focus on myself second, do not allow ""Consumers"" to deplete my garden, express ""God's love (in and out of my home), establish healthy boundaries (not selfish ones - healthy ones), and ensure that I manage relationships in a mutually respectful way, I CANNOT lose.As my brother-in-law told me, ""Read this book with your heart. You will be changed. I promise.""God bless you Danny Silk!"
"As I attempted to navigate my ex-husband and his wife's ferocious attempts to slander and intimidate me, this book became like a bible to me.  I was desperately trying to process the severity of what was happening and how to handle it.We are all 'broken' in some way, but when people are afraid they often feel powerless and think their only way to gain power back is to manipulate and bully others in sometimes horrible ways.  To hear Silk explain how fear brings out the worst and most unbelievable behavior in people, I came to see these two (2) people with new eyes that allowed me to view them with compassion, pray for them and 'keep my love on'.  It certainly didn't excuse their behavior, but freed ME from the fear, bitterness and self-righteousness I felt toward them.I recommend this book ALL the time to anyone who has someone difficult, toxic or just downright mean in their life, but chooses to honor God by loving in return."
"I had to read this book for the ministry school I’m in. I thought it was silly that they wanted us to read this, at first. Then, as I actually started to read the book I couldn’t stop... I don’t want to be the person that gives away all the details but if you struggle with healthy boundaries and even loving in stressful situations, this is a good read... I was able to utilize the practices in my own life and I can say I feel like a more powerful and confident person because of it."
"I had been diagnosed bipolar 1 nearly three years ago and I have learned that there is a popular belief within the bipolar community that we are powerless to our diagnosis. My mood swings were killing my relationships and tearing my life apart. After researching and reading many forums about this diagnosis, I found that I got comfortable believing the lie that bipolar 1 controlled me. It was easier to shut my brain off and react to every trigger and blame my circumstances and environments rather than trying to live powerful and take responsibility for my own actions. After many months of powerless living, broken hearts and rubbing elbows with other sick individuals to create a toxic comfort zone, I found that I was alone. Yes, surrounding myself with seemingly ""safe"" but broken people that agreed with me was not helping my situation and the real problem at hand.My heart told me there was more to this diagnosis than just coping with it. Medication was one thing, which took care of the logistics of my situation but my heart was still so very sick and out of control. I knew that something needed to move, and this book along with many of his other books, helped me identify the lies that I was believing that funded my powerless behaviors.I greatly anticipated this book and am so glad its finally here as Danny Silk defines what real power and freedom is, and what I really do have control over. He defines what slavery looks like too and I found so many parallels. The ideas that are expressed in this wonderful piece have helped me understand how to conduct relationships on every level with all types of people. I now understand that I may be bipolar, but that is just a diagnosis, and is no excuse for poor living. I am no longer fused with my diagnosis and am free to take control of my life and goals for relationships.I find that I have to think a lot harder about things, because everything is not as it seems the first, second and sometimes third time around but it is possible to live in control of me. Reading this wonderful book leaves me empowered to be me without feeling embarrassed, scared, or anxious about showing the world who I really am.Thank you Danny and Sheri. I love you both so much and am reading this a second time around with my husband.Jessica"
"Forget the cliche and just hear me out. Really, all we need is love. Love has the potential to be the most powerful force, if we will tap into it. Living from love, because love, for love, through love is truly the heart of spiritual warfare. You can chase demons all day everyday for your entire life, but the best way to take ground and make the devil wet his pants is to live in love. God is love. It is the nature of God, manifest by us. Darkness cannot remain when the light is on. I have went through seasons of my life fighting warfare all wrong. What a waste of time! I wish I had gotten this revelation sooner and sought out the tools and skills in this book years ago! You will not regret reading this book!"
"I am so glad I finally ordered and read this book I'd been hearing so much great stuff about! It's a well-written book discussing not only the importance of being filled with love and showing it, but also dealing with HOW we may continue to be filled and and overflowing with that love when we connect with others. If you're looking for a book about communicating in a truthful but honorable and loving way, this one needs to be on your shelf. You will want to buy some colorful sticky note arrows to tab certain insightful pages for future reference. Thankful for this book."
"This book is amazing! I think anyone who is thinking of getting in a relationship, are in a relationship, or are struggling about whether to break up....should read this book! It makes relationship mistakes so clear...but also lets you know what it will take to fix it. Biblically based and logically sound, I would highly recommend this. A personal testamony.... it made clear how unhealthy my boyfriend was...It helped me know it was a very good idea to let him go, I saw he was controlling. I will use these concepts to inform how I select my next relationship. I pray it will be as awesome as the book expresses...with work of course :)"
"This book is awesome. My marriage has been difficult for a couple years now and my husband and I read it. While it hasn't made him willing to apply the principles taught in the book, it has helped me greatly. I found this to be a slight catch with this book, but not enough to decrease my rating. The spiritual maturity level of the people reading this book (or any self-help/lifestyle book, for that matter) must be high enough that both people are willing to change. My husband isn't there yet, but I'm not making changes in myself to try to change him. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED WITH THE STUDY GUIDE."
"This is such an important book that I have bought several copies of this book and given them away. I have encouraged everyone in my family to read it. It has changed the way I relate to others and has helped me to navigate some difficult times in my relationships with different members of my family. It has changed my definition of a powerful person, and I have started to view myself as a powerful person when I do things the right way and keep my attitude right, love unconditionally, and do everything out of love for the other person. I know that this is the right way to relate. It is God's way. I feel so much better when I am doing things from a selfless, loving position instead of grasping, controlling, trying to get my needs met through others kind of behavior. The teachings on communication and boundaries are right on, too. Things are starting to come clear, and this book has been a major contributor to helping me to understand how God wants us to do relationship."
"This simply written book has a power-filled impact that remains with you.  Helps you get in touch with yourself so  you can learn how to get in touch with others.  Learn to recognize why a relationship has failed, or is beginning to fail, and get fabulous tools to make it work again, only better.  It doesn't judge or con condemn, it simply helps you see what went wrong and why and how to get it together again, and KEEP it together.  The love in our marriage is more meaningful that it had been before my husband read this book.  It's like being married all over again.  It isn't a gooey type of relationship where you feel you are obligated to do or say certain things.  It's a richer understanding of what true loving is all about.  When my husband learned that I was very peaceful when the kitchen was clean, it hasn't been filled with clutter since.  He takes time to make me happy in small but important ways.  This wasn't achieved by nagging, believe me, it was achieved by a desire to love and show that love in small ways that have big results."
One of the best I've read- practical and encouraging. This book really made me see how I can always choose to be in control of my attitudes and actions. I don't have to be afraid to be EXACTLY myself because I'm really important. I don't have to be afraid of letting other people be EXACTLY themselves because they are in control of themselves. Setting healthy boundaries is going to be fun. Expressing what I need is going to be refreshing. Hearing what someone else needs and keeping my love on- because I can sounds like the adventure of a lifetime and I can't wait to see what will happen as I choose to love me without exception so I can love everyone around me with the same respect and care I now see I deserve to give myself. Bravo Danny Silk- you've earned these 5 stars!!
"I recommend this book to everyone.  I have learned so much about powerful communication from this book.  It is helping me in communicating with friends, family and my husband.  Danny Silk is a very interesting author and writes about situations in his own life to help you learn and understand the point that he is trying to make.  He is a very encouraging author and very positive in what he writes.  I had planned to loan my book to my daughter, but halfway through reading it, I decided to purchase another copy of the book and give it to her.  I want to read this book again."
"This book has given my husband and me some great tools in improving our communication and connection.  It has helped me understand myself much better -- which is obviously a key prerequisite to my being able to communicate what I need.  If I don't know, how will anyone else?  Danny's teachings have also clarified our number one goal anytime we have conflict, which is to  PROTECT OUR CONNECTION.  That focus changes everything and immediately aligns us in unity against whatever is coming against us. Danny Silk is the best teacher I know on  how to do relationships.  Whether it's in our marriage, or with the kids, or with others, when we hit a challenge we now ask this question, ""What would Danny do?""  Meaning, what do love, honor and freedom look like in this situation?"
"Best book EVER!!! I dislike most ""self-help"" books bc most are never practical and never really get to the root of the issue that caused you to buy the stupid book in the first place... BUT, this book. I cried the whole time with conviction and relief (bc my husband and I aren't the only ones, so there's hope). Seriously, best marriage/relationship book I've ever read, hands down. It's so pratical and doesn't sugar coat the truth, and that's what my hubby and I needed. Absolutely wonderful book and should be a must read for every couple or someone who had trouble with relationships."
"I thought I had all the marriage and relationships thing pretty well figured out. And then I got remarried.  We both became different people to each other. This book set it right FAST. I t is not a long read, it is straight to the point and it is spot on.  I constantly observed my reactions and what the author stated was revealed over and over again. It was a major shift for me and my husband reacted very lovingly automatically.  We're closer than ever and I owe much to this author."
"This book changed mine and my husbands life. We also purchased the mp4 downloads from ibethel.com. I, growing up in my italian household am used to yelling about everything, it was just normal for me. if you want to be heard you yell! I can honestly say since i have finished this course i have not raised my voice once towards my husband. We have a love for each other now that is indescribable, because we feel safe around each other, and what is important to me is important to him and vise versa. I am now trying to bring this system into my business. The biggest thing i have learned is about describing feelings. If you start the statement ""i feel like..."" you are actually not stating a feeling, you are stating a thought. That blew our minds. it should be ""i feel..."". the first time we had a disagreement it took so long just to figure out what the heck we were actually feeling! For me, most of it was stemmed from fear! We are starting the classes over again this week to go through it a second time. I have bought this book for most my loved ones and tell everyone about it. You won't be let down. The main thing you need to know when reading this book is: think about yourself on every page. Do not think ""oh thats my husband"" or ""oh thats my wife"" think-- ""is this me? do i act this way?"" you need to be honest with yourself."
"Do yourself, your family, and your relationships a favor and GET THIS BOOK! It has revolutionized the way I do life with people. Healthy boundaries. Healthy awareness. Empowerment to take ownership for the only person I have permission to tell what to do: ME! Grateful to Danny Silk for teaching me how to be a powerful person who aims to keep her love on no matter what!"
👍🏻
"My wife and I participated in a small group that went over this book.  I, a workaholic and servant-at-heart, has a very difficult time saying no, specifically to friends and family.  My wife, who is that friend who everyone shares everything with, has a hard time saying no to someone sharing.  This book provides a clear way creating boundaries, connections, and communication.  Everyone in the group was positively affected, and we each have either given away multiple books and/or recommended it to several others."
This book has taught me to love well. Love well with people of all walks of life. What caught me is that people think that when they climb the ladder they need to keep their sins a secret. We need to be open with one any. Secret sins destroy us and will manifest in time. We will not prosper if we keep our sin a secret. We need to love love live...
"Great book on communication. I really think most couples could learn so much from this book. It’s a little less scriptural than I expected but was extremely enlightening to my habits and actions when dealing with my relationships (spouse, children, inner circle)"
"I'm a  Marriage and Family Therapist and recommend this book to some clients. Danny Silk does a fine job with the topics of connection, communication, and healthy boundaries. All critical components of a healthy relationship. I often suggest the couple purchase two books. Read through a chapter and highlight pertinent content. Then come together each week (with no distractions) and talk about what stood out for them. Some people have reported ""this is the best book on marriage I have read."" Consider that at no charge."
"I read Danny's quotes from this book on Facebook for maybe a couple of weeks before I realized it was his new book.  Of course I had to order it immediately. My life was forever changed after my first encounter with Danny's teaching at a conference ten years ago where I purchased ""Directing Vision Daily,"" (now updated and called ""Loving Our Kids On Purpose"").  I learned about self-control and it affected every relationship in my life, not just the training of my toddler (now the oldest of four and headed into middle school).Danny has such a powerful message.  I call it distilled truth.After a really tough year, moving across country, returning full-time to the workforce after eleven years as a stay-at-home mom, children having issues in school and needing more support, and much more, I found myself very disconnected from my husband and miserable.  I watched a You-Tube video where Danny said something that went straight to my heart and I puzzled over it for days, ""every relationship has one of two goals: connection or disconnection.""  I realized that at some point over the past year I switched from the goal of connection to that of disconnection.  I knew I should want to be connected, but I did not.  After fifteen years of marriage and so many conversations about the same topics and still not being understood, I found myself once again in the place of wanting to give up.The book took a couple weeks to come in the mail, but I read it in two days, hungry for a solution to the problem for which I now had a label: the goal of disconnection.  We read Gary Chapman's ""The Five Love Languages"" about 13 years ago, so that part was not new to me, but Danny's summary of the acts of service love language (many other points too) felt like he was reading my mail.  After thinking on all that I had read for a couple more days, I arranged to spend an evening with my husband alone.  We were able to have a much needed talk that has put us on a path to reconnecting.By this point in my life and my marriage, I realize this is a journey that will inevitably entail future obstacles.  This book has given me yet another tool, one that takes me back to the foundation.  The key to keeping my love on is exercising my self-control and behaving as the powerful person I am, not waiting for someone else to rescue me from my misery.  Thank you, Danny.  I needed that."
"In this book it highlighted ways on how one can maintain and establish a healthy relationship through connection, communication and setting boundary. Those who struggle in communicating and expressing their feelings will benefit with this book the most. Myself, included, I struggle with building and keeping the relationships I have whether it be romantic or friendships because I keep such a high guard that prevents myself from trusting and becoming vulnerable to others. I learned from this book, different ways on how to communicate and be vulnerable by expressing what I need and want without actually criticizing other people. I now know how to love and understand someone without demanding them to change and adjust just to please me.Please like this review if you find it helpful."
"This book will change your life concerning relationships. Danny’s experience in social work, foster care and family relationships is highlighted throughout this book. Incredibly valid for success in navigating close relationships."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in establishing, building and rebuilding healthy relationships with healthy boundaries.  I am an adult probation officer with a social work background, so this book was completely relatable and I understood the ""lingo""..  I have also worked as an Addictions Counselor.  Many of the concepts presented are things I learned in college, but this was a great reminder of great truth.  As a probation officer one tends to become rule focused and agitated when the rules are not followed.  This reminded me to keep my love on.  I was recently able to utilize the concept by setting a boundary and not doing more work than the individual on probation.  My job is to control myself, not him.  I can inform him of the consequences of those choices, but I cannot control his choice.  I also shared part of the boundaries section with another probationer today.  I drew some things out for her on paper in regards to boundaries.  A light bulb seemed to come on for her and she asked for the name of the book and author so she could download it to her kindle.  Motivational Interviewing at work.  I would love it if this book also had a companion workbook!"
"This is an easy read but good read!  It definitely helps you analyze your boundaries and communication process.  You can have healthy boundaries, say no and disagree in constructive ways.  Develop a process and plan but make sure it is filtered in love.  Love isn't weak, it is strong!"
"The way this book is presented is so practical and easy to understand and apply to my life. Over the last few years, I've been learning about boundaries and relationship dynamics and this book has put to words what God has been trying to show me. I really appreciate the way he spells out how not everyone should have the same level of access to us. I'm sure it's obvious to some people, but for me I really needed someone to show me certain relationships should take priority over others. i used to feel guilty for not bending over backwards for everyone and have learned the hard way that it's not healthy or realistic to live this way. I also am really benefiting from the section on communication. I'm very much a passive communicator and I'm learning that my needs matter. I'm especially taking my time through this portion of the book so that its message can really take root in me. Thank you so much Danny for writing this book! It's exactly what I needed in this season of my life."
"I was looking for a book like this one. Thankful God inspired Danny to write it.Whether you are struggling in your relationships or flourishing in them, it's worth owning this book. Relationships require continual effort on our part and who wouldn't want more information on how to improve those relationships.There are so many dog-eared pages and notes, too many to recite here. I did want to highlight a few things included that were quite beneficial and great reminders.1. Did you learn to love? God will want to know if we learned to love, for love is the greatest commandment. I truly believe our culture is misguided on what love is; this leads to heartache and dysfunction. Danny outlines what love is and what it is not.2. Love languages, boundaries, and setting limits. These are very crucial parts of relationships. Danny does a wonderful job of summarizing info from the 5 Love Languages book by Chapman, and including tools to help you set boundaries and limits with others.3. Communication and the pillars of a healthy relationship. These sections were especially helpful. Danny gives you insight on how to communicate your needs and how to deal with conflict in healthy ways.Aside from giving you tools to improve your relationships with others, this book has moments of hilarity. I laughed loudly on several of the points!You will not regret buying this book. I plan on reading it again and buying a copy for my loved ones. It's a must read and easy read. I finished it in one sitting. Buy this book!"
"I got this book because I've begun to meet people over the years who have been involved in Bethel Church in Redding, Calif., and Jesus Culture in Sacramento, including Danny's Silk's executive assistant, a former student of mine. I'm glad I did. There's a lot to like here about how to establish godly connections with others and creating healthy boundaries for yourself with people that I'm sure I'll refer to often. I do believe that what Silk describes as communication styles at one point aren't that - they're character flaws, expressed through communication - big difference. But most of the rest of the book is very helpful and I can imagine referring back to it often as I navigate the sometimes challenging relationships I encounter in the academic and ministry worlds."
"WOW!!! I cannot say enough about this absolutely life-changing book! It has absolutely revolutionized the way I see myself, and my relationships with others. Reading this book was like turning on the light, illuminating so many issues and questions I have had unanswered for years. I have literally either bought the book for most of my close friends as a gift, or recommended it heartily.Read Keep Your Love On, with an open heart, and an open mind, and prepare to have your highlighter close by. You will learn how to love yourself and others appropriately, enhance relationships on every level from work, to friendships, to family and marriage. I do not exaggerate when I say I believe each and every human being would be greatly blessed and benefited from the simply put, clearly written wisdom contatined in this volume.  A MUST HAVE! A MUST READ! Five stars. I do not give accolades that easily, but this book has literally changed my life, and is the most important book I have read in years."
"If you have a stack of books you want to read about love languages, boundaries, communication and relationship psychology, set them aside for when you have a few months of free time....Now, pick up a copy of 'Keep Your Love On' by Danny Silk.I am a long time reader and listener of Danny Silk's wisdom and this little gem is a streamlined reference for many of the things that he passionately believes in and teaches for maintaining healthy relationships - from spouse to acquaintance. Utilizing easy to understand analogies and other tools, Silk shares what it takes to keep loving even in the midst of conflicts that arise in our dealings with fellow humans.Some of my favorite things:-His focus on the incompatibility of love and control.-His emphasis on learning to communicate one's own actions rather than dictating to others what they should do.-Instruction on learning how to decide who you will say 'yes' to and who that means saying 'no' to.-I love the diagram Silk created to illustrate levels of intimacy needed to ""cultivate and protect boundaries."" Your Inner-most circle is for God, next for your most intimate human relationship, and from there the circles flow out farther away into the most outer circle to whom you might love with prayers or hopeful thoughts but not much else (as an example in his diagram, Silk's outer circles are populated by Charlie Sheen and Al Qaeda...I'm not sure if that's a commentary on his opinion of Charlie Sheen or not, but it made me laugh!).-In the same chapter on levels of intimacy I found the peace that I needed in reconciling my desire to love unconditionally with my need to change the dynamic of a formerly close relationship...It is stated: ""Often people who once held the 'most intimate' place in our lives find themselves out in the Al Quaeda Sphere...We keep our love on toward them but it may be a very long time before we ever have them over for dinner."" Thank you, Mr. Silk, for confirming that it is OK to protect myself from emotional harm.-Danny Silk is a Christian Counselor/Pastor with an unwavering Christian perspective, yet the bulk of the book does not belabor this point and there isn't constant Biblical Proof-texting or preaching. Because of this I feel very comfortable in sharing this book with my friends who might be of a different faith or who might not care to read a book heavily laden with theology just to get to the practical wisdom within.-I can't wait to practice being a Blue-Ray Player.....And to understand that last one you will have to get this book!KYLO!!!"
One of my favorite books by Danny Silk. My own love walk has grown since I began reading the many books along with my bible from the minister's with Bethel in Redding. If increased love is not fruit then I don't know what is.
"If you've read the Bible and you're a believer, this may be the only other book you need while in-between your point of salvation and Heaven. Seriously, all that matters in relationships is learning how to be loving no matter how you feel, no matter what your circumstances are, no matter what type of relationship it is, and no matter how the other person chooses to be. Once you get that, you stop trying to control circumstances and other people, and you really begin to walk in love. READ THIS BOOK. And buy a few extra copies because you'll be wanting to gift it to others too."
"I grew up with honor and respect being demanded of me while leaders and family did whatever they wanted. I struggled to figure out what ""healthy relationship"" looked like and at it's core ""was"". This book has helped me in my marriage and other relationships in knowing HOW to have a great relationship. The book gives you the ""what is a healthy relationship"" and what isn't a healthy relationship. It also covers the purpose of communication and boundaries to protect that. Hands down the best book I've read on this! Highly recommend it!!"
"Great book by an author who writes and connects to his readers well. Very well laid out and gives hope and guidance to people who want a new approach to strengthening relationships, learning how to create healthy boundaries, and being able to take practical steps and rethink old paradigms. Reading it over and over has helped really solidify the powerful thoughts of this book."
"Growing up in a program for juvenile offenders, i never learned how to have good healthy friendships. I've always had a heart to help people, but never learned how to say no... This book has given me new insight on life, love, and friendship. I look forward to putting this into practice"
In this book Danny hits my G spot. Yes. My God spot. This book is an easy read with a message of freedom. The book made me cry and hunger and thirst.  I want more for my life and relationships. Walking in Christ and allowing God to move us through the Holy Spirit is what is offered here. I come from a broken family. This book gives me hope and strength and determination to continue to break down the walls. It is my hope and desire that the Lord and this book impacts you in a positive light.
"Amazing book.  Great for all couples or any single person too! This makes so much sense.  Choose love people!! I am an unmarried woman, never been married, but hope to eventually lol.  And this book has given me some insight into love, my choices, and how what we do affects others.  Easy to read.  Extremely well written.  Danny Silk is awesome.  Wow"
"We are reading this book with a group and several couples have stated how it is saving their marriage! That says a lot for a book. Many books are full of fluff with very little helpful content. This book is jam packed with a lot of meaty and practical information. It is hard to put it down. I started applying principles from this book after just reading chapter 1. It is helping me realize some of my blindspots and areas I can work on to strengthen my marriage and my relationships. This is a highly recommended book to help maintain healthy relationships, prevent problem areas, and fix existing ones. It just takes a humble heart to admit error, and the boldness to take a step in the right direction: creating loving relationships."
There is so much in this book that will lead you to change your life for the better. I have read several books by Danny Silk and all of his books are some of the best I have read. Practical and Simple truths that will help you have better relationships with everyone you know or meet.
"Next to the Bible, this book has probably had the greatest impact on my life. I can't recommend it enough! I keep buying a copy for myself to reread and giving it away before I get a chance. This book teaches how to REALLY relate in a way that will leave you feeling more satisfied than you have in your whole life. Although I do not know Danny Silk personally, he has played a huge role of teaching me what a father is really like. Thank you, Danny, for your influence in me and my family's life. We are forever blessed because of you. I love it that our extended families want the life and order we now have because of your book. You are awesome!Having adopted older children makes living in close quarters with situations that have made me feel like I want to run away and have no hope...feeling like my whole life has been invaded and not knowing who to ask for help. This book has taught me how to keep my love on and live with others who are hurting."
"I’ve learned to become a better person and lover due to this book! This book shows ways in which you can become a better communicator and person, in general. By giving different perspectives into how you treat another person you love, it teaches you patience and kindness, whenever situations are tough. I would totally recommend this book to anybody who is looking to learn how to have boundaries, but also to maintain kindness."
"Danny Silk writes a clear and easily understood book.  But more than that, I have learned so much about relationships - clearly this is very effective in marriage relationship - but this gives a unique understanding to what causes people to act as they do.  I have read a great deal of books about relationships, but this gave me new information and clearer descriptions.  This would be a fantastic book to use in a small group setting or for a marriage encounter group.  I have a problem with ""one size fits all"" books and this book doesn't do that."
"Good for healthy relationships, and those in trouble. But if yours is in deep trouble, set an appoint to see him or another best selling faith- based* author/counselor of marriages in crisis. *why faith-based? Time magazine’s epic edition of the science of marriage just reported that atheists aren’t often happily married. So why start with a counselor whose approach doesn’t support the best data?"
"This book is everything that you hope a non-fiction book would be. The theme of love never gets lost in the middle chapters and you never get bored. If you will be vulnerable and think about yourself instead of others, you will find this book challenging, insightful and inspirational. I have been putting some of the ideas to practice, especially during exchanges with my wife, and our communication is better than ever. The book reveals what true powerlessness really is and inspires the reader to live powerful and love deeply. Rarely do I say this, but I wish everyone would read this book!"
"I am not a big reader, so when I read a book, it's got to be good. I am on my third time with this one,  and have recently purchased the study guide. If you are working through a difficult relationship, and we all will be at some time or another, this book provides critical tools to navigate your way through."
Teaches on 5 love languages and how relationships can improve if you know how to discover what makes people know and feel they are loved.
"Well, I did it.  I walked through 'Keep Your Love On' line-by-line.  Normally I read through a book pretty quickly.  Yet this one was different.  Not that it was a difficult read - on the contrary, it was quite easy.  What slowed me down was how Mr. Silk took reasonably complex emotional health principles and put them into terms that I could connect with unlike any similar book I can ever recall reading.This book provides clear explanations of how (due primarily to fear) people get in their own way, and simultaneously create discord in their relationships.  Most importantly, it provides tangible tools and insight on how to approach situations differently - and subsequently increase one's effectiveness.What a thrill to read such emotional health truths, and even better, have it so well aligned with & woven into my faith.This is a fantastic read.  More importantly, it will help me to create more authentically Christ-like connections in the future.  I'm a better husband, a better dad, and a better man because of this book.I don't know Danny Silk.  I will likely never meet Danny Silk.  Yet I owe Danny Silk a debt of thanks.I give this book my highest recommendation.KYLO!"
"This book was required reading for the Bible School that I'm attending. I'm glad that it was because I don't think that I would have bought it otherwise. The author touched the deep recesses of my soul. I wasn't  expecting that. He really ministered to me. God used this man to correct some things is my life. If you have a teachable heart, you will get a lot out of this book."
"I read this book right before my wedding. It is a book that I recommend to husbands and wives. I also recommend this to every person who is or will be in a relationship, so everyone. It has so many valuable lessons that teaches you to be victorious in your relationships rather than being a victim."
"Book is awesome.  Really helps put a new perspective on connection, communication, and how to properly setup boundaries to protect those tings.  I highly recommend this bok if you want to push your marriage or even your close relationships to a new level."
"Danny Silk is a great pastor, leader, and speaker! He writes well, and he has grappled with issues of helping people get out of tough relational spots in a very healthy way. In this book, he takes his philosophy in ""Loving Your Kids on Purpose"" and extends it to adult relationships.  By chapter 2, you feel like he has figured relationships out so thoroughly that you can hardly wait for him to help you.  And in fact, he does help you.  BUT, I think that most of the examples he uses are relatively easy issues to deal with, and I think it would have been more helpful to present more challenging cases.  But even as is, the book is very helpful, especially for those unfamiliar with his other writings and teachings."
"The intrusion of technology into our lives has increased the time spent interacting with machines and reduced the time spent interacting with people. Because developing healthy relationships take time, the reallocation of time away from development of healthy relationships has contributed to declining civility and increasing violence, both at home and in public places. Against this rather bleak environment, an emerging role for the church in these postmodern times has been to teach the basic relational and social skills that can no longer be assumed to exist: enter Danny Silk.In his book, Keep Your Love On, Danny Silk starts by writing:“I wrote this book to help people build, strengthen, and heal their relational connections.” (11)Silk sees three themes as components of healthy relationships—connection, communication, and setting boundaries (12)—and he structures his book around these three themes. Let me turn to each of these themes in turn.Connection. Silk starts his discussion of connection by distinguishing powerful people from powerless people, writing:“You need to be a powerful person. Powerful people take responsibility for their lives and choices. Powerful people choose who they want to be with, what they are going to pursue in life, and how they are going to go after it.” (20)Being powerful is important in relationship because:“A healthy, lasting relationship can only be built between two people who choose one another and take full responsibility for that choice.” (20)Powerless people are driven by fear and anxiety in making choices and look to other people to fill in for their perceived lack of power (21-24); powerful people realize that they can only control themselves and do not look to others to solve their problems (25). Consequently, it is powerless people who feel a need to role-play as victims, villains, or rescuers (23), because these roles focus on sharing power that powerless people feel they lack, as Silk writes:“Powerless people use various tactics, such as getting upset, withdrawing, nagging, ridiculing, pouting, crying, or getting angry, to pressure, manipulate, and punishing one another into keeping their pact” [in being victims, villains, or rescuers] (24).Real love is a challenge for powerless people because being deeply insecure in themselves they approach relationships as consumers (21) who have trouble being full partners in relationships … Obviously, a lot more can be said about the subject of connection and relationships.Communication. Silk sees communication as a transaction between the inner and outer life, citing Jesus:“The good person out of the good treasure of his heart produces good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure produces evil, for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.” (Luke 6:45 ESV; 81)Silk sees powerful people insisting on assertive communication where: “My thoughts, feelings, and needs matter and so do yours” (86), not motivated by fear. Powerless people are governed by fear, trying “to hide what is really going on inside” (81), not able or willing to communicate on an equal basis. Instead, powerless people adopt a passive communication style (you matter, I don’t), an aggressive style (I matter, you don’t), or a passive aggressive style (you matter, but not really) (82-84).Silk offers some helpful advice on dealing with these three powerless, communication styles:“A powerful assertive communicator responds to a passive person with, ‘What are you going to do about it?’ They respond to an aggressive person with, ‘I can only talk with you when you decide to be respectful.’ And they respond to a passive aggressive person with, ‘We can talk later when you choose to be responsible and tell me what is really going on.’” (87)Clearly, not everyone starts out as an assertive communicator—Silk himself admits that he started out as a passive communicator married to an aggressive communicator. Because he had to learn to be an assertive communicator paying attention to the needs of others, there is hope for the rest of us.Boundaries. Silk begins his discussion of boundaries by observing:“…not everyone should have the same access to you. You are responsible to manage different levels of intimacy, responsibilities, influence, and trust with people in your life.” (124)Silk starts by recounting several stories about Christians who did not understand this issue of levels of intimacy and counters these stories by observing that “Jesus prioritized certain relationships over others”, as in (most intimate) =>God the Father=>John=>Peter, James, and John=> the twelve disciples=>other disciples=>spectators=>everyone else (125).  He goes on to state:“I love lots of people through my ministry. I counsel them, pray with them, laugh with them, and cry with them. But that’s it. They don’t get the bulk of my time, attention, or money. They don't get to know my heart and influence my decisions. After our few hours together, I leave those people at church and go home to my family and close friends.” 128-129)This insight into Silk’s own relationships might come as a shock to many Christians who have trouble establishing such priorities and maintaining them, especially Silk’s comment about the “God-spot” (126), reserved only for God—not spouse, not work, not kids, not political causes, and so on. You get the idea—if not, remember how the Ten Commandments start out:""I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.""You shall have no other gods before me.""You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.” (Exod 20:2-6)Danny Silk’s book, Keep Your Love On, is an important resource for church groups, readable, and interesting. Before I had finished the first 20 pages, I started thinking of all the people that I would like to share this book with, especially newlyweds and family members. Read it; discuss it; share it. You will be glad that you did.[1] [...]"
"I've been looking for this book all my life! So grateful to know how to manage, in love, people who want to consume me. Read it alone + then read it with my husband. We've established boundaries with others to protect our connection, and it's really enhanced our relationship. Thank you for writing this book, Danny Silk!"
I love this book. It was exactly what I needed at the time I bought it. A friend told me it changed his life. He was having a hard time & bought this book. Now he is using the advice from the book towards his life. I see a complete change.For me it helped me understand people better & how to work with those people. Not only in my personal life but my work life as well.
"Probably one of the best books we have ever read in our lives. So many of my family and friends were touched and changed by this book. Literally each chapter has information that makes you want to stop and stew on it and completely revamp your life. Danny silk is restoring, protecting, and debunking endless relationships through KYLO."
This is a book I have read numerous times & will continue to read the rest of my life. This book must be walked out and applied with others. The 5 KYLO principles are game changers. It will turn your life upside down. God’s wisdom is far superior to man’s wisdom. All of Danny Silk’s books I have read (and re-read over and over) have turned my world upside down in a  very good way. Danny Silk is such a gift to the body of Christ.
"An amazing book that I highly recommend. It will challenge you and you'll probably feel like having a hissy fit at some points that hit close to home but it will lead you to a place where you will gladly choose to keep your love on - no matter what. I am single and found Danny's insights to be practical and helpful in my close friendships and ministry. It has helped me let go when i have needed to do so while keeping my porch light (love) on. This book has helped me to set safe boundaries so I am able to show honour, respect and love consistently without burning out or becoming bitter. Excellent read for those who fall victim to compassion fatigue."
"I was at a time in my life where it was either leave my boyfriend or be miserable just to see him happy. We all tend to lose self-worth and self-confidence over time. Especially if the relationship has been strained from time to time. Take opportunity to get back what you lost. This book has helped me find my strength and I feel all young,middle-aged, and engaged couples should grab this book. Worth every penny!!"
I have read this book twice now. I plan to pick it up and read it a several more times as a refresher/continuing education on how to love and receive love in a healthy Godly manner.I would also highly recommend this book for church leadership teams.
"I have never experienced healthy relationships and healthy boundaries are blurred lines.  I was loaned this book and had to have my own to make notes in the margins and highlight what stood out to me.  This book gives me hope, encouragement and explains how to be powerful not powerless.  I highly recommend it to everyone and am hoping to find it on audio for my daughter and son-in-law.Some parts I had a hard time understanding at first, but I continue to reread and meditate on it and feel it's getting in there.  GOD is so good!"
"This is a great book for couples at any stage, but I bought it this time as a gift for two friends who have recently gotten engaged. I pray this develops their ability to have pen communication and a more healthy relationship. It’s been a great addition to my marriage!"
"Father God gave me an invitation in 2012 to ""Love my people well and that includes your husband!""  I was shocked because I thought I was already doing that. This book has added fuel to my burning heart of love with some practical steps. How Danny describes boundaries is brilliant!  I believe it is a MUST READ for everyone.  I will be reading it again and again.  Bless you Danny Silk!"
"I bought this book as a recommendation from one of our church leaders. It has now become an invaluable tool in our church body as we learned to speak to one another and to the rest of the body as people who choose love without fear.But it didn't stop there for me. I took it home. I shared with with my husband, with my child, with my family, with my friends, and with people that I talk to. I realize that I cannot control anyone but myself, and sometimes I have a hard time with that! It's a learning process. I haven't mastered it, but I get better every day. This has changed my life!"
Everyone should read this book. Brought me perspective and helped with create change in my relationships. So much freedom and health came out of reading this and implementing what it says.
"Love this book! I gave mine away years ago and wanted to read it again! I will purchase more for friends and family! Everyone should read this book for any relationship, intimate, friendships, and family members."
"This book is so helpful and engaging that I didn’t want to put it down. It explains power struggles, fear ties and easier ways to keep your love going strong in your relationships. I highly recommend this book!"
"This book will change your life if you choose to receive the truth that is communicated in it's pages. It's very clear and straight forward, but also deep and impactful. The author shares his personal experiences, as well as anonymous stories of other's. You'll want a highlighter!"
Good Material.
"This was hands down the best book I have read all year (and that is with me reading Culture of Honor right before it!)! I highly recommend this book in conjunction with Culture of Honor - CoH helps you with relating to others, where KYLO addresses the idea of connectivity on a personal level.I have to say the most astounding thing was getting about 2, maybe 3 chapters in and having revelations about the WHY of people's actions in my life. I also was able to look at behaviors I had and work on making them more fruitful.I simply cannot recommend this book enough. It will stretch you!"
EXCELLENT book and a marriage (or any relationship for that matter) life saver! Danny Silk is a genius in relationship dynamics and every page contains extremely important information. His books are a must-read for all families who want to thrive.
I intend for this review to be simple.This book is for every human being who is or wants to be involved in any kind of relationship with others.  The information present is priceless and provides the tools necessary to be a truly powerful person.  Read the book to find our more and to go deeper still grab the workbook that goes with it.  It should be well worth your time.
"So amazing, has help me as a mother, a wife and a daughter! So many great things about this book! YOU HAVE TO BUY IT AND SHARE"
"One of the best books on managing healthy relational boundaries. There's more emphasis on marriafe relationships but covers the wode spectrum including various levels of friendship and family relationships. It's written from a charismatic Christian perspective, if you aren't familiar with the author's body of work. Relational tools taught in this book are useful even if you are not of faith-based persuasion."
This was an in depth evaluative book on wisdom boundaries and keeping your love on in all types of relationships whether you feelLike or not. Strategies and discerning various types personality styles are also outlined. Stories and examples given by Danny Silk are sure to make you laugh but knowing how real and applicable it is to you. Highly recommend this book esp. for couples learning how to love at all times with right communication tools!!👍🏻😁
"I've been asking The Lord for answers on boundaries & how to love & respect people of authority in our lives when you see them hurt other people but they are blind to it. I went for prayer at my church over another boundary issue, a triangle matter between a sibling & our parent. He recommended I get this book. I went immediately to the bookstore but they said it kept selling out. Later, I was meeting with a spiritual mentor & we were praying over what to study. She happened to come across a quote on FB by Danny Silk & she shared it with me. It became very clear at that point, this was the book God wanted me to read. It has challenged me in a few of my current views but overall, reminded me how important it is to forgive & to love people through their imperfections as Christ does in myself & others. Very eye opening on boundaries; thank you!"
"While I am still `processing' the book, chapter three [The battle between fear & Love] was very impactful. Though it seems to `elemental' I really had to take a look, and in the Light, see where I had been allowing circumstances or words drive me toward disconnection, and to make course corrections toward healthy connections. Here are a few of my favorite quotes from that section:Fear and love have opposite agendas and opposite strategies for achieving them. They cannot coexist in a person, relationship, or culture. (605)Learning to partner with the Spirit of love requires you to become powerful. That is a serious challenge. When Paul told Timothy that the spirit of love is also the spirit of power and a sound mind, he implied that its opposite, the spirit of fear, is the spirit of powerlessness and a weak, divided mind. (612)As you manage your love toward others and pursue the goal of connection, you will need feedback so you can understand how you're affecting them and identify where you need to make adjustments. (646)You need to have a punishment-free, control-free, fear-free plan for dealing with people who make mistakes, engaging in conflict, and setting healthy boundaries. (659)Silk's insights will truly help the reader move to connect with others in order to build a healthy, connected relationships, rather than giving way to separation."
I recommend this book to everyone. I will be reading this again and again. It’s a lifelong lesson about loving.
Excellent book. I can't explain how much I needed to read this book. For years I've struggled with establishing intimate relationships and keeping them. My eyes have been opened to the reality of what it means to love every moment of the day and to not turn off your love toward anyone.I'm going to have to re-read this book over and over because it is just so dense with so much wisdom.Thank you Mr. Danny
"This book is not just for couples - it highlights excellent principles on how to change yourself to become a better person, and how to cultivate relationships in general.My wife read it, then recommended it to me, so I read it, and then we went through it again together.Highly recommend!"
One of the greatest books I have read for strengthening your marriage. I highly recommend it.
"This is a huge toolbox for learning how to have healthy communication and boundaries in relationships! No theory here- this book was born out of two people struggling through and their hard earned wisdom. Whether you are in a relationship (and we all are!) or long time married, this book can give you ways to be even better together!"
"""Keep Your Love On"" brings great understanding and revelation to the practical and messy aspects of living with ordinary people who have extraordinary destinies.  Danny brings Kingdom of God concepts and principles into the stark reality of living with broken and powerless people, which all of us have been at one time or another.  I have been a pastor for 35 years and a private practice therapist and social worker for 11 years, and wish this book was available at the beginning of my ministry, for my own benefit as well as for the benefit of others.  This is a remarkable follow-up and expansion of many of the principles Danny laid out in ""Culture of Honor"".  I have been so impressed with this book that I have made it assigned reading for all of our students in our ministry school. You will live in relationships with greater connection, satisfaction and power if you take what is revealed in this book to heart.Mike Hutchings, Global School of Supernatural Ministry, Mechanicsburg, PA"
This is an awesome book with simple valuable relationship advice.  Easy to read. Highly recommend
"I love so many things about this book! I especially love how Danny Silk provides practical strategies to extend love in various situations and day-to-day experiences.  I read this book with my women’s small group, and each of us were challenged and encouraged to stay connected in difficult situations and practice healthy communication with friends, co-workers, and family members. After personally witnessing the fruits of the practices mentioned in the book, I bought several copies to hand out to friends, family, and even strangers.  This book definitely teaches you how to keep your love on wherever you go and whatever you do!"
"Excellent communicator. Makes real points that can help relationships - simple, practical ones. Speaks as to adults, not platitudes to show how much he knows. He aims to help us grow up and succeed, not talking down to anyone, but showing it is possible to see turn-around, no matter how bad a relationship has become. Read the book, and then go to a #KYLO seminar if you can."
"I have been alive for 64 years, married  37 of these years. I wish I could say those 37 years have been easy, but they have not been easy.Through reading ""Keep Your Love On"" I have learned the necessary tools for improving this relationship. As hard as I tried, as much wisdom as I applied, as many tears as I cried, in a couple of short months I have seen more improvement then in the balance of those 37 years,  by applying the truth found in ""Keep Your Love On""Make no mistake, there's commitment and work involved as in any other area of life. Stick to it, get a group of friends to study together with you and to support you and you will see results!There is hope! Thank you God and thank you Danny and Sherry.Enjoy…"
"This is an outstanding book for individuals and small groups. It incorporates valuable tools and examples for strengthening and building relationships. It is also very clearly and simply written. We recently read it in our women’s small group, and it has had a profound impact on how I understand relationships and handle complicated situations. It is also a great resource for anyone in ministry to better understand people and learn how to set healthy boundaries."
Amazing book. This book will literally transform your marriage and your life. Not just for marriage relationships but it's applicable to ever relationship in your life. Highly recommend. Definitely will give this a 5 stars
This book will help you evaluate yourself and share with all those you care about how to love well in all relationships. I like that this book gave clear instructions for setting boundaries and used stories from the authors life to support themes. Easy to read. Life Changing content! ❤️
Keeping you love on is one of the most powerful concepts I have ever heard. Danny Silk shares Jesus' purpose and heart in this book. It is easy to read and follow. You will be excited about turning your love on and keeping  it on from cover to cover!
"This is not just a ""turn the other cheek"" study.  It helped me tremendously to handle passive aggressive people in my life and  taught me how we need to set relational boundaries.and  This study is helpful for every season of your life, for instance, dealing with your children at different stages, you will need different strategies.  I learned you cannot have a relationship with anyone without respect and responsibility.  The KEEP YOUR LOVE ON teaching DVDs with Danny Silk are REALLY a blessing (and funny) too!"
Super good book and I reference it continually. Will use it for the rest of my life ...so much here to filter and work on. It has helped me to keep connection in spite of negative or lack of response from others. Spiritually the wisdom hear is beyond our culture....we need this desperately.
"I thought this book was just regurgitating ideas from any other marriage book I’d read. I couldn’t finish it. Others told me it was helpful, so maybe it’s helpful to others?"
"I highly recommend it. Good advice for relationships with your spouse, family, even friends...."
this book is SO good! I Recommend it to literally everyone I meet
Great book. Everyone needs to have this book. Life changing!
"Filled with truthful testimony, powerful insight, step by step life application. This would help anyone in any relationship. I highly recommend it!"
"I have read this book several years ago. It seemed more relevant now. We moved away from Redding where Danny Silk and others at Bethel Church had lead a culture of emotional maturity.  This time reading i realise how much work i need to put in. The culture is not created here in my small mountain community, so I must create it around me. I don't need to change everyone else's behavior, but I do need to change what I accept into my world."
"I've read several good books for help on relationships, but this one is KING. The author highlights what you can do to better your relationships, for yourself and for others.From someone who is always in recovery for codependency, it's also a well laid out map for how relationships are actually suppose to work."
"Most Christian Marriage books tells us about women's and men's separate needs and then promise that if we each meet those, our marriages will be happy and blessed. In other words, most books use blame and control as a self-help tool...""if you do this, he'll do that.""But this book uses an entirely new tool--it calls out the powerful in each of us and asks us to take responsibility only for our own actions, not because we want to manipulate the other person, but because if you change your role, the other must. It concentrates on getting you healthy and whole, and a marriage of two healthy and whole people can make for one amazing relationship.Read it. And then read it again. It will change your life and help you to look at how Jesus modeled relationships in a whole new way.You won't be sorry!"
"This is one of the few books I've read that I consider life changing. I've read it cover to cover three times and continue to return to it as I allow myself to grow in Keeping my love on in my relationships.Danny explains the difference between powerful people and powerless people, powerful being the desirable trait, which basically comes down to owning your responsibilities, not being a victim, and learning to connect to others rather than disconnect, as we humans tend to do when relationships get sticky. Powerful people also have a strong sense of boundaries, but not in a way that cuts others off or diminishes them, simply holds others to the same standards of responsibility.The book is divided into three sections; the first is on connection vs. disconnection, the second on communication, and the third on boundaries. This format makes it easy for me to find what I need when returning to read as I move toward a healthier life of connected relationships,"
"Great book to help you learn to live in love. With many situational illustrations and Biblical Guidance Danny shows us the real Biblical definition of unconditional love and how to live and love in today's society. I laughed. I cried, it moved me to examine my own heart and motives. I can now say that I am learning how to keep my love on!...Pastor Dave FFCC Newark Ohio"
Excellent!!
I had a friend suggest we read this....it hit the nail on the head for issues we have faced for years. This may become my go to gift to give for newlyweds.
"I enjoyed this book from the first wordings. I believe it is chock full of revelation that Danny has processed in his own life, plus practical application, with examples. I loved it! I felt myself getting more free in some of my relationship growth as I was reading! I kept coming into agreement with his words and could feel the power of God behind it. I can see why God has used him in so many ways. Much respect brother!"
An excellent book!  Wish I could have read this years ago!  I have given it as part of a wedding gift.  Everyone could benefit from this book!
MUST READ FOR EVERYONE!I would personally pay $1000 for the information in this book. Why? Because the relationships in your life are the MOST VALUABLE thing you have and our communication can either construct or destroy the bridges of connection in those relationships. Read it for yourself and be prepared to grow in your skills and ability to navigate the joys of powerful relationships!
"Totally based on Bible principles that most of us have never seen before -- you don't have to be a Christian doormat but can minister happily with boundaries set up.  Prevents the common Christian burnout problem if these Bible principles are followed.  Deep book but easy to read and comprehend.  We taught it in our church Wednesday night family night, I order a copy for myself and also for my friends in ministry."
"The wisdom contained in this book is potent, and it's inviting me to do some serious remodeling in my world."
The clear and concise way  book is written.
This book changed my life forever and I love you recommending it and even buying it as gifts
"This book is so wonderful.  Brings such a break down of how we respond and to take a deeper look.  Then to see why relationships don't work out so well for us and why.  Not just in marriage but any relationship.  It has opened my eyes to why I do things and that I see that I actually created this problem but never had I seen it that way before.  It gives you so many insightful things to think about.  My husband and I are reading it out loud together and then we talk about it.  And I can then tell him some things about me that they said in the book that I do, as does he.  It has opened a big door to our communication and created wonderful and closer relationship.  A ""must"" read for couple or anyone wanting better relationships with family, friends, or relatives, OR to help you learn more about yourself….which then makes you the powerful one not the powerless on."
Good principles and lessons to take in. Examples in the book are unrealistic and author seems slightly arrogant.
This book is absolutely life changing. Everyone Christian or not needs to read this. I highly recommend this book to anyone at any walk of life. I bought the study book as well to get a deeper understanding and apply it to my personal life. I would recommend that as well.
"I read this after his book ""loving your kids on purpose"".  I absolutely loved this book.  I find that I am still reminded of the teaching in my day to day.  I grow closer to the Lord, love people better, and learned to become a powerful person.  The book is easy to read, allow taking my time and truly processing and practicing what I read proved important for me.  I highly recommend this book."
"This book will change your life and your relationships. It has helped me define what love is and how to remain powerful while giving others the freedom to  be powerful also. It makes loving others sound achievable and even appealing, taking the guilt trips and fear of abuse out of love entirely. A great read and a great reference to be studied and applied for a lifetime."
"This book taught me the practical principles of loving others as Christ modeled, regardless of their behaviors. I've got a long way to go in growing into the person God made me to be, but this book serves as an important stepping stone in my personal transformation. God put it into my life at the perfect time and His blessings are pouring into my life and relationships!"
"This book was absolutely inspiring as well as challenging. Helping bring revelation to mindsets that I personally took on that were unhealthy and hurtful to myself, others, and most importantly abba. This has helped being light to a right relationship with others and how to handle the only person I should be handling, me. The fruit of applying these principles will be self control. The fruit of the spirit that is so important! Loved this completely! I would recommend this 50 times!"
I have wanted to leave a review for this book for a while but as I have been unable to process and implement core concepts from the first chapter I knew it would be an incomplete review. However the difficulty I am having is due to the deep and life changing insights that Danny shares. If you are like me and have problems with relationships and understanding how you could be better at them then KYLO is essential reading for you.
"This book is a must for anyone who finds themselves in the same problem(s) over and over and doesn't know why.  Danny Silk takes the reader on a journey of self-discovery of the lies that we believe that keep us in bondage.  He then delineates how to rid ourselves of those, then adopt the truth instead, and shows a new foundation on which to build connected relationships. The only thing that is lacking would be an in-depth study guide to accompany the book.  I highly recommend this book."
"Best book on relationship I have ever read!  Learning how to set boundaries in love so you will not be depleated of your resources is a difficult thing to practice. It is so vital to your relationships though, if boundaries are not set than bitterness can creep in and destroy a relationship. We have all been there before.I can't rave enough about the truth I have found in Danny's book.I recommend it to everyone!"
"A lot of books on relationship and communication offer a lot of ""fluff"" but KYLO is not one of those. Though it's not easy to always have self control, this book shows that we DO have that power through Christ and that we are called to responsibly govern our own behavior (and not anyone else's). Danny Silk is giving us back the keys to our own car; he puts the responsibility for powerful communication and healthy relationships back in our hands...it's up to me to choose to take up that calling. Way to go, Mr. Silk!"
"Me and my wife are newly weds. We are both from relatively disfunctional families who struggle to express their love. For both of us people are so important but often we have found ourselves feeling confused, some times violated, and just generally unsure relationally. As a result discouragemment had set in and the truth is neither of us felt like we were measuring up to our potential.We were searching for a something that would help us grow in these areas; we so desperately wanted and needed to mature in love. When we stumbled upon this book and read various quotes, we both had high hopes. The truth is though, this book has far exceeded our expectations. It has helped us learn so much about relationships, about ourselves, and it has helped us develop the confidence and motivation to step up into proactive relationships again!This book is truly life changing.Thanks heaps Danny. We highly recommend your book!"
"This book is easy to read, helpful, practical, and one you will refer back to again and again. Whenever I give my copy away to a friend, I quickly order another copy because this is one of those books that I want to keep on my bookshelf for easy reference when I need it. My husband read it as well. It gives great information on how to respectfully resolve conflict in your marriage, the importance of making your needs knows and also meeting the needs of your spouse, and how to continually put your connection above the desire to be right. Lots of great information to keep your marriage strong and centered on Christ. I highly recommend this book!"
Very insightful!!!
"This is the hardest book I've ever read. It is also by far the most revelatory and life-transforming book I've ever read! I was stuck in a cycle of feeling hurt, and trying to forgive. I couldn't understand why I was feeling so trapped until I read this book. Danny exposes the lies that keep many of us trapped in a victim mentality in which we blame everyone else for our mistakes and struggles. These are not easy truths to hear and repentance is key.Danny then goes on to give tools to help us get free, to see the truth and to live in a mindset of living powerfully and taking responsibility for our own choices, mistakes and feelings. I believe this is a timely book for people who are wanting to experience greater depths of relationship with God and others, and to be fully connected as the church is awakened. I absolutely cannot say enough about how tremendous this book is.Danny writes eloquently and insightfully. I could not put this book down and am now reading it for the second time. Thank you Danny! This book has changed my life, freed my from the past and given me hope for the future!"
"This book is basically a summary of the teaching Danny Silk does in the Defining the Relationship DVD series - it's a great refresher if you took the course. If you didn't, you get all the main points in a pretty succint fashion and it costs a lot less than the DVD series. :)I appreciate the insight Danny has - he says things is such a way that makes you think, even when it's a topic you've heard about before. The first chapter is worth the price of the book - it's on whether you are a Powerless person or a Powerful person. Wow - very eye opening! It's great for anyone who has ever had a ""victim mentality"" or been in a codependent relationship - or if you have any friends who are like that. You'll see yourself in that chapter somewhere - even if you don't expect to!I have already recommended this book to several people and I haven't even finished reading it yet - it's that good."
"Danny Silk's work is truly anointed by God! I have been leading a women's weekly codependency recovery group for about 11 years. We have traveled together through many different resources but nothing that has packed it all together like Danny's book. Through reading his material, I realize the ultimate goal of our journey to healing is learning how to love and be loved by God and others. That is our destination. With that clearly in focus we can work on the things standing in the way. The things that Danny covers beautifully in his book!"
Life changing book!
I love this book! My husband and I got this to start reading before we got married because we are very proactive in our relationship and making sure it stays happy and healthy.
"Every time I read a review of KYLO on Facebook, I think to myself, ""I should write one too!"" so here I go.  I'm challenged to find the adjectives to describe how incredible this book is.  It has been an answer to my prayers.  As I read this book, I was ""nailed to the wall"" as I saw the dysfunctional way I viewed relationships while at the same time I knew it was true and that I could choose to change.  All of our lives are the product of our choices and choosing to read this book, receive and believe its godly council and then choose to change by the grace of God and the assistance of the Holy Spirit, will change your life.  I have begun this journey, although I still feel like a deer in front of headlights on many concepts, I'm taking it one day at a time.  Thanks Danny Silk, you rock!"
"Well written, good read. Can apply this knowledge to ALL of your relationships."
This book is a game changer! Can’t recommend enough! Such a great boon on building connection with your spouse and being a powerful person! Love Danny Silk!
"One of the best books on relationship I have EVER read.  Way more useful and readable than Cloud's ""Boundaries"" series.  It really just comes down to - are you going to love or not.  It's a choice, that if held to, will reap so many benefits - it becomes well worth the pain to do."
This is a really good book if you want to grow in the way that you love people or family.
This is one of the most amazing books I have read. Everyone needs to read this book. I donated several copies to a local women's prison where I live. The inmates are eating it up. It is definitely new technology for them and they are changing culture by keeping their love on!  Danny Silk is an amazing author. His style is straightforward. H is an excellent communicator.
Thumbs up
I think it would be best if one also watched the video series with the workbook in addition to reading the book.  I personally thought it was more geared toward married relationships but there was a lot of good basic information when one deals and communicates with others.
"I found some of his boundaries quite harsh since they pertain to love, but this message contains wisdom we all need."
"I have been working with couples for almost 17 years.  This book gives excellent information to couples on how to communicate and how to stay connected.  I often tell people that Danny Silk's book, ""Loving Our Kids on Purpose"" is the last parenting book you'll ever have to read. Though marriage is a bit more complicated and cannot be helped with simply one book, this one should be at the top of the list!"
Really great book about strengthening relationships.
"I learned so many lessons. I'm ashamed to say I identify partly with the description of a powerless person however, I am determined to grow and become someone who can love and be loved appropriately.This is such a great book. Read it and learn with an open heart."
"This book has transformed my heart and has been revolutionary for my Family dynamic! We recently had a vacation, took turns reading each chapter, sharing intentional applications, and praying for the holy spirit's breakthrough. Needless to say, it has happened and I can say confidently that we have an amazing family! This is my third time reading it, but it is so much more powerful when you go thru it with others. The power of love is yours!!"
"Not a fan of everything Danny Silk, but he killed it with this book. Take the time to read it."
One of the best books I’ve read on marriage in a decade!
A very good read for those who’ve experienced hurt or woundedness in a relationship without really understanding the reasons why. This was extremely helpful to read having recently been divorced after 24 years of marriage. Would have been amazing to deploy these tools for a successful relationship.
This book is life changing.  I rated this book 5 because that is all the stars available.  The book gets straight to the point.  Easy to read and critical if you are to grow and/or raise your children in a way that keeps them encouraged.  Anybody that reads this book whether they follow Christ or not would benefit from the support this book gives.
"I appreciate this book so much. As per what the book had touched on,I have found in my own life that when Christian leaders mess up we are summarily shot at dawn and thrown in an ash heap. I appreciated that anology the most, because it reiterated that we ARE human too and make mistakes. Instead of shooting our wounded I would like more people to read this book that deal with and counsel people who are Christians but need love and compassion instead of a swift kick when down. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who needs a word of encouragement in any interpersonal relationship. Sure beats "" give up on them/  her/him and quit or divorce."
Gone through the first chapter in no time and it’s definitely a page turner for me. I’m really enjoying it.
"You want to be challenged to love more, love better, and love at all times?  This book hives revelation and wisdom to make it possible."
Love it!
For years I've struggled with being a people pleaser. This book has helped me with practical boundaries and spiritual freedom from fear. If you've had low self-esteem or insecurities I wholeheartedly recommend this book.
Great book
Easy to read.
Everyone should read this book! I'm currently engaged and about to be married in a few months and this book has beyond blessed our connection and communication. So thankful to read it now- I want to keep my love on in marriage always. But I not only want to keep my love on with my significant other bit also with everyone else around me. I want His heart for all people. I want to always chose to keep my love on. This book was inspiring and encouraging and thought provoking and in every way shows the heart of Jesus. I bought a copy for my parents. I pray it blesses them too. I highly recommend this book!
"The greatest relationship tools that have been conceptualized in our time are culminated here in this book and framed within the heavenly culture from which they were first inspired. Each concept is explained in a way that makes you feel like you always knew it, but couldn't quite reach it until now. You just go, 'wow, well that just makes sense.' I recommend this book to anyone that is in any kind of human relationship. It will likely change your life."
Wasn't very strong.  Wouldn't recommend
"This book is actually about keeping your love on towards others, but I learned one of the deepest lessons about Gods love which is always on for me :). Gods love doesn't change towards me, ever. I can choose to walk away or go elsewhere, but His love stays the same. The more you understand this fact, the more you learn to steward that same love towards others. They can change, but you don't have to switch off your love. This revelation opened up a new way of thinking and understanding for me. It positions you to learn way more about unfailing love in everyday life."
A great book! I think it's saving my life. I was advised to get it and so I did. It arrived the next day so I could take it with me on the plane. Thank you!
I recommend this to anyone.It helps if the anyone would like to have better relationships than they do now with anyone.Outstanding information.  11 out of 10.I have already decided to buy copies and send to all of my friends.
This book boils down love and marriage concepts into the most practical steps I've ever seen. I highly recommend this book!
Loved Danny’s examples and way he explained concepts. Easy read. Recommend for those who struggle with relationships. My main takeaway is I can’t expect people to know how I feel if I don’t communicate it.
I love the stories and practical examples. This is the best book I’ve read on relationships and their dynamics; no matter what type of relationship.
This is a must read for everyone! I night one for my dad and he has read it a couple times. My sister heard about it and is reading it and loves it too (not even a follower of Christ) What a great book! Fast shipping too.
Practical.  Accurate.  Gets to the essentials.  Truly life changing!
This book address so many issues that will change your life-if you are willing.
"I've seen most of Danny and Sheri Silks DVDs, so I was familiar with the concepts.  This book is a distillation of his relationship and child rearing teachings and I highly recommend it.  I can't imagine any living human who would not benefit in some way from reading and applying the principles he teaches."
The Bible Says that perfect love casts out fear.  This book teaches how to keep love as the first lens of life.  How to deal with all relationships not just romantic.  To love is a position of power and security.  People who act from love are powerful and can change an situation they find themselves in.  This is a good and timely read.
This book teaches you to keep God first in your relationships. Then you need to love yourself before you can love others
We are still working through the book.  I can let you know when we finish if it is a five star or not.  We are only on the 4th chapter. It is a good book and gives a lot of insights into how you react in relationships and how to keep your love strong without putting up barriers and guards.  My husband and I have been married 43 years and we are going through the book chapter by chapter together.  It is helping us with our relationship even though we have a strong marriage and also helping us to understand the importance of how we respond to our adult children when we have to say no when they want us to say yes.  It is a book that enables you to dig into your relationships and make them much better than they are if you are honest and open.  This book gives way to make that happen even if your spouse isn't that talkative.
"Danny Silk once again knocks it out of the park. His wisdom has transformed our marriage and given us tools to life by. He has given me permission and ways to be and feel powerful and free.This book is for all of us. There is not one whose relationships would not be improved by taking his words to heart. This is a lessons learned approach, not theoretical, rather lived out version of the real thing. Thanks so much, all of the Silks for sharing your lives with us. Those around me are enriched because you did."
"This book is life changing. It allowed me to reconnect with my Mom. It has given me valuable insight with building a connected, strong marriage. I love how Danny Silk reveal God in simple ways. That love starts with God, the way God loves us that's how we should love each other. Awesome, excellent book."
"This book has changed my life. I have told many people to read it and re read it, Danny Silk is a great writer and knows how really communicate the point he trying make. Great easy read that will changed your life, and your realtionship with people! It is a must read for everyone."
I don't know of anyone who expresses this as practically and clearly as Danny does.  We are having every home group in our church go through this book.We are very excited about the skills and the language that this is going to give our culture as we grow together in relationship.  Thank you Danny!
Loved this book
Phenominal book.
"Wow.  Really packs a punch. Concise, to the point, and easy to read.  Wish it were as easy to apply!  The principles are inspiring and practical."
"I work with a ministry that serves a lot of people in broken relationships. After awhile, I started to get scared that I would one day find myself in a broken relationship too. After reading this book though, it occured to me that I can be powerful and create proper boundaries to help create healthy relationships in my life. I feel really free and happy!"
"This book is great, and Danny Silk is a genius when it comes to understanding interpersonal relationships.  I liked Culture of Honor, but this as even better, as he is no longer limiting the scope of what he is talking about to apply to the church. I was very impressed with the book, and plan to buy a couple copies to give to different friends."
I have never understood how to love liked this before. All I have known is the fear factor of love and have learned to be very closed off with people who hurt me. I have been on a journey to love for sometime now but this new way of thinking about it has changed my thinking.
"We are doing a book study on Keep Your Love On, going through it week by week along with a video. I have enjoyed it and have been putting into practice the information. It is very sound teaching, has been enlightening and helpful in my primary relationship which is my marriage. I can see the concepts being useful in many other situations. As Danny says, where two people are in a relationship, there will be differences of opinion, causing conflict."
"Great insights into practical ways of protecting our relationship with God without being disrespectful to the person needing love, setting boundaries as my wife has encouraged me to do when someone calls as we are talking, asking the person who comes to us how we can help them, and listening to the other person without taking responsibility for their choices."
I and my son Jared have both read this book.  Neither of us have ever read a better book.  Need to read this over and over again and re-learn this way much more completely.  Also went to listen to Danny Silk speak in person.  He preaches even better than he writes.
The rawness and realness Of the experience. No sugar coating. Just loving through your brokenness to become powerful and love others from their brokenness and watch them become powerful as well.
"I got this book when it first came out, and was so empowered by it that I started recommending it or buying it for everyone I knew. two days ago I attended my best friends wedding, where in his speech he said, ""we were pretty disconnected, and then I read Keep Your Love On and it changed everything."" he and his now-wife had been disconnected for two years, until he read KYLO and got understanding that he could be powerful and choose love! then they started dating, got engaged, and now they're the most powerful, inspiring couple I know! woo!"
"I read this book in the context of a study group. This book helps one see how we can have control over ourselves, speak truthfully, and set healthy boundaries, in order to choose to love others. A lot of practical wisdom is given here."
This is a book that is meant to be studied annually and put into practice.  I highly recommend this book and everything by Danny Silk.
Great for couples!
"This book is amazing, very informative about relationships and how to have a good one. I've also loved his teachings on honor. I met him in person this year and it was very crowded and busy but he stopped and spoke to me which was a real blessing. You can see that he lives out what he teaches. Thanks"
"When something is so amazing that it's not logical, I call it ""stupid good"" and this book is just full of things that are so incredible that I just can't believe it! It has profoundly changed the way that I view the topic of love. Definitely worth checking out!"
"Danny Silk is an incredible author and Keep Your Love On is one of the best books I have read.  I highly recommend it for everyone to read.  His books and teachings have changed my life.  Don't miss out on a great book!  If you want to make your parenting the best ever, get his book Loving Our Kids On Purpose."
"I am at a very difficult time and crossroads in my life. Although terrifying, I am grateful for the challenges I am facing and for the growth I am experiencing because of them. I am not a religious person but I know this book was sent by God at a time when I needed it the most. I wish I would have read it long ago, my life would be much less difficult if I had done so. Everyone needs to read this  book!"
"A wonderful definition of what it means to be powerless or powerful in relationships. Wish I had understood these things twenty years ago. Would have saved lots of heartaches and unnecessary disruption in my life. I would recommend for everyone,b it makes an excellent study for couples, families, and those thinking about marriage."
One of the best books on healthy relational dynamics I have ever read.  Recommended to all my friends and have reread it so I had the principles down pat in my own life.
Wow.Powerful book about how to be a powerful lover of people.Relatively short but SO FULL of truth.
I love how this book talks about love and how you can connect with love it has good things to learn
I am reading this along with the guy I am dating and it is opening up good conversation between us.  I am looking forward to finishing this book and seeing the fruit from it.
Phenomenal book!  Principles are absolutely ones by which you can live.  Will really help you to understand how to be a powerful person with powerful relationships founded in the desire to connect and love.
"I was just reading the sample available, but I was caught in a trance and I bought it. My spirit jumped in reading the words from this book. I could see myself as powerless person, in all my manipulating ways. Sure I made choices to let go and let God, but some habits die hard. This book is powerful, filled with the capacity to allow for your own revelations. I will live as a powerful person. I will own my choices, and I will reap the growth in relationships as a reward. Amazing book! May God continue to bless you and your family as you live out the cost of the message I was able to receive."
"""The defining, driving force of a powerless person is anxiety."" I had no idea how much of what I did in relationships, subconsciously and by default, was motivated by the fear of their reactions and judgements. This book helped me to own my defects better, as well as see the need to accept the defects in others. This book does not pull any punches either. This stuff is hard work but well worth it in the long run. Who wants to live life codependent?"
Great lessons about how to love well! I liked the real life examples of normal people learni g how to live without fear.
"Fun, insightful, encouraging"
"Fantastic book! Everyone should read it!,"
"I am still in the reading process, but this book gives me something at each page. I simply love it and recommend to everyone!"
"I like the three steps: connection, communication, and setting boundaries. I recommend this to married or singles. Especially liked learning the root word of responsibility : RESPONSE. Not react. Learn your response which respect for yourself, telling what your going to do, not what the other persons needs to do. Keep judgements out. Only tell how you feel, no opinions, and then tell what steps you are taking to set a boundary. This is true connection, leaving the communication open for ""how can we stay connected?"" How can I help you reach the goal you've set for yourself."
"I come from a home where relationships are disposable and distance is required for self preservation. Even after receiving Christ, I was acting out of habit in my relationships. This book is teaching me how relationships are meant to be handled.  I now have hope that I can handle situations with love instead of fear. I'm on my way to becoming a powerful person."
"Every human being should read this book! It is so powerful! If everyone read this book and began to practice loving the way it teaches, we would have heaven on earth! Bring it on! Keep your live on!"
Highly recommend. This is an invaluable resource for relational intelligence and growing as a person in general.
"This book has been such a key to a variety of relationship situations I am faced with.  This book helped me understand God's agape love and how to actually live it out.  I am still practicing all the points mentioned in this book, but I definitely feel peace in me.  Thank you!"
"LOVE THIS! Recommended by a friend, this book is teaching me a lot about how the Father designed for us to love and what it means to truly do so. Connection, communication, and boundaries... learning so much! My husband and I are now reading it together. I highly recommend this."
"This book has given me insight into living in the power of the Gospel. I now have language that helps me apply what God deposited in me when I received Jesus as my King.  I am assured that He's given grace and tools to walk in His love by making powerful decisions. My relationships are blessed decision after decision and step by step I take in agreement with Love and Honor. I'm gifting it to many friends and family, recommending it to anyone who wants to grow in loving God AND loving others in practical ways."
Liked it so much I bought six more for family and friends. A must read for anyone. Diamonds that will last a lifetime.
"Highly recommend. Now I am more aware of communicating, changing my relationships"
"Keep Your Love On is a life-changing book.  My eyes have been opened and my heart awakened to the truth about LOVE. Among many other things, I thought that unconditional love meant I should allow others to be disrespectful. This book guides you through choosing to love and receive love fearlessly...setting boundaries while keeping your love on...embracing our differences without fear while keeping your love on...I could go on. Just read it! I am going back to page one and reading it with my husband! Keep your love on!"
"This is a must read for anyone wanting to understand what as Christians we are called to do. It's challenging and motivating. This is not a self-help book, this is a relationship-help book, a love-help book that will change the way you treat, view and love others. It is a must read for all who want to carry the Gospel, the Good News, into their relationships and into the world!"
"It's difficult to make positive changes when you're unaware of the issues or, like most of us, have a difficult time communicating what is going on inside. This book will help you identify some communication challenges you may be having and provide you with some heart tugging tools to make positive ""powerful"" changes. It'll also provide some insight into what your closest loved ones might be feeling and give you tools for handling yourself in those situations. I tend to not like ""how to"" books because they feel overly complicated but this is not complicated at all. In fact, I lost track of how many times I popped my head up and said that's so simple. Where direction is provided in the book, there are references to the Bible in regards to Jesus' life walk. Jesus didn't complicate things and neither do we. With a deep respect for the book, I'd say it boils down to choosing to keep or not keep a connection and choosing to be a powerful communicator or a powerless communicator. Most of this book would pertain to the very closest of relationships - spouse, children, family, then close friends. However, there is an amazing chapter on boundaries that can be used for all relationships. And, who couldn't use some help identifying and setting healthy boundaries?! This book is part of the second year curriculum for a ministry training class I'm taking and it has had a major impact on my life as I have learned to keep my love on with a 19yr old daughter that I could barely spend 10 minutes around just weeks ago. This morning she invited into her room to check out a writing project she is working on. That's major! This is the second copy of the book I bought. The first was for me and this one is a gift for my daughter."
Pulls together a well balanced view on relationships and makes it approachable.  A pastor with the background of a therapist.  He blends the worlds of Scripture and counseling together splendidly.  Loved this book.  I have yet to be  disappointed with any of his books.
Beautiful book! I recommend it!
Has taught me much to not mess up my relationships and for my future marriage. Excellent stories and teachings on love.
GREAT book! He is very real and goes deep!
This is a great book that gives practical steps to ensure you are doing all you can to be a powerful person in your relationships!! It's easy to read and full of great examples! I plan on reading this book again!!
"oh my goodness, this is an awesome book! It is an excellent read after reading Culture of Honor. It drives home the message of LOVE even further. Danny Silk has great insight into the day to day dealings with people as we maintain our identity with Jesus Christ. LOVE..above all else!"
I've read a lot of relationship books over the years... This book is cuts to the core of the issue & delivers REAL possibility for improvement with those you love and interact with.
"Unfortunately, it still takes two and doesn't cover abusive relationships. If the unsafe person refuses to change, it's still unsafe and abuse. I've followed the advice given before and all it does is encourage her to up the abuse. She's reading it now, and it's possible she might now see it."
This book has opened my eyes to a lot of things. It helped me realize all the things that I was doing wrong in my relationship obviously its not all me but it guided me to  communicate and create boundaries better with others. I def recommend this book to others. #KYLO
This book provided me with practical applications to improve my relationships and change my outlook in how I interact with others.
Great book
Telling ALL my friends about it...it gives you tools to be loving and free...and who does not need more of that...reading it inspires you and makes you hungry to be a powerful person...and get rid of all the relation junk that tries to bind you.So yeah...read it ...do it..and pass it on..
I have read it twice. Definitely a must read if you are in relationship with anybody!
Love this book!
"This book is so rich. Tons of helpful reminders about boundaries and how to live in freedom without sacrificing your love tank.Current fav quote: ""Putting God first in our lives won't compete with our human relationships. It will PROTECT them, because one of God's top priorities in His relationship with us is teaching us how to love the people He has put in our lives. Keeping God in your God spot (the core of your life) keeps you connected to the Holy Spirit's incredible resources of wisdom and understanding to define your relational priorities and boundaries. He's going to show you who you're supposed to be, with who you are supposed to be connecting, and how to build and protect those connections. He's also the Spirit of power, love, and self-control who enables you to follow through on your ""yes"" to these relationships."" from Danny Lee Silk's book Keeping Your Love On (#KLYO), page 132"
"The last few chapters especially spoke to me. I have been in ministry for over 20 years and have really struggled to manage the constant tension between my responsibilities to help and serve others and my responsibilities to ""tend my own garden"" as Danny Silk mentions. Very practical tips for those in ministry or any kind of ""people business""."
"I liked the book, the only reason I didnt give it a 5 is its been a while and I dont freshly remember but I think I will read it again :)"
I have ordered  a copy and given away. This book is FABULOUS! Single and couples should be reading this wonderful book!
This book gives you the tools to build heathy relationships!I appreciate Danny’s honesty.  His examples were clear and concise
"Highly recommend this book. For my purposes Chapter 9 spoke to me the loudest. I learned something from every chapter, but I sorta wanted Chapter 9 to have been Chapter 1! As you read this book you'll discover tips and ways to become and stay a ""powerful person"". You'll learn to prioritize your life's relationships and really mean it! Read this book as if your life's quality depends on it...it does!"
Each topic handled to smooth silkiness as you read through hard situations and their solutions.  The how's and why's were handled generously and I re-read sections often and it always reminds me of the truth of our true nature in Christ and the love He has for us and for others through us.
Danny’s teachings on boundaries and kylo have impacted me tremendously. This is a must read.
"Easy to read. Biblical, but not a theologically out of reach read. Written for the real person. Very practical and useful help. So important when feeling so broken from other people and my own lack of self understanding."
This book is a life changer. I highly encourage every one to buy a copy and read it.
"Danny is such a practical writer and writes in a way that all of us can understand.  Although this is a complex problem, Danny makes it possible and worthwhile.  After reading this book, I believe it is possible to Keep the Love on in spite of differences of attitude and opinion.  Thank you Danny Silk."
"This book has changed my life and the lives around me! The principles and concepts taught in this book have brought much freedom to my relationships and have helped me become a more powerful individual. I recommend this reading to every person wanting healthy, life-giving relationships in their life."
outstanding insight
Great book! Still doing the study with some friends so I also purchased the study guide. I recommend getting them together to help you reflect and ask questions as you read through the book. Everyone can benefit from this book. I highly recommend it!
Such an amazing book!!
"READ THIS BOOK. Oh man. This book helped me so much. I bought one for my mom as well, I think everyone should read this book. So helpful."
This book is awesome!  I bought the hard copy after reading on my kindle.  This book will encourage you to replace distance with connection and communication!
"I absolutly loved this book.  This book is not only for marriages, but also can be used as an aide to help you learn how to love other people in your life by understanding where they come from and why people do/say the things they do/say."
"As a pastor I have enjoyed many books and this one is right up there.  It is so clear and practical on what love is and is not.  The wisdom on boundaries is simple to understand but so profound if I can live that way.  In a world surrounded with messed up relationships this is a bright light to explain why they haven't worked, why they aren't working, why they won't work and how they do and will work."
Danny puts feet on what it looks like to love always. So encouraging to me. I realized how I have unknowingly been loving so conditionally and selfishly. I have been equipped and released to love others in a greater more complete way. Thank You Lord!
"This book has helped me immensely.  I bought it because I was struggling with many relationships in my life.  As I was reading it, it felt like Silk was speaking directly to me.  This book talks about all different kinds of relationships. I am single and thought that it might just be about marriage relationships, but what I've learned from this book is relevant to friendships, familial relationships and also romantic relationship. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and have found that I am doing better in the relationships in my life due to reading this book and spending time in prayer.  I read it alone, but I think this would be a great book to read with a friend or in a book study, or with your spouse."
"We read this book for our small group that focused on marriage, but there was so much that I put to use in my life as a pastor and Christian.  Would HIGHLY recommend!"
I heard about this book at church and I’m enjoying reading it. It gives a alternative perspectives and helps identify ways to connect with your partner based on communication styles.
"A wonderful, thought provoking book on interpersonal relationships, communication and self-discipline.  I love it so far. . . havn't finished it yet.  If your interested in human behavior, and love for humanity -- it's a great book!"
This books is full f wonderful thoughts which provoke thought and give practical ways to 'keep your love on'. I thoroughly enjoyed it and plan on using it to direct small group discussions
This is a book to be digested slowly. Danny Silk is blunt and down to earth and delivers guidance and tips effectively. 'm sure I'll be referring back to this book periodically
Great book.  Easy to understand.
This is one of the best relationship books. It includes a lot of commons sense but made me thing of things in a new light. It's written in a manner that is easy to understand and easy to see how you can fit new habits into your life. I highly recommend!
Very helpful combination tools for difficult relationships.
Such a good book! Easy to read and engaging!
"Every couple needs to read this book, especially if you are thinking about getting married."
"This book is incredible! I loved it so much that before I even finished reading it I purchased several more copies to give to friends. I also plan on reading it again along with the Study Guide that I also purchased. This book is incredibly insightful. Danny Silk took the the best parts from other relationship books (e.g. The 5 Love Languages) and combined them with his own useful instruction. This book is not only useful for marriage relationships, but can absolutely be applied to all other relationships (business, family, etc.). I highly recommend that you read this book. It will change your perspective on life!"
A wonderful book!
I stayed up all night reading this excellent book. Best thing I've read on boundaries and communication. I went through an entire yellow highlighter! I've bought copies for my friends.
"Easy to understand, a awesome book for any one about loving others & your self!! A must read!!I'm only 1/2 way through, I can not say enough good things about it!!! Amazing insight!!!Just get it buy it & learn so many fabulous things!  Literally life changing!!"
Outstanding! This is one of the better books I have read for true change in the heart and soul.
Danny Silk has done an amazing job of taking profound truth and putting it into simple and straightforward language that anyone can understand. This book has the potential to strengthen good relationships as well as totally transform broken ones.  I highly recommend this book for every single person on the planet.
An amazing read that can bring light to many different situations and relationships. I found myself learning new things about myself and others. I love the emphasis on learning how to love which everyone in this world needs a lesson on.
"This is the most profound, readable, understandable, comprehensive, biblical, as well as practical book I have ever read on the subject of healthy relationships. The title is a little long but it perfectly reflects the book's content. Great read! I am looking forward to going over it again and again until I learn to keep my love on in all situations!"
"READ this book.  Then read it again.  Oh, I forgot one thing:  READ THIS BOOK."
A phenomenal and necessary read. Certain books should be in everyone's library and this is one of them. It transformed my marriage that was almost over and it will change my relationship with my father too. Please apply these principles to your life and share with others.
As you read Danny's words change your heart posture by challenge and examination. But you get to choose how to respond.
"If you don't know how to keep from making co-dependent relationships, this book is a must read!!  Because when you really love people for Jesus, you don't enable them to keep doing the same crazy sins over and over."
"I enjoyed this book vey much. Practical, inspiring, and filled with truth! I recommend for all ages and especially for someone just engaged or newlyweds!  Ty"
Recommended by a friend so came looking for it on Amazon. Of course I found it for a great price! It was shipped promptly and I enjoyed reading it. I am always looking for new perspectives on relationships and this book answered quite a few questions.Thanks!
"Not only did I like this book, I have since purchased several copies to give away! Very helpful for relationshops of all types, not just marriages."
"The author gives us a great reminder that we need boundaries in our lives as we learn to live with ""our love on"" .  Not quite as in depth as Boundaries by Cloud and Townsend, but good."
This book will help any couple understand how to keep your marriage alive!  Get it!  It's worth the $$.  Rated at the top of marriage books.
"Awesome book!!  Read it 3 times and also did a book study on the concepts with our bible study group.  It helps you to recognize unhealthy dynamics in relationships, and gives you tools to communicate with love to the people you love, while loving yourself well.  I have bought over 15 copies for different people, and keep on buying more every time someone shares a relational need."
Just love this book and its insightful information.
This is the most profound book I have ever read. it totally revolutionized my thinking about relationships. I was gripped from the first page to the last. I have bought and given numerous copies away and ever person i gave one to was hugely impacted.
Beautifully written and is exactly for now. Every believer needs to delve deep into this book and put into practice keeping our love on. I was convicted and encouraged all at once. This will be on my usual rotation list of constants to read. Thank you Danny silk.
Best book I have ever read on relationships and love. I love the way Danny Silk writes. Excellent book for a bible study or a couple to read together.
I love this book!The simple concept of always walking in love can be so hard for us. Danny breaks it down and reminds us what relationship is all about.
Great book
Mr Silk provides great examples through his own experiences with people and his family. I really appreciated it because we know that we do deal with each of these differently!
"The insights and guidance in this book have helped me to better navigate the relationships in my life.  It's helped me to pinpoint both strengths and weaknesses in myself and communicating and moves towards improvement to stronger, better, and more rewarding relationships in my life.  Thank you."
"Danny doesn't mince words. He gets right to the point and gives great practical advice for those of us who deal with t-rexes, chocolate covered dragons, and goats on a regular basis. Highly recommend!"
So thankful for the tools in this book of how to love others like Jesus while maintaining personal health. Others matter and so do I.
This book has really helped open my eyes to my own short comings and communication downfalls. It's also helped change my perspective from focusing on changing my spouse to taking responsibility for my own actions. Very impactful. Thank you Danny Silk!
I enjoy Danny Silk as an author and this book was powerfully delivered and I was not disappointed. Working through relationships is a non-stop evolving task. Danny highlights the biblical way to healthy relationships and setting up healthy boundaries.
I started highlighting great points Danny made in this book. I should just highlight the entire book. This is one of the best books on relationships I have read. I have purchased and given away about 10 copies because I believe the wisdom in this book leads to healthy lives. I will be reading this book once a year until my default is keeping my love on.
"This is a must read book. In any relationship, this is truly an example of loving like Jesus!"
Great read! Definitely changed how I communicate in relationships. Read this book!!
"This is an extremely practical and life transforming book. Every Christ-Follower should read it, reflect upon it, and put these Truths into practice! Pastor John"
"There was nothing earth-shattering about the information in the book, but the clarity with which it was presented was amazing. Seeing everything laid out plainly and practically helped me start making changes to improve the relationships around me. I've read the book twice and have recommended it to many people around me."
"Danny explains things so clearly, demonstrating the differences between powerful and unpowerful people. I am halfway through the book and feel so empowered, I love being challenged to grow! Thank you Danny for showing us its possible, having met your daughter Brittney I have so much hope for my future and my children! God bless you! Janine :)"
"Wow... I mean WOW!! I've only read the first chapter and I'm already blown away! It's worth the $12 just for chapter one! The power in the simplicity of Powerful & Powerless is life-changing. I'm buying more copies today. I can't wait to finish it. Thank you, Danny Silk!"
Absolutely awesome and life changing. I read Loving your Kids on Purpose first. The principles of correction in honesty with a goal to connection is revolutionizing my thought patterns. Wow and yea!
The best book I have ever read about relationships! Everything was spot on!
"A well written, easy read.  One of the best books I've ever read on effective communication."
The best book I’ve ever read on setting boundaries and continuing to show love to others. I will recommend this to others.
A teaching that I recommend to all.  Valuable information that draws you closer to the Lord and others.  Highly recommend
"This book is a true life changer!  I recommend  it for parents, couples, anyone wanting to have healthier more fulfilling relationships"
"This book is full of wisdom for living that I wish I would have known years ago.  As we love fearlessly, we become powerful people who can take charge of our own lives, free to pursue our dreams.  I have already experienced release and change in my relationships as I apply its principles."
"Just love this.  I go back to it frequently when I'm at a cross-roads or point of frustration in a relationship. Danny Silk has so much wisdom to share, and I appreciate the practical applications and realistic scenarios he provides to demonstrate these teachings."
"This book is an amazing guideline for loving people well. Pursuing connection, communicating with love, and setting respectful boundaries are all foundational to healthy, loving relationships. More than impressed by this book!"
Love this book so far! I've read over half of it and it has inspired and helped me a lot. Very easy and enjoyable read.
One of the all time best books I have read!
"Everyone should read this book before saying ""I do""!"
One of the best books on Love and how to achieve Love in your marriage and other relationships. It also illustrates how we are Love outside the church.  You are the man Danny!
Great great read!
I really enjoyed reading this book and found  Danny Silk's insights on relationships and how to manage them very helpful. His wisdom for dealing with complicated circumstances that occur with people we love has provided a way to love people and still have healthy boundaries. Great book full of wisdom for relationships!
Life changing communication tools. Relationships are only as good as people are at communicating with each other and this book gives you some clues about how to do that better.
"Thank you so much Mr. Silk. My relationship with the Great I Am, my marriage and relationship with my daughter and loved ones will never be the same. Thank you so much for loving people and wanting to bring them the gift of hope. Thank you for sharing some that must be very personal stories and availing us to a glimpse of you and your families heart. You and Sheri absolutely rock!!!"
Great purchase!
Great!
Fantastic book!  I recommend it to everyone.
"Highly recommend this book for anyone who loves God , and wants to learn to love people the way Hedoes"
Thank you for accurate description
Excellent women's study.  Used it in a group.  Been married for 50 years but I still learned some new tricks.
Excellent book!
Such an amazing book; Danny's understanding of relationships is phenomenal. Often we find ourselves in relationships where we feel out of control or see it as hopeless. Most of the time it is because we have not set boundaries in the early stages. This is one of my favorite books and plan to give each member of my family a copy.
"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, it kept me thinking through the entire book. It is well written and is easy to read. I plan on rereading it again to dig deeper into what Mr. Silk is trying to teach us. This is the 1st book that I have fully read through in a long time, most books I'll read and put down and come back to it later not this one."
"Danny Silk's new book is an extremely insightful and practical book which enables the reader to improve and increase their network of relationships. Danny's style is easy to read, with lots of practical and transparent examples, making it easy for the reader to understand and transfer the relational concepts presented. This is a book, which needs to read several times to mine all the gold that is within."
"Game changer, marriage saver."
Slow vibrations
I hope everyone reads this book - we can all learn something from thisThanks to Danny Silk for explaining complex ideas in a simple practical manner
so far its a good read a hard read like because it new lingo that i am not used to but still very informative and eye opening so far
Relationships are MOST important so let's do it right. This book gives the right tools to implement in any relationship situation.
Awesome book.  Life changing.  Waiting for workbook to come out.  I highly recommend this book for help improving all relationships.
"I have been so blessed by this book by Danny Silk, it has empowered me and brought me understanding on how to be choose love and keep healthy boundaries and connection with everybody around me. A must read for every Christian."
"This is not a book about a loving marriage connection, this is a book about powerful, life changing, God ordained love!! I will read and reread this book, because I am fully convinced that the most important thing we can ever do is love we'll."
Anything coming out of Bethel Church Redding is going to be amazing! Love these principles!
I have already learned more about how to love than I have ever known!I think this book will revolutionize anyone who reads it!
"I have heard many messages by Danny about communication and boundaries and i think this is definitely a ""best hits"" ... Easy to read, understand and apply. Really amazing!!"
Helps keep you thinking calm and rationally in tough communication. I recommend it to anyone struggling with communication skills or being able to understand their emotions.
Love the book good for a marriage and friendships
"My wife and I picked up copies of Keep Your Love On! (""KYLO"") for our 8 year anniversary.  As we had followed a small group study on Mr. Silk's ""Loving Your Kids on Purpose"", and found his teaching to be incredibly practical in our day to day relations with our children, we were excited to see what Mr. Silk had to say about marriage.More than a book on marriage, KYLO is an overview of how to create and foster intimate interpersonal relationships by learning to make connections, communicate effectively and set appropriate boundaries.  Mr. Silk uses anecdotal experiences from his personal life and ministry to set the stage for each chapter in the book.What I ended up walking away with from KYLO was the discussion on ""love languages"" (how people receive and give love);the seven pillars of a healthy relationship; communicating in conflict; and a breakdown on the various levels of intimacy.  These concepts gave my wife and I, who on all accounts have a happy marriage, food for thought and opportunities to discuss how to make our ""good thing"" better.Though the book is written from an evangelical Christian perspective, I believe the book has value even for non-Christians. The analysis of interpersonal dynamics, communication styles, and  behavioral cycles all have a secular academic foundation which comes to the same conclusions Mr. Silk arrives at by biblical means.Though ""self help"" books are not a genre I usually cozy to,  I thoroughly enjoyed KYLO.  I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to know what a healthy relationship looks like and how to foster healthy relationships in your own life."
"Best 10 bucks you will ever spend!  Deep waters in this book, inspiring!"
Brilliant!  I can't put it down and will buy a few more copies for friends.  Thank you Danny Silk!
Great book on learning to love no matter what!
"Life changing information for parenting, marriage and every other relationship.  Great read!"
This book is essential to relationships in a committed Christ Centered way.
"Every book that i have read by Danny Silk has challenged me and ""threatened"" my ""comfort zone"" and this one is no different. He calls us to be powerful people living powerful lives and he shows us how to ""keep our love on"" in a world that doesn't always return our love. I highly recommend it!"
One of my favorite books of allll time!
"Best book on relationships I've ever read! So many eye-opening, paradigm-shifting, biblical-grounded principles for learning how to love people, whether friends, siblings, parents, children, or spouses. I've read it twice in 6 months. Both times I would talk to God about what I was reading. The first time it was evident that He was using the book to expose many of the unhealthy patterns of interaction I'd grown up with. The second time, He was using it to build in me healthy patterns to replace the old one's He'd removed. Holy Spirit used this book to work some powerful shifting in my heart, life, mindsets, and actions. Thank you, Danny Silk for your faithfulness to spreading the message God has given you."
"Encouraging and challenging. I felt God working in my heart the whole time to breakdown huge ""boundaries""  I kept up with people. This challenged me to be vulnerable."
Love this book. Life Changing! I have ordered several and keep giving them away to people.
There is such Godly insight in this book and I learned of some great tools to use in my relationships.
Couples in relationships and people in general who are curious about love and successful relationships.  Easy and exciting to read.
good
Powerful and truthful message. Relationship takes two working constantly on it!
"This book was revolutionary because it taught me some basic things that relationships suffer from every single minute of every day. I always remember what the book talked about because the problems that are caused by 'not keeping my love on' happen so often. Since I've read the book, and acting on the advice, I've become a lighter person...for sure, it's harder to offend me. Thank you Danny Silk."
I truly believe in this book and believe everyone should own it! Very intelligent read and very useful if you apply what it is that you learn.
"The book has been very timely and helpful. Between this and the book called ""Boundaries"" and listening to teaching from Alyn Jones and Chip Judd I feel like I'm getting freed up and filling in to the person the Lord's created me to be. So good and much appreciated!"
Great book for couples
"I have had trouble in my past, and recently, with keeping my love on. This book has opened my eyes to see that love isn't weak, but it's the most powerful force we have against fear. Thank you, Danny!"
We used for a marriage study but works for any relationships.
Great book. Loved it
Great book on lasting love!
"If you believe that the people that you love the most are important to you and you also are tired of being a pushover and a coward because you dont know how to engage in healthy conflict, then you need to read this ASAP.Hands down one of the best books I have ever read."
Interesting!
Very powerful and Enightening. Everyone needs to read this book.  I will read it again it has so much insight to love.
This book sums up a clear and simple message of truth on how to love with power. My husband and I have been reading this together and it is already helping us to see each other more clearly and choose to really love more in our daily lives. This is practical and thought provoking and compels you to want to keep your love on!!! Well done!
"This book was an incredibly easy read and at the same time challenged me to love more fully. Not an easy task, but with so much practical wisdom found in this book, I now have more strategies on how to love like Jesus does."
READ THIS BOOK!
This book gives perspective about not letting love be conditional. It is about choosing to love anyway!
This book is one of my favorites of all time. Extremely worth buying and giving to friends.
"What a wonderful book! This has taught me not only how to love others well, but how on protect what I have to offer through boundaries so that I can CONTINUE to love others well. Thank you Danny Silk, for Scriptural guidance on how we can carry out God's greatest commandment to us .... To love one another!"
Excellent book about relationships.
A must read for human beings!
"Wow, this book has truly challenged my view of relationships as well as life in general. I've never seen how fear has influenced my relationships, and reading this book has brought me liberty! It has set me free from fear and now I set out each day to do my best to be powerful in everything I do. Loving my kids, my husband and everyone around me! Thank you Danny!!!"
"This is probably one of the most challenging books I have ever read, but it has been so worth it! I can't express my gratitude for Danny Silk's book and his ability to challenge and encourage at the same time."
Good book to improve relationship
OK
Excellent- helped our marriage for sure
"My husband and I used this as our wedding guest book and had our guests highlight their favorite verse and write in the journal spaces. We love it and treasure the notes our guests wrote to us. The pages are thin and it's very hard to find pens and highlighters that don't bleed through the pages, so I do wish the pages were thicker but other than that we loved it and it was perfect for us. We like the plain white cover because it looked ""wedding like"" and now we get to decorate it however we want to."
I love these I ordered 3 of them to do custom painted bibles. And I will be ordering more. I'm so excited about these and cant wait to give them as Christmas gifts. (The font is kinda small) but they are journaling bibles and  they paint up beautifully.
"LOVE this bible! I was going through a drought... I barely wanted to read my bible daily. With this Bible I got more excited and went back to my thorough daily study. The print is small, but I can read it fine. My mom though said she would have to use her glasses. This is for someone who likes to mark up bibles and make detailed notes. Depending on what type of pen used, it doesn’t bleed through. I recommend a normal pen instead of a gel liquid pen. Though If you use the gel liquid pen it isn’t that much of a noticeable/annoying bleed through. You can still write notes on the next page easily."
"Over all good quality. Im not a fan of the papery cover. The font is super small. The sides for journaling are lined, which I would have preferred to be blank."
"I was a little nervous about the print size when I ordered this bible, based on the reviews.  But, I was pleased when I first opened it to find a font size that is larger than most bibles, and easy to read.  The pages are thin, but still thicker than traditional bible pages.  To be a single column full bible, I was also worried that it would be very think and heavy, but it really isn’t! Also, the pages are a pretty cream color, making for a nice contrast with the text color.  The only reason I took away a star is because I wish the words of Christ were in red like I am used to in other bibles.  The binding seems to be nice and sturdy, as well as the front and back covers, which are actually more of an eggshell white, as opposed to off white like they look in the photos. I can’t wait to customize them!"
"I got two of these bibles to customize as graduation gifts and they were perfect! There was room for journaling as well as the cover being perfect for painting, drawing, etc."
Font is a way too small . It is redicilous to read such a large format Bible with so no legible font. I understand it's jornaling Bible but I got to read it too. Do not recommend this Bible to anyone.
I love this bible and use it regularly. I gave it three stars because the pages are very thin and even thought I have 01 point pens that don’t bleed they still show through the thin pages. The first day I opened the Bible immediately something got on the white cover an ruined the ~white~ look.It is great for the 20$ I got it for (it may have been on a sale) and I use it everyday (: I just thought potential buyers would want to know that the pages are thin. The white cover seems to like to absorb things and so I covered mine with brown paper.
"Unfortunately the text is too small for me, and when coupled with the very thin paper, it’s distracting. Otherwise a nice bible For someone younger"
"Love this bible! Plenty of margin for side notes, the cover is sturdy, I was able to use basic marker pens to sketch on it, and it's a good sized bible. Can't wait to fill up the cover and rest of the Bible with quotes and journaling! Highly recommend! Great price too!"
"Painted this Bible as a wedding present for a friend. It was easy to paint, and looked beautiful when complete!!"
"The Bible itself is amazing and I love it. The one problem is I’m an artist and paint them and almost every time the box and the Bible are dented, damaged or bent. The packaging needs to be improved so that it’s better protected when shipping."
"I bought this because I wanted to start reading the Bible more often, it’s an all white Bible and has journaling spaces. Really nice quality and it’s completely white but the picture didn’t show that. Perfect Bible for teens or anyone who wants to customize their cover."
"I did receive the bible today.  I haven't open it yet because it is my 12 years old daughter's Christmas present.  That was the first item on her list.  When we unwrap it on Christmas morning i will post the picture.  So far, it looks amazing"
This is a nice Bible.  I plan on trying to paint outside cover. It was a little bit smaller than I thought but overall it’s still nice
"I thought it would be a little bit bigger and have more space for notes. But that’s more on my end than an actual problem with the product. Personally, I need much bigger spaces in between the lines. Text is really small. But if you don’t mind these things, it’s a great Bible. Really love the hardcover on it and the strength of the pages."
"I bought this Bible to be customized by a local artist for my best friend who just graduated college. It was very easy to paint a new cover on the Bible, and I love the ESV translation. A great gift for a great friend! I highly recommend."
"This is an awesome Bible for journaling! I use Tombow and Micron pens and sure, the pages are a little thin, but the perfectionist in me is hardly bothered by the very small bleed through which happens because it is almost unnoticeable. I even paint in it and the pages hold awesomely! I have already bought 2! I will be using this brand forever!"
I loved the plain cover!!  I definitely plan on painting it! I was worried the pages would be too thin which they are but my highlighters didn’t bleed too bad! You could hardly tell in person.
I needed highlighters that weren’t going to bleed so I got the crayon gel like ones and they work perfectly. The pages are thin like any other bible but I love how sleek it looks
Using this as our “guest book” in our wedding. We will be painting it for the occasion :)
These are so fun to paint the covers and to take notes inside of! I love the freedom of creativity the covers offer its owner.
Perfect description! Came in perfect condition. Enough room to take notes.
I bought this for my daughter last fall and she got it as a Christmas gift. She went to church camp this past weekend and discovered there were missing books of the bible and chapters out of order. Is there any way to get a replacement? Happy to send  more pictures.
I purchased this bible to paint on for my daughter’s Confirmation. It held up well to the paint and turned out gorgeous.
Pretty just what I was looking for
Beautiful bible. Great for my daughter’s wedding.
It’s perfect!!!
Love the ability to customize
Love it!! I will be using it as my wedding guest book where guest can write by a favorite verse and will be having someone draw a design on the cover to make it unique!
"It had lots of great space for loved ones to leave messages! We also plan to get the front of the Bible painted, we loved the plain cover!"
The spine and back cover were damaged (crushed) upon arrival. I had intended to paint the cover but it won't be an even paint job because of the damage.
This is such a pretty bible and I am in love.
Loved painting this bible! (I recommend using mod modge after painting & don’t use too many coats of paint!) 🌿
Awesome!!! Perfect to paint on. Super nice and sleek. Gods word is the best!!!!! ✨🧡😁✝️
Exactly what I was looking for! Love it!
Perfect for a customized family bible!!!
Great for painting the cover
Amazing
Love this bible! I painted it and used it in senior pictures!
"I’m so upset, the writing is way to small."
Love this! I painted the front beacuse I hated the white but I also wanted something I could customize so I love it! I wish there was more space to write between to words
"Good, very good"
It's beautiful on the Inside. So nice and has a ton of room to write notes on too.The cover is easy to paint or do whatever you want to it.You can truly personalize this to how you want it
"The pictures in the ad aren’t the same as the bible. The bible did come two days earlier then the prime shipping said. I love the bible, the only thing I would say is that the font is very small. I don’t have a problem with it but if you are someone who does I would recommend a larger print. Overall if that doesn’t concern you then this is a great bible. I would also recommend looking for the customer images and not the one in the ad since it’s inaccurate."
"Perfect size, not too heavy. Super excited to customize it, very happy with this purchase will probably buy again so I can customize one for my mother in law!"
Absolutely worth buying. Love it so much
I’m really enjoying Benner’s book. I read another along with a Bible Study group and He’s seriously into knowing who we are in the Lord.If you desire to know God more fully for whoHe Is instead of looking at life experience or so called blessings...read this. The point of our whole existence and worth is found in knowing who He Is. not trying to figure out God through our circumstances with finite minds.
This is written from a fundamentalist perspective. It wasn’t what I expected.
"One of the worst things the church could do to it’s congregants is force them into a mold. To produce carbon copies of the preferred archetype. This is dangerous because people develop a superficial foundation in what they perceive is socially acceptable amongst the community. This produces Christians with no endurance & most of all no identity in Christ. This type of culture in church prohibits diversity & with diversity accompanies effectiveness. We can’t all expect to be missionaries otherwise who will man the fort? We can’t all expect to only minister to the sick we must also tend to the orphan. Our reach is limited when you place limitations on a people who supposedly serve a limitless God. It’s only through the acceptance of our uniqueness in God that we can genuinely find ourselves & our purpose. Otherwise, church just becomes another masquerade that the world easily perceives."
This book is for those at a crossroads of self discovery. The goal is to know your true self in light of truth found in Christ. The author suggests that this truth is only found in the light of Christ. The read is a little “heady” so read slowly to allow time for reflection.I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to those who want their thinking to be challenged to find a new self awareness in the face of Christ.
"After reading this book for two weeks, I can honestly say this book has transformed my life completely. As an aspiring and young pastor I’ve been searching for my voice for a very long time. I’ve been trying to embrace the gift of being myself and this book gave so many powerful truths that has enabled me to discover my false selves.I highly recommend this to young pastors/leaders who struggle with comparison and embracing their own voices. May the Lord bless and keep all of you who finds this book."
Excellent Book on how deeply Our Heavenly Father loves us. Far more than you can ever imagine. A short book yet filled with scripture and wisdom. I have read other books on the same subject that were good but repetitive. You will find yourself taking your time going over each chapter to mine all the spiritual truths in each one.
"This is a refreshing book which pushes you towards the freedom of embracing who God created you to be. One of my favorite books I read in 2015.Especially as Americans, we quickly find our self-worth in what we do. Yet this is not who we are. We are no more or less significant based off of our actions... Just a tid-bit of the (many) truths this book speaks on.Every person who reads this will benefit from it."
"A-Mazing.  For those who are tired of the self help and self help(ish) Christian books that offer little-to-no real answers for a changed life, this book is for you."
"This book is so good I have read it four or five times. It is teaching how to know God and that you can't know God if you don't know yourself. That is because if you aren't honest with yourself about you, you won't come to God with your real issues and he can't show you unless you are willing. At the end of each chapter is a mention of how you might meditate on God's word."
"Dr. Benner's wisdom and experiences are so inspiring and wonderful. I learned so much about Jesus and I began to fall more in love with him from reading this book. I also learned a lot about myself, and I am considering reading it again, because it is so jam-packed with wisdom that I feel I need a long time to process and digest each chapter! Thank you, Dr. Benner!"
"I chose this book because it was a referral reading from another book I read, loving God with all your mind, in that book the author refers to other books that help us to better develops our mind, to know God more.  This book was not a long book and it developed my mind d in the area of gospel meditation, which interested me.  It also reflects on know I g yourself you have to know God.  I really like the book and will probably read it again, I recommend to any Christian who wAnts to start developing their mind towards God's will."
"Possibly one of the most insightful books to read if you are searching for spiritual formation and freedom from needing to ""create yourself."" Biblical and eye opening, relieving and convicting. At first the title turned me off because most books along this line are about trying to ""find yourself"" or working to ""create who you are"". But the is about knowing God deeper and in doing so, discovering who you are in Christ. If you are an enneagram 4 on the enneagram test, please read this book."
"THE GIFT OF BEING YOURSELF: THE SACRED CALL TO SELF DISCOVERY.  Item ordered on 09/13/21 and received on 09/17/21. This book is new and clean throughout. It is a softbound, and a small book (127 pp total), but it is big in contents to spiritual self-journey. It is very engaging and I could not put it down. The six-session discussion guide section is profound. This is a special gift to me (from me). Thank you, David Benner for writing and sharing your wisdom to the world."
Wow!  This book is absolutely fantastic;  it is foundational to knowing who you are.  If you’re a human being you need to read this book.  I’m serious.  Many times I had to stop and think about the implications of the ideas Benner presented.  They are wide and far reaching.  He examines who we are at our core.If this isn’t a must read then there are none.  I highly recommend that you get this book and discover who you are and who God is.  Amazing stuff don’t miss it!
I have been looking for a book that bridges my love of sitting in silence and mediation with my acceptance of GOD and spirituality.This book helped me experience god and know him more fully
This book has been a game changer ! My mom got it for me ironically at the perfect time - my therapist uses this to help w/ personal growth.  He really understands neuroscience - the brain being a psychologist.  It’s fascinating!  There’s plenty of knowing God books but this is the only one that really addresses knowing and loving acceptance of ourselves to deeply know God !  He walks you through dozens of exercises throughout the book and at the end - for each chapter (and I still read it again and again !) for example on mindful meditation of the gospels - it’s truly life altering !
"Love this series!! Really gets you thinking about relationships between God, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, and yourself. These are some of my favorite books for inner reflection and how to find, build, and move my relationship with the Lord. Not to mention these books help greatly with Bible study of the Word of the Lord, meditation, and prayer."
"I wish i had read this 30 years ago, it would have saved me (and my loved ones), a lot of heart ache. But, better late than never, and God can still remold me and chip away the false veneer i have spent a lifetime accumulating."
"Truly a geat book. One that I will return to time and again. It's not a phycological feel good book, though....it will really get down to business about how much we are loved by our Heavenly Father and if we will allow ourselves to  live like that we will have the freedom to be our true selves."
"The Gift of Being Yourself (2004) by David Benner is a useful little book for those interested in understanding themselves. Benner is a professor of psychology and spirituality who is interested in understanding more than just behavioral change. In this book, he explores John Calvin's dual maxim that as Christians we must come to know God and come to know ourselves. Although this book dedicates a chapter to the former as a necessary requisite for the latter, the majority of the book is committed to helping the reader explore issues of self understanding, which is best accomplished by knowing how we relate to God. In particular, there is a clear call to knowing yourself as one deeply loved by God. Once you realize yourself as one deeply loved, you can then begin to explore your true self--not the self you want others to see--but who you truly are.  This book provides some practical ways to begin this journey. It is readable, engaging, and important."
An excellent book on learning how to discover who you are in Christ. To transform you must know who you are in Christ. To know who you are in Christ you must know who you really are deep down in the ugly parts of your soul. They Go hand in hand. Easy to read and digest slowly so you can put into practice what he is recommending. Transformation takes work and takes time in relationship with Jesus.
Benner is a gifted and insightful author who brings his background and skills as a psychologist and a spiritual director to reflections on the human person.  This book is for anyone interested in reflections on what it mean to be fully human and fully alive.
"Received book in good shape, as expected. Delivered timely and just started reading it and it speaks to my spirit beautifully. A great read."
This is probably one of the most important books I have ever read.  It is a small book loaded with spiritual wisdom and truth.  Every follower of Christ should read it.  It has given me a true understanding of what vocation and calling are really about.
"This book should be mandatory reading for all Christians. We seldom see ourselves, our motives, our individual existence in these terms. Eye opening and soul shaking."
"Agree with reviews here. Simple language, deep thought and profoundly practical. This is a good book for someone struggling to find their identity in Christ. This guy knows what he is talking about!"
"Have you ever read a book that you felt was written specifically for you? The Gift of Being Yourself by David G. Benner was definitely that book for me. It is the second book in a series of three books (the first book being Surrender to Love and the final book being Desiring God's Will) that a friend recommended to me. There are only six chapters so it really isn't a difficult read.The chapter titles give you an idea of the specific topics covered by the book: Transformational Knowing of Self and God, Knowing God, First Steps Toward Knowing Yourself, Knowing Yourself as You Really Are, Unmasking Your False Self, and Becoming Your True Self.Read my entire review at: http://scottcouey.com/2013/05/30/being-yourself-is-a-gift-most-treasured/"
"A friend recommended this book to me.  This book took more time than most to read because there is a lot of self-reflection, evaluation and guided exercises that help you uncover your self-deception.  It outlines a process of spiritual growth & transformation in friendship with God rather than just a life-duty of obedience. What freedom and joy we have to live in awareness that we are loved & made right with God and can find deep calling as we live in peace with God-in-us through the power of Jesus sacrifice, forgiveness and His Spirit in our lives."
This book is wrecking me in the best way. Wow- I’m telling everyone I know how insightful it is!
"Excellent reading and balanced perspective between Discovering God and Self-discovery. Far from the self-help methods or ""how-to"" books, this is a Manifesto to become better in order to live, love and serve humanity better through the guidance and grace of God. A Must Read. Thank you!"
"I always thought of myself as grounded in reality, and confident in my identity. While I started reading this book seeking to gain wisdom to help a friend, I found some great treasures for my own life, and discovered truths about myself that I never knew. Definitely recommended to anyone wanting to be honest with themselves about who they really are at the core of their being."
"This book helps one explore and expose the truth about one's self.  Highlighted by spiritual and psychological insights and wonderful contemplative frameworks of thoughts and perspectives, Benner's training and experience become accessible tools to the reader."
I gained real insight of myself through reading this. I've been having a real struggle with my identity for the better part of 2 years and I finally came to understand some things just through this quick and easy read. Helped something click for me. Seems like many others had as good a luck as I did
"This book was recommended by a friend and leadership coach as I seek to become a better leader, a better husband, a better father, a better - no strike that- as I seek to become the me that the Great I Am created and has continued to will into Being.Know that the ""you"" that picks up this book physically or digitally will not be the same ""you"" that finishes it.Highly recommended for anyone wanting to become the true being that God created or those tired of walking through life without a truly defined identity? This book will be a regular part of my life."
Dr Benners book is truly an amazing gift. If you are a Christ Follower who has been broken and you seek wholeness in Christ...this is a book that will aid you on your transformational journey!
A wildly helpful guide into what Jesus meant by dying to self to find your self.  Will be referencing back to this on often on my personal journey.  Brenner has a lot of clinical insights to add that help get you inside your own head.
Totally excellent book on how to know myself as I know God.
great ideas and will written
"David’s way of sharing his own journey, drawing parallels from Scripture, and sharing stories from the life of others really helped to reinforce the truths in this book. Thankful for the challenges to prayerfully reflect on this truth and apply it."
This is a great book to grow your understanding of both God and yourself.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to dig deeper into their faith journey.

"This is an extremely important book for humans.  It is a radical book in the sense that it will challenge your favorite dictums yet if you allow the author to speak to you, another Author, will speak to you and your life will be forever changed and transformed.  I heartily endorse this text and its author."
This was a fantastic and thorough look at discovering who God made us to be as individuals. It was a little dry in it’s presentation but definitely worth the read.
"Benner is thoughtful and gentle. He guides you graciously through some deep water, allowing you to feel the deep without being overcome. Give yourself the gift of reading this book over and over."
"The author offers some nourishing (although not always tasty) food for one who is hungry for an authentic, fulfilling intimacy with our heavenly Father."
This pushed me deeper.. And caused me to really evaluate... well everything.. I love the amount of truth written on each page.
"This book is uniquely profound as Brenner unpacks a clear path to discovering our true self and what that means to how we invest our life.  I found this book to be deeply revealing, intimately inspiring, and a MUST read for any soul journey.If you don't know yourself read this book, you will discover the real you in the process.  I just finished the book and starting again right now."
I enjoyed the practicality of applying to my own life and how it related to Jesus own walk with God.
An insightful book that leads the reader to being receptive to the gift of self knowledge of our true selves in Christ.
"Very good as it helps one to look at their own life in term of your relationship with God, asking the question ""do I really know God or only of Him""?"
"I spent the 24 years of my life thus far having no idea who I was. I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grew up as a kid so I didn't try in school because I felt there was no reason to as I had no goals. I became an actor before I even got into school theatre, learning to blend in with every ""clique"" and personality out there. I've lost friends and romantic interests because they could tell I wasn't authentic and never knew who they were really opening up to.This book has helped me to make sense of a lot of it, and I really wish I had known this all as a kid... It's a very enjoyable read and only a little over 100 pages, so easy to get through if you're like me and don't have much time to read - but there is so much within those pages! :D"
I am really enjoying this book.  If you are looking to grow in your relationship with God - this is a must read but it is not for the faint of heart!
I liked that this book wasn’t about fluff but had practical and actionable steps that you can take to grow.
"This is my first book to read by David Benner and it will not be my last.  It has opened so many doors for me to pray about, as I have learned so much about myself.  It is a Must read for anyone trying to find SELF in GOD."
This book is condense and to the point.
"Need a very long time to digest. Repeated read more than 4 times.  Very insightful. Recommend read his book Surrender to love first, then desiring god’ will, then this one."
"Loved it! I love who God has created me to be, and I long no more to be any different from whom He created me to be!"
"This book leads us to pause and reflect on knowing ourselves in the context of knowing God.  This includes the good, bad, and the ugly.  This is an important idea which has been largely unexplored by religious communities.  I found some gems here that are catalysts for becoming a whole person.  While some parts of the book were more engaging than others, the concept the author introduces is fundamentally important."

"I literally underline so much of this book. And I am usually pretty conservative with my underlining. It's so beautiful, practical, and full of truth. You should buy it."
"It is a clear, concise guide to understanding self in relationship with God and community. It is an excellent book of anyone who works closely with others and seek to gain a self understand of how one functions and why in the context of the greater community."
Great book and in really great condition.
"Good shape, great book."
A great explanation of how to identify and let go of the 'false self' built upon the fickle and thin foundation of our inconsistent and conditional successes and replace it with your unique and true self built on the solid and unbreachable foundation of God's perception of us as precious human life that bears His image and that is restored to wholeness and holiness through the work of Jesus Christ on the cross and through the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit in the human heart.  ~C
"SO much to consider. I read it slowly and am now working my way through it again, highlighting and following the study guide. Excellent book!"
"Enjoyed Benner's writing style, which makes ""self discovery"" as down-to-earth and so easy to understand that I wondered why we don't all have such wisdom.  Whatever our place in this world, whatever our belief, this book is a joy."
This man has a way of taking the pains that we experience and using them to help us understand them and then use them to grow. Brilliant.
"Powerful book, wish all Christians could read it!"
Great book! Highly recommend
This is the most impactful book I have ever read. I'm currently reading it a second time. I've purchased copies to give to my closest friends and family.
I read this book some time ago.  I gave good information and Biblical foundation.  It was helpful during a time when I needed some reassurance about who I am in God.  This book is a good read for those who want to know more about their Christ-identity.
Arrived today!  Cannot wait to read it.  It came HIGHLY recommended!
"This book was suggested to me. Can't say enough about it. It's a powerful short read. It is not a self-help book. It is truly effective in shedding great light on ""self"" and how self relates directly to God as His intentions or your life."
This book had me agreeing with some things and frustrated and disagreeing with others. Definitely challenged the way I thought about certain beliefs.
Benner does a great job of making the link between knowing God and knowing yourself. He gives practical advice for both.
Walking through this book is a journey with a spiritual director.  If the reader follows the gentle instructions of each chapter a deeper awareness of Gods movements within with occur.
Great Book! Using it for a church group...loving it!
Awesome book about knowing God for real!
Book in excellent condition
This book gave a clear path to knowing myself in God and what to think about along the way. Very good for anyone seeking clarity for their lives and how to seek truth if their lives in God.
Well written many suggestions on ways to work toward becoming your true sel
"Needs to be read a few times and expect to need outside help to really apply this book but the fruit is well worth the efforts.He speaks to the heart and something deep within says, ""Yes!"""
This is absolutely one of the best books I ever read. I am excited about my journey of discovering my true self in Christ. I’m even more excited about introducing my true self to the world.
Haven’t read the book to completion as yet but I highly recommend this to anyone who struggles with their Identity.
"This book is clearly written and provides a fine introduction to various forms of self-analysis.  I find it helpful for those who want to begin a spiritual journey, and a broad spectrum of practices and methods is provided.  I found some of the published reviews a bit overstated, and suggest other books for those who are looking for a more in-depth presentation of any one way to get to know oneself better."
Really like this book. Not a lot of repeating himself which I like!
I did not think I ordered this.  only the kindle and paperback.
The author clearly helps the reader understand the source of who we are as centered in God and apart from him we are our false self. I loved reading it and will continue to refer back as I discover myself and God.
"This book is the second in a series that adds on to the first book by David Benner, Surrender to Love.  This book talks about the importance of after knowing ""whose you are"" then knowing yourself in relationship to and with God."
I have done all of these exercises before but the context that Dr. Brenner provided facilitated fruitful results.  A great discernment tool.
It is a short book but the info given was very validating to me as a Christian and brought a few ideas I hadn't thought of.
"This was a dear book about knowing God. While it could be summed easily and while it was repetitive, it was process learning."
"I don't like to generalize the word Christian now that it's come to mean something cultural or religious, but not at all about Jesus. Nevertheless the book is solid on the subject of identity -- not just who we are in Christ but what God is making of us."
Very pleased
"When we look for our true self, having a guide , like this book, is a great help. Enjoy reading."
"This was a book of freedom and affirmation of self for me. The aspects that you thought were wired or different, but in truth, exactly how God made you to be for the calling he has on your life.  This is also a book that I will review every year or two to check myself and recalibrate my journey if needed.  I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone that desires to be rooted in God's handiwork with them."
A must read for anyone seeking to truly know God! One of the best books Ive ever read. Life changing
Good read...…….
My 18 year old son is reading and discussing this book with a mentor. It is very helpful.
"This is an outstanding book, truly life-changing.  I wish everyone could read it!"
uiters kosbaar. Maklike skryfstyl
This is one heady guide to find yourself. But did you expect it would be easy? Deep and enriching. Well worth the read.
Love this book! Borrowed it from my pastor friend...decided I needed my own copy.
This book is well written. This book mentions about Father Basil Pennington who I think Is a very good writer.
good
"Be bed does a great job of balancing the good and bad which make up our persons, and helping us to discover who we are in Christ, which is our true self."
Benner is an author you will want to read.  He writes to those who desire a deeper walk with God the Father through Jesus Christ.  It is more than a religion.  It is a RELATIONSHIP.
Such a great book.
The author uses many biblical references to back up his points. This book helps you confront the things about yourself you may not want to look at but desperately need to.
"Book arrived promptly, great shape, will make the perfect gift for Christmas! Thanks."
"Very insightful read.. Highly recommended !!  Its amazing how much we live a false self - as the author relates: we have become ""masters of deception"".. it takes great courage to enter ourselves with honesty but with it comes real transformation in Christ.. If you really seek change in your life then READ THIS BOOK !! 

  
The Gift of Being Yourself: The Sacred Call to Self-Discovery"
I thought this book had some jewels to help ignite the passion for a deeper relationship with God based on how he created us to be
VERY FREEING !  WE DON'T HAVE TO KEEP PLEASING OTHERS !  ONLY GOD ! EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS IT IS A BLESSING !
"Such a wonderful book!  If you are looking to know yourself more, I highly recommend this."
I thoroughly enjoyed how this book always had me focus on me in relation to Christ. The exercises were helpful
Great book. Most people try to please everybody but themselves. Good teachings. Recommend highly.
Really good book. It encourages you to be authentic and to feel what you feel. Don't deny your feelings because you're 'supposed to' feel something different. Don't rush to ask 'why am I this way?' just feel where you're at and know that god loves you where you're at.
Excellent read
"Incredible book!!!!  A fast, yet profound book that will change your life!"
"“Nothing is more important, for if we find our true self we find God, and if we find God, we find our most authentic self.”Don’t let the cover fool you. I will be honest, when I first heard the title, The Gift of Being Yourself, I thought it sounded like a pathetic, self-motivational, feel-good book. Then I saw the cover of the book and I though it looked like a pathetic, self-motivational, feel-good book you would find in your church lady’s library.But the book is actually a decent, concise look at spiritual development. Benner has some actual credentials and understanding concerning how we approach God. If we do not have a strong understanding of who I am, then I am incapable of understanding who God is.This is not some new age spirituality. This is not a book about finding God in everything. This is about finding yourself in the midst of who God is. When you look at yourself you can find God and looking at God you can find yourself."
"This helped me to understand myself and my identity in Christ as a child of God. Such self-understanding and self-knowledge in God is essential for leaders, and especially as they want to provide spiritual direction to others and to present others perfect in Christ."
"Finished this book only to find myself wanting to start again at the beginning, and read more slowly the second time around. I will definitely be looking for more books by this author as well."
The Gift of Being Yourself is a gem that is worth a second read.  Sentence after sentence is easy to read and enriches the reader. Benner gives the reader plenty to reflect upon and uses scripture as illustrations to clearly  make his point.
This book is a winner.  Definitely read this for inspiration.  A wonderful book for young adults as is Poema Foible.
Thanks!!
AMAZING.... POWERFUL!!!
The book is brand new and was shipped properly.  Thank you.
Used as a Sunday School discussion study
"In all the search for identity, David Benner shows us the path to our true selves, which is nothing apart from God.  This is a clear explanation of what the false self is, how it was formed and how we can find and develop our true self with God.  It is a book I will refer to again and again on my soul care journey as well as share with others."
Good read
An outstanding treatment of the question of self identity and offering balance and grace to the process of discovery.
This is an excellent book for one who is ready to be genuine and is struggling with the issue of knowing God verses knowing about God. It is a journey and this is a tool that can help with self awareness and God awareness. I highly recommend it.
This book reveals in simple terms how knowing that God first loved us explains how we can know ourselves.  This is really what the meaning of life is about.
good book.
"Amazing , life transforming book and it's short for non-readers like myself!"
I really enjoyed this book and think everyone should read it. I bought it for my husband and brother.
This book changed the way I see myself more than any single book.
This is a book you'll come back to reread as its packed with spiritual nuggets that aid ongoing spiritual growth.
"I am a practicing Christan and this book sort of verified some of the  concept sI already believed. The author, David Benner did not say what his qualifications are. He seems to be diagnosing christian problems as a psychologist in a 9 part  break down of possible problems.  It is interesting, but he seems not to guide us to reliance on faith"
This short journey of a book truly walks a path of continued self discovery... mostly by inspiring one to KNOW Father more as well as endeavor to know the real me in Him...great
A must read.
"Small book, but very powerful ."
"This is a great book overall. It is very well written and engaging and had very eye opening content. It can get a little spiritual at times but for most of the readers, I'm sure that's not a problem."
This is my second reading David Benner's second book in the series. I have found a second reading gives me a greater appreciation for the things David has called us to consider.
Really enjoyed this book. Our individuality is a gift and God created us uniquely. As we get to know Him we get to know ourself and are continually transformed in to the image of Jesus.
"There's stuff in this book that is so well written . . . it clarified much of my muddled thinking.  Thank you, thank you!"
This is a life book that I can read over and over again.
Challenged me in my walk with Jesus.
This is a great book full of exercises for the lifelong pursuit of discerning one's calling. Benner artfully interprets theology to define a path on this journey.
Great read
A great read!
The Gift of Being Yourself was recommended to me 2 years ago.  I added it to my list of reads but never purchased it.  As I read the book I started reflecting on my journey realizing God's movement and activities to help me move away from False me toward True me.  David Benner's writing style confronted my analytical tendencies which led me to slow down and take in each word/phrase/sentence.  I appreciate Benner's spending more time on how we come to Know God by seeing the false self all of us construct and the true self emerging as we wrestle with God in the depths of our being.  There are a few books that I return to over and over.  I think this will be one.
"Very insightful and helpful to me being at this phase of life in my journey.  This is a book to read ""thoughtfully,"" and to potentially dialogue with others about."
"very interesting subject matter, but somewhat repetitive and/or redundant. Chapters 2-3 worked better than melatonin, The final chapters were good, (this review is of course relative to my personal likes and dislikes). Still an ok read for those wanting more understanding of SELF."
very insightful and helpful in my journey
"There is an elite inner circle of 5 or 6 books which have changed the course of my life; this is among them. This book contains insights heretical to conformed Christian thinking.  This is not a book about learning how to be good enough, how to fix yourself, or how to find acceptance in exclusive circles...no, this is a book about discovering your deep belovedness as you are, and how to come to terms with God's unconditional love and wisdom in designing you and embracing you for His own intimate purposes.  This is a book about transformation, not conformity. This is a book that will bow your head low before His presence, and lift your head high in your rightful place among men.  What a place the Christian community would be if we truly allowed Him to genuinely transform us, instead of wearing the obligatory masks of conformed thinking and behaviors in wasteful grasps for acceptance and approval.  I will never go back to those masks, now that I know who I am!"
It answered so many questions that I had been asking and looking for. Awesome from beginning to end. Definately leads you back to our Lord and Savior.  jj
This is an excellent book for those who are trying to find their true self in God!!
"Great book for those in the process of wanting to know God and self in a deeper way. Practical exercises, too, which help the reader delve deeper into both these areas. A book worth reading and re-reading."
"Lifechanging!  I found the words in this book like water to my dried soul.  It brought life to places that only held death and darkness in the past.  When God made man he said, ""Very Good"".  We somehow bought into the devil's lies and do not realize the wonder of God's work in us.  Buy this.  It is an encouragement to embrace the potential that God has placed in you and become who you were intended to become."
Great book!
Well written and very insightful. The author points out how easy it is for us to become self-centered even in our Christian walk. Benner helps us to look honestly at ourselves and recognize the areas we need to change while also helping us to identify our strengths and gifting.
What a great book to put forth a call to self discover with intrinsic view and call to spiritual formation!
Absolutely enjoyed this book. Benner clearly and thoughtfully awakens the reader to the connection between knowledge of self and knowledge of God.
This book was amazing and helped me realize so much about myself and who I need to truly be in Christ.
"This book provides a great framework for understanding the self & how to find the good life ( happiness) we all seek. It is through finding ourselves, not worshipping but finding our real self. Benner not only explains this well, he provides some steps or experiments to try to begin to find your real self. I highly recommend anyone desiring to know God through his greatest creation - you."
This book is a great companion for all seeking to add foundational courage in who they really are in God.
Brilliant.  This is a topic that needs to be addressed more.  Well Said!
"Great, interesting read and conceptual understanding of self & spiritual development!"
Deeply insightful book. Just finished my first read. Will be revisiting it again.
This book were everything I hoped it would be. I would definitely recommend the reading of this book to everyone.
"This is a well written, easy-to-read book that is a must for anyone wanting to become the best of what God designed them to be"
Great
I needed it for a class I was taking Thanks for asking This book is something I would give to someone
I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to grow in their relationship with God and in their understanding of themselves.
The product came in a very timely manner!  The book was in new condition and was great!  Thanks!
If you are looking to find more out about yourself on a deeper and spiritual level this is the book to read! It does a wonderful job explaining how to be who God has created you to be all while nurturing yourself and learning to communicate with those around you who are at different levels than you are.
Excellent book!
"So much more than I expected. The book was recommended to me by a friend, but I had no idea. I read it through in no time and gave it to my wife immediately after afterwards. Spoke into my life, callings, relationship with God and I thought it was simply a book on being authentic. So much more. More hope, more relationships, more life, I cannot recommend the book enough."
"In ""The Gift of Being Yourself"", Benner simply, clearly, and eloquently articulates how we can actually discover, embrace, and live out of our true self. I appreciate his insightful, encouraging reminders: although this growth process may seem slow and painful at times, the freedom of living out of our true self and knowing the Creator of our true self more intimately are incomparably greater."
"This book is so good that I have ordered more than once and given as gifts to those who can understand the call to be yourself; to accept all you are, the good, the bad, the ugly, that's the real you as you are, not pretending to be someone you are not. God is good and loves you even if your fallen state, but He can not walk beside someone has not yet come into knowing themselves who they truly are .In order for God you find you, and walk beside you, it must be the real you that He finds.There are simply no short cuts; in order to be who you would really like to be; you must start by accepting who you are now. Apart from God, you alone can change nothing. When you know who you really are, God in His Mercy will come to  you, not to judge and condemn you, but to love you, and to forgive, you and to heal your broken heart.From there you can grow honestly with God always by your side,  to then begin the long, and at times hard journey, to  becoming the beautiful person God had always planned for you to be. This book is must reading for all who yearn for  something more in their lives, something that only God can supply, the beauty of truth; the knowledge of the real Truth; God: who wants a relationship with people who are real, in touch with who they really are, and in touch the majesty of  God, their best friend. It's 5 star reading from start to finish. I highly recommend this book. 5 stars."
We are studying this book in my group bible study.  It is VERY thought provoking and the discussion questions in the back are extremely helpful.
I read this book for school and I am glad that I did.  Its not something that I would have picked up for myself however I encourage others to do so.  The book provokes you to desire to shed all of what you know about yourself and then rebuild your being by the what God reveals to you.  I found the ideas in this book calling me to freedom to be me as God sees me and not as I have seen myself or as the world has seen me.
Powerfully healing book! I haven't found one this excellent for a long time. I will reread it over and over...Loved it.
"Brennan Manning always delights, never disappoints and always writes with the grace of God. I will be reading this one again."
Arrived as expected
"After reading Surrender to love, this volume continues that work. I highly recommend this to anyone (especially Christians) who long for more of Christ."
"A wise book that opens up the areas of knowing yourself and knowing God. Insightful, well-written and accessible I highly recommend this book."
Recommend for people both new to and experienced in the spiritual journey of discovering God's love at our very core! I found the exercises were practical and helpful  to open up space and allow the Spirit to speak!
Study group selection.
Recommend this read for anyone looking to deepen their intimacy with God! ...I need now 5 more words to submit this oh we're good now. Good bye.
"Also, easy to read.  Good guidelines for living."
"This was a good foundational book.  The young that recommended this loved this book, and why I wouldn't rate it is high for me it was a good read and drew me into God's Presence."
"The book was very well written and insightful. However, it was the worst condition used book I have ever purchased. It had been marked up extensively inside by 2 different readers. There were no indicators before purchase that it was so badly marked up."
"Mr. Benner has a low view of scripture which leads him to teach poor theology and lead people towards idolatry through the practice of ""gospel meditation"". I do not recommend this book but rather recommend reading Calvin's writing on the subject in the Institutes.See http://pauloverby.blogspot.com/2015/01/knowing-god-gospel-meditation-idolatry.html for more information on Benner's practice of ""gospel mediation"" as put forth in this book."
"This book was  chosen by our small group leader. I got absolutely nothing out of it! It is full of psychobabble and bizarre ideologies of behavior. Those who are in baby stages of their spirituality will walk away from this book thinking they need to find something wrong with themselves in order to be normal. The ""nail on the head"" for me was when the author referenced Sigmund Freud. The reliability of the book dwindled instantly for me. One cannot write a valid book about God and spirituality by quoting Freud. The concepts simply do not equate on any level."
We are now teaching distracting and side issues to believers. This is a dangerous direction to be heading. I call this the social gospel of self.
"In the Preface there is enough evidence to ignore this book. The author references Matthew 10:39, but did not quote it. Jesus said in verse 39, ""He who has found his life will lose it, and he who has lost his life for My sake will find it."" Ponder that statement - read it 3 or 4 times and think about what is being said. Jesus is NOT talking about self-discovery! Jesus is saying if you focus on this world and yourself you forfeit eternal life - you ""lose it."" But, ""he who has lost his life for My sake will find it."" The Lord is saying you must be willing, if necessary, to forsake everything to be a true follower of the Lord Jesus Christ, and thereby gain eternal life. Read Matthew 10:34-39 for the context. We must put our love for Christ above all other relationships. We still love those in our family, friends and our neighbors, but our supreme love should be for God. Jesus said the greatest commandment is to love God with all our heart, soul, and mind. The second most important commandment is to love our neighbors as we do ourselves. (Matthew 22:35-40) There is no third commandment here to love ourselves. Loving ourselves comes naturally - that's the problem with the world today!The author also said in the Preface, ""While concepts such as self-discovery, identity and authenticity are easily dismissed as mere psychobabble...."" Well, YES!!! This book is dangerous to one's true spiritually. Read the New Testament for confirmation, become a disciple of Jesus Christ and be rewarded with eternal in heaven."
"""The Gift Of Being Yourself"" by David Benner is a good read on being yourself as a beloved creation of God.  Just over 100 pages, the book covers such topics as:1.  Steps for truly knowing yourself (hint: it starts by knowing you are beloved by God and He knows everything about you).2.  Addressing the false beliefs we hold about ourselves.3.  Suggestions for becoming your true self.4.  Discussion guide at the end of the book to accompany the title.Very readable and full of helpful insights.  Will read again in the future.  I was given a review copy by IVP Press in exchange for a fair review."
"This is such a wonderful, powerful book. I listened to it on my free Hoopla app, but now want to buy my own copy. This book is full of good truths about the enormous love God has for each one of us – just as we are. This book would make a great gift. Thanks to my sister for the recommendation!"
"""The Gift of Being Yourself"" is an exceptional investigation of the subject of self-identity.  The author, David Benner, is able to masterfully bridge the Biblical paradox of death-to-self and self-discovery.  He writes, ""For if we find our true self we find God, and if we find God, we find our most authentic self.""  We don't find our true self by seeking self-identity but by seeking God.Benner sees our identity not as a creation but as a discovery and as a gift from God.  By discovering and living our uniqueness, we fulfill our destiny.  The purpose of the book is to assist people in the transformational journey of becoming their true self in Christ and living out the vocation that this involves.  To do so we must know ourselves as known by God.  In knowing ourselves and knowing God we can experience the gift of being ourselves.The author contends that through self-deception, we tend to confuse our true self with some ideal self we wish we were. We adopt mask that portray us differently than who we authentically are. Self-discovery is not to escape reality but to commit to it.  We must decide to accept what is really there and accept ourselves as we are and accept God as He is, not how we would want each to be. Spiritual transformation does not result from fixing our problems.  Our sin nature is not self-fixable.  Instead, spiritual transformation results from turning to God in the midst of our problems and meeting God just as we are.It starts by coming to know God.  If we come to know God, we come to know love, and to love God is to know God.  It's not simply knowing about God, but it is personally meeting God in Jesus.  To do so Benner recommends Spirit-guided meditation of the Gospels and meeting God in the events of life through prayerfully reviewing each day.  Benner puts a high value on solitude throughout the process of self-discovery.  He gives instruction and insights into carrying out these disciplines.All of us tend to reject our true self that is created in the likeness of God.  Instead we chose a way independent of God that is our false self.  This false-self is created out of placing my value in what I have, what I do and what people think of me, rather than in God's loving acceptance of me.  If we do not want to live in bondage to our false-self we must be prepared to be other than our image of our self.  We must allow God to embrace us just the way we really are.Coming to know and trust God's love is a lifelong process.  It begins by letting God know our desire to experience His perfect love.  We must allow God to accept us just as we are and enable us to accept ourselves. In doing this we dare to allow God access to the dark parts of our soul.  Self-acceptance always precedes genuine self-surrender and self-transformation.Following a discovery of our authentic self, Benner then moves into a discovery of our vocation.  Our vocation is always a response to a Divine call to take our place in the Kingdom of God.  It always involves the care of God's creation and people, moving us to humility, love, self-sacrifice and stewardship.  From Luke 4 Benner wonderfully explains that Jesus' understanding of vocation came out of wrestling with God, himself and the devil in the solitude of the wilderness.""The Gift of Being Yourself"" is a thoughtful, practical, and easy read.  It is not the definitive textbook for self-discovery nor does it fully answer all of the questions.  Yet, the small investment of time you spend reading the book may provide just what you've needed to begin the journey of self-discovery through an encounter with God."
"""There is only one problem on which all my existence, my peace, and my happiness depend: to discover myself in discovering God. If I find Him I will find myself and if I find my true self I will find Him.""  ~~Thomas MertonI really enjoyed this book. Time and again as I moved from chapter to chapter, I found personal connection to the things Dr. Benner was writing. It was the revelation of ""I"" crucified many years ago in my own life that set me on the journey I am on today.I don't think this book is for the faint of heart...at least not those who are not ready for deep and serious soul searching examination. The Gift of Being Yourself is about unmasking and forsaking the false self that so many of us have created, the masked personifications of ourselves we hide behind.The first chapter of the book, Transformational Knowing of Self and God, sets the premise that we cannot know God without knowing ourselves first and Benner quotes several great writers (John Calvin, Thomas a'Kempis, and Augustine) of Christian thought to support this premise. I do not find this premise incongruous with what Scripture teaches us in as much as we understand ""knowing God"" as developing a deep and meaningful relationship with Him. It is with this understanding that I found complete agreement in a statement Benner makes with the continuing development of his premise; he writes:""Knowing God and knowing self are therefore interdependent. Neither can proceed very far without the other. Paradoxically, we come to know God best not by looking at God exclusively, but by looking at God and then looking at ourselves--then looking at God, and then again looking at ourselves. This is also the way we best come to know ourselves. Both God and self are mostly fully known in relationship to each other."" (p.26)Once Dr. Benner establishes the premise of knowing self, he moves to chapter two and begins to construct a baseline for Knowing God. It is my understanding of this baseline that knowing God consists of full surrender of self (we must know the true self first in order to surrender), and then move on to a continuing exploration of experiential intimacy in relationship with God. Benner describes the relationship as coming primarily with knowledge and friendship with Jesus. He makes the distinction in the type of knowledge he speaks with a wonderful quote from J. I. Packer who said, ""...a little knowledge of God is worth more than a great deal of knowledge about Him.""In further developing the knowledge of God, Benner points the reader-seeker to Jesus in the Gospels. He also provides several tools for the surrendered seeker to experiment with as they meet God-in-the-flesh through Jesus. Some of these tools include imaginative reading, contemplative reading (aka Lectio Divina), the examen, and journaling.A significant portion of the book (chapters 3-5) is spent helping the reader understand the true self. Benner explains the importance of this understanding by saying, ""Knowing ourselves must therefore begin by knowing the self that is known by God. If God does not know us, we do not exist."" This statement made me pause a moment and consider words I remembered Jesus saying in Matthew 7:23; ""Depart from me, I never knew you...""  I pondered a question in my own mind that seemed to make sense; is our true self the only us that is known by God? Perhaps this is why Jesus says ""away from me, I never knew you"" to a person who knows about God, but does not know of God having lived the entirety of their life in the guise of the false self. And, I continue even today to consider this...As I said, chapters three, four, and five are deep, soul-searching chapters. I spent much time highlighting and writing in the margins of the book in these chapters as I found point after point that I had realized in my own journey. I found new ways of articulating some of my own experiences and was greatly affirmed in what I discovered. For instance, one of the lies I believed before surrendering myself to God fully was the idea and fear of ""losing my identity."" I was scared I would become some weird automaton facsimile of myself. Realizing ""my identity"" was something I needed to lose; I trusted God and surrendered my self to Him. It was in this act that found a practical understanding of ""dying to self"" and the realization of Galatians 2:20, being crucified with Christ. Dr. Benner explains it as follows:""Crucifixion should be directed toward our sin nature. And we must first accept it as our nature, not simply human nature. Only after we genuinely know and accept everything we find within our self can we begin to develop the discernment to know what should be crucified and what should be embraced as an important part of self."" (p.58)Chapter five, Unmasking Your False Self, was one of the most heavily highlighted and annotated chapters of the book for me (chapter six being the other). My attention was on full alert as Benner made this challenging statement. ""The only hope for unmasking the falsity that resides at the core of our being is a radical encounter with truth. Nothing other than truth is strong enough to dispel illusion. And only the Spirit of Truth can save us from the consequences of having listened to the serpent rather than God.""Benner describes the original sin of Adam as the same sin that continues to separate and confuse our relationship with God. He describes the confusion with these words;""Their (Adam and Eve) desire to be like God was not in itself the problem. For God had created them in the Divine image and wanted them to be like God. However, God's gift of likeness was quite different from that offered by the deceiver. The core of the lie that Adam and Eve believed was that they could be like God without God. But without God the most we can ever do is make ourselves into god."" (p.79)The remainder of chapter five never slows pace from that point. Dr. Benner brings to light many things that cause us to stumble and be challenged in our efforts to know God. All of these challenges are directly related to the confusion of our identity, our true identity, which can only be found in Christ. And, as stated in the opening premise of the book, in order to know God-Christ, I have to know myself.The final chapter, Becoming Your True Self, was a wonderful and hope-inspired reprieve from the previous three chapters. The hope of finding our true self and finding that self in God is shared by Benner with these words:""We do not find our true self by seeking it. Rather, we find it by seeking God. For as I have said, in finding God we find our truest and deepest self. (p91)Although the chapter is not long (seventeen pages), it covers a lot of ground. With discovery of our true self, we find purpose, unique identity, vocation (or calling), and a real sense of the ability to love and be loved. Many comparisons and examples are made to the life of Jesus as illustrated and depicted in the Gospels... He is after all, our model; ""follow me..."" Similarly, as Jesus stated his purpose was to do the will of His Father, our calling and self-fulfillment makes this our purpose as well:""My calling... is to be a kingdom servant of Yahweh. But the way I am to do that is ground in the self that God created."" (p.102) ""Christ's way to self-fulfillment is not like any way we could ever have imagined. His way involves losing our life so that we might find it, dying so that that we might live. His way is always the way of the cross. Death always precedes new life."" (p.104) ""Paradoxically, our fulfillment lies in the death of our own agendas of fulfillment. It also lies in the crucifixion of all our ego-centered ways of living apart from complete surrender to God."" (p.105)As I said near the beginning of this review, this book is not for the faint of heart. It is a serious and very rewarding book for those who would take to heart the instructions and experience shared by the author, Dr. David Benner. I found the book very encouraging and affirming with my personal experience. I also found new insight and understanding to some of those experiences. Additionally, I have found new ways to share the freedom of my own journey and relationship with God in ways that might be beneficial to other persons seeking an unencumbered true self relationship. The Gift of Being Yourself is truly a gift and would be a great addition to any library.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Intervarsity Press to read and post a review on my site.

"The author, a psychologist and spiritual director, states in the Preface that: ""While concepts such as self-discovery, identity and authenticity are easily dismissed as [selfish] psychobabble, each has an important role to play in the transformational journey of Christian spirituality."" And ""finding our truly authentic self in Christ and rooting our identity in this reality is dramatically different from the agenda of self-fulfillment pronounced by pop psychology.""  One's ""true self has been hidden in Christ from all eternity.""  There is lack of true authenticity in the masks that persons adopt as parts of their social selves.  Each person is of inestimable value to God.  Finding one's true self is a matter of RECEIVING it as a GIFT of ""self-in-Christ"" and this is a transformational process.Chapter 1.  Emphasizes the fact that knowing God or self in an objective way (which is merely ""knowing ABOUT"") won't lead to the desired end.  Rather, the transformational knowledge must be a relational, personal knowing.  The author illustrates a lack of real self-knowledge in the story of a very effective pastor who gave in nevertheless to addictive lust and had an affair.  Discussing the person and some discoveries in counseling, the author points out that the pastor had a habitual inability to be honest with himself about who he really was and what he really wanted in the depths of his being.  [I'm leaving out the details of interesting complexities of circumstances and emotions, and the resolutions that came about.]  Author also details how Peter the apostle is an example of a person who grows in self-knowledge.  ""Deep knowing of God and deep knowing of self always develop interactively.  The result is the authentic transformation of the self that is at the core of Christian spirituality.""Chapter 2.  This chapter ends suggesting a practical exercise that one may choose to try for 1 week  for getting to know God (through Jesus) and getting to know self.  This may be achieved through Spirit-guided Meditation daily for 15 minutes on Gospel passages about Jesus along with also the events of one's life that day.  [There's a detailed description of how to carry out the exercise.]Chapter 3.  States that to advance beyond the elementary grades in transformational spirituality it is necessary to make God's Love the basis of our identity through truly knowing and believing that God's love for us is ""absolutely unconditional, unlimited and unimaginably extravagant.""  A lifelong process.  Spiritual community is an absolute must for this.  [So that let's some of us absolutely OUT of any possibility of this kind of ""knowing"" Love or making advancement spiritually].  It's a scientific psychological truth that we must recognize and face our worst, hidden-parts of self because repressing them will only give them more power.  Self-knowing and self-acceptance is unlocked in Prayer.Chapter 4.  About the necessity of getting to know yourself as the sinner you really are.  Author discusses how repeatedly confessing our same old specific sins with resolve to avoid them and strategies for coping with guilt is very unsuccessful in getting BEHIND our sins to our CORE sin tendencies.  Tells a great story about a married minister who was unable to overcome an addiction to sex, was planning to leave ministry but had counseling by which some underlying complex needful causes behind the addiction were exposed.  Then genuine acceptance of his self, of the particular way in which his seemingly monstrous ""enemy"" of sexuality needed to be accepted and integrated into himself, within God's acceptance of him as he actually was, brought clarity and discernment.  God was waiting for him in the core of his brokenness and sin.  Author suggests finding keys to CORE sins behind the outer habitual sins by use of Enneagrams [which I think some major Christian denominations have utterly ruled out as being despicable, for reasons unknown to me--I've only read the denunciations of Enneagrams in the church newspapers...].  Discusses briefly the basic particulars of the Enneagram system of self-knowledge which seems spiritually harmless and quite useful as the author presents it.Chapter 5.  About unmasking our false self, which is built upon our ""inordinate attachment to an image of our self that we think makes us special.  Are we prepared to be something other than our image of our self?  Examining our defensiveness and our compulsions, perfectionism, sensitivities; dismantling ""cherished illusions"" by a radical encounter with truth.  The false self ""is the tragic result of trying to steal something from God....""  Basing an illusionary identity on ""what I have, what I can do and what others think of me.""  (There's a great quote from Thom. Merton on p. 81, I leave for reader to discover and relish.)  But here's a good statement by the author:  ""Every moment of every day of our life God wanders in our inner garden, seeking our companionship.  The reason God can't find us is that we are hiding in the bushes of our false self.  God's call to us is gentle and persistent:  'Where are you?  Why are you hiding?'""  Brenner gives two reflections to aid the spiritual aspirant to ""Come out of Hiding.""Chapter 6.  Finding true Self.  We find our truest and deepest self by seeking God.  An elaboration on Vocation, Vocation Grounded in Identity, Living the Truth of our Uniqueness (""God meets us in our individuality because God wants to fulfill that individuality.  God wants us to follow and serve in and through that individuality.  God doesn't seek to annihilate our uniqueness as we follow Christ."")  Discussion of Our Calling and Our Fulfillment.  Dr. Brenner suggests meditating on a certain Scripture event that he specifies, and writing out a mission statement for your life.  (He elaborates on how to go about these two assignments.)EXCERPT FROM EPILOGUE: ""The self that begins the spiritual journey is the self of our own creation, the self we thought ourselves to be.  This is the self that dies on the journey.  The self that arrives is the self that was loved into existence by Divine Love.  This is the person we were destined from eternity to become--the I that is hidden in the 'I AM.' ""As an approach to spiritual growth through concepts about Christian Identity, I thought the argument of the text was an exquisitely worded, fulsome expression about what is certainly true.  I enjoyed how well-written the book was.  Am unable right now to comment on use of suggestions/techniques.I was most intensely interested when Dr. Brenner recounted stories like the two mentioned above about the problems and discoveries that occurred with clients he counseled.  Found the unraveling of those problems very revelatory and very heartening.  Was hungry for more of that kind of thing, felt I could have learned and benefited from a great deal more of that means of gaining insight--stories and CASE HISTORIES of the specifics involved in certain significant identity/self-non-knowledge/sin problems and the explicit interconnected emotional elements in the discovery of the truth of the matters about the personal struggles.  Also I just find those kinds of stories interesting."
"""Spiritual transformation does not result from fixing our problems. It results from turning to God in the midst of them and meeting God just as we are."" (page 67)David G. Benner opens up a topic most Christian think is taboo to show us it is the one thing we truly need to embrace to become the person God is calling us to be. In order to live the uniquely created life God has for us, we must first except ourselves as God has excepted us, just as we are. In order for us to this we must look at the darkness inside of us, and see who we are and acknowledge our sins and troubles. In order for us to change something we can not crucify it on the cross as sin if we deny we do it. We must accept who we are and work with God to use it for His glory!The gospel is not a method book for sin management. It is not a guideline for avoiding sin and a way to deal with our guilt when we fail as we always do. The gospel is a way for us to understand who we truly are, who God created us to be, and move forward in who God created us to be. ""Self-acceptance always precedes genuine self-surrender and self-transformation."" (page 58)David G. Brenner helps us to look at who we truly are and accept that, and then move forward with God in being who He has uniquely created us to be!"
Meaningful and worth re-reading. I can see why this book is a bestseller... so well written.
Boring!
"This is a short book, but needs to be read slowly to digest all the points Benner makes about going on this inner journey. He talks about the contemplative life the Desert Fathers might have sought after, but puts it in modern terms. Daydreaming on a gospel story, reflecting on your day to find where God was, embracing all of who we are because God does are all salient points and exercises that lead one to accepting the gift of being yourself.The book goes against our present church culture of producing for God and reminds us that God already loves us and wants us to slow down and spend time with Him."
"On its own, discovering ourself could be quite dangerous. David Benner puts the importance of knowing one's self in proper perspective. It's not ""who I am,"" but ""who I am in Christ."" Who I am in Christ is a beloved creation of God, fraught with sinfulness but loved nevertheless. Knowing this is the starting point for allowing God, trusting God to have his will in my life. It is at the same time reassuring and humbling. It does not go against the teachings of Christ and Paul when they said we must deny ourselves, and be crucified with Christ. If I don't accept who I am in Christ, how can I possibly deny myself?"
"This was a short book that focused on the interplay between getting to know yourself and getting to know God.  I didn't get a lot out of the book, probably because it is short and because I've already been hearing and thinking a lot about the true self/false self and self-awareness issues for a while now.  The book reminded me to spend more time meditating on gospel stories and to not take myself too seriously, but it didn't expose me to anything that I hadn't already been thinking about a lot.  It may be very helpful for those who hadn't heard its message before and I hope that such people can get this book in their hands as a good introduction to such themes, but those who are already interested in the journey of self-discovery probably need a more in-depth read."
"Very insightful, solid Christian theological interpretation by a trained and practiced psychologist."
One of the greatest books I have ever read on the reality and possibility of anchoring our identity in Christ. It's fresh in my memory so I am tempted to call it one of the best books I've ever read ... but even in a more sober moment it would make the cut. Get it.
David Benner hit a home run here! Highly recommend.
I really enjoyed this book. It feels a little academic but in a good way. You can tell that David is very educated. I would recommend this book if you are looking for clarity on why we need to know ourselves to know God better.
Great
"Good, helpful book., but I found ""Opening to God"" more helpful."
"While this book is relatively thin, don't let the size deceive you! You will want to read this one several times (with a journal in hand). Written by a Christian psychologist it goes deeper than the first glance. Highly recommended especially for anyone who is struggling with their identity in Christ or more importantly, anyone who thinks they've already got that ""wired."""
Great book
good incite to see yourself as compared to how God sees you.
"A copy of this book literally fell of a library shelf a year or so ago and ever since then I've been such a fan that I've recommended it to nearly everyone I know. We are currently using the book in an adult study to rave reviews. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to go deeper, not in their knowledge ABOUT God, but in their KNOWING of God."
"Bennett's book skillfully drills through our carefully constructed ""false self"" to reveal that our TRUE self is so much easier to maintain...if we are willing to embrace it. Prepare to be reoriented with the gospel!"
Timely arrival.  Item received as advertised
I found Benner to be a man of spiritual depth who has walked with God long enough to grasp more deeply than most the level of acceptance and grace He offers.It's an easy read but full of challenging thoughts and personal exercises to deepen one's own experience of God's unchanging grace.
This has not loaded on my kindle!
"Used it for class, good read."
"An awesome, powerful and eye opening walk to discovering your identity in God through Jesus Christ and the purpose for which your were created."
I ordered this and had it delivered to a friend.  Seller processed quickly and got it to my friend within a few days.
I have not read this yet! Might be good. Have to read first and see. But the phone will not let me read until I write something! 20 word
"I gave this book only one star because this system would not let me give it zero stars.I read the book ""The Gift of Being Yourself"" by David Brenner because it was part of a reading list for a class at my church.  The book struck sour notes with me right from the beginning for its indiscriminate use of language that led me to question whether the author was writing a spiritually-themed book at all.The elements of universalism echo throughout the book.  The author relies heavily on writings by Thomas Merton and other openly promotes the teachings of Merton and is actually focused more on the results of mystical and panenthestic practices than on the Scripture.What I found most disturbing is the apparently deliberate attempts to deny the existence of objective truth.  ""Truth"" is discussed in the book as a fluid, subjective concept that has no real meaning.  The idea that a person's experience defines truth ignores the Scriptural principles that state, for example, ""Jesus said, 'I am the way, the TRUTH and the life; no man comes to the Father but by Me'"" and ""These things are written that you may KNOW....""  The book is a deliberate attack on truth.Benner also recommends the use of an enneagram to help the reader identify sin in his or her life as a method of becoming close to God, instead of urging readers to search the Scriptures to let the Holy Spirit reveal sin.  He suggests visual imagery as a way of feeling closer to Jesus - even suggesting that the reader imagine walking with Jesus and ""watching"" as Jesus engages various people in conversations.  There is no mention of how to figure out what Jesus looks like and the implication is that the reader is free to imagine Jesus in whatever way suits him or her.I think this is a highly seductive and dangerous book that actively seeks to lead people away from the truth of of the saving knowledge of Christ as revealed in God's word.  Don't get sucked in."
Excellent
Great book full of insightful deep truths of who God is and who he created us to be.
"This is a great introduction to self-discovery. Although it wasn't highly profound, it was at times enlightening and moving.I came away with a deeper appreciation for self-awareness and a fuller knowledege of my own faults and strengths."
Great book if you have any doubts about your faithEasy to read and makes so much sense!
It's a thought provoking book that helps get to the inner depths of oneself and how intrinsically linked this is to knowing Christ. It's guidance on the transformational journey is excellent
An excellent informative book highlighting the importance for us all to know who we TRULY are.
I was given a copy of this book a few years ago and found it to be a wonderful gift. David G. Benner's insights are illuminating in regard to how we relate to God. I have since bought several copies for friends and am about to purchase another right now. Definitely recommend this book!
"Suggest you buy multi-copies of This book, along with Benner's 'Surrender to love' to give away to friends. Easy to read but best read carefully and prayerfully for life-giving transforming encounter with God."
"This was a magnificent tool for anyone looking to understand themselves and their spirituality further.  It's not a text book, and David leaves you plenty of space to make his thoughts your own and apply them as you are ready."
Wow what a book - totally recommended - takes me to deeper places
This book is life transforming
"Eye-opening to the reason why we struggle even as Christians. God will only help us be ourselves, not any other version we have developed and present to the world."
A wonderful book
Fabulous book - wish I'd found it years ago!
Very good
"Bought this book after my counselor recommended it. Read this book carefully and slowly. It's a great read about how identity is discovered, and not formed. This is a great quote from the book, ""Paradoxically, as we become more and more like Christ we become more uniquely our own true self.""Every Pastor should read this book."
"Enjoyed the book very much. Sometimes we feel that we need to sacrifice our own well being and needs to help others, but the book helps you realize how you need to care and love yourself first in order to love others."
"Even though with my 5 star rating resulted in ""I love it"", that isn't exactly what I would say about this book.  God used this book to give me a whole new revelation about Himself and about me.  For most of my walk with the Lord, I've been confused about just who I am and who God meant me to be.  I knew about His goal to make me more and more like Jesus, but I really didn't understand what that looked like.  Now I know.  David Benner's insights into human struggles about identity run so deep, I've had to pray my way through most of the book, as every sentence is profound.  I'm learning to be more accepting of the way God made me, and recognizing that He made me this way for His good purpose.  I would hightly recommend this to anyone who is serious about becoming who God made them to be."
"I was recommended this book, but honestly, it's a very privileged and patriarchal view on spirituality. It does not take into consideration complex issues such mental health, gender, race, economic class, or other influences of one's spiritual journey. I think it opens up very foundational discussions around this topic, but is far too one-sided to recommend it beyond anything other than a discussion point as I don't think it's safe for anyone outside of a narrow mindset."
"This version does not include the discussion guide for each chapter, which is quite disappointing. I did not know until I purchased it and was comparing it to the physical copies that my friends have."
"I've have found this book profoundly helpful in my spiritual life and journey. I have found Benner's theology and thinking sound, clear, vulnerable and extremely helpful. This a book I will gift to family members, staff and colleagues. This is the next book you should read. This is a book you'll reread."
Really great book. He takes you through learning about the self but also how we are made in the image of God. It's a book that forces you to reflect on areas in your own life and know your identity in Jesus. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for something great to read.
"I didn't know David Banner's writings until this book and it has had such an impact, I'm already looking for more . Thank you so much."
"A short easily applicable book. In a time when the world and media are screaming at us what we need to BE in order to be accepted and considered lovable, Dr. Benner reveals how we can discover our true self by discovering who we ARE in Christ.This is a must read for any desiring to grow in their walk with Jesus."
"I work with youth, and I found this to be a great tool to help with a lesson on identity and being known by God."
"This book reminded me  of how God made me, and desires me to be me."
"A good read. The author seems absolutely authentic and his writing is easy to follow. I liked some chapters more than the others, but I think, all of them were necessary to have in this book. I absolutely recommend it. As the title says, it deals with how to find out who you are by finding yourself in a godly environment."
Love the book
Great book on how to embark on authentic self discovery
This is a great book. Exactly what I need to know to discover my true self and my God.
Loved it
A book for inspiration and self knowing.
Doesn't make any sense.
Such a great read..Simple to follow and it keeps you hooked!
Such a good book about authenticity
This is a book that I would like to read it repeatedly.
For those taking time to seek godly self discovery and life calling this book will guide you as you soak in these truths.
Amazing book and fast shipping.
Very enlightening!
Enjoyed this book. Have read it several times to reflect on its content. Would recommend to those who are looking to grow a deeper faith.
Great book!
Pour ceux qui se recherchent et qui ont besoin d'aller plus en profondeur. Court et assez facile à lire !
I dont think i read
This Bible works for me!
"English is my second language and reading is always a big challenge. This translations helps me understand better the scriptures and keep my bible study, now in English."
I love love love this version of the Bible. It's so easy to follow and study with.
I use this product for a study guide
Too heavy to carrying around
Excellent Bible and easy to find Books
"ordered the large print  edition hard cover & find even the notes are in easier to read text than others I have ordered.This is a great study Bible & I prefer it over the ESV study Bible I ordered some time ago.The paper seems better in the LAB than the ESV.It doesn't have a ribbon marker so if that's important to you the leather look one does have one(or 2) for anyone wondering the NLT  has notes in green,the NIV is the  light maroon one.Also if you like visual reviews there are plenty on Youtube ."
"I would like to first say I have found that the Life Application Study Bible is one of the best study bibles to help you understand Gods Word and the help you be able to apply it to your everyday life. But if you are looking for a high quality bible that you would want to hand this down to your family then this edition is NOT  IT. The leather covering is nice to the touch but is poorly done, exactness of the edging, gluing, gold guilding was poorly done definitely not up to the standards of other premium bibles. The biggest disapointment was in the printing quality, flaws in the pages were wrinkled and every page was stuck together on the top gold edge of the pages and I had to cut them or pull them apart by hand. The printing was smaller than I thought it would be or wished it would be. My suggestion is to wait for some other bible company to make this bible or buy one of the cheaper editions so you won't feel so bad that you feel did not get what you paid for. I am not sure if this edition is what kind of quality you can expect from a bible that is made in China or was it just one that slip through without being inspected??. Please don't be turned off of the Life Application Bible just be aware that the quality of printing and the quality of how it is put together is questionable for the dollar."
"I am very impressed with this NLT Study Bible, the quality is very good, and very important, this Study Bible provides every bit of information required for all newcomers to reading and understanding God's words, it provides in detail the answers to complex questions in an easy to understand term.  I would say that after you read and study this Bible over time you will without a doubt be very impressed !, ""Great buy folks""  God Bless"
I like the packaging and the large print format.  Makes me yearn to read the Bible more. Commentary on the verses are very practical today's life issues and makes the studying of the scriptures enjoyable. Couldn't have asked for anything less.
Everyone interested in reading the Bible should have a copy of this book. I’ve given away many copies of it.
This is a great book for anyone trying to look more into scripture and it’s true meaning
"If you could only read one book on how to study your bible, this is it.  A great beginning hermeneutics tool for the theologian. Great advice on how approach a text as well as rightly divide the Word of God."
"confused the heck out of me, more questions now than when I started."
"Thoughtful and well presented so that it is easy to understand and apply.  One of the best books I have read on how to read, interpret, and understand scripture."
"Not an easy read, but lots of good information.  I read this as a text book for a Bible class and learned a lot.  However it was a little difficult to follow at times."
"Very helpful book for understanding how to approach the Bible. In an age where people pick and choose which Bible verse speaks to them or is there favorite, Fee and Stuart calls us to look at the whole text of Scripture and not neglect what may come before or after those favorite verses that we have."
I am very appreciative of the work of Gordon Fee.  If you are enthralled by the Bible as I am there is no better person from which to learn. The book is work many times its price in value.
A good 👍 resource. Gets you thinking exegetically and hermeneutically. It's compact but meant to lead you to an exciting time of study.
Very informative about how to read the different genres in the Bible.
This book is a must read for all serious Bible students. It helps address many of the common issues in Bible interpretation and provides a simple methodology that will help you understand how to understand the intended meaning of the text and decipher your own biases.
"Great Read, recommended by my Pastor."
This was a great book! The content was great and even though it was a schoolbook it was one that I will read again and use for farther studies. The authors really provide great feedback tools to reading the Bible and understanding it.  I suggest this book to anyone that wants to dive deeper into the Bible.
"l had to return it. l ordered it for a Bible class l was taking, but l got a loaner, is a great book."
"Awesome insight to the Bible.  A must read for all those looking to get incredible value when reading in the Bible for ""All Its Worth""."
the title is totally accurate.
This has been a great companion book for reading the bible for me.  It compliments studying the bible as you are reading..

Very good.
"The Bible's depth of information needs to be understood and taken seriously.  This book is a great help and should be given with the Bible as a gift for new believers and anyone interested in the oldest, best selling Book in history."
"Fee makes this an easy to read book for how to study different parts of the bible. I used this while teaching college and high schoolers and it was easy to understand without being dumb, while still providing good insight and depth without being as dense as one of my textbooks. I will continue to recommend this to anyone that wants to learn how to study the bible better."
Excellent for establishing context and understanding of each type of biblical writing. Had Douglas Stuart as a teacher for Old Testament survey and he was great. More of the same in this book.
This is an excellent resource for all Biblical scholars ranging from the novice to the so-called expert. Its reading and study can be illuminating and enriching for those who dare to undertake that task.
"This book is filled with foundational ideas, useful tools and clear examples. The segmentation of the books of the Bible by genre is especially helpful. Highly recommended."
"Teaching me how to read and understand more about what I am reading, and how to take my time and break each scripture down"
Surprisingly interesting and now highly valued information. I recommend this book to everyone.
Bible study
"Sound, well written primer for Biblical sermon preparation. Great reference for ongoing refreshment"
Very helpful for my research paper.
"Great book a must read and library addition for anyone who will teach or preach from The Word of God. I've read it twice now, and each read is more valuable than the last."
Awesome!
Every teacher and serious student of the Bible should read this several times and apply its principles.
"Good hermeneutical concepts, but spent too much time trying to sell the version Fee helped translate."
So helpful for folks who think the Bible is an encyclopedia that dropped out of the sky.
A great starting point for understanding the books of the Bible.
"There is a lot of good information to be had here. For some it maybe too simple for others just right. For me I felt the information was good but a bit repetitive, however there is unique information in each chapter. I guess I would have loved a more condensed version without the repeating."
Great book!  I highly recommend it to all!
"A good basics on Bible understanding, Helped me much in my daily readings and studies"
"like Fee's theology and ""helps"" when reading the Word"
Fun book to read so far.  Just started reading and I look forward to all that's contained within.
"Not a Fan of this book, It's overly complicated to read and will not help the average bible reader, it also puts way too much emphasis on historical context and external readings other than the bible. Heres a pro tip just get a good commentary and use youtube or sermon audio to pull up sermons on anything that confuses you about the bible, you don't need some unnecessary  formula to understand God's word, it was written by the Holy Spirit and made for ALL to understand."
Good read so far.
"This book is informative and helpful in experiencing more from devotional time.  The author tends to use 'big' words that I felt could have been used sparely, as well as a lot of repetition."
"not light reading,but very interesting"
I don't necessarily agree with everything that is said but I appreciate the thoughtfulness of his argument.
"If teaching disciples to read the Bible for themselves is the most important task pastors, teachers, churches can perform then I believe most have failed. I grew up in a conservative Southern Baptist church context that taught the innerancy and importance of reading Scripture daily and studying it corporately, but never once had a lesson in exegesis, hermeneutics, biblical theology, etc. I was fairly well-versed in theologically-rich works by John Piper and Jonathan Edwards in college, as well as apologetics, but still didn't understand how NOT to read my Bible, and how NOT to use commentaries (among other things). One shouldn't have to go to seminary to learn these things if reading the Bible is essential to the Christian life. It really wasn't until I started listening to expositional preachers and noticing the difference of how they handled Scripture and explaining how NOT to handle Scripture that I began to ""get it."" Too often I see well-known teachers in errors of redefinition and decontextualization, which simply recreates itself as disciples make disciples.There's a reason why expositional preaching and biblical theology are at the forefront of the Nine Marks of a Healthy Church. The importance and practical application of proper exegesis and hermeneutics are what Gordon Fee and Douglas Stuart teach in this book. I'm actually disturbed by who I haven't seen seen write reviews of this book on Goodreads and Amazon. Reading this book, and others like it which they recommend, is extremely important. This is basically a how-to guide made as simple as possible, providing some basic examples to get started in each genre of writing one encounters in Scripture.The authors have since written a companion book that I hope to read (How to Read the Bible Book by Book) but I'll read D.A. Carson's Exegetical Fallacies, R.C. Sproul's Knowing Scripture, and James Sire's How to Read Slowly first. Fee is a Pentecostal who has differentiated himself from others in his denomination. He's also a fantastic NT scholar, having written well-regarded commentaries on Paul's epistles to the Corinthians. Stuart is an Old Testament and ancient languages scholar at Gordon-Conwell. The first edition of this text was put out in the 1970s and the latest revision was published in 2006. Below include my own thoughts, summaries of topics, and some of my highlights and notes edited slightly.  ""Reading the Bible with an eye only to its meaning for us can lead to a great deal of nonsense as well as to every imaginable kind of error--because it lacks controls... we believe that God's Word for us today is first of all precisely what his Word was to them. Thus we have two tasks: First, our task is to find out what the text originally meant; this is called exegesis. Second, we must learn to hear that same meaning in the variety of new or different contexts of our own day; we call this second task hermeneutics...the original meaning of the text--as much as it is in our power to discern it--is the objective point of control...And this brings us back to our insistence that proper 'hermeneutics' begins with solid 'exegesis.'""Scripture was written to be understood and interprets itself, but we have to pay attention and ask the right questions to get at the meanings. The authors walk through the different versions of literature found in Scripture and how to ask questions of the text. They disagree with each other on certain interpretations and hermeneutics, and are fairly plain about that. ""Even the two authors of this book have some disagreements as to what certain texts 'plainly' mean. Yet all of us are reading the same Bible, and we all are trying to be obedient to what the text 'plainly' means.  ""There are two basic kinds of questions one should ask of every biblical passage: those that relate to context and those that relate to content.The questions of context are also of two kinds: historical and literary...The most important contextual question you will ever ask--and it must be asked over and over of every sentence and every paragraph --is, 'What's the point?'...A text cannot mean what it never meant. Or to put it in a positive way, the true meaning of the biblical text for us is what God originally intended it to mean when it was first spoken. This is the starting point. How we work it out from that point is what this book is basically all about.""Most sections have a 10-20 point summary of the do's/do nots.They begin with a brief look at textual criticism and the difficulties of Bible translation. They endorse the NIV and (then new) HCSB while comparing various translations. They examine the translation difficulties related to various texts. (Fee is controversial in believing that 1 Corinthians 14:33-35 as we know them were not written by Paul but were a marginal comment written by a scribe that was later copied into manuscripts as though written by Paul. He argues that it clearly contradicts 11:2-16.) While many trumpet the ESV's gender-literal translations, they point out the problems with saying ""man"" or ""son"" when the author was referring to women as well, or ""pupils,"" etc. In short, approaching a text from multiple translations and understanding why they differ is important.They discuss the importance of Bible dictionaries and external sources, particularly when looking at Old Testament history. They contain an appendix on what to look for in a good commentary and list a couple for each book, classified by the level of reading. Consulting a commentary should be ""the last thing you do"" in studying a text or a book.Some weaknesses and traits of the book that have probably kept it from wider scholarship and praise in recent years:1. The authors are not Presbyterian or Southern Baptist.2. They prefer the NIV as a translation and are somewhat critical of the ESV as an overreach into the unnecessarily literal.3. The authors do not write about examining the themes that run through Scripture. They do mention analogies and caution the reader to avoid making analogies where Scripture does not. They demonstrate how Augustine over-analogized everything, much of what I marveled at in City of God (my review) was bad exegesis, and are probably eager for the reader not to turn common themes into unjustified analogies. But Wayne Grudem and others teach that finding themes is an important aspect of biblical theology.4. The book does not discuss inerrancy, even though the authors are inerrantists. Inerrancy is assumed, I suppose, and the authors do not deal with bible difficulties.5. Fee's views on 1 Corinthians (see above) and the role of women in the church put his hermeneutic outside most Reformed teachers.The authors deal with the problematic uses of the OT in the new. Christians believe that the New Testament authors were inspired by the Holy Spirit and therefore able to write analogies between the Old Testament and the life of Jesus than we are able to today. For example, Paul's interpretation of Jesus as the ""rock"" in Exodus 17:  ""To be sure, we modern readers are quite unlikely on our own to notice this analogy in the way that Paul described it. If Paul had never written these words, would we have made the identification of cloud and sea with baptism (v. 2) or the rock with Christ (v. 4)? In other words, would we, on our own, be able with any degree of certainty to determine the sensus plenior or secondary meaning? The answer is no. The Holy Spirit inspired Paul to write about this analogical connection between the Israelites in the desert and life in Christ without following the usual rules about context, intent, style, and wording...""Similarly with Matthew noting Jesus' ""fulfillment"" of various prophecies, such as being the ""son called out of Egypt.""Epistles:  ""one must always keep in mind that they were not primarily written to expound Christian theology. It is always theology applied to or directed toward a particular need.""  Were occasional from the reader's side and written for a specific or stated occasion. (Philemon, James, Romans, exceptions to epistles occassioned from reader's side).OT Narratives, their proper use:  ""In the biblical story God is the protagonist, Satan (or opposing people/powers) are the antagonists, and God’s people are the agonists. The basic “plot” of the biblical story is that the creator God has created a people for his name — in his own “image” — who as his image bearers were to be his stewards over the earth that he created for their benefit. But an enemy entered the picture who persuaded the people to bear his “image” instead, and thus to become God’s enemies. The plot resolution is the long story of 'redemption,' how God rescues his people from the enemy’s clutches, restores them back into his image, and (finally) will restore them 'in a new heaven and new earth.'”  ""As you read the various narratives, be constantly on the lookout for how the inspired narrator discloses the point of view from which you are to understand the story.""What OT narratives are:1. Not allegories or stories filled with hidden meanings. (Augustine made this error in City of God... everything was allegory.)2. Not Intended to teach moral lessons3. often illlustrations of what is taught explicitly elsewhere, like examples of what happens when people disobey the Ten Commandments.Errors in interpretation of biblical narratives:Allegorizing - relegating the text to merely reflecting another meaning beyond the text.Decontextualization - ignoring the full historical and literay contexts and the individual narrativeSelectivity - picking & choosing specific words & phrases to concentrate on instead of listening to the whole.Moralizing - looking for a moral in every story. Ignores that ""narrativges were written to show the progress of God's history of redemption.""Personalizing - applying parts of the text to you or your group in a way not applicable to everyone else.Misappropriation- Gideon's fleece, people try similar because Gideon did it.False appropriation - form of decontextualization. Suggestions or ideas that come from contemporary culture, foreign to the narrator's purpose.False combination - Pulling here and there even though elements not directly connected in the passage.Redefinition - Example: 2 Chron 7:14-15  ""so they tend to ignore the fact that God’s promise that he will “hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land” was about the only earthly land God’s people could ever claim as “theirs,” the Old Testament land of Israel. In the new covenant, God’s people have no earthly country that is “their land” — despite the tendency of some American Christians to think otherwise about the world. The country all believers now most truly belong to is a heavenly one (Heb 11:16). Perhaps the""They offer ten principles of interpretation.Acts:Holy Spirit is the leading role in the narrative.Church history was not Luke's goal per se. He wanted to explain how the Gospel got to Rome. Ignores Eastern churches, Jerusalem, Egypt, and more.Fee and Stuart give an exegetical sampling of Acts 6 and 8.  ""Not every sentence in every narrative or speech is necessarily trying to tell us something. But every sentence in every narrative or speech contributes to what God is trying to say as a whole through Acts.""  ""Unless Scripture explicitly tells us we must do something, what is only narrated or described does not function in a normative (i.e. obligatory) way — unless it can be demonstrated on other grounds that the author intended it to function in this way""Trying to look at Acts and the epistles for ""how to do church"" is problematic.Show how Baptism immersion is tricky (151-152).  ""We would probably do well to follow this lead and not confuse normalcy with normativeness in the sense that all Christians must do a given thing or else they are disobedient to God’s Word.""The Gospels:""the major hermeneutical difficulty lies with understanding 'the kingdom of God,'""Authors shaped, and arranged his materials. Mark’s gospel, for example, is especially interested in explaining the nature of Jesus’ messiahship in light of Isaiah’s Fee claims “second exodus” motif.pericopes.""Think horizontally""  ""To think horizontally means that when studying a pericope in any one gospel, it is usually helpful to be aware of the parallels in the other gospels. To be sure, this point must not be overdrawn, since none of the evangelists intended his gospel to be read in parallel with the others. Nonetheless, the fact that God has provided four gospels in the canon means that they cannot be read totally in isolation from one another.""why?  1. parallels give us an appreciation for the individual's distinctives.  2. help us be aware of different kinds of contexts.The purpose of studying the Gospels in parallel is not to fill out the story in one gospel with details from the others. Usually such a reading of the Gospels tends to harmonize all the details and thus blur the very distinctives in each gospel that the Holy Spirit inspired.The very best of these is edited by Kurt Aland, titled Synopsis of the Four Gospels (New York: United Bible Societies, 1975).""Think vertically""To think vertically means that when reading or studying a narrative or teaching in the Gospels, one should try to be aware of both historical contexts — that of Jesus and that of the evangelist.There were three principles at work in the composition of the Gospels: selectivity, arrangement, and adaptation.  ""One of the most noted of these, for example, is the cursing of the fig tree (Mark 11:12 – 14, 20 – 25; Matt 21:18 – 22). In Mark’s gospel the story is told for its symbolic theological significance. Note that between the cursing and the withering, Jesus pronounces a similar judgment on Judaism by his cleansing of the temple. However, the story of the fig tree had great meaning for the early church also because of the lesson on faith that concludes it. In Matthew’s gospel the lesson on faith is the sole interest of the story, so he relates the cursing and the withering together in order to emphasize this point. Remember, in each case this telling of the story is the work of the Holy Spirit, who inspired both evangelists.""Jesus' parables:- point of parables was to illicit an immediate RESPONSE.  - identify the audience. Disciples? crowd? Pharisees? Scribe?Some parables have no context.The authors provide interesting interpretation in several places. ""Let the dead bury their dead...,"" Jesus' refusal to settle dispute between brothers, etc. were admonishments that the kingdom of God is at hand, there are better things to concern oneself with.Old Testament Law:Six guidelines:1. OT Law is a covenant.  The covenant format had six parts to it: preamble, prologue, stipulations, witnesses, sanctions, and document clause.2. OT is not our Testament  ""unless an Old Testament law is somehow restated or reinforced in the New Testament, it is no longer directly binding on God’s people (cf. Rom 6:14 – 15).""3. Two kinds of old-covenant stipulations have clearly not been renewed in the new covenant . While a complete coverage of the categories of Old Testament law would take a book of its own, the portion of laws from the Pentateuch that no longer apply to Christians can be grouped conveniently into two categories: (1) the Israelite civil laws and (2) the Israelite ritual laws.4. Part of the OT renewed in the new covenant. “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind”5. All of the OT is still the word of God for us, even though it is not still God's command to us.6. Only that which is explicitly renewed from the Old Testament law can be considered part of the New Testament “law of Christ” (cf. Gal 6:2).There is an explanation of the apodictic laws and casuisitic laws.12 dos and don'ts:1. Do see the Old Testament law as God’s fully inspired word for you.2. Don’t see the Old Testament law as God’s direct command to you....OT Prophecy:The prophets are not inspired to make any points or announce any doctrines that are not already contained in the Pentateuchal covenant.Importance of understanding historical context.""God spoke through his prophets to people in a given time and place and under given circumstances. Therefore, a knowledge of the date, audience, and situation, when these are known, contributes substantially to your ability to comprehend an oracle.""Stuart (I presume) walks the reader through Hosea 5:8-12.Poetry and PsalmsThe authors give certain aspects of poetry to look out for.Psalms are poetry and need to be appreciated as such. A reader must be careful not to “overexegete” psalms by finding special meanings in specific words or phrases where the poet will have intended none.wisdom literature (Proverbs, Ecclesiastes):1. proverbs are not legal guarantees from God2. Proverbs must be read as a collection3. Proverbs are worded to be memorable, not theoretically accurate.4. Some proverbs need to be ""translated"" to be appreciated.Unless you think of these proverbs in terms of their true modern equivalents (i.e., carefully “translate” them into practices and institutions that exist today), their meaning may seem irrelevant or be lost to you altogether (cf. ch. 4).RevelationRevelation must have meant something to the original hearers. Is written as a form of literature (apocalypse).""John clearly intends this apocalypse to be a prophetic word to the church. His book was not to be sealed for the future. It was a word from God for their present situation...What we must be careful not to do is to spend too much time speculating as to how any of our own contemporary events may be fitted into the pictures of Revelation.""""The fall of Rome in chapter 18 seems to appear as the first chapter in the final wrap-up, and many of the pictures of “temporal” judgment are interlaced with words or ideas that also imply the final end as a part of the picture. There seems to be no way one can deny the reality of this. The question is, what do we do with it? ""These are references given throughout the text that are not included in the Appendix:Textual criticism.

I highly recommend it."
"This book reads more like an exposition as to why they feel the NIV is the best translation of the Bible rather than being an introduction to hermeneutics. Another major issue I had with the book is that the authors never put a single reference or source for their ideas. I don't have an issue with this theory but it's difficult to understand why two men, who are both professors and hold PhD's, could think that a single reference isn't necessary."
"Part useful and enlightening, part impenetrable. (I'm about halfway through it.)"
"In my opinion, every Christian should read this book. Why? Because most have never been trained how to read the Bible. Hence, this book delivers on what its title says. And by no means does this Bible-interpretation training require any special, secret knowledge or to be an “expert.” It does entail being a regular person, yet knowing some general principles and adhering to basic rules of logic. Subsequently, when a believer actually has an informed understanding of what God has actually said, it leads not only to greater obedience and blessings, but also greater usefulness in the kingdom of God. Better Bible interpretation will also help Christians help each other and intelligently engage with secular culture.The authors state that their aim in the book are twofold: first, to discern what the text originally meant (exegesis) and second, what that original meaning communicates to us here and now in our modern context (hermeneutics). As the authors demonstrate, this task is easily accessible. They subsequently walk you through the “how-tos” of exegesis and hermeneutics by helping the reader to understand different Bible genres (e.g., you read history different than poetry), teaching you how to ask the text the right questions (e.g., What is the historical and literary context?), wrestling with the challenges of interpreting Scripture, and providing a healthy amount of real biblical examples to guide you along. The result of all of this is that readers will not arrive at their own meaning (“This is what I think/feel this means …”) but rather, what God intended it to mean.In addition to all of this, this book gives you a balanced assessment of how to choose a good Bible translation (Chapter Two), as well as interpretive rules for understanding the different categories contained in the Bible (e.g., Old Testament Law and Prophets, the gospels and the epistles). Throughout the text, the authors also point you toward plenty of secondary resources for those eager to investigate one particular area more thoroughly. There is also an appendix that provides book-by-book recommendations for commentaries that you can use.Again, this is overall a fantastic resource although the authors tend to reject their own sound counsel on rare occasions. One example includes their treatment of cultural relativity in the epistles (pgs. 84-90) where the authors arrive at a modern interpretation totally opposite from what the original intent was.The final thing that I will say is that (obviously) you don’t want to read a book on how to read the Bible and not read the actual Bible! Consequently, this is a great resource to use when you (or your church) are doing a Bible reading plan or reading through the whole Bible together. The Bible’s worth is infinite, and this text will help to open your eyes to see the sweetness, the splendor and the excellence of the Word of God."
Was difficult to comprehend. I will have to come back to it in a few months when I'll possibly understand it more and have the time to read in small sections
Very helpful to me.
Such a great resource for helpng Christians think through how to understand and apply Scripture.
Had to have it for a training course I am doing.  So far so good.
Very good
5 star
A book for the serious bible student.
"Good thing in this book is its consistency in going through text and context for the main types of Books in the Bible.It is well categorised and so applicable to almost every Bible book you read.It helps to prevent mistakes in interpretation by emphasising different themes of exegesis in different books, with very clear examples from the BibleUseful for Bible teachers and pastors teaching young Christians to read the Bible thoughtfully and with the heart without making crucial mistakes in application.This book is not meant for advanced students of the Bible of course, unless they would want to teach explanatory Bible reading and how to apply what you read."
"History shows us that there has always been some disagreement among Christians as to what the Bible says on various issues (from theological to contemporary).  This book will give you the background you need to read the Bible for yourself in an intelligent way, helping you to understand what was written in a historical context, and how you can seek to understand and apply that in our current culture."
"I bought this for a course, and find it really interesting and to the point, the authors have done a marvelous job, and I appreciate their work. I recommend this highly to anyone who enjoys reading the bible, which will give you a better understanding on how to properly read and understand the bible. God bless..."
"Questo è un libro che mi ha cambiato la vita! Mi ha concesso di realizzare una comprensione più precisa e più profonda del testo biblico e, come è scritto, la conseguenza è stata: ‘conoscerete la verità a e la verità vi farà liberi’. Come credente ho potuto sperimentare una maggiore profondità nella comprensione del messaggio divino, una maggiore dipendenza dalle Scritture e una minore dipendenza dalle tradizioni ecclesiali, una nuova visione di come Dio abbia potuto parlare a uomini e donne come me, e di come questo messaggio indirizzato a loro possa parlare a me oggi. La cosa sorprendente è che tutto questo è accaduto con un testo rivolto a tutti in maniera semplice, non attraverso i testi accademici cui ero abituato nel mio studio delle Scritture. Gli autori, due dei maggiori esegeti rispettivamente dell’Antico e del Nuovo Testamento, hanno la rara capacità di scrivere testi autorevoli per il mondo accademico (che ho potuto apprezzare successivamente), ma anche testi straordinariamente chiari e comprensibili ai non addetti ai lavori. A tutti quelli interessati allo studio della Bibbia vorrei dire... provare per credere!"
"This book is very inspiring and thought-provoking! Batterson uses so many real-life stories, Bible verses and examples to prove just how powerful our God is! It has challenged the way I think about prayer and what I think about God.There were a couple small things in his theology I didn't totally agree with, but overall a very solid book and an easy read! I have recommended it to many people and have bought it for some of my family."
"I learned that I was limiting God because I didn't feel worth or qualified to asked for His help.  I found out it had nothing to do with me and all to do with God. God is omnipotent, which means by definition, there is nothing God cannot do. Yet many of us pray as if our problems are bigger than God. God is infinitely bigger than your biggest problem. His grace is infinitely bigger than my biggest sin. So draw a circle around my BIGGEST DREAM and BOLDLY PRAY for that Dream. OR Circle that Unsaved Child and BOLDLY PRAY"
"It's hard for me to admit that only a few years ago I didn't pray a whole lot at all. I always felt like I didn't  want to bother God with my petty problems. Sure, I prayed about the big things. But then I started hearing and learning more and more about the power if prayer and how God wants to be involved in every area of our lives. I started praying more and seeing more results then ever before. Still, I wanted to go deeper, to understand it more. I prayed on what to read before I found this book. It was a God send!  After only about two chapters into it, I wrote down some specific prayers and circled them. One of them that was a big financial one, was answered two weeks later!  I was shocked, but not surprised!  I know God hears them and I know He is so good!  I highly recommend this book!  As this new year is about to begin, I am more excited then ever to commit a lot more of my time now to prayer!  I have already told so many people to get the book and read it!"
"I think I would have enjoyed this book more had I not read ""What if, Grave Robber"" and other titles he has written. He uses the same analogies, stories, over and over and over again. Batterson drowns you with statistics and facts and then tries to tie them into a spiritual truth. Although I enjoyed the overall concept of this book, I wish he would circle his new books with new material."
This book is an inspiration for prayer.  The stories shared made me think/wonder how prayer can help me more. And how to have the phenomenal answers to my prayers. This book is worth reading for those who would like to know how to draw the circle and be a Circle Maker. I enjoyed this book and took a fair share of notes.
"Lo recomiendo mucho, yo lo leí en versión electrónica y me animé al comprarlo para regalarlo pues me pareció una excelente opción para reflexionar sobre los retos que enfrentamos en la vida.Definitivamente me gustó más la versión impresa que electrónica, ya que puedes hacer cómodamente revisiones de alguna sección referencias con tu biblia de manera más práctica.—-I highly recommend it, I read it in electronic version and I was encouraged to buy it as a gift because it seemed like an excellent option to reflect on the challenges we face in life.I definitely liked the printed version more than the electronic version, since you can comfortably make revisions of some section references with your bible in a more practical way."
"Our God given power is first off - only in Him and given by Him.  This book is a great reminder of that.  I had started a prayer journal months before reading this book. God lead me to circle each person, concern, need, desire and vision...  up to now -I didn't know why. Thank you for writing this book.  And now I am off to draw a second circle to that which God has already answered in His way, will and time.  Amen."
"This book is about circling your needs, wants and fears in prayer, just as advertised.  But it is so much more than that.  This author has so much to say, I think he could write forever.  And here's the best part... it's all completely interesting.  Mark has fascinating stories and he writes very well.  I found myself laughing at times, smiling a lot and constantly being amazed at how many examples are in this book to prove and illustrate the premise.  I see myself reading this a second time at some point in the future and loving it just as much the second time around.  This book is very meaty.  You will have to sharpen your incisors because there is a lot to chew on here.  If you like a lot of substance and a lot of food for thought, step up to the plate and put a fork in each hand.  This book has it all.  I am thoroughly impressed and a fan for life."
This book was given to me by a friend in January of 2021. I read it and have since given it as a gift to multiple people. The author brings to light truths about prayer and about the Lord that are not widely taught in church. It has shifted my perspective about God and about the way I pray in very positive ways! Would highly recommend this book!
"My church has done The Circle Maker Bible study twice as a group.  I decided to do it on my own using it as a deep, personal devotional. I've look forward to every time God and I sat down with this book. I was sad when I realized my missed opportunities, but encouraged that God could do great things with my simple faithfulness in prayer. This book, hand in hand with God's leading, could be a life changer. I've made a circle!"
"“Bold prayers honor God, and God honors bold prayers.”I don’t know if I can adequately review this book. The topic of prayer is incredibly confusing.Does prayer change God’s mind? Does the number of prayers have an effect? Does the intensity of the prayer have an impact? Does my view of God have change the outcome?In reading The Circle Maker by Mark Batterson, I would think the answer is “yes” to each question.One example would be the number of prayers. Example after example, Batterson shares numerous stories from his personal experiences; praying over and over again until the prayer is answered. After each example, Batterson follows it up with a question, “What if I didn’t pray that final prayer?” It’s as if God has set some predetermined arbitrary number that we have to meet before he decides to act.Batterson even shares stories from the Bible such as the march around Jericho. “What if the Israelites marched around Jericho only six times instead of seven?” I guess that is a valid question, except in that case it would be more about disobedience to God since He directly told them to march seven. It would make more sense (and fairer) if God always told us the number I needed to pray.I finished this book thinking this: obviously my doubt in God has made me a poor Christian and God has no interest in answering my prayers. I assume that is not Batterson’s intention but it’s hard to not think that way. When a prayer is not answered was it my inability to believe or was my prayer misdirected? Since there is no definite way to know, you keep praying until either your prayer is answered or you come to the conclusion that it’s not God’s will.I want to create a prayer infograph that shows cyclical prayer life. It would go something like this:Pray.Was it answered?Yes, then praise God!No, then try again.Pray again.Was it answered?Yes, then praise God!No, then it wasn’t God’s will. Change your prayer.Doesn’t that seem a bit weird and cyclical?Maybe I’m too foolish to understand. Though a Christian, perhaps my doubt is too big."
"Years ago I started to read this book..  I stopped because it was so powerful I wanted to reread it.  It literally changed our lives.  After reading part of it we ""circled"" an item in prayer and it changed the direction of our lives.  I would say it's a ""must read"" book for anyone truly seeking God's leading."
"Although not always the most captivating and difficult for someone with ADD to stay focused on....it was, by far, one of the most influential books for me to read. It really made me look, evaluate and understand what my prayer life was, is, should be and will be. I say read it...and read it now. God has a reason for you to read this...and reading it along with your Bible...even better!"
"You MUST READ THIS BOOK. Every Christian should have this revelation to take the world by prayer. Our inheritance demands the glory and blessings that prayer opens. I'm Soo excited even tho I already knew it's power. This book just opened up incredible increase of wisdom and understanding to circle your prayers. Don't hesitate, buy, read and be amazed!!"
"I really enjoyed the book and the inspiration to pray with greater expectancy.The reason it didn't get 5 stars was the overuse of the phrase, ""Pray like it depends on God, work like it depends on you."" I think there is a fear that prayer alone will lead people to complacency. The problem was that all the stories in the book really emphasized that it was ""pray like it depends on God.""There was no clear explanation of the ""work"" I was supposed to do. Obviously, if you are praying to buy a property, you must put an offer on the property and do some due diligence, but the application of our ""work"" is vague at best. This sort of phrase often leads one to the conclusion that if things don't work out, it's not clear if it was God saying no, or you just didn't work hard enough.Other than that one issue, it inspired me to want to pray bolder prayers."
"Dr. Batterson knows how to explain without digging too deep. If you follow the Circle Maker, your prayer life will definitely improve. I have taught several of Dr. Batterson's lessons, and everyone loves them."
Prayer and work together accomplishes more than we can imagine is what I perceive to be the theme of this wonderful book. The author backs this premise up with real life examples from thousands of years ago to the present: very convincing to me. I also like his life goal categories which helped me formulate mine. Highly recommended.
I chose this book to strengthen my prayer life. I now see prayer from a new and fresh perspective.I love this book.
"I truly recommend this book to anyone, not just Christians.  I am a Christian and this book has increased my faith and prayer life tremendously. I purchased this book for my church, as we read it together.  But I will be reading it over and over again.  I want this word to be remembered forever.  I also started Pastor Batterson's devotionals.  He is such an inspiration and genuine man of God."
"If a book really impresses me, I'll buy it for my daughter or my dad. I think maybe not this one. A friend of mine was over the moon about this book and recommended it to me. So, maybe it's just me and what I'm into reading right now."
Just started reading this book and loving it.
"Not as interesting of a read as ""If' by the same author.  But it does provide some help with how you pray - what to pray for and it improves your pathway to the Lord.  As a Christian, I love the message this book has provided to me and the help it has given me in my prayer life."
Wonderful read so you do not utilize redundant prayers.
My sister loves it
"This book really increased my desire to pray.  I'm a seasoned Christian but realized that after a series of several hard/discouraging years, I lost my fervor for prayer and only strived for things that seemed readily within reach.  This book helped me hope and believe in the power and miracle of prayer again as I read this author's journey in building his church and how prayer was at the crux of those experiences.  It challenged me to think beyond myself and my family when I pray. The book has really broadened by perspective and scope of prayer overall. It encouraged me so much that I decided to start  listening to his sermons online.  What's cool is he teaches the same principles in his sermons, so the core themes are reinforced.  It took me a very long time to read this book, it was a little slow at first, but I also realized that it was helpful to take time to digest it rather than read it straight through.  It has really strengthened my belief in the power of prayer.  I can genuinely say again that I am praying and hoping for great things in life!"
The author tells of the power of praying through on our prayers before God.  He talks about answered prayer to those he circled in continuous prayer. I highly recommend this book.
The passion for Prayer and connection to God with a sense of expectancy and  sense of hope to affect this world with Gods help!
I borrowed thus book and was so delighted I had to have one of my own
"The book was wonderfully written and full of Biblical references.  I would recommend it to individuals who are new in their walk with Christ and to those who need inspiration to improve their prayer life.  I would also recommend it to Church groups who desire to inspire growth in their Church and to all who are going through trials  of life so they would know that God is there for them, no matter what they have done!"
"I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. Its eye opening and inspiring to pray through the difficult seasons and to not lose faith, God will answer."
Pray with and for our kids is so important.  Gave me a lot of great ideas!
"God hears us through prayer and does answer us, but this book is not Biblical. The historical event that the author based this entire book from is not Biblical, so it makes me question what ""god"" he is suggesting we pray to."
excellent recommend for everyone to read
Mark Batterson shares humbly and passionately about his personal prayer life and how God has Specifically answered... He brings in additional examples of others who are likewise focused pointing the way to a close and life-changing walk with God--a walk that is powerful and effective in Gods kingdom. I highly recommend this book!
This book will teach you how to pray big prayers and give you a better understanding of what an amazing God we have.
"One of my favorite all-time Bible studies is ""Chase the Lion,"" by Mark Batterson, and I've been needing a prayer boost, so I knew The Circle Maker would surely answer my need -- and I was not disappointed.  Mark is obviously a man who loves and serves God and his encouragement in praying fervantly to God is such an inspiration.  I'd highly recommend this book to every Christian."
"The Circle Maker is one of Mark Batterson's better books. The principle behind the circle maker is ultimately about being persistent in prayer and holding onto the promises that God has given us.Mark uses a great way to view our prayer life and along with his great storytelling ability, makes The Circle Maker a must read for all who call themselves Christians.I'm sure the book will have it's critics as anything out of the ordinary normally does, but this book isn't about a name it and claim it theology, nor is it about copying how other have challenged God to answer their prayers. The reality is that Mark encourages us to lay hold of God and 'prayer through' until we see God answer, and God always answers!"
Good book but first 4 chapters are upside down. Thought it was a fluke but ordered one for my husband and the same thing. Still readable and the book itself is a good read. Think this is a manufacturing error
"This is a wonderful book! Mark is a masterful storyteller and weaves in many testimonies and stories, moving the book way beyond just theory and into the deeply practical. Biblically based and written beautifully. I really appreciate his heart for God and his willingness to share his experiences in putting feet to his faith, thus inspiring us to do the same. He definitely is qualified to write this book based on the numerous faith-building examples he shares! There is a DVD that accompanies the book that is very good as well, especially for group Bible study. Get the book and start circling....see what God will do when you step out in faith!"
"A friend shared their copy of The Circle Maker with me and I immediately started reading it and acting upon the inspring teaching from Mark Batterson.  This book has changed my life -- my attitude in prayer, how I focus on goals I believe God has for me, how I work in not for profit fundraising.  I've shared the concepts with several people and have bought two books as gifts.  Be sure to read this book -- powerful teaching, important truths, and a life changing call to action!"
The Circle Maker Praying Circles Around this a very good book. I recommend this book. It help my prayer life.Pauline
"Not good...if I could, I would give no stars.  The author presents compelling stories of prayer answered in the manner he wanted, but twists scripture to mean what he wants it to mean rather than what it truly means...eisogesis rather then exegesis."
I enjoyed being reminded of the power of persistence in prayer. It 're requires you to utilize your faith. Keeping my priorities in order.
This books makes you feel very uncomfortable! But not in a bad way... It made me realize just how much I've been limiting the potential of my prayers. We feel like we';re being humble before God when we ask for little but God wants us to make big requests. He loves to show off and he;'s waiting for us to give him the chance to come through. That's what I learned reading this book and I'm definitely applying it!
hit the nail on the head.  Good spiritual insight
"This book challenged my thinking and made me realize I have to dream bigger and pray harder.  It has really revolutionized how I partner with God!  I gave a copy to the pastor I work for and he also had a watershed experience.  So much so, that his wife and the ministry leaders are reading it.  Awesome!"
"I enjoyed Mark Batterson's writing style in The Circle Maker.  He provided many examples of his application of praying circles around people, places and situations.  ""Praying circles"" was a new concept for me.  I liked the book  so well that I recommended it to my small prayer group at church and we will begin reviewing and discussing it soon.  After reading the book on my Kindle, I purchased a paperback copy, too, and may purchase more for gifts for relatives and friends.  I plan to buy some of Mark's other books since he made this book so interesting."
Not finished yet but this is awesome
Awesome awesome book!! So motivational! It has changed my prayer life quite a bit and inspired me to pray for more. It has inspired me to want more. I love it and I highly recommend it!!
This book is great!
"One of the best books on prayer I have read.  Although there is repetition in this book it serves ""drive points home"".  Reading Mark Batterson is the equivalent to listening to Joel Osteen; positive and uplifting!  You can not read this book come out not praying circles around yourself and others :)"
"If you have an issue in your life that you do not know how to deal with, this book is for you! His layout of the book is impeccable, and his stories are truthful! You will get encouraged and challenged. Take a step of faith and get this book! Your life can be changed forever if you will follow what Mark is teaching. (which, by the way, is nothing more than just biblical truths)"
"Wow, I can't say enough about this book. If you are having a tough time with believing God hears your prayers, then this book is for you.If you are a dreamer and want to change the world, then this book is for you.If you lack the faith to move mountains, then this book is for you. It is encouraging, uplifting and motivating."
This book is outstanding and will awaken your prayer life.
"I am thankful , for Mr. Mark, his presentation, his interpretation for me is God breathed . I have read positive and negative reviews . I ask the Lord for wisdom , this prayer the bible states is always answered . First a circle is found in satanic worship ,but Satan is the created not the creator . He is the father of all lies , a copy cat , not one moment of his existence after the fall , is original . What Satan means for evil our Lord means for good . Enough of that !  A circle ,  a line in the sands of life , to me is not the focal point of this historical event , it is one man's faith , a pointed prayer , a humble heart , God centered life , on his knees , till all breath was gone . Absent from the body is present with the Lord . My challenge , as you prayerfully consider this book , consider this , it is not the circle , a square , a triangle or the check mark on your prayer list . It is a almighty God , who is no respected of men , least any man should boast  ,  a man on his knees does not have far to fall . So pray a large prayer , believe for the unthinkable , Jehovah jeirh ,the Lord our provider will never leave or forsake you . On our knees together , one prayer at a time , will change our lives and those we pray for !!!!!"
I have  learned better ways to pray by drawing a circle or walking in circle  as I pray. Thank you  Mark.
But this book The Circle Maker! I cannot get enough of this book that teaches us to be BOLD in our prayers and to Pray circles around miracles we want GOD to move on! A BIG GOD can do GREAT things in our lives if we have the FAITH & TRUST in HIS timing not ours!
I love the way Mark Batterson writes. This book is inspirational and an easy read. His other books are great too.
This is a good book that teaches us how to pray. However it does have some that I do not like. It talks too much about money. It does ok not show much humble but pride. The pride of life is a big temptation. Anyway it is worthy to read.
"The Circle Maker has revitalized my communication with my Savior.  The writing is simple to understand yet powerful and impactful beyond its words.  I'm greatly encouraged to read of all the awesome ways that God responds  to our prayers and how we must learn to ""pray through"" with the unwavering assurance that God is ""for us.""  It is definitely worth the investment of your time to read, ponder, and be challenged to draw the circle of prayer and keep circling until God answers."
"While based on Honi...this book has some wonderful revelations throughout it. It has really broadened my dreams and forced me (in a good way) to pen my dreams, my prayers, and track when I achieve them and when prayers are answered. Currently working on my bucket list!"
This book is one I will be revisiting often and recommend to everyone I know! It is so inspiring and I am thankful Mark wrote it.
Friends recommended and we were not disappointed.
This book came at a time when I really need it. It is an easy read and is equally insightful and encouraging. It is a call to action! My church has been called to read it corporately. I am so glad! I recommend it wholeheartedly.
This is a well written book on having the faith to pray God’s Will. I would recommend it to everyone.
Very insightful
"Good,  but a little repetitive"
Great for urpose
"I am still in the process of listening to this book, but so far I'm in awe.  This  book in a short synopsis is how to pray.  How to pray big and how to pray circles around all of life's issues.  I can't recommend this book enough."
The author seems to believe that if you just pray hard enough and pray long enough then God will answer your prayer.  I don't believe in this Santa Claus aspect of God.  Prayer is a difficult topic and I know many people believe different things but I could not agree with this books thesis.  If you want to read a good book on prayer then I recommend Phillip Yancey's book Prayer (Does it Make Any Difference).
"I got this book for a small group study I was invited to at a friend's church. The premise seemed appealing and I was hoping it would be full of useful tools for making the most of my prayer life. However, I did not find a true gospel message in this ""name it, claim it"" method that the author proposes. His focus seems to be how to pray to make certain outcomes come to fruition, instead of emphasizing prayer that brings one into a closer relationship with a God who orders our steps. For me this book doesn't have enough gospel and misses the mark."
What a realistic book that truly reminds you how powerful prayer is.
"Dr. Batterson's approach to prayer is inspirational, his guidance very beneficial.  The book significantly boosted the power of my prayer life."
The Circle Maker by Mark Batterson is a powerful book on prayer.  It has helped my personal prayer life tremendously.  I have used it with groups in my church as a study and the various groups have really benefited from the study.  I highly recommend The Circle Maker and any book by Batterson.
"Power of your prayer.I started while reading the book.Praise God, prayer is you desire.When you get it, you get it."
I was encouraged and reminded of the privilege I already have in Jesus Christ. To pray and and ask and wait for God's amazing answer.
"The truths in this book, if put into action, will result in outcomes beyond description.  A particular issue that is looming kept coming to mind.  Somehow, this book, if implemented, will turn the situation around.  God's plan WILL finally occur.  Of this, I have no doubt.  There is a lot of information here, more than can be assimilated quickly BUT life changing.  It demands action."
Ok
Good reminders and practical examples.  Easy to read and sparked my soul to reinvent my prayer habits. Pray daily and never give up
I feel alive after reading this. Awake with NEW hope in the future for generations to come. Thank you! This is the stepping stone to my new life.
"Great book if you haven't watched his enegram videos on YouTube.  I thought it would be more teaching on the subject, but so far it's basically word form of the videos.  Oh well, great book to keep handy when needed."
this book is life changing
"I wholeheartedly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning more about how to better relate to themselves, their spouse, their kids, their employees, boss, etc.This book has an uncanny way of putting words to those emotions, curiosities, and questions that we all ask: why do I behave/react/feel the way I do?Written from a biblical perspective, this book is great for Christians wanting to know themselves, God, and others better. It is also incredibly practical, so even if you don’t consider yourself a follower of Christ, there is some really great stuff to apply here.My favorite section was the “How to Love a ____” at the end of each chapter. Filled with super practical, poignant advice, I have used these tips to better love my wife, my kids, and those in my community.I highly recommend this practical, poignant book!"
This books is so well done! It teaches you how to better understand yourself and also understand the people in your life you have relationships with! I highly recommend for anyone who has a difficult relationship or struggles to understand their own motivations for what they do things!
This is a great tool to get to know and to be real with yourself and others.
"I was able to read the early digital copy and loved it!  I ordered a hard copy to be able to mark it up.  Jamie is so relatable and inspiring. She is such a giving person. The efforts she has made to pour into everyone during the launch, with her event and providing meals to those in need is off the charts. The book is not only inspiring, but a fun and entertaining read.  I devoured the book!"
"Such an easy read.  You feel as if you know Jaime as a friend and are sitting in her living room talking.  It makes you feel as if you can do anything and push through the no's.  I recommend this for everyone, not just people who want to start something major.  There are many common life lessons within this book. Believe It!"
"I bought this book and also purchased it on Audible. I find her voice so kind and uplifting that I couldn’t stop listening. She has unbelievable grit, determination and work ethic that I have rarely seen and she is such an inspiration. I started buying her makeup years ago when it was only on QVC so it was fun to truly understand the world of cosmetics and what it took for her to make it to the top. I highly recommend this book, especially if you can listen to her tell her own story through Audible. She’s such a beautiful person inside and out."
"This book is so inspiring! Jamie wears her heart on her sleeve! Love everything about it. Some of the most inspiring quotes are related to DREAMS!  ""Don't let anyone else's doubts about you or your dream turn into doubt in your head."" Rid your head of self doubt! Dream bigger everyone! No one gets to tell you how big your dreams can be! Don't let someone else's two cents bankrupt you! You were made for more! ""Knowing when to let go of a dream is as important as knowing when to follow one."" So just follow your dreams! Make your dream so big that is scares you! YOU CAN DO IT! Garb this book! You won't regret it!"
"Before you pass over this book thinking it's just another book full of motivational mumbo-jumbo, do yourself a favor and don't! Jamie Kern Lima's story is relatable, fascinating, and powerful! Her journey from struggling waitress to multi-millionaire CEO and philanthropist is a must-read! Jamie shares her story with honesty and vulnerability, imparting the lessons she learned along the way. She doesn't gloss over the difficulties she experienced or the doubts she had. She shares it all - the good, bad, and ugly.  This book is insightful, thought-provoking, and encouraging. You will come away inspired and motivated to pursue your own dreams. I loved it so much I gifted it to both my daughters."
"Tbh I’m very surprised to see the 91% 5-star reviews. Don’t get me wrong, as an entrepreneur I found a lot of stories really inspiring and I definitely learned things. Jamie seems like a really nice and genuine person but her writing style makes me not want to keep reading this book. I’m sure she has a lot of good stories to share."
"So nice I bought it twice! Both the audible and hard copy versions. This book is for every woman. If you need encouragement, if you need to be reminded of your why, if you need to feel inspired - get this book. Jamie’s words give life and so much wisdom! And all the profits of this book, 100%, are going to two none profits!! Get a book for you and one for your bff. You won't regret it!"
"I was fortunate enough to be part of the book launch team for this book through NetGalley Shelf, I also pre-ordered the Audible version.As I read/listened to Jamie narrate this book I truly felt as if I were curled up on her couch having a conversation with a long lost friend. Jamie is so genuine and caring as she speaks of her friends and tells the story of her Journey and believing in herself through all of that rejection she managed to never give up.The lessons that I learned and the inspiration that I took away I can only wish for all.For every woman in your life daughter/granddaughter/friend this book is a must read👍👍👍"
"I attended the one day virtual event that Jamie Kern Lima hosted for this book launch. There were over a dozen speakers,and it was a life changing experience.I waited anxiously for my book to arrive. I am on Chapter 6 as I write this. I have laughed,I have cried,and I have rejoiced thus far. Jamie is so real,so raw and so genuine in telling her story.I HIGHLY recommend this book for ANYONE who has ever struggled with finding their voice,their path, rejection,fear,self-doubt or confidence. Actually,I recommend this book for EVERYONE!"
"I did not know quite what to expect when I picked up this book. I had never heard of Jamir Kern Lima and I did not like the cover, but I chose to read it anyway. Never has the saying, ""never judge a book by its cover' been more applicable.This book is fantastic. I laughed. I cried. I was inspired. I was educated. I was motivated. I was challenged. I was moved.I read a lot and this book is most definitely in my TOP TEN MOST LIFE TRANSFORMING BOOKS I've ever read.I hope that you read it. I hope that you find friends to talk with about what you read here. I hope that you are able to make positive changes because of this book."
"Wow...I’m almost done with the book. And what an inspirational story. Jamie did an exceptional job telling her story and I believe it will help inspire many lives, it already has inspired mine. Get the book! You will not regret it. Thank you Jamie."
"This book, her interaction with supporters and valuable tools that come along with this experience are amazing to say the least! Get the book, get the ebook and join the book club! You won’t regret it!"
"Jamie Kern Lima’s book Believe IT is amazing!  Inspirational, authentic and needed in the world today.  Jamie is a light for all of us sharing her real stories that we can all relate to."
This is a wonderful book that I am sure will encourage everyone who reads it. Jamie shows us by her example that we all can become unstoppable too!  I highly recommend it!
Motivation!
"This book is relatable, honest, and positively motivating!"
Empowering
"This book is not just for business people. I thought it was compelling and inspiring with great personal stories from the author, and also her close friends and family. Great take away to just keep moving."
Phenomenal book by a phenomenal woman I am so inspired
"I highly recommend this book as it is so honest and inspiring in becoming the authentic you.  I've laughed, I've cried and have felt inspired.  It is a true must read and makes a great gift a friend who is in need of some inspiration."
"I seldom start a day without reading the Twenty Four Hour a Day book.  I love the history of it and am so glad to have it and other recovery books available for reading on my Kindle.  Written in the 1940's, it is as relevant today as it was then."
The dailies I read all of the time this is the best one! I decided to buy four more for my friends! This book has help me so much you wouldn’t even know! I rate this five stars !!!!!
this text includes thoughts for the day and prayers not actual meditation techniques
I love this book and highly recommend this book to anyone in recovery
I’m in a 12-Step program that reads from this book each day. I ordered it so I can have one for myself and I’m so happy I did. Reading out of this every morning starts my day off great.
i use this everyday on my kindle and it's convenient
"What I like best about Twenty Four Hours A Day is that it is written in a way I can easily relate to. It seems that this collection was written for me personally. The combination of a thought, a meditation, and a prayer every morning helps me to center my day in recovery. Peace."
"I use this book as a source for mentoring teenage felons in juvenile detention. It never fails to connect them to God in a way that they can truly relate to in peace and comfort.  The words are hopeful and penetrate the soul, a beautiful simple interpretation of God's voice calling us back to a meaningful life of love toward one another."
"I start my day reading this, helps me focus on one thing to try to remember to better myself. Liked the readings at meetings so much I ordered my own copy, so so,e days I hear it twice lol"
Exactly what I expected
Dead on! Very well done! Included in my morning readings and meditation!
Still one of the best out there.
Love the topical readings throughout the year. So many are just perfectly in step with my daily life.  Helps me stay mindful of what's important in life.
What I enjoy is the questions that I have to answer . I believe it helps to make me a little better person during the day and to see at night how well I've done during the day. Not a hard way to go.
Binding was defective with middle pages not secured with stitching and loose.
hard to find
"I go to an AA meeting every morning and 3 days a week the topic for sharing comes out of the daily readings from this book!  It is not AA conference approved, but our group took a group conscious to use it because the readings are so Higher powered to work your program!"
"Lifesaver, the first couple of years. I will usually share that "" I don't believe in god, but I do believe in prayer and meditation...DAILY"""
The book is in excellent shape and very usable.
Gave as a gift & the receiver of the gift is loving it
"This should be required by anyone with any sort of an addiction issue. It really is thought-provoking & a good way to start each day. Written by those who know what it is like in ""recovery""."
I have been reading this book every morning for 30 years plus.  I start my day right with prayer and  meditation.
I use this book daily and I simply cannot do without it! I read it often throughout the day for strength and guidance. From day 1 it has been a constant source of inspiration and help with my higher power!
Love the inspiration I get when I read this daily
Helpful for meetings.
"A very interesting book for those who are looking for spirituality and find a real life out of chemical dependency.  As Hermann Hesse says ""the only one genuine vocation for the human being is to find the way to himself"" (in Demian)."
"24hrs is spot on for helping persons especially those in AA to get a perspective on their daily lives.Each day it Gives the reader  a: ""Thought For the Day"", followed with A ""Meditation for the day"",  and a Prayer for the Day.  All in tidy two to three pages.I've been starting my day every day for 5 years with 24hrs."
I use this book every morning with a third step prayer. This book makes me look forward to being more spiritual. It truly is progress not perfection. Get it.
Product as advertised; good service from seller.
Hazelden publishes this little meditation book. I really enjoy reading everyday. It helps me get on the right attitude for the day. The Sanskirt on the front bag reminds me to stay in TODAY! Perfect!
This book has been so helpful to me when I first started in AA. Just the right size to take it with me during the first few years of sobriety.
great
"There is always something in the daily reading that is inspirational--even for someone like me who isn't very ""deep""."
"Keep coming back, it works if you work it!"
Great price & fast delivery time!
Filled with wisdom and hope
"This has been an important part of my recovery for over 30 years now and although this is not AA approved literature, I recommend it to those I work with."
great
Old daily devotional that I needed another copy of.
"Good, thank you"
I have been using this meditation book for over 25 years and I never leave home without it.  It has always been the book I put my hand on first and I find that I get the meat and potatoes of its inspiring words every time I read it.
Inspiring readings.
"anyone doing 12 step work will find this little book helpful, giving a thought for the day, a meditation, and a prayer."
A way to live life. A blueprint for carrying on living un addicted ly  Higher power is the power of life

"Great product, great delivery time!"
The book is great as i need the daily reflections as it reminds me of my AA program and gives me blessings every day and also reminds me when i am wrong. Its basic it keeps me alive and hope full.
I love the large print in this recovery meditation book
"As a Christian you are set apart from the world and receive your worth and reason to be from the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This book takes what the Bible says about the position of the believer in Christ, and systematically reveals the common lies of the world that many believers unwittingly and unnecessarily try to live in.Every Christian should read this book through very slowly in addition to regular bible study."
This book is loaded with quality information
"Great book!  A good resource to turn to and learn from when you're ready to shed  the burden of trying to please evryone, working for approval and ....as the title says, searching  for significance.  Truly opens the reader's eyes to old thought patterns and habits and is so encouraging in its teaching the reader how to be free.  Truly free! Highly rcommend it."
"Did not inspire me. I was waiting for the big reveal, but it did not come. Gave up half way through."
"This book was part of a class I took years ago. I then taught a class with this book and then have taught it again and again over the years. Each time I do I learn more about these principles that give my life a huge boost of confidence. I recommend this to every believer and even pre-Christian who wants to be free from the Blame Game, or the Performance Trap and the many other lessons this book provides that can put your life on a healthy track."
"Most of us have been brought up to believe that in order to feel worthy, valued or even a little good about who we are, we must hear the applause of others...their opinion of how well we 'perform' is vital to our self-worth.  Before long, we realize the marker has been moved...in order to receive the verbal affirmation we long for, it takes more and more performances to feel what we think we need to feel or hear what we long to hear.This book makes it chrystal clear...we're performing for the wrong crowd!  We have One who desires to 'sing over us', love us unconditionally and never condemn us.  He's always in our corner to cheer us, affirm us and lavish us with gifts.  He never lies, never withholds His love and offers everything we need to live life to it's fullest.  He doesn't yell, manipulate or raise the marker when we're not looking.So quit performing for the wrong audience...find freedom that releases us to be who we were meant to be, do what we were created to do, and find joy in the process."
"The book was okay, needed it for school."
Life changing book!
No complaints.
One of the most valuable books I’ve ever read. Truly changed the way I see myself for the better.
Excellent read.  Finding purpose in your life is the main idea
Good read for those struggling in life in a particular moment
Great for therpay
"We are using this book in my church small group. It's a great book for someone who is ""searching for significance"". Thankfully I am well aware of God's love for me, so it didn't fully apply to me, but again, it's a great book for someone who can't fathom why God would love and forgive them."
"The author - Robert McGee - provided a number of situations that proved him a savant scholar. First, he writes as one who authenticates his information. Throughout his text he describes himself as a person who was a victim of his subject matter. This provides instant realization. Viz., You cannot describe the torture chanber unless you yourself have suffered its conaequences. Second, McGee is most capable of treating his readers as if all are precious; he places you in first position and last, he is a compassionate person with a gift of helps to those with painful souls.Excellent text on healing the touchstone of our mind!Franklin A. Alvey, Ph.D.Portland, Oregon"
"I picked this up during a Kindle sale, but even if you pay full Kindle price it's a sweet deal, as it includes the workbook.  The book itself is well organized, and I particularly enjoyed the chapters in which he mined the scriptures to make his point."
Interesting and with quite a few quotes that stuck with me.
Every time I read this book it feels like it my first time
The title of this book may lead you to believe it is a self help book but it is in the form of strong theology. A great read for any follower of Christ!
"This book is for anyone who has ever felt like a fellow human has unfairly judged them.  It makes you realize that our significance is not measured by man, but what God says through his word."
Very good on selfworth and everyone should read it.
"This book is spot on in how it addresses our natural tendencies to seek significance in those around us.  However, I love how it points out the truth of where our significance should lie and gives practical application for moving forward.  We did this in my church group recently and those who truly took the time to read and study this book saw amazing growth.  There was such a change in many of our members and where they found their value.  I would recommend any church do this in a small group setting."
Next to The Bible; this book has done more to change my life than any other. I've purchased several copies over the last several years to give to family & friends. What a difference it has made in our lives!
"This is one of the best books that I own.  If I could give it more stars, I would."
Excellent study of who we truly are in Christ! I have done group study and also one on one. Everyone would benefit from reading this book.
Tried and true book that I share with others regularly and re-read from time to time.
We are studying this book in our bible study.  It helps you with your self image.  In our group I like his video.  I think that is very helpful. It's good for a church group.
Needed for School
This book is most helpful for new and seasoned pastors in counseling their congregants.  The amount of information in this modest book is too much to be absorbed at once.  It is a book that I will hold onto and refer to over and over.  Many thanks to McGee for his research and heart for those that are broken.
This is a must read for almost everyone!
Excellent source for anyone struggling with self-worth issues
This book is amazing!!!!An absolute life changer!!!!!
The ideas in this book were very helpful for me as I went through a study course at our church.
Excellent book.
Just as described. Great.
Arrived as promised and in time for Christmas - I ordered on dec 18!
Excellent book!  I had heard of it from many friends so thought I'd give it a go.  It is a well written book with great insights into one's self image.
This book is so helpful I have purchased it for several other people.  I am also recommending it to others.
"Great way to ""find yourself"" and your thought patterns, personality and character dissected with out you figuring out how to do on your own.  You will definitely find those missing personal traits you've hoped to obtain our get rid of.PERFECT BOOK!!"
"Very thought provoking and insightful... a slow read, because so much to absorb!"
Life changer if a person is willing to change how they see themselves and where they fit in this life.
This is basic for renewing your mind.  Many people have benefitted from this material saying getting this information into their hearts was life changing.
When I realize that my significance is in Christ nothing can really get me off track!  This is an awesome book!
It will change everything you think about yourself and God. His love for us is more than we can comprehend.
"Was recommended to me by my son who is a professional counselor.  Well worth the time and read.  Also, quite convenient to have on Kindle."
This book is best read with someone over a period of time.  I found it difficult to read and work through the questions on my own.
Written in great depth. Our significance in life is found in our Lord and Saviour - Jesus Christ. Our significance is lost in this world - it is not the World's standard that is important. If we approach our lives by worldly views then our significance gets lost and is only found when we know our true purpose. God loves us and He designed us for His purpose. The joy of the Lord is my strength and He will be your strength and you will grow in the Love He has for you if you will open your heart to receive His love. He already paid the price on the cross.
"As a counselor, I regularly recommend this book to my clients. McGee does an excellent job of presenting cognitive principles in a way that is easily understood so they can be applied by anyone. The author provides excellent background information on the normal struggles that many of us face in dealing with fear, shame, and rejection. He provides clear and easy to use tools for uncovering the impact of these issues in our lives and the lies that we believe because of them. His healing process is based upon Christian principles that are highly effective. This book is appropriate for a wide range of relationship and emotional challenges."
"The abridged version of the book is good, but the sound quality of the tapes leaves a little to be desired. This would be much better if they re-released it on Audio CD.Doug"
Beautifully written.
"this book has been recommended to me and i am quite thankful for it.the author communicates alot of our false beliefs and directs us into scripture about what the truth really is. this book could be of real benefit to a person who has had some mild church upbringing but never really understood GOD'S grace and truth,it can also help a person grasp God's redeeming love for them. the author uses alot of scripture and you can study right along with this book and your bible. it really does appeal to your heart."
"I think most of us search for significance, this book does explain our significance.  I got the CD to just listen and soak up the information provided."
"The book is well laid out. I enjoyed the workbook section at the end of the book. The book challenged me to look beyond the simple things to see how God's plan for me is much more than the surface. Furthermore, having a proper identity found in God's truth is essential to living a life that is pleasing to God."
"When in your 40s your life begins to fall apart around you, loss of family, career, health, etc. you don't want to find out that it has been you that has destroyed it all.  This book has opened my eyes to a cancer that I carried unknowingly, but with devastating effects.  Don't wait to get well.  This book helped when 3-4 years of vatrious counseling didn't even touch---it's a book that I consider inspired by God to help us.  On a scale of 1 to 5 it is a 37.  May God's Spirit comfort you and lift you."
I read this book because my school asked me to but I was so blessed that I read it. I recommend it to every Christian.
One of the best books I've read in my Christian walk
"This book really makes you take a second look at yourself. Parts of it are almost too in-depth for me, but I still would recommend the book. It would be a great book to study. Lots of knowledge to be gained!"
"How to serve God and have purpose and meaning in life.  Giving up the ego-thoughts of ""what do they think of me"", etc.  Wonderful transformation."
My husband and I are reading it together. I is helping us see the roots of our disagreements. It is helping us be more kind and understanding with one another.
"I have led a small group study of ""The Search for Significance"" at least five times. When its content is realized and applied, it is nothing short of powerful and life-changing for the reader."
Great book for young girls building their faith!
Great book. Was very pleased
Bought for school
This book speaks to what my teenage granddaughter is going through right now. I'm enjoying reading it and am very hopeful the Lord will use it to help her to make good choices during this scary time.
Good book
Amazing book and I’m reading it with my 15 yr old. She even likes it!
"Gift for my niece whose dad has not been consistent. Her parents a getting divorced. She was interested in reading it, which actually surprised me! It was encouraging 15 year old to recognize what’s important."
Excellent book
Just perfect!
Wish I would have had this several years ago.  So many truths!
LOVED THIS BOOK. I can believe how much God has used this book in my life.
One of the very best books available that covers a multitude of issues that young women deal with daily.
love
Excellent
Bought the book for my granddaughter
Great read with teens
Super Satisfied!
A book every women young or old should read.
Best book I've EVER read! And I'm an avid reader. Would definitely suggest it to my friends.
this is a must read for young women today and those of us who are a little older
Great work
Very powerful!  Great read for any struggling woman.
Great book
Good transaction!
excellent study.. I highly recommend it for small groups
"This is perhaps one of the most important books that any young Woman (Teenager) will ever read to keep them from a life of sorrow. The other book Nancy Leigh DeMoss wrote is ""Lies Women Believe - and the truth that sets Them Free"" is a MUST READ FOR EVERY WOMAN and the Principles are for Men Also. I read 1,200 books and both are in my top 15."
It Is a good book for young women
"I love,love,love this book!!!! I have read it twice, will read it again soon."
"I liked that this book was unique in that it focuses on many of the lies that young girls tell themselves! Great book, I read the book with a group of girls in the youth group I work for."
This is an awesome book. I wished it was available for me to read 20 years ago. I share the information in this book to my freshman in high school who's just decided to follow Christ.
Great book for young girls. Doing a bible study with it with a group of girls aged 13-15 and it generates very meaningful conversations aimed at preparing them for a bigger world ahead.
"Beware, do you, or do you want your daughter, reading sensationalized descriptions with details of how one father proceeded in  an ugly direction with his daughter. Once read, will your daughter ever be able to erase the memory. We really don't have to continue flooding the media market with a higher degree of sensationalized material on damaging behavior issues, to keep teens reading on what happens to others. This will go in the trash, as I don't even another mom to read this book that make verbal pictures too clear. We really don't need counselors telling us all."
great to use with the youth group girls
Doing this study with young christian women who are interested in discovering what lies if any they have been harbors go and living by and then to cherish the truths God has written about them. I can't wait!
Love the book...I'm 16 years old and I love it! Great for Bible studies
I bought this book for my teen daughter and she loved the insight on godly precepts for every day life. This book helps young girls make the tough choices they're faced with in today's society. I highly recommend this book.
"I am a youth leader in our church, and we are currently using this book with our teen girls. I love it, and I love the words of wisdom the girls are receiving! God truly led these women while they wrote this book! It's even got good reminders for those of us who are leading these girls."
"I thought this was a great book.  I bought it to help with low self esteem for my daughter.  Young women are faced with so many things these days that can tear down their self image, from acceptable size to how many likes you get on a picture on social media.  She doesn't like to read so I have learned to incorporate suggestions into our conversations."
"I highly recommend this book. It deals with real life issues and how to handle them. Sometimes as an adult it's easy to forget what teen girls go through and this book is a good place to start an open discussion about those issues.I would highly recommend to all young women/teens, Christian or not."
"Best book to ever read with your daughter, friend, whoever.  This really makes life different and makes you wonder why it hasn't hit the best Times seller list?"
I enjoyed reading Lies Young Women Believe. It hit home on lots of things and really encouraged me to continue fighting the good fight.
"I haven't read the entire book yet, but I've read quite a bit, and this is a great book for teen girls.  Actually, the principles of this book are very applicable to anyone, but the specific lies that the devil tempts us on is more geared to teen girls.  I am using it for a youth group girls' Bible study, and so far the girls really like it and it seems to be helping them grow in their faith."
"I purchased ""Lies Young Women Believe...and the Truth That Sets Them Free"" for my Sunday School class of junior high and senior high girls.  The girls LOVE this book.  It has answers for them for almost every problem they encounter in their school environment.  And ,believe me, it is not easy to find a book that this age group will rave over!  I am so glad I got this book from Amazon - and ,by the way, it was the lowest price I found and service was great.  Thanks."
"As the authors of this book, Nancy DeMoss and Dannah Gresh attempt to expose 25 lies that Satan uses to deceive teenage girls, and to replace those lies with God's truth.  The heart of the book consists of nine chapters which claim to represent the devil's lies to young women about God, Satan, girls, guys, relationships, faith, sin, the media, and the future.  The authors identified these lies from a survey questioning 1,000 adolescent girls located in ten different cities; the survey itself was initially developed from a discussion with a focus group of 100 girls. The final three chapters of the book discuss how God's truth can be used to overcome these lies.  I like the premise of what the authors were intending to accomplish with this book, but I have two major concerns.The first problem is that of the 25 un-Godly beliefs, I can wholeheartedly stand behind the spiritual antidote to only 14 of them, whereas the remaining 11 present problems.  For example, lie #10 is ""It's OK to go out with a non-Christian"".  An explanation follows with a quote from 2 Corinthians 6:14-18, which I am fine with, but this is followed up with the statement, ""Not only does God want you to marry a Christian; He wants you to marry a man who will lead you spiritually.""  I might agree that is ideal, but is that what God requires in His Word?  In this book, there seem to be numerous examples of ""truth"" that extends beyond what the Scripture teaches.  In lie #11, girls are told to avoid glancing at provocative marketing posters at the mall; in #12, they are instructed to ""compile a list of books and movies that don't fuel (thoughts of) romance"", and in #13, they are admonished ""not to talk about menstruation with guys"".  Conversely, there are also examples where ""truth"" seems be lacking or absent.  In combating lie #19, the sins of ""lesbianism, fornication, and masturbation"" are all grouped together in one evil lump, without any useful Biblical explanation.  Lie #20 states the belief that ""It's OK to break the law or rules if I'm not hurting myself or others"".  This begs the question, whose law and whose rules?  While I would agree that teenagers often have poor impulse control and don't always consider the true consequences of their actions, one should not forget the time Jesus and His disciples picked grains in a field to eat on the Sabbath (Mark 2:23-27).  Are 71% of teenagers wrong to say that under limited circumstances, some `rules' are meant to broken?  Similarly, lie #22, which concerns teen media usage, contains well-intentioned advice that may be helpful in many cases, but lacks Scriptural underpinning.However, I think what's worse than some of these oversights is the bold assertion that all these things that teenage girls believe equate to satanic deception.  Lie #1, ""God is not enough"", may simply express the longing that young women have for friendship and fellowship with each other, as well as with their Lord.  If human beings were meant to live without benefit of one another, wouldn't He isolate us at birth?  Similarly, is lie #9, ""I need a boyfriend"", really a satanic lie?  Can any Christian married woman honestly look back at their single days and say, ""I thank God that I never needed or wanted a boyfriend.""  There's something untruthful or dishonest about all these supposed lies, and I get the sense that some of the survey questions may have been designed to trick the young respondents so the authors could later exclaim, ""Gotcha!""  I question whether Nancy Leigh DeMoss should have written much of the material in this book.  She is a lifelong single woman who has had a chronic problem in her past with ""exaggerations"" (see lie #19).  Is she above that now?  Is she really qualified as a spiritual counselor to boy-crazy, teenage girls?I will concede there is some useful material that seems Biblically based.  I can stand behind the Scriptural rebuttal to lies 2-4, 6-8, 15-18, 21, and 23-25.  These are some positive, truthful messages here.  God really is involved in our lives, He sometimes doesn't fix our problems (they way we want Him to), and He is not much like our earthly fathers.  Satanic activities are more prevalent than you think, outwardly `beautiful' girls are not worth more to Him, and you don't have to `perform' to be loved and accepted by Him.  The authors end the book by affirming the valuable role that women have in God's kingdom as wives and mothers, and by exhorting young women to spend time reading their Bibles.  I appreciate all the work the authors and graphic designers put into this book, including the snappy graphics and mostly contemporary cultural references which would especially draw girls under 18 years old to read this work (even though the once popular MySpace social networking site is no longer ""cool"").I realize my views stand in stark disagreement with the majority of conservative Christians who love this book (including one I know personally and got into an argument with).  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend it.  At its best, it contains well-intended counsel that can be useful for a season in a young woman's life.  At its worst, the text strikes a condescending, authoritarian and unloving tone, and in places, appeared to violate God's warning in Revelation 22:18 -19 against ""adding or subtracting"" from His Word.  If you read this, do so only with a great deal of caution, and stand ready to question what parts might not be consistent with Biblical truth."
"I am going through this book with a group of 12 sixteen year olds right now, reading and discussing one chapter per week. This book is presented in a clear and very updated vernacular that engages.  And both the lies and the TRUTH that are presented are right on target. Biblically based and solid. I highly recommend it for EVERY Christian teenage girl.  And, of course, the Lord is using it in my life as well."
This book confronts the lies that have been buried deep in my heart for many years. It not only puts words to what's been in my heart but it confronts the lies with TRUTH...the kind of truth that sets your heart free.
"I loved this book, and am actually using it as a teen girls Bible study this fall.  Everything discussed in the book is pertains to young women today.  I also liked how every truth for a lie was backed up by multiple scriptures from both the Old and New Testament. Highly recommended!"
"This book is incredibly relevent to my life today. With society, media, friends, etc. I found myself believing lies that I didnt even know were lies. With the step by step process of recognizing the lies and how to live in truth my life has changed! I recommend it to any girl because each one of us is part of this world...and we need to know what the world is telling us!"
"This was a great book!  Lies Young Women Believe was very personable book and I love how Gresh and DeMoss write in a very uncondeming way.  As an 18 year old, I don't like ""self-help"" books and this definitly was not one of them!  If you are looking for a easy read with helpful advice, this is the book for you."
"This is an ideal book for mothers to work through with their teenaged girls!I recommend, as the book does, that they keep a personal journal while reading through it."
"I really like this book. It gives you the facts without scaring you or leaving you with wanting more information. Its fantastic in knowing the lies we are being brainwashed, and how we can believe the truth. 10/10."
Brilliant book for young girls.  In fact I've had to buy a couple of extras because everyone wants to borrow it.
Great!
An excellent book which addresses the issues (lies) modern young women face!
"Great book, recommend it to any girl out there. I have read it again, and again... and I am still learning more. Totally worth it. Loved the Digital version, I could carry it with me on my phone, and allowed me more time to read."
"I love this book for teens!! It explains our battle against the world the flesh and the devil. It clearly presents the Biblical truths that young women need to hear about who they are, how they are created, how valuable they are and the lies that catch them and try to destroy them. I would recommend this book to every youth group leader to share with their middle & high school youth!"
Amazing tool to help young ladies grow towards being a Godly woman.
being used in girls group at church
I bought this book for my 14 year old daughter. She loved it.
Great book
"I have struggled with the discipline of praying for some time- the way that I was taught to relate to God had grown formulaic and stale. In this practical book, Fr. James Martin helps us to reimagine what it looks like to be in relationship with a living God, a God who desires to relate to us in a variety of creative, and even ""non-religious"" ways. Prayer doesn't have to be kneeling by your bedside or reciting the ""Our Father"" endlessly. Instead, Fr. James helps teach us in practical ways to pray with creativity and playfulness. This book is like a permission slip to connect with God in ways that are truly authentic to who we are as people. Every Christian should read this book."
"This book is an outstanding guide for any person who wonders about prayer -  “How”, “Why”, “Where” and “When”?  It clearly presents how praying can be a source of hope; a time of healing; the foundation of relationship; a fountain of affirmation.  Father Martin expresses beautifully that there is “no one way” to pray.  Prayer is as diverse as the person praying.Father Martin has infused the book with humor and personal prayer experiences that leave the reader to realize his down to earth humanity.What touched me personally is how the book helps the reader come to understand that God “seeks out” the prayer!  God’s love for each person is so immense that God yearns to have a personal, individual relationship with all people!Learning to Pray has inspired me to keep on making personal prayer a lifetime priority!"
"I have known Father Martin for over fifteen years, I ‘met’ him when I was looking for an inspirational-Catholic-focused book for my Adolescent Development class. That was my graduate classes’ favorite book: Becoming Who you are. Some of the other professors liked it and read it too. Several years after I started this class, I went to the Holy Land on a Pilgrimage and read Father Martin’s book named Jesus: the Pilgrimage. It was the most influential book beside the Scriptures that I used through my trip. Father Martin has received a great gift from God for writing and for listening. One of the major points that I saw unfolding as I read the book “Learning to Pray” was his astute ability to listen to others- his listening frees others to hear his story. Father James Martin’s voice is familiar and loving. As a good Jesuit he tells us the purpose of this book: “it is meant for all faith traditions and to focus on what happens in prayer”. This book is an “invitation to both prayer and faith, because you can’t have one without the other”.Learning to Pray is a magnificently holy book for everyone on the planet. Martin knows how to assist people in transforming their lives and being with God in all that they do. He certainly is at one with Ignatian Spirituality. I am reviewing his book so that there is an emphasis on sections that were meaningful to me personally. I’d like to start with the Chapter “Walking to School” in which Martin tells about his gentle beginnings with God. Some prayers were thanksgiving and others were petitionary. When Martin wanted to be on the safety patrol, he said a great deal of Hail Mary’s, in fact the more he wanted something the more Hail Mary’s he said. Children, he tells us, pray without the notion that there is a wrong way to do so.In Chapter 4, Martin tells us that prayer is for  everyone. There are many ways that we pray without knowing it: When you spontaneously ask God for help, you pause to think about something that inspires you; you are aware that you feel compassion; you wonder about God and wonder if He approves of your actions; you wonder about the meaning of your own life; you are aware that you are grateful; you try to “center” or connect. Martin spends significant time discussing each of these variables and helps us to feel at one with God and each other in our approach to God.In Chapter 8, Martin unfolds for us what happens in rote prayer. At times, it was thought of as somewhat faulty but Martin says “rote prayers are valuable in many ways: we know them, they have distinguished history, they are timeless, they are comforting in that all know them and they can lead to meaningful prayer. When my granddaughter was learning the Our Father, she would stop and ask me the meaning of certain phrases which is another way of making rote prayer meaningful in hopes that we’d continue to grow in prayer. If I think about a person, I always stop to say a prayer for them.Some time ago around 1984, Robert Bellah wrote a book called “Habits of the Heart”, in reading this text, I felt we were living the habits of the heart of Father Martin. The Daily Examen does just that- it examines the habits of the heart. Martin tells about his work in theatre and how he offered the cast The Examen of the Day. This is a prayer that St. Ignatius left for us that helps each of us see where God is active in our daily life.” It is the most helpful prayer for people starting out in the spiritual life.” Where is God affecting and moving us? Martin states: “It is an attitude more than a method.” There are 5 basic steps: “presence, gratitude, review, sorrow, and grace.” Martin lays out a way to make sure all 5 are attended to. Martin does this with consistent and constant attention to how his day unfolds. So Martin focuses on the issue of why we pray the examen: it invites us to pause and appreciate God’s presence- it helps us to notice. He states: “The examen is an antidote. When you pray the examen at the end of your difficult day, you will be reminded of that moment of grace, remember to be thankful for your friend’s embrace, perhaps remember other times you spent with your friend, and thank God.” It also helps us to see the small moments of grace that happen during our day that give us a sign of the Holy Spirit. Martin gives us excellent examples in his own life and the experiences of others. In Chapter 10, Martin examines for us “What happens when a person prays?” Just as humans have surprising and unsurprising emotions throughout their human existence, so too in prayer. We need to ask ourselves questions such as: “What is evoking this emotion? Is the emotion related to something that is going on in my life? Is this emotion telling me something about how I perceive God? and What might the fact that this emotion came up mean for me? I believe that these questions that Martin poses help us to truly form habits of the heart that are constant and consistent. “Prayer is a conscious conversation with God” Martin, in explaining how to deal with your emotions states: “I believe that God wants to know us in our beautiful, complex, messy humanity and that emotions are part of being human.”“If you refrain from saying what is on your mind and in your heart, a closer relationship with God may become blocked.” This relationship with God is certainly manifest in our relationship with others. God desires an intimate relationship with you and so desires your honesty. Again, it is similar to the kind of issues we relate to our best friend, everything. Martin brings us to understanding ‘insight’ as he states:…insights in prayer can be as important and transformative as emotions. Insights can also answer a thorny question or figuring out the question: What is Jesus for you? Martin provides a section on mystical experiences, that is, experiences of rare intensity in which we feel an almost overwhelming connection to God. He says defining mystical is difficult as “feeling filled with God’s presence in an intense and unmistakable way or being lifted up.”Chapter 12 deals with the gift of imagination. This is a chapter that is in much more need of specificity than other chapters. Martin talks about the importance of giving ourselves in prayer. That is, being as present, aware, and attentive as possible while remaining open to wherever God might lead us and being willing to spend whatever time we allotted for our prayer. We use all the tools available to try to understand how the Gospels were written and edited, which Gospels rely on other Gospels, when each was written and what the communities they were writing to were like. Chapter 13 continues with praying with Sacred texts. Martin first gives us a definition of Lectio Divina which means holy reading or sacred reading which is an ancient prayer with a venerable tradition. It predates Ignatian spirituality. Martin states: “The main purpose of Lectio, besides union and communication with God is a thorough assimilation of sacred truth and a life lived according to this truth. The words you chew over become a part of you.In reading this book, I disciplined myself to only read a portion of it each day so that the words would sink in and become part of who I am in relation to Christ. It is a book that is carefully and thoughtfully written by a holy priest of God. First, get yourself a copy, then get your friends a copy and then have everyone in your parish or circle of friends read the book. The purpose of the book holds true: to bring us closer to Christ and His Church and to each other."
"The saying ""God is in the details"" has much wisdom in it for spiritual seekers looking to discern authentic spiritual practices.  I write this respectfully...not every priest is an expert on spirituality nor every recipient of a masters in theology an expert on prayer.This book is illustrative of two challenges we face as Catholics seeking direction on prayer and the spiritual life: both priests & popular writers with only some training in theology or the spiritualities of their religious orders write books on how to pray, and spiritual leaders in their networks endorse them.Father offers some clear waters on various topics that, unfortunately and unwittingly, are tainted with subtle and not-so-subtle factual errors. His misunderstanding of lectio divina as complex is influenced by an Ignatian bent in favor of using the imagination, something true lectio does not encourage.His promotion of Centering Prayer shows he has not studied the topic in enough detail to know its true nature. Thankfully, there are good books and articles written out there on Centering Prayer that seekers can eaily access to learn more. Fr. Martin, like so many other enthisiasts, however, gives a glowingly vague yet misleading desciption of it.Catholics have a great banquet of spiritualities to draw on in their hopes to learn how to pray. Best to look to true experts to learn the divine details.Clare McGrath-Merkle, DPhil, ABD spirituality studies, MA, MTS, Certificate in Carmelite StudiesAuthor, Berulle's Spiritual Theology of PriesthoodArticles at SimplyCatholic.com, The Regensburg Forum, New Oxford Review"
"Fr. Martin's book is an invitation to Learn or Re-learn how to pray. For the newcomer to prayer its a wonderful starting point. For those who have an established prayer routine it encourages you deepen your prayer life by speaking to God in a way you may not have before. It's witty and honest and easy to read. Fr. Martin addresses what might be discouraging you from prayer, reasons why people don't pray, and offers many different ways go about changing that. The book opens not just one door but multiple access points and helps us take a look at OURSELVES and our own habits to strengthen our two-way street relationship with God. If you're thinking about it, it's worth the read."
"Fr Martin is not kidding when he says a guide for everyone.  He addresses everyone from the most devoted to the atheist. In his usual, inclusive and compelling style Fr Martin has written an accessible guide on prayer. A fantastic read for Lent or for those curious about what prayer is and how it effects us. Fr. Martin shares charming, relatable stories from his own life which will probably feel familiar to all of us and weaves them into practical as well as mystical prayer experiences and examples."
"To someone who is neither a ""professional religious"" or a ""holy roller"",  the subject of prayer can be intimidating. This book not only shows that prayer can be as simple as breathing for the nervous beginner as well as  being further illuminating for those who already have an active prayer life.Fr. Martin has a writing style that is uncomplicated without being patronizing, knowledgable without being pedantic and encouraging without being pushy.This book is a very welcome addition to my spiritual life. Thank you, Fr.  Martin!"
"This is indeed a book for everyone.  In the same way he engaged readers in his bestseller “The Jesuit Guide to (Almost) Everything,” Fr. Jim reaches out to those who don’t pray but are drawn to prayer, to those who are just beginning to pray and to those who want to enrich their relationship with God by learning more about various prayer forms.  This is a great reference tool.  It’s full of quotes from saints and mystics and also includes a section for further exploration.  Buy it for yourself and also for that spiritual seeker in your life."
"Learning to Pray, A Guide for Everyone, is truly that.  Whether you are deep into a well developed prayer life, or are just beginning to feel an urge to connect to the 'Other', Fr. Jim Martin offers you comforting, guiding words, encouragement, and a bit of ""yeast"" that deepens your prayer experience.  My only wish is that I had this resource to give to those I walked with in their faith journeys over the last 40 years.  Written in a simple conversational style, this book will be like a good friend that you touch base with when you need to hear a comforting word, share some deep conversation, and become reacquainted with the many moments of God's presence in your life."
"This book is excellent because it really is written for everyone. Each chapter addresses another aspect of prayer, and certainly each speaks to a person differently. This book is honest and doesn't preach; instead the book is very simple and directive. Regardless of your faith, you can gain insight and wisdom from this book. Father Martin is a no-nonsense guide for spirituality, and this book is true to his ministry."
"I am a fan of James Martin SJ.  He writes well and is in touch with the real world and the struggles that we all have in developing our prayer time and style.  I found this book a treasure.  How I pray is often a matter of where I am in the current journey of my life and this book has everything I could ask for for guidance.  Thank you, Fr. Jim!"
This book is for anyone a journey of yourself  with prayers and feel blessed where you are in prayer and your journey will be enlightened
"I was great “pray-er”! I could recite everything from The Lord’s Prayer to the Memorare without really thinking! Problem was I got nothing in return. No sense of peace. No whispered answer.  No feeling of God’s presence. With Fr. Martin’s help, my prayer life is on the way to becoming richer, more consoling, and FUN! My advice: Buy The Book!"
"In twenty-one years of Catholic education, don’t remember anyone ever addressing the many mysteries involving prayer. How do you pray? Why do you pray? Does it really work? How do you know? Are there right or wrong ways? In Father Jim Martin’s new book, Learning How to Pray, he addresses these issues plus a lot more I’d never considered. He has a conversational writing style that makes even the profound,  complex issues simple to grasp. Have given this book to ten of my friends – even one of my Jewish buddies – who have raved about its style and substance. If you’re looking for a way to resurrect your prayer life, this is the book!"
What can you say. Book is subjective to the reader
I am thoroughly enjoying reading this book especially during Lent when I am working to improve my relationship with God.  He makes it sound like anyone can do this well.
"I have read several books on prayer and while they all have their place, this one is my favorite.  Mr. Martin’s candor and unfiltered experiences, gift the seeker (the reader) with insight and the vast breadth of wisdom gained throughout his journey with God.  I’m a very grateful that God had encouraged him to share this life journal with us."
Fr Martin has a wonderful easy style in this book on prayer. It is nevertheless a tour de force overview of the various forms of prayer but it makes you want to pray. There is a way to prayer that is waiting just for you. The book recommendation section at the end is valuable for further exploration.
"Fr. Martin  draws on his Roman Catholic background and experiences to invite everyone to learn to pray. While the weight of his background sometimes seems a bit too heavy, he doesn’t have a “one way to pray” mentality. He is most generous in sharing his personal experiences, and leading the reader toward thoughtful, creative ideas. While I wouldn’t expect any earth shattering changes after reading this book, letting the ideas stew may prove beneficial."
"As a Catholic who drifted away from the church, I was looking for a way to build a more personal relationship with God.  I first came across the author, Father Jim on line and was drawn to his “down to earth” personality and his way of making God seem accessible.  His book “Learning to Pray” is encouraging to anyone like me, seeking to find a more conscious connection to the Divine through prayer."
"You can always count on Fr. Jim Martin to offer a read that is both enjoyable and thought provoking. This book is no exception. Whether you have given up on prayer, have never attempted it, or have been praying for years, you can find helpful ideas to move you closer to a relationship with God through prayer. He provides lots of down to earth examples from his own life, starting with his childhood experiences up to the present time, which really help the reader to understand what he is trying to say in each chapter, and encourages one to try out different ways to connect with God.  This book works well with both reading it on one's own, as well as fueling lots of wonderful discussion in a group setting!"
"Fr. James Martin has a wonderful writing style, personal, intimate and insightful. I have a whole shelf of his books fir that reason. This one addresses every question one might have about prayer. I was struck with the discussion he includes about prayer being intentional. I highly recommend this book to deepen your prayer life and your spirituality."
"I am retired Director of Faith Formation in a parish and for 20 years coordinated the RCIA process.  I would highly recommend this book for those just beginning the RCIA journey, the team members who lead them, and the director.  It gives basic explanations and very helpful examples and insights.  It answers many of the questions that I think many of us have about prayer, including ""How do I get closer to God?"", ""What if I can't feel anything during prayer?"", and ""How do I know it's God speaking to me and not just my own desires?"".  And then it gives great descriptions and ""instructions"" on various types of prayer.  Buy it now and I think you'll find it very helpful."
Jim is a master at combing the spiritually deep and the easy to access.
"I found myself connected to Fr. James in his book Learning to Pray since I've been connecting my dance forms Colombian folk cumbia, and contemporary dance, as my daily day routine as a way of praying, trying to follow St. Ignatius when he says: ""No el mucho saber harta y satisface el anima sino el sentir y gustar de las cosas internamente"" so I enjoy dancing!, but how do I dance and pray at the same time? How do I know if I'm praying correctly? How do I know to who I am listening in my prayers? I invite you to read this book and found this answers and more, about many ways of praying. Let's learn how to pray with Fr. Jim Martin.  Also check the book club at his fcbk page it was really helpful tome, a little to fast for my reading timing but good!"
This book is for everyone. The novice will learn how to start praying and a seasoned veteran will learn different ways of praying.  It has opened my eyes on ways to pray and is bringing me closer to God.  Highly recommend the book to everyone.
"I have it on Audible. I really enjoy it in this form. Not only is it a great book for those interested in prayer, whether a beginner or a long time history of regular prayer, it gives a refreshing look at prayer and types of prayer.There are things that all people can learn. I also like that he is the reader of his own book. I enjoy listening to him. I've followed him in other formats and so you get a sense of his true connection to what he has written. It's clear that he writes to share his experience and knowledge to truly help others  ❤ 🙏"
"This is the third of Father James Martin’s books that I’ve read and, as usual, he did not disappoint. This book is for everyone, for someone who has never prayed but wants to, for someone who has prayed very little or for someone who has been praying all his/her life. This book is so readable, enjoyable, and above all, extremely helpful. Father Martin relates some of his own experiences in learning to pray, and his humor and humanity make the book all the more relatable. I highly recommend it."
"It's excellent. It is thought provoking in the best way and written so that even if you are mildly curious on how to pray, you'll be given solid guidance that can expanded at your pace.  Bottom line is the book gives you tools for greater connection to God and peace"
"Father Martin always has very good insights and is very inviting in his discussions.  He teaches in such a way that anyone can follow him.  He also is non-judgmental.  He also invites a lot of room for discussion, and interpretations.  The book is great for anyone who is being introduced to prayer, or if you want to find more ways to pray.  Plus James Martin is a great guy, very approachable and compassionate.  Get this book!  You'll be glad you did."
"An excellent book, written by a well-known American Jesuit priest."
"Okay I suppose. Really not what I was expecting, it felt more like he was trying to slip in an autobiography.Was expecting something more academic."
A brilliant book for anyone interested in prayer.
An absolutely excellent book for novice and experts in prayer. Fr. Martin’s insights and explanations of various forms of prayer will help to enrich and expand the scope of anyone who desires to plumb the depths of a relationship/friendship with God. I highly recommend this book and in fact am using it as an instrument to teach about prayer in my ministry as a parish priest.Fr. Tim Moyle p.p.Diocese of PembrokeCanada.
"Fr. James Martin has written a fantastic, readable guide on how to pray.  I encourage anyone struggling to pray, wanting to deepen their prayer life or wanting to learn how to pray for the first time to read this book.  It can change your life and deepen your faith."
Would highly recommend
Bought for grandchild as the one they had wore out after many years.
This sweet classic book is one of my favorite “go to” baby shower gifts!
Got this for my mom to read to her granddaughter and they both love it
"Omg, people - it’s an $8 book? Calm down on the construction 😂 I have never seen my 18 month old daughter be more in love with a book. We have started reading a book every night before bed, she is on a 3+ week streak of picking this book every. single. night. Wouldn’t have thought much about this book but omg my daughter LOVESSSSSS IT! I think the peek-a-boo page is her favorite :)"
Had this book as a kid and decided to gift it to my nieces. Product arrived as shown.
Very flimsy
Good book! Much smaller than I though.
This is the old version where the textures are nice and big. New versions with hard pages have only tiny patches for the kids to feel.
"I was a little taken aback that the book is cardboard. However, it's really durable. It uses a lot of tactile skills for babies-lift a cloth for peak a boo, smell perfumed flowers, stick a finger the the ring. My daughter really liked it."
Most definitely worth it. One of my favorite childhood books. Glad to pass it onto another kid.
Bought this as a gift because I have one for my baby daughter and she absolutely loves it! It was so fun to see her learn what to do on each page.
"I bought this as a gift, but it is so flimsy I decided not to gift it. Don’t waste your money on this one. It will not last very long with a young child."
"All 3 of my boys have just loved this book. I received it as a baby shower gift and have since ordered it for other moms-to-be. This is a great beginner book in which the baby can interact with the book playing peek-a-boo, feeling Daddy's face, etc. I think this book helped spawn a love of books for each of my kids. I would recommend this book for age 4 months to ??? My older kids sometimes join in the reading with their baby brother. Our one book has held up well, and I look forward to having it for my grandchildren!"
"Of course I loved the sensory part of this book. The quality of the binding was disappointing, this was very different than the book my kids had when they were young."
I grew up with Pat the Bunny and wanted this for my son for his first easter. Love this book! Cute and easy to read.
"It looks flimsy and i almost regret buying it at first. I was actually hesitant to let my 10mo old read this as it may easily be destroyed.However, he learned to pat the bunny(after reading the book twice), play peek-a-boo, say ""flowers"" at age one, book, feel daddy's scratchy face, and he loves looking at the well made little mirror and reading through judy's book.This is one of his most loved books and unfortunately, now at 19months, the most tattered and only held together by scotch tape but it survived 10mos and rough handling and excessive reading almost every.single.day (getting read at least twice on a daily basis).This book now holds so many fond memories of me and my little boy reading together (everywhere! We bring it everywhere!) that it was ridiculous i even thought of regretting this purchase when i got it.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone and everyone with kids. We'd get another one when the book finally gives."
"We raised our three kids on ""Daddy's scratchy face"" and just had to order it for the next generation."
"There is not ""patting"" on this book. It is all paper, where as normally the bunny is fluffy.  Really disappointed."
Too fragile of a book for a baby. I thought I was ordering cloth. That my mistake. Otherwise cute book. Just not feasible.
I gave this as a gift because it was one of my favorites when I was a little girl. My friends son has to read it every night!
"I bought this for a baby shower ""wishing well"" knowing that the expected baby will simply LOVE this book. Both my children loved this book and read it until it was torn and tattered. I've since bought it as a gift for expectant mothers, and they've told me how their babies adored patting the bunny and doing the many other engaging things in the book. Every page is highly interactive. With few words on a page, babies can soon read this themselves. It's a great first book for baby."
A sweet classic
Charming for my new grandson's very first Easter! Thank you!
"Before I owned this book, I never really understood its allure.  It seemed like it wasn't really brightly colored enough to hold my daughter's interest.  Boy was I wrong!  She has loved this book from the time she was about 8 months old.  She's now almost 2 and it's still one of her favorites.  She especially loves the little hole representing the mummy's ring and always wants to put her finger in my ring too.  The one problem with the book is that it's not at all sturdy...but then again, it is quite well loved."
Love it
Gift.
A classic! Need I say more?
Perfect
My students enjoyed this book
Love Pat The Bunny but not the comb binding.
A classic inaa nice package forr gifting
"Good book to read to children unable to speak or barely able to. Pointing to the pictures, getting child to pat the bunny, and reading along establishes a comfortable ritual for children. This positive experience with books and reading can then be built on with more advanced books."
This classic book has been one of our favorites over the years with all of our 5 children enjoying it as babies and toddlers. It is tactile and fun! But we got this particular version for our latest grandson and it didn't last through 3 readings before it was fallen apart!
"Pat the Bunny is a family tradition that I am happy to continue. Our first child was given one for his one-month celebration and our kids loved it while growing up. Now we have given one to our first grandson and look forward to years of reading with him and, hopefully, his many siblings! ;-) A classic!"
Cute book.  Our little granddaughter loves it and can doall of the things.  She is a year old.Every baby must have one. Always have good luckwith Amazon.
"Now there are a bunch of touch/feel books out there, so they may be more appealing.  I DO know that, when our kids were little (long ago), this was one of the few out there and it was universally loved by them and many of their friends.  That said, I opt to send what I KNOW to be a home run to kids now."
"I like this book, but the description said it would be a HARD COVER book and it is most definitely not. It has a spiral binding and the pages, cover, and back are not that sturdy."
"I am not sure why, but every baby I have shown this book to is absolutely fascinated by it.  Despite the illustrations resembling something you would have seen in the 1950s, the book has universal appeal, down the the plastic binding on the side."
"This book is legendary in our house.  My daughter loved it so much she wore it out.  So when I found I was pregnant with my son, I immediately purchased another one.  Or, I mean the Easter bunny left it for him ;)  He is just as much in love with it as she was."
"My 8.5 month old loves this book.  He anticipates every page and knows how to do all the motions and touches.  He laughs when he plays peek-a-boo with Paul and smiles after smelling the flowers.  He learned to wave from the last page.  Now whenever we say ""wave bye bye"", he waves just as he does to Paul and Judy.This is a must have, all-time classic that really survived the test of time.We love it and read it every morning."
"Fifty years ago, this was our daughter's favorite book. With a new baby in the family, we immediately decided to buy a copy for her. This was the book which introduced our daughter to the world of books, and we are certain it will do the same for our new great-niece."
"Being a book for babies, I was not expecting it to be so flimsy.  The book is bound with a cheap plastic spine and looks as if it will be torn apart within hours of gifting.  Also, the ""mirror"" is very poor quality, the baby definitely won't recognize themselves in it.  If I had seen an actual picture of this book, not just the cover, I would not have made the purchase."
"I don't know if I didn't read the product description thoroughly, I can't remember. But this book is cheaply put together.... it has plastic rings holding the pages together and then cardboard front and back. The book is fine! Super cute, I just wasn't expecting the bindings/cover to be that way."
"I bought the cheaper version so it makes sense that it's a little bit cheaper. It has a plastic binding. The activities are fun, and my son seems to be getting into it a bit more now."
"The eleven month old will sit still for this, but we don't let him have it or he would destroy it in no time. One we keep up on his shelf."
Always a favorite.  Amazon does not disappoint in quality and good price.  This purchase is a gift and I am not embarrassed I ordered it on line vs. a book store.
I bought this book for my daughter who is 15 month old. She can easily open it and turn its pages. She is so attached to it . Everyday she explores a new page and that what makes it a brilliant book for kids
"I must give a biased review.  We owned this book a generation ago, and my children loved it.  Now my granddaughter has the pleasure.  This book not only helps very young children with reading; but also, helps them with textures and shapes."
Book has very pointy and sharp corners. Not cool when this is geared toward such a young audience. I can't let my daughter hold and play with it in her own. Also the binding does suck.
"One of the all time great books for very young children, still in the crib. They love the soft bunny they can pat in the book.  Not intellectually stimulating -- but cute to see their reaction."
"Nothing has changed in 30 years! The same book and size I used for my children, now I used for my grandson.  Many books have been made smaller, I am happy it is the same size!"
"As other reviewers have mentioned, it's a great little interactive book, but I HATE that it's not a true board book.  The spiral binding is annoying, and the corners of the book are pretty pointy and sharp for little hands."
It's a nice book but the print is to small. The peek a boo sheet is tiny as well. It was a gift to my 10 month old daughter for Easter.
"I chose this as a first book for my granddaughter.  It has texture for tiny, exploring fingers.  I know that it will certainly be one of her favorites!"
Our older neice wore out the first copy because she enjoyed it so much!  We had to buy a 2nd copy for her new little sister! The 'touch and feel' is such a great asset for little children.
"15-month old loves this book. He likes all the little flaps and ""activities"" in the book. I remember I had this as a child too. I wish it were longer though because I have to read it to him about three times."
Not the original hard cover.. Very flimsy cover with cheap plastic binding. My toddler tore this up in the first 10Minutes ( if it took that long)
"This is a shortened version of Pat the Bunny.  I purchased it for my 1 year old, but due to flimsy construction, will probably not be able to give it to her until she is 3."
"I loved this book as a kid, my son loved it too BUT it is so poorly made that it can NOT withstand a toddler.  It ripped apart quickly"
I purchased this book for my 2 year old granddaughter and she absolutely loved it. The ability to feel the book as well as see the drawings and hear the words really made this special. Now if there were only a way to work in the other two senses...
Bought this for a gift as my daughters loved it.  Probably better for 2 and 3 year olds although I bought for a 1 year old.
My younger grandson loves it.  I was looking for a book that is interesting and interactive.  Great choice for a little one.
"I had this book as a young child & have fond memories reading it with my siblings. Now, it's something I enjoy reading with my daughter."
"An oldie but goodie.  My kids wore this book out, reading it until they were 4 and 5 years old.  I buy it for every expectant mom I know."
My 40 yr old bos loved this book. Actuelly wore it out. Now my grandson is loving it just asmuch. Great gift as well as having one at my house !
"I've given this book many times as a baby gift.  I remember reading it with all my children, the oldest almost 40 years old now!  Love this book."
"If your kid is small. This will be licked, torn, and bitten before anyone can pat any bunnies Cute in theory but for the assumed age target, its not very hearty."
"I remember this as a classic, but I ordered the book (and opened it up) without recalling what was on every page. It proved to be disappointing - too few pages, too flimsy, to little to touch - and a little too old-fashioned."
I read this book to my daughter when she was a baby and it was her favorite. I bought it for my grand daughter and the quality is much poorer than it was 30 years ago.
"Paper seems very cheap. Won't last long for curious little hands. Contents look good but will be better if it's a board book. Since it's only 10 bucks, I won't bother return it."
Super simple read yet it really shows you the depth of Love of Jesus for all of us right where we're at. Anybody would get a lot out of this book!
Good read. Inspirational
This author gives a different perspective to some well know people in the Bible. Really make you think differently about people.
I Love this devotional Michael. You are a gifted writer. I plan to share this with my circle of friends in the nursing home where I work.
Very good 48 day devotional
"I bought it for my special needs grandson, he has CP like the author. He was so thrilled to read from someone he could relate to."
I purchased the online devotional. Great writing
"This devotional will help you to forgive yourself and show love for others! This is a well written ""down to earth"" devotional."
"Such a funny, down to heart, but richly full of scriptural truth book. Just the right size daily readings!"
Loved this book so much bought another copy for my neighbor. The author wrote in a way that made it something to look foward to reading.
Used Nobody Left Out for an 8 week sermon series at Christiam Fellowship Church St Louis MO. Keep up the great work Michael !
Bought this for my room mate.she loves each & every book I bought her & yes I bought all her books at amazon.
This is such a quick and beautiful devotion. Will use it and recommend it for years to come
I think this book would also be a great resource as a devotional with teenagers or college students. Thanks for the book!
Uplifting devotionals! Loved it! Well written
This is going to be an amazing product.  I'm going to use it as my personal study guide.
This devotional shows new points of view and Jesus' faithfulness in loving us all.
Item is of transcendent quality. Very swift delivery. Packaging was elegant. Would buy from again. A+
I love it & it’s just as described. Easy to read & understand. Nice large print
Love it so far haven't completed the plan yet but really have enjoyed the devotional so far.
Great book...well written. Ordered one for retired minister friend.
I absolutely love this book!
"Michael does a great job creating a 40 day devotional with 8 Bible stories.  Excellent way to get in the habit of Bible devotion, while enjoying Michael’s witty commentary on the stories."
"What a wonderful devotional!  I get up very early to go to work, so each day I was blessed with an encouraging message about people in the Bible.  The lessons are a quick read and leave me feeling encouraged.  I love reading the Bible and knew the stories by heart.  However, Michael brought out many points I hadn't thought about before which was exciting and deepened my faith.  I bought several to give as gifts.  Wonderful message! Thank you!"
Absolutely awesome book !!!!! a easy read ....I bought 10 more to give to friends
It was a great read. Anyone can identify with it. Quick chapters and I love that you can read how you prefer whether a devotional or leisure.
"This book was so wonderfully honest and a beautiful reminder of how much Jesus loves us...even when we are broken and messy! (Like me!) We are never too messy to be held by our loving Lord and Savior.  Thank you, Michael...I needed that gentle and loving reminder!!"
"This book was recommended to me by my Brother-in-Law.  I am so glad he did.  When I started to read it I didn't want to put it down.  From the moment you start to read it you begin to approach situation just not at work but at home differently.  As my brother-in-law put it ""you begin to ask better questions"".  I even apply the principles to my 12 year old getting her to answer the better questions I ask when we discuss situations she is involved in.Highly recommend this book."
"QBQ made a huge difference for me! I now have a fantastic relationship with my boss, whom I have been working with for the past ten years, but that was not always the case. After my first year of employment I was frustrated and discouraged. At times, I was having passive-aggressive interactions with my boss, wanting to make sure he knew I was not happy. A family member recommended I read QBQ. I read your book and quickly realized that I had adopted quite the victim mentality. Based on the book's inspiring stories and simple effective strategy, I changed my ""Questions"" and quickly saw different results. In fact, a short time after reading, I had a real heart-to-heart conversation with my boss, and that conversation forever changed his leadership as well. He still occasionally refers to that honest, healthy conversation as a pivot point for him leaving some of his controlling tendencies behind. Once I was able to discuss things with him by asking the right questions, My leadership became healthier and more effective. This is a GREAT READ!"
Simple. Some good points but very repetitive. I felt like this was one of those services that was trying to sell you on to the next product which the author has more than one book. This felt more geared towards a younger population.
Really nothing here unless you are a completely inexperienced or incompetent manager. Save your money. Save your time. Although it takes less than an hour to read.
Make you think a different way than you were. I’ll be asking all my salesmen to read this. Great book for sales leaders.
"An excellent read. QBQ by John G. Miller will easily provide you with very useable information, which you can quickly put into work for you."
Great read of useful ideas and thoughts. Effective communication of a new approach to an old problem. How to be better
"We are believers here at Husqvarna Construction Products.  We have been a long time partner with John Miller and QBQ.  We've trained hundreds of employees over the last12 years.  It is true when said, ""The old stuff is the good stuff"".  This is a practical tool that is not anything new, that is why it works. This has become part of our foundation and culture.  It is a tool that helps us in every area of our life, at work or home."
"As a consultant,  there are few books that I reference more than QBQ.  It sets the culture of a business and changes it from one of blame and excuses to one of personal accountability.  I recommend that a company read and discuss one short chapter a week and discuss how it can be integrated into their company."
Buy 2 if you read while using a highlighter. By the time you are done nearly all of the book is covered in highlights. I've read many books on leadership and accountability and none come close to touching the QBQ way. Mr. Miller's concepts become part of your life and in no time you will identify and discover your own QBQ moments. I wish Mr. Miller had written this book 50 years ago as it is a great guide to life!
I like the matter-of-fact account that didn't attempt to sensationalize exorcism or glorify the exorcists. The subject matter is fascinating (and alarming) enough to stand on its own.
"This book, taken from diary entries with additional commentary, offers a glimpse inside the thoughts of priests, demons and the oppressed or possessed. I found this to be a helpful primer and reminder how we are all in a world we can only partly perceive."
This book was very interesting.  I learned many things even though I am a lifelong Catholic.  I would recommend this book to anyone of any faith.
I learned quite a lot about possession and helped me to understand how demons work in people.  Answers a lot of my questions.
"This is a book you won't put down. It's straightforward in its presentation, but it gives the definitive answer to the question about where do science and religion meet. Or more appropriately, where science stops and religion finishes the job. It might scare you...a lot, but it will give you another perspective into your faith."
Best book I ever read on exorcisms. Msgr. Rossetti's knowledge on the topic is encyclopedic based on the many exorcisms he has performed. His stories are amazing and his theological reflections are born of his holy life and absolute faith in Our Lord.
"Very interesting read regarding the many aspects/history of exorcism, and personal experiences of the author. Easy to read style that makes this book hard to put down once you  start it. Highly recommended!"
Demons are real spiritual beings and this book brings to light the fascinating - and important - work of Exorcists.
"Excellent Book!!  Easy to read, and very uplifting.  Confirms the doctrines of the Catholic faith; especially that of the Eucharist, and the need for the Catholic Church and her Priests!A must read for all those Catholics engaged in Spiritual Warfare."
Excellent easy read
"While i expected a more narrative approach the format is in fact as the title states - A diary. This lends itself to a fast pace with excellent commentary on the events recorded. I am almost 1/2 way through the book on the first day simply because I wanted to read ""just one more"".Very interesting, inspiring and edifying.I am going to do penance and slow down now to meditate on what i have learned."
Enjoyed the read.
"I was so hyped for this book. I’ve been saying this for years, that self-love can be tricky. We don’t want to hate ourselves, but all our feelings are NOT always valid, and we can never self-help ourselves to perfection. Self help will always leave us a little shortchanged. Allie has such a conviction and wrote it out so beautifully. For anyone who doesn’t already follow Allie Beth Stuckey - GO. NOW. She is insightful. Patient. Well-rounded in her school of thought. She is biblically sound. And her guests that she interviews are WISE! She is learning and teaching at the same time and PRAISE GOD for her. Pretty sure the one star review down there talking about “toxic individualism” was written by Robin DiAngelo herself lol."
I was only able to read the first pages before realizing buying this book was a mistake. Do not buy. The book is extremely offensive and shows little to no empathy towards real issues and problems in our world. The book claims life will be happy when you believe and have a relationship with God - that’s simply not true. Overlooks a lot of factors that go into life’s journey. Ignoring yourself is not the solution.
"I loved this book. After my child was born with a disability I suffered pretty severely from PPD. I kept trying to be “enough” for him, for my husband, and for myself. The days were honestly a blur and I heard a lot of (what I now know is prosperity gospel) advice which initially turned me away from God. I was told, “If you just pray enough God will heal him” or “He isn’t healed because you don’t have enough faith.” I never felt like I was enough because I was in such darkness. This wasn’t the life I had dreamed of or the life that I planned for my child. I spent way too many years searching for happiness within myself and trying to accept my child’s diagnosis. I totally bought into the self-love culture and obsessed over working out/ self-improvement or I just drowned my sorrows with  wine. It was a miserable and exhausting journey trying to find happiness & fulfillment within myself. Recently I heard the TRUE gospel from a friend of mine & it wasn’t until then that I realized I was in desperate need of a Savior. This book has helped me battle countless false teachings that I have heard. It has also eliminated the self-destructive mindset that I had for so long. I’m not enough and that’s ok because Christ is enough. Allie, thanks for being bold & for pointing out how how toxic this self-love culture is. You have helped me through your podcast & through recommending John MacArthur’s teachings. I have a LOT to learn but I now know that He is the only way to real joy & happiness. Thanks from the bottom of my heart!"
"I just finished reading Allie Beth Stuckey's first book, You're Not Enough, and That's Okay. What an amazing first book for a new author. You can watch her on YouTube under her name talking theology and culture; she's very smart, very articulate and very biblical.True, the book was written for girls and women, but I wanted to read it for the purpose of recommendation. Allie is wise way beond her years. She's brutally honest about her high school and college year's struggles with sex and alcohol and relationships -- all while being a Christan, but they are confessions that help the readers know she understands. One of the most fascinating things she described was the flood of love she experienced the first time she heard her newborn baby daughter cry: so THAT'S how much God loves me!"
Does a fantastic job getting to the heart of the self-love culture and presenting the gospel message.
"Put down Brene, Glennon, Gabby and Rachel‘s books and pick up Allie’s. Seriously. The self-love movement is a hamster wheel that will keep you not only stuck, but deceived. Allie’s book is much needed in this time of ego-inflating, self-centered me-ness. We aren’t enough, and it’s totally okay!"
If I could give this 0 stars I would.  Please don’t waste your time or your money on this book.  It provides nothing helpful and in fact infuriated me.  I am a Christian who fully believes our identity comes only when we know ourselves as children of God and was hopeful this book would be a great resource.  Nope.  It was a waste of time and money.
"I really wanted to like this book.  The very general premise that you are not enough- because we need God and God made us to need him, so of course we aren’t enough on our own- and that’s ok-is not where she goes with this book at all.  Another reviewer commented “ This book is needlessly divisive, poorly written, lacking in deep theological grounding, and not very insightful. There are many better books on both self care and walking with God.”. I couldn’t agree more.  As a mental health therapist, I actually found much of her writing harmful.  As a Christian, I found myself struggling to see how her negative opinions of women who have had abortions or non-wives / non-mothers or anyone in the LGBTQ population was Christ-like at all.  I will finish reading this book because I feel God led me to the small group that is studying it.  I have one Myth left to read.  Thus far, I have yet to read any of this book that doesn’t actually make me kind of angry. Bottom line- don’t be deceived by this title.  It doesn’t go where you think it will.  Quite the opposite."
"Allie is a rare voice of biblical wisdom for young Christian women who are daily bombarded with messages from secular platforms. Every husband should give this book to his wife (and read it himself). Every dad and mom should read this book with their daughters who are 16+. Every pastor who works with high school and college students should read this and have copies ready to give to young women at his church. Allie constantly puts the focus on Jesus. As she wonderfully articulates, ""The call of those who follow Jesus isn't one of self-love or self-affirmation, but self-denial."" This book guides those who are weighed down by the disappointments of the self-love culture to find peace with God through Jesus Christ's atoning work on the cross and his glorious resurrection. It also will help young women who may not yet be aware of this culture of self-love but are bound to find themselves tempted by it sooner or later. Buy it. Read it. But another copy. Give it to someone who needs it."
"An incredible book with an extremely important message! Allie easily walks us through a multitude of issues that plague women - specifically Christian women - face today. (Side note - if you are not a Christian, you most likely won’t agree with this book! Crazy! I know! But go ahead and leave that negative review ;) Lil keyboard warriors- gotta love em)Anyways - I am incredibly thankful for Allie and her truthfulness about WHO we are and WHAT we are called to be. It is much more simple than the self help gurus of the day will try to convince you. This is a great read, and will most likely lift that weight off your shoulders you didn’t even know you were carrying."
"I enjoyed this book for a number of reasons but the main one is that she is absolutely spot on in her analysis of this toxic culture. I spent years trying to love myself and I have never been more depressed. I was having panic attacks, depression, crying spells, and I could not seem to get better mentally. When I let go of this idea and turned to God a lot of those mental problems began to melt away. I still find myself struggling and it’s not easy by any means but loving and serving others for the glory of God is far more satisfying than spending your days loving only yourself and finding out how insufficient you truly are. I wish I had realized it sooner."
"A great book I think every woman should read. It is geared toward young women, but it blessed me also as a woman who is a bit older than the target audience. This will be a book I purchase as a Christmas gift to some of the young women in my life. You are not enough...and that is OKAY! This books shows how to embrace God's unchanging truths."
"I adore Allie & her perspective is refreshing, honest & needed. I listen to her weekly podcasts faithfully & follow her on Instagram. As expected, she promoted this book like crazy so I was excited to support her efforts & hear some more meat about this topic of toxic self love. I enjoyed the first chapter because it invited the reader into the most vulnerable side of her she rarely shows.  However, the rest of the chapters were just a regurgitation of her podcast episodes. Nothing new. If you haven’t listened to her then this book will be full of new advice & wisdom that you probably need to here. Also, know that target audience is women 18-35."
"This was a message I had needed to hear for a long time, especially since becoming a mother. The cultural message of 'you have to do everything and be everything to be a contemporary, fulfilled woman' is toxic and it was weighing me down. I always felt like I was spinning my wheels and falling short. Allie's biblical message is hopeful, inspiring, and freeing.  It gave me a new perspective as a woman and mother, and it gave me a renewed sense of gratefulness and subservience to God."
"LIFE. CHANGEDOh my word, I rarely leave reviews but I had to get on here and say how much this book has LITERALLY CHANGED ME. It has changed my political views, the way I view God, myself, the people around me, etc.  I realized how much of a self centered life I was living.  This book has inspired me to reach my fullest potential by realizing how joy enough I am and embracing the fact that GOD IS.  I cannot say enough good about this incredible book! Please please please purchase this book.  The toxic culture of self love needs to be discussed and needs to be re evaluated.  Let's be part of the change!"
"I’ve been a fan of Allie’s for about a year now, and I have been eagerly anticipating this book. Like many young women, including Allie herself, I used to buy into the whole “self-love” culture and the idea that loving yourself will make you happy, and I’ve seen firsthand how it fails. Allie explains that while we will never be enough, that’s okay, because God is. This book shows us how to live lives where we focus more on God than ourselves. Allie is great at speaking the truth in love and I found myself feeling encouraged by reading this book. The only thing that disappointed me about it was that it was too short :)"
"While the basic premise is something that can and should be explored and talked about, this book didn’t really help and likely may even negatively contribute to that potential conversation. The usage of fear based anecdotes seems like a youth group tactic that largely runs flat unless you were on board before reading the book. Add to that tangents that seem to be more about scoring political points than discussing the stated topic of the book. The last general issue with the book is that in critiquing aspects of the culture she presents as problematic, there doesn’t seem to be much depth to the critique only giving a glancing look at any of them essentially setting up the straw man that’s easy to take apart.Better engagement with the flaws she sees in the culture that demonstrates that she has spent time looking through the various arguments and studies that have been done would’ve helped a lot. In addition to that it would be helpful to actually cite sources (though I would put this more on the publisher than the author). It’s problematic to make claims about others logic and then not provide evidence that that is what they actually believe or show that you aren’t taking their quote out of context.A final issue I have is that despite mentioning that she benefited from it, the author never advocates for seeking counseling. There are numerous instances in her anecdotes that would provide opportunities to suggest counseling could help, the most glaring is in the case of suicidal ideation. It seems odd that in a book written by someone who benefited from counseling, who is trying to convince the reader that they aren’t enough on their own wouldn’t make sure to talk about how seeking help from others is a good idea."
"This has been a book me and sisters have been wanting to read. This was my first book in a long time that I finished. Its biblical and what I loved about this book is that it teaches you that its ok to not be ok as the title states. That where we have Jesus, the beginner and finisher of our faith to trust and to give us strength to depend on to help us fulfill these false and empty promises the world says we are to have. It just really reaffirmed that there is beauty in my brokenness and its ok, and that it becomes new and even more beautiful when united with Christ and who He says I am."
"I've listened to Allie Stuckey's podcast Relatable for a year and a half, so I was pumped for her book. At first I didn't know how much help it would be to me, considering that I'm not one to fall for the self-love message our culture promotes. I thought I might not be surprised by the message in her book, but I was wrong. I finally picked it up over New Years and couldn't put it down once I started it. Like the name of her podcast infers, Allie is so relatable in her tone. It feels like I'm getting to know her over coffee because of her down-to-earth, understanding  tone. I loved learning more about Allie through the books, since she doesn't share too, too much personal information on social media. Though I certainly felt familiar with all of Allie's views towards the prevalent lies from mommy blogger culture and instagram influencers, it was so helpful for me being able to categorize those cultural lies according to the 5 chapters of her book. Allie'a analysis reminded me of why those ""truths"" are false and that most importantly, they are hurtful because they distort the gospel. Allie's book encouraged me in my faith and renewed my confidence in the Christian, theologically conservative worldview I hold, since more importantly than anything, it reflects Christ and his gospel! Allie's quick-witted, bright, relatable, and wise exposition shows that God is at the center rather than ourselves! God is good!!"
"This is one of the best books I ever read because it was refreshingly different.I didn't agree with some of the things the author talked about, but that doesn't mean I dislike the book! I actually thought her unique perspective was fascinating. This book was overall very insightful, well written, and talked about a lot of hard issues going on in the world.I am very tired of the same old self help books that do nothing but basically give you one long feel-good quote. This book was the opposite of that. The author's tone is more authoritative than other self help authors. But I actually kind of appreciated that.Overall, if you get offended easily, it isn't the book for you. But if you appreciate unique opinions and are sick of the typical ""self-love"" statements, then you will love this book."
"Well written and well thought out! Thank you Allie Beth! Every woman needs to read this and then combat the myths the world is spouting and Christians are buying into without realizing it! Read your Bible today, and then read this!"
"This is an encouraging, uplifting read. Allie Beth Stuckey tackles topics (myths) popular in her generation with wisdom beyond her years, and a good understanding of the Bible. She shares bits from her own life to make it interesting, but also relies on Biblical wisdom to explain her points. While reading the book, I kept hearing women on TV say, ""You can't love others until you love yourself,"" which is one of the myths Allie Beth discusses.I'd recommend this book to any woman, of any age. I plan to share it with the women in my family."
"I've been a listener of Allie's Relatable podcast for a few years. When she announced she was releasing a book, I knew I had to get it! Reading this book felt like I was sitting down for tea with a dear friend. Allie's words are vulnerable and compassionate, but they never lack in truth, humility or wisdom. Her biblical perspective on the deceptive culture of self-love is so needed in today's climate. I wish I could buy a copy for every woman I know. Read this and lend it to your friends. Thank you, Allie!"
"I can totally relate with all the myths Allie describes in her book. I love the fact that all these myths show their falsehood under the light of the word of God. This is a very important topic specially nowadays when women of all ages are being constantly bombarded with self love messages that end up making us feel more empty.  The only person that can equip us to love and serve others is Jesus Christ. Thanks Allie for your book, I know it will be a blessing for many people."
"We have a deluge of self-help and ""love yourself"" books and narratives out there.  This book is counter-culture and biblical.  Allie B. Stuckey tries to alert the reader to trends and reasonings that are false and destructive.  She's lived it and believed it, and it almost took her life.  All the preoccupation with ourselves shows that we really don't have to learn to love ourselves.  We already do.  What doesn't come naturally is loving others and becoming selfless.  She doesn't advocate not taking care of ourselves, but she does speak against a preoccupation with ourselves, how that easily happens and what to do about it.  I'd recommend this book especially for 18-30 year old girls as the target audience but could certainly reach those beyond.  It's an easy read but still thoughtful."
"As a daughter, sibling, wife, mother, in-law and now grand mom I’m deeply encouraged that a young woman speaks truth to this young generation who has difficulty filtering what our culture demands —through God’s Word. As an unworthy, but surprisingly much loved daughter of the King of Kings, I know Allie speaks refreshing truth."
"I said what I said: Every Christian woman should read this book.If you want an honest and biblically sound resource for navigating the toxic culture of ""self-love"" and the deeper implications of a world whose perspectives and attempts at ""justice"" are rooted in a secular, biased, and--at the core--evil [Godless] intentions, then I personally recommend this book.  A quick read that will leave you better off than when you started.Above all, look to the Lord for all your needs and true wisdom. Search the Word and trust in the Lord."
I wish this came in a twelve-pack so I could give this book to everyone on my Instagram who is struggling with trying to acheive something they never can! This is not a self-help book that will make you feel better. This is a book that speaks God's freeing truth of not being enough because we aren't! I could not recommend this book more! Needs more than 5 stars!
"This book was an excellent counterpoint to the myth of self love and self sufficiency. I appreciated the Godly perspective offered, and it resonated with me and what God has been showing and teaching me over the past few years. The audio was well read, good pacing, and easy to understand."
NOT EVERYONE IS RELIGIOUS! Can hardly go a page without referencing some form/word/phrase/person from the Bible. Book is god-awful terrible should be in a religious section.
This book was so encouraging!  I felt like I was the only one who felt this way!  You are not enough and YOU ARE NOT ALONE!😊❤
"An absolutely captivating, refreshing message grounded in Truth. Allie inquires that if the only constant in life is shifting cultural values/societal standards, why are we aiming to appease our fickle hearts? Her arguments are laid out beautifully. Such a freeing read."
Great book. I recommend for anyone growing up or living in this digital age. Completely changed my perspective of social media and the “self love” culture. I lived for awhile thinking loving myself was the answer.... it’s not.
"My daughter smsnd I read it and loved it, is a blessing. Honest and on point. Also the hard cover is super cute!"
"This was such a refreshing, mind-opening book! It was an easy read, including captivating stories that were inspiring. It had some hard truths in it that were very good for me to mull over and pray about. I would recommend for women of all ages and life stages!"
"So encouraging!! Wishing I had this book years ago!! A sobering reminder that God’s love is enough. Bringing your pride & sin to the surface is never fun... Thankfully, Allie lovingly tells the hard truths I needed to read, like a trusted friend."
"Amazing book. When we live in a world so focused on self, Allie brings us this well thought out and scriptural based book on the truth of what God intended for us. I highly recommend reading it more than once."
Was a whole PAGE AND A HALF of transphobic banter in a book about toxic self-love necessary? To the recycling bin it goes!
"I listened to Allie read the book on auditable and have since bought 3 books to give away!! What an amazing little book filled with insight, truth, grace, and hope. I highly recommend for all but especially those with young girls in their formative years!! Oh how they need to hear truth rather than try lies and myths of this world!!!!"
"Loved the message behind this book, highly recommend!"
The best book I have ever read besides The Bible Gods Word.  She did an excellent job in giving so much truth in a world of falsehood.  Thank you Alley Beth Stuckey
Definitely recommend! The book gives so many great perspectives and outlooks. I love the challenging views and the biblical perspective!
"This is the best book I have ever read and think everyone should read it. I have recommended it to most of my friends and love how raw and real it is about the things that are biblical, but counter cultural."
Great message for a women. Enjoyed the truth Allie brings in this book.
The very best book & hopefully Allie Beth will write more soon!!
Such truth for a time like now
Easy yet thought-provoking and edifying read. Did not disappoint!!
Such truth in a time of great deception.
Such a great book for Christian women! Love the book and love Allie!!!
So much wisdom in this book!
"Allie Beth Stuckey is a rabid anti Catholic, you can see her videos on you tube.  Not sure why this is under Catholicism - Self Help.  Catholics will be more richly rewarded by reading Jen Fulwiler instead"
"I am really disappointed in this book.  I bought this at Barnes and Noble.  The front cover intrigued me because I am for sure so done with “self-love” culture.  What started off so good (2 chapters in) turned into a call-everyone-out who has ever written about self-help or faith in a hot second.If you have a universal view of God as love and God being in everyone, DONT BUY THIS.  The author takes the Bible very very very seriously and it’s not just, “God is good” it’s more like “unless you live this way, your selfish and me focused” which is so far from the truth.Also, my sister is gay. I love her and her partner always.  Yeah....don’t read this because she mentions how marriage should only be between a man and woman because it’s “God word”. Goodness gracious...this is why we are not progressing."
"Just another book espousing one person's views on motherhood, marriage, racism and social injustice (which apparently does not really exist). Save your money and skip this."
"This book is a complete disappointment. The main concept you will learn from it is that introspection will lead us to a path of perfectionism and discouragement, also that looking within is selfish and wrong. However, how do people find God? By looking within, noticing our flaws and realizing we need God! Most of the content is against the left movement and criticizes pro-choice, LGTB and socialism. I felt like it went off topic to judge current democratic trends from a self-righteous position. What I found very distasteful is that you will see quotes from other people but only to discredit them. Most of the books I have read, people use quotes that support their statement not to disagree with them and judge them for having that point of view. There were some good points, like loving others instead of waiting on self-love to do so, but I wish this was the main content of the book."
"This author proved to me how contradicting & judge mental some Christians can be. I’ve only was able to read the introduction and became disgusted as i got deeper into Myth #1. You can’t do anything without God (which is true) but because I grew up in church, I’ve learned early that judging others is a sin and also that no sin is greater then the other so to read a book written by a Christian judging women that get abortions and transgender is repulsing. I would rate this book 0 stars if i could."
"She takes self care out of context. I am not a religious person, but I read biblical Christian based books from time to time because they have great value and insight. Binge drinking and hook ups because of a break is not what self care promotes. Being enough means that you don't have to earn yourself worth."
"Self care is not at all what the author is making it out to be. Christians need to stop combatting everything they deem mainstream and understand that both self love AND trust in God can exist together. Self love is about doing what you NEED. And for christians, that can mean turning to God and praying on it. That does not mean self love is toxic."
"This book is completely toxic.  religion should not be INSTEAD of self-love.  For many people it is in ADDITION to.  Self-love is not about being perfect or thinking that you are, but at its core it's about accepting yourself for who you are and not degrading or belittling yourself.  There is room enough to love yourself and god and unfortunately this author is spewing hate.  Which isn't very Christian...  Do yourself a favor and ignore this book and choose the path of self love."
"I'll admit, I'm biased. I'm a regular listener of Relatable, and say ""Allie Beth Stuckey says..."" way more than I should. That said, I generally dislike all things self-help...even Christian self help. This book is the exception.Allie Beth gives us a glimpse into her story, and how she has intersected self-help culture throughout her young life. She highlights the lack of what the field has to offer, and even the harm it causes to both Christians and secular communities alike. She leaves no stone unturned, even criticizing self-help tendencies that have infiltrated Christian circles (enneagram, essential oils, decluttering, etc.) She supports her opinions with facts, and leaves room for nuance (no, you're not a terrible person because you want to be attracted to your significant other). While Allie is a conservative a political commentator, she mostly focuses on the gospel throughout. This is no surprise, as she has consistently stayed faithful to what is of first importance throughout her career. If you're secular, you probably won't like this book. Still, if you're willing to open your mind and hear a concise summary of the Christian viewpoint, give it a read. You may find yourself agreeing with points made on the inadequacies of ""self help"" psychology. We can likely all agree that we need more than empty platitudes to become our ""best selves.""Overall, Allie gives a voice to the millennial minority who is growing stronger in faith and principle day by day. I'm proud to support her and will continue to do so."
"I have read excerpts from this book although admittedly not the entire thing (I don't want to give money to this person, and believe that my skimming from a peer's copy is enough to get the gist). I also watched an interview with this young woman about the book. I simply cannot believe this type of messaging is being spread in groups of young people, and it honestly scares me.I grew up in an environment that espoused the type of beliefs that this young woman holds, and I cannot begin to tell you how damaging it was to me. And I'm not crazy or alone. There are millions like me, who did this ""I'm a piece of crap, only God can make me feel good, I'm not worthy of anything"" baloney and really internalized it and have issues to this day with feeling like we're worth something - to friends, to a lover, to ourselves. Self care is not ""trendy."" Having a reasonable self-esteem is not ""trendy."" Feeling like you're ""not enough"" is not normal or something to be celebrated. Feeling like you're ""not enough"" leads to toxic and damaging relationships of all kinds, mental health issues, self harm, etc.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK FOR YOUR DAUGHTER OR FRIEND. This messaging is directly in conflict with psychological well-being, the authors and promoters don't care, and you are encouraging mental health issues by spreading this garbage. If this young woman found that God was her way out of an eating disorder, GREAT. If anyone feels they need to cling to any god or religion to ""hang in there"" through a rough time, GREAT. But the answer to that ""rough time"" isn't that ""rough times are normal and you should feel like crap because you are a terrible sinner."" Practice self care, seek out mental health care, and feel good about yourself, because you DESERVE it. You are not a ""worthless sinner who needs God."" You are a human being who deserves compassion and feelings of self-worth, because you ARE worthy."
"The title was promising, but the author failed to deliver. I feel like she could have done so much more with the title she used. She made some big, bold statements, but never once properly argued them through. Instead, she sprinkled a bit of her story here then added dashes of other people’s stories there to maybe meet the word count rather than to support her thesis.I heard her talking about her book and was convinced that she really had something to say, but my excitement was short-lived when I discovered that her writing skills didn’t match her public-speaking skills. She is a great talker, but a poor writer. Perhaps another non-text-based outlet would have been better suited for her to bring her ideas and arguments to life. I feel like anything else would have been better than publishing a book because what I read was nothing more than a draft–full of ramblings split into chapters to make it seem like a book–in desperate need of a proper edit and a proper rewrite."
"A book absolutely every girl/woman should read! Well written and relatable! Truly ground breaking, from a wonderful author... it has been a few months since I finished it but I will be reading again for sure. Has a unique insight, and makes points that you would not read elsewhere. I can definitely say that this book enhanced my vision of life. Contains lessons that I will carry with me for a lifetime."
"Every Christian woman needs to read this book! Throw out the girl wash your face garbage 🗑 and BUY THIS BOOK!!4 stars instead of 5 for calling Bonhoeffer a martyr when he wasnt, Bonhoeffer was killed for being part of a large group of “higher ups” who were trying to assonate Hitler, not for being a christian, Bonhoeffer's theology was actually fairly liberal."
"In a society that is leading women down a destructive path, Allie brings a gospel centred message of self-denial. Allie is honest, informative and current. She tackles all the issues of today which are presenting themselves as solutions but are clearly just compounding the problems for women. This is a must read for women who want to know how to be set free from the selfish ambitions the world demands of us and fall straight into the arms of a powerful redeemer - Christ Jesus!"
I haven’t read the book yet but they presentation and the quality of material is great. I did watch a few of Allie’s video on YouTube and it made me want to discover more about the book.I am not enough and that’s ok. I hope that this books shows me ways to let God fill me completely.
"In a time when the world is calling good evil and evil good, Allie’s book is a smack in the face in the very best way! She drops so many amazing truth bombs! Every woman young and old should read this and share it. We need to push the reset button on our thinking and realize the world has been lying to us. The best news in the world is that we aren’t enough and indeed that’s OKAY!"
I encourage women to read this book! Allie did a great job identifying the lies we are constantly told!! So worth reading and discussing with your friends!
I love this book! I agree with the author so much on the points she makes in her book. This book is also teaching me quite a bit on different views and even politics. I think it is biblically sound too.
So relevant to today and the issues facing our culture. Filled with truth and scripture to back it up. Highly recommend for everyone who never feels quite good enough or needs to find some inner peace!
I’ve been listening to Allie for awhile and was eager to read her book. Didn’t disappoint! I want everyone of my friends to read it also and will definitely be recommending it. Christ truly is enough - grateful for His grace!
The book is great! Really refreshing considered we are always bombarded with “self-love” ideologies.Would highly recommend. Book is an easy read which is a huge plus for this mama who doesn’t have a whole lot of time!
WORTH THE PRICE!!! 😍 HARD BOUND! GOOD PRESENTATION OF THE BOOK!!!! READABLE TEXT💯
Everyone needs this book. Real talk!
Awesome perspective. Refreshing read.Worth it!
Loved loved loved this book. Recommend that every woman should read this!
This focuses more on content you are in the midst of than other commentaries that go off on major tangents and and in depth opposition of interpretation.
Wonderful. Very informative; covers all different views and perspectives.
Exceeded my expectations.
"This is a great resource when studying the Bible.  It is laid out verse by verse so as you use this along with reading your Bible, it is a supplement to understanding the background and time and culture."
I love the way this book breaks down the Bible so that one can understand the historic meaning of what's going on in the text. Great to use as you read The Bible.
Best commentary bible on the market!
This commentary is everything!
"Absolutely one of the best Bible commentaries in existence.  All the different authors that contributed allow for an environment of diversity of thought, but with the clarity of editing from Dr. Vanlaningham and Dr. Rydelnik."
"great book with a detailed understanding of each book, chapter and verse of the bible. no more excuses about ""I can't understand the bible so I don't read it."""
This is a great addition to my library.  I use it everyday.  Opens up the Word and brings clarity.  Packing was good.  Didn't have to wait long to get it.
"Excellent read, very interesting!"
good
Helps one to understand the bible
"If you need further explanation about something you read in the Bible, you should get this book. I think it's great!"
Generally agree with!
Excellent
a great book
Great reference!!!
The commentary is great!  Easy to read and find your way around---tons of information to help my study of the scriptures.
A great one volume commentary.  I trust the authors.
A must have during indepth bible study.
"Very helpful, complete, easy  to understand answers to all verses that I've checked on so far."
The commentary is excellent.  It is a good companion when reading the bible and needing clarity on scripture.
This commentary answers all the questions you might have.  It gives clear explanations for hard to understand passages. A must have!
Great book!
The commentary is insightful.
wonderful tool to use for deeper understanding of Gods Word.
Very helpful and for the most part understandable
very good!
An amazing work!  So grateful to all of the authors and contributors.
A great source when studying God's word. A source you can you can trust. Nice to have digital copy so you don't have to carry that huge book around!
"Very easy to read and understand.  A great addition to any Bible Study.  Once one starts reading the commintary, you are drawn in to study and learn more."
"This commentary is very insightful for Bible study, especially for the introductions to each book in the Bible. Although the first one came damaged, it was replaced promptly and the return process was easy. I definitely recommend this book as a primary commentary on your bookshelf."
I like it and find myself reaching out for it when I want to know what does the verse or the passage mean. Good job
Has been an insightful commentary that covers the whole Bible and is offered affordably.
A very big help in Bible study. I would recomend it to any one looking for help to understand the Word of God and aply it to life.
It's a good commentary--not too wordy or too lofty for the average Bible studying person.
Very helpful with the teaching of my Sunday School class. Thank you so much.
the kindle version is good for simple and quick reference! search function is good and easy to access and no need to bring a big heavy book with you in a bible study group!
Very good.

Cute book.  bought as a baby shower gift
This book had a dark permanent marker note to whomever it was given. It covered a third of the inside cover. I new it was used “good” but never expected that kind of damage for the price.
"Very cute. I purchased this for a baptism in which the parents are not active in the church, but their extended family is. This was a very nice, calming book without being too ""churchy."""
Great gift for a baptism.
Darling book - ordered it for a baby shower - new parents loved it!
"I bought this for my great granddaughter for Christmas, such a precious book, she wants it read over and over. A perfect gift for little ones"
The contents are boring and not good to teach your children - who is giving your baby a piece of cookie before bed time? There are animals that are hard to recognize who they are. Not educational. I should have returned it.
Combined this board book with a stuffed giraffe as part of a christening gift for a baby boy-arrived in perfect condition.
Love this book. Good quality. Colorful pages.
This is my son's favorite book. He loves it so much that the binder is falling apart. I bought the kindle version so he will have a copy that can't be destroyed. It is a great bedtime read.
Good little bedtime book for older sister to read to the two little ones.
Great book for bedtime. I bought Aurora Loppy Giraffe and put them together as a shower gift.
My 2 1/2 year old granddaughter loves this book. The use of repetition makes it easy for her to “read” it to me. It has become one of her favorite bedtime stories.
Absolutely adorable! Wonderful book super cute story and adorable pictures. Love it! Gave it as a gift at a baby shower and the new Momma loved it!
This has become one of our favorite bed time stories. It is fun to read and the pictures are heart warning. I highly recommend it for a gift.
This book is my favorite gift to give expectant mothers.  So sweet.  I pair it with a Baby Swaddle Blanket with Quote.  I always get asked about it during the baby shower.  Love it!  Have bought before.  Will definitely buy again.
I give this book a five star rating because it covers everything that I think is important for a book of its genre. The pictures are adorable. The colors set the perfect tone for a cozy story to send your little one drifting off to sleep.  The words are pleasant and rhyme beautifully. This is a perfect story to read to your little one before they go to sleep. I highly recommend.
Sweet gift
This will teach our kids to know there's a good God out there who loves us all.
"Very sweet book. I have a three month old I bought this book to read to. His theme is giraffes and we are Christians so I thought the book was a great combo. My two older kiddos, 7 and 9, love reading this to the baby. Its very sweet and a good night time book to read before bed."
"Very cute little bedtime rhymes, different animals on each page, my granddaughter enjoys it, even when it’s not bed time"
My granddaughter reads it every night and loves it
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
        
    










  
  
    
   Sweet book but came printed backwards and upside down 😞"
Wonderful quality book.  I love the cushioned cover.  Beautiful illustrations.  Purchased two of these to go with the Prayer Bears as gifts.Don't hesitate to purchase.
"Such a great night time book. I've read this to my daughter every night since she was a newborn. I love all the animals and was pleasantly surprised to see my favorite animal on the last page, red panda ;) I bought his book for a friend who just had her baby in December, highly recommend!!!"
I will buy more of these as I need baby gifts. It’s an outstanding book
Such a cute book. Not overly religious. Got it as a gift for my Godson’s gift set.
Good baby gift...note the title....there's a slight religious theme....consider your audience.
Beautiful little bedtime book for my 2 yr. old grandson !
"This makes a great story book right before bed. Very cute, nice pictures. Makes a great gift for little ones."
Bought for a baby shower gift. Love the rhyming of the story.
Cute book
This is a very nice book.
We love this book. My son (2 and a half) loves this book too - and he had memorized it already because we have read it so much. My wife gives it to everyone who has a new baby that we know and they all love it.
Great quality and price. Illustrations where wonderful.
Cute book
A good book.
Cover is so great. Sturdy and lovely. Wonderful book for my twin great grand daughters who will be 1 yr. old in November. Love this book
"Adorable illustrations, simple for young one. Bought for my new Granddaughter."
great
excellent reading
"GoodGoodGoodGoodGoodGoodLooking forward to reading more, but this review is holding us up!  Thank you."
Cute book!
"Great bedtime story.  Good message, nice rhyming, love reading it to my son before bed."
"Nice pictures. The text is middling, and the ""God bless you and good night"" (repeated twice) is the only mention of religion. Okay for an infant of a few months old. I doubt it will hold her attention in a year."
"This an adorable story that's perfect for bedtime.  It's a board book and it rhymes (two of my fave things in a baby book), plus the illustrations are wonderful.  Very soothing for baby.  I would purchase it again."
so cute
This is a really sweet book with cute pictures and rhymes. We read it to our 10 month old son every night.
"Absolutely love it!!!! I always forget to write reviews on here and wanted to make sure I started doing it because I always check them myself. This is a GREAT book, My son is 4mos, He was 3mos early also so he's not really into books quite yet, But the 1st time I read this he did smile and giggle; Bcuz it rhymes I kind of sing it to him:) My mom came to see him, and I read it to her, My grandma came to see him, and I read it to her... They love it and so do I :) I'm sure this will be one of our main good night stories :) !!! And right away I put it on my fb & recommended to my fellow mommies! It came.in about a wk, I.had 3 other orders with it as well and perfect condition Also !!Thank you so much!!!"
Very nice bedtime read...
I've been using this Bible now most every day for more than a year and it's made very well. It's really well constructed and the pages aren't too flimsy or fragile. I've not torn any yet! I would recommend and repurchase.
"I like the outside of the Bible and the size of the type. BUT the words of Christ are NOT highlighted in red and I am very disappointed about that. When I tried to comment on my order, the page would not let me. Amazon, clean up your act. I see other pictures of red highlighting, why isn't mine highlighted?"
No worries on the vender. Its a fantastic example of the bible lays flat an eye catcher at our houses hall entry way. Gets compliments like a shiny new car.🙏 👍😎
"The cove is very nice, but this is not what I call large print. Very disappointing."
"My mother loves to read her Bible, and as an older person has trouble sometimes reading smaller print. This was the perfect gift for her. The words were large enough for her to read easily, the cover was beautiful. She loved it."
It does not have large print. The print is very small and hard to read. The sentences are all crammed together. There isn’t a space between the sentences. Very hard to read especially if you wear glasses. I need to go to a physical store and buy a new bible that I can see to read and that isn’t crammed together. The pages are so thin it is hard to read.
Large Print not Large enough had to order your Giant Print :-)
"Initially got it for myself, and when my mother saw it, and saw how big the letter were she wanted it. Apparently, she’s been looking for a large print bible, I gave her and she reads It now. She love the color and the sturdiness of the Bible; am glad I got it."
"Got this for my oldest son so he had a lightweight bible he could easily carry around. It’s very nice for the price and the font is a good size. He has muscular and vision issues so he needed a light bible with larger print and this bible suits his needs well, he loves it."
"The larger font (11) and thumb index make this Bible very easy to read and look up Scripture. We would definitely order from this seller again, fast delivery and a quality product."
It's really lovely.
Good
Yes been looking for a bible like this for a long I love it
"Very beautiful Bible...Perfect pink,But....Very fragile & thin pages..Cover feels like cardboard..No index like said"
This bible was so beautiful I want one for myself. It was a gift gift for someone. Would buy again.
Not large print. Only chose this one because it said large print.
"Bought this as a gift. My grandma loved it. The words aren't as large as I expected, only a tiny bit bigger than a regular Bible. The cover is gorgeous. The gold really shines against the brown leather."
Beautiful Bible love it
Its beautiful and is good quality.  I like that the words that Jesus spoke are in red lettering.It helped to bring me out of a very strange and dark time in my life.  It helped to put me back on the path that God wants me to be on.
Great first bible for my son. It seems to be of good quality...my only complaint is that the large print isn’t as large as the print in the other bibles I own.
GOOD
Easy to understand.
"Am very happy with this purchasethe Bible is soft, very well made and the pages are not thinExacty as described"
Love this Bible!!!
My mom loves her new Bible. She can read and understand it very clearly.
"I love this Bible.  The print is large but not too big.  It has a beautiful cover, better than the picture shows, and it has thumb tabs so I can quickly find books.  The pages are thin as per usual in a Bible, and I have some trouble turning pages.  Highly recommend.  I only wish it was available in the New KJV."
Print not large as described
I bought this Bible for my 6 year old daughter and we love it. It's really pretty and exactly what I wanted for her. I hope she'll have it her whole life.
This is a Bible you can use for many years. The cover is well made!!! The large print is easy to read. Thank you.
Just what I needed
"I love the look of the cover of the Bible. I just wish the print was a little larger. Even though it says large print, the text is still somewhat average to me, other then that everything else is great."
My favorite version and writers hands down..i keep purchasing these for friends and loved ones..no worries of mixed in false stuff..or twists..just the Word..and good binding and leather and lays flat and affordable..fits perfect in medium bible covers.. There ya go!
"Nice Bible, but does NOT have large print."
"Exactly what I been looking for not to big, as I seen some bibles that seem to weigh like 5lbs. Pretty satisfied with the description...would buy again not for a while tho. 😊 Love my bible"
Bought it for my husband I must say he love it inside out.. Very good for the price..
it says the type is 10 point which is not large print in my opinion.
Bought each of my children one. They loved it!!
"I love this bible it is sort of thin, not heavy at all. I am very fund of this bible. It is my study bible."
What can you say or should I say can’t say about a bible? This one is so pretty and well put together.
Nice bible for money
"The length of time between my first reading of Pilgrim's Progress (John Bunyan) was so long ago.  I found Alan Vermilye's translation so much easier to read and comprehend.  As a new Christian when  I first read it,  I took a lot for granted.  I supposed that someday I would just know it all like Christian seemed to.  Reading it this time, the character, Christian was almost pushy and judgmental.  Not willing to give up on Christian (and Bunyan) quite yet, I researched John Bunyan's life and found that his faith was quite genuine and he was imprisoned for it a couple of times.  Being a Puritan wasn't everyone's cup of tea in Bunyan's generation.  On the other hand, I find the older I get, the more I need to fill up on God's Word instead of judging.Not quite willing to leave Bunyan and The Pilgrim's Progress, I did some more research and found Part 2, Christiana and Her Children.  I discovered a refreshing story of  Christian's family who rejected Christian when he chose to go on pilgrimage and how their hearts changed and followed behind him.  I'm so blessed that I dug deeper!"
"This work has never gone out of print. I decided to read “The Pilgrim's Progress” as it has a reputation as a classic and has been forced down the throats of many a student.I can see why it is forced. Aside from being a tad dated in writing style and a tad verbose, it can get on your nerves as most of it is just a bunch of bible quotes that served the purpose of the writer, John Bunyan.I have to confess that I only made it through the first part of the book before I realized that the rest was going to be the same.Now, other than having a reputation for being the first English-written novel, I can see no value in spending time reading it. Possible I need a course on why I should want to read this book. But if you just take it off the shelf you will just put it back."
"John Bunyan’s The Pilgrim’s Progress Part 1.Revision by Alan VermilyeI first read John Bunyan’s The Pilgrim’s Progress in the early 1950’s when I encountered it in a highschool literature class. The edition I used then was new, copyright 1933, and the book cost $2.00! WhenI encountered Evangelist early in Chapter 1 he said “if this be thy condition why standest thou still? He(the man) answered because I know not whither to go”. From there on, though the prose be beautiful,the reading became tedious and interpretation difficult. Alan Vermilye has composed an unabridgedrevision and the above encounter reads “If this is your condition why are you still standing here askedEvangelist. The man shrugged his shoulders and said I don’t know where to go!” Reads more easily doesit not? Some of the old and elegant prose has been replaced by more modern and elegant prose, but nodetail has been changed or omitted from the older texts.Alan Vermilye has composed several works of CS Lewis that I have used in leading small groupdiscussions at my church; Miracles, The Great Divorce; Screwtape Letters, and Mere Christianity. Eachhas been well received enthusiastically. I use as a measure of success how many come once and leave,how many leave the group early and how many fail to fully participate by their reading and discussions.Using those criteria my groups have been most successful.I found The Pilgrim’s Progress professionally written, easy to read and, grasp the concept. ReverendCharles Spurgeon is said to have read the work more than one hundred times and still believed thatwhile it is arguably the greatest allegory ever written he still had difficulty grasping its essence. No sowith this edition!I read this work in the Kindle app. For my I pad. Each reference led me to the reference source and useda whole page for the refence but did not give the reference quote. And I found I could not edit the pageto add my own notes. Were that available it would add significantly to an already excellent bookrevision!I plan to use this and its Study Guide in my fall small group discussion group and believe it will be a greatsuccess!"
"I wasn’t sure I was going to like the idea of a new translation of John Bunyan’s book, The Pilgrim’s Progress from 1678.  On the other hand, I had tried to read the original multiple times and frankly never finished it.  This isn’t really a new translation as much as it’s a version in plain English.  Sort of like Eugene Petersen’s, The Message, version of the Bible.  It gets at the modern sense of what was originally written and uses modern language.  Therefore, its much easier to finish!  I’m not going to repeat the story/allegory as other reviewers have done a good job and most people are generally aware anyway.  I would say Pilgrim’s Progress is a great example of an allegory, a writing style we don’t see a whole lot today.  I think this version of the book would be great for high school students or a small group study… it also has a study guide that is excellent."
"Having read Pilgrim's Progress many years ago, I remember this as an inspiration book, but very difficult to struggle through the language and style.  This revision, in current words and structure, allowed me to enjoy the challenges of the concepts rather than the challenge of reading.  As I was asked to review this book, I stopped often to check the original text and found this newer offering extremely true to the original. This is a book that makes the reader think about their Christian belief and/or think about Christian concepts in general. This thought process is further enhanced by the retaining of all the Scriptural references (and there are many) from the original text. Therefore, as would be expected from a classic, it is engaging and extremely well structured so as to make it a fun read.  Combined with the study guide, this is great material for personal or group Bible study!!"
"I thoroughly enjoyed Alan's opus of The Pilgrim's progress. It is a deeply profound book of every Christians' journey to know God and live by faith from first to last. As Christians, we will all go through certain places such the swamp of despair and meet many characters who will either encourage or discourage us in our lives of faith. I appreciate Alan's struggle to understand Bunyan's original text and interpret it for the modern reader. I highly recommend the book for personal or group Bible study."
"The Pilgrim’s Progress a ReviewOver the years I have heard many people talk about the book The Pilgrim’s Progress but never really had any desire to read it, or really knew what it was. Then a couple of years ago my church was offered a free streaming of the newly produced animated movie by the same name. We have a monthly movie night at church so we took them up on their offer. I found this animated video to be very interesting to watch.Then a few weeks ago I was offered a chance to do a review on a rewritten and updated version of The Pilgrim’s Progress that had been rewritten and updated for modern days by Alan Vermilye. Not only did Vermilye rewrite the nearly 350 year old book with present day language, he also took up the chore of creating along with it a study guide to be used by both individuals or for church groups.I was pretty much stuck at home during this Covide 19 pandemic so this was a great opportunity for me. I downloaded the book and the study guide to one of my tablets. I started reading the book without even glancing at the companion study guide. Knowing that I was going to do a review of this book I took notes on the characters and destinations. Now this isn’t something that I always do, but I do like to highlight passages in books that I find meaningful, want to remember or need to investigate further. For just the first chapter alone I took a total of 5 pages of notes. I found the text to be easy to read and follow. It was also an intriguing and exciting narrative on the main character and his journey.The main character is Christian. His name and the names of other characters were given names like Evangelist, Pliable, Faithful, Hopeful, Ignorance and Goodwill. The characters names were as much a characteristic while also being a character. This was a very interesting way to present a quality of a character without having explain the character.The original author, John Bunyan, of The Pilgrim’s Progress was written back in the late 1600’s. It is said that it is second only to the Bible in the number of copies sold and that it has never been out of print. I don’t recall that with my Roman Catholic upbringing to have ever been exposed to it in the past. This is probably a neglect of my education. Bunyan wrote this and many other books and tracts during his incarceration in jail.This study guide is a valuable asset in understanding the book. If I had gone to the study guide, just to check it out, before I had started reading the book I would have found that the 5 pages of notes I took were already fully compiled for me in the beginning of the study guide. Also there you will find many other helpful pages containing a wealth of information about the book and it original author, John Bunyan. Take note that you MUST use Vermilye’s writing of The Pilgrim’s Progress along with the study guide, no other version will follow it or make sense.I urge anyone interested in reading this book to also invest in the study guide. It is separated into twelve sessions that go along with the twelve chapters of the book. Each chapter/session, as they are called, in the study guide has numerous thought provoking questions, some that site Bible quotations, so you may want to have your Bible handle also.I read this on my tablet which didn’t allow me to highlight areas of special interest or to take notes in the margins, I wish I had been able to. So I would suggest that you get the hard copy of the book and study guide rather than have to use the Kindle version like I did. At least get the study guide in hard copy so that you can take notes there. I do lead a men’s discipleship Bible study at St. Bart’s Anglican church and will probably introduce this to them in the future, so I will be getting hard copy of both publications.I recommend this book to individuals of all faiths and denominations and also highly recommend it to church Bible study groups. Enjoy."
I tried reading John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress many years ago and was put off by the Shakespearean language. I wrestled with meaning and context as those have changed dramatically over the years . I gave up on the original after only a small effort. I was so pleased to try again with this revision. The story is clear and extremely readable now. I feel I understood what Bunyan was saying. The scripture references are easily accessed with the click of a button so they can be read along with the story. The work is inspiring and I am glad I had another chance to read and appreciate it.
"Actually, the study guide comes separately.I vaguely remember hearing this story retold from a pulpit, as a boy in church; I thought it was stupid then, but I really hate it now!So why am I giving this a Five-Star rating?Because it is what it's supposed to be: The Pilgrim's Progress, rewritten in modern English.If that's your cup of tea, drink it.If you can't get enough of it, and want to share it, incrementally, with your Sunday School class or bridge party, etc., get the study guide to go along with it."
"Not having grown up a Christian, I missed reading the easy reading of Pilgrim's Progress and read the Dangerous Journey with my children. This was a fabulous resource for children. Ready to set out on my own to read the actual Pilgrim's Progress left me completely confused and settled that I just would NEVER read the original. Until now. The modern-version stays true to the actual reading but for the confusing wording that many of us are not used to. It is so easy and enjoyable to read, I read it in one weekend and went back and read it again. I plan on reading it to my children this year in our homeschool as well. Don't miss out on the amazing Study Guide that helps you SLOW DOWN and digest what it being said and how to apply it to your life personally. I would recommend doing this with a study group or a friend or two to get the most out of it. This is a wonderful resource and am highly recommending to others who would like to read Pilgrim's Progress and understand the power of this story for a modern day Christian."
"It was very easy to read.  My goal is to get my bible study group used to reading classic literature.  Usually people avoid classics.  By reading this easy to read version, they can gain comprehension easily and won’t be as fearful of tackling another timeless, great read.  Thank you"
I have always wanted to read the pilgrim's progress but have been a little overwhelmed by the size of the book and understanding the grammar.  I am a casual reader and just have and do not have an easy time with trying to make sense of some of the older English grammar. This revision makes it much easier to read for someone in my boat.  I have enjoyed reading through the book and relating to many of the situations and feelings that Bunyan brings to life in his book. Thank you for a readable version for someone like me!
A very well written translation of John Bunyan pilgrim's progress. I found it very hard to put down the book. Very enjoyable. It follows the life of a young pilgam in a dream like setting. Following him through his journey to salvation. I highly recommend this new translation to young desiples and new Christians.
"While I am a public high school English teacher, as well as a clergyman, and I do understand Jacobean English rather well, Alan Vermilye’s version is a very clear and accurate retelling of this Christian masterpiece.  It is very easy to understand and is an enjoyable read.  Add the study guide with this, and you get a deep understanding of the message Bunyan was trying to get across.  Let me recommend both of Vermilye’s books to you.  The Pilgrim’s Progress should be in every Christian’s library, and this version is a must have.  The study guide will make understanding the book far easier and would be a great Adult Bible study at church or in smaller home groups."
"I am an artist; visual images are what I love to see and create. Alan has made it possible for us to easily picture the journey that Christian is on with more clarity and understanding. John Bunyan wrote a book with a great message that was for the people of his generation who were able to understand it easily. Today, it's a difficult read and would need to have someone who practices exegesis to explain or interpret a text written four hundred years ago. I know there are many updated versions, but I believe this is the one to read.The importance of what Alan has done doesn't dishonor Bunyan's work; it makes sure that the message will continue to be read and understood today because it's about each of us and how we lead our lives when on the journey to the ""Celestial City.""When you add the study guide, you can use it to test yourself each week as you read each of the 12 chapters in the book. It will work great for individual study and group studies.With the free answers, you can verify your answers and see how they stack up to Alans."
"This version of Pilgrim's Progress is a very easy-to-read book. I haven't read the original (or any version) prior to this, so I can't speak to comparisons. With everyday language and character names that help you keep track of their role, it's simple to follow along in a bible study where you're reading snippets at a time. I got this with the Study Guide, but I found myself just reading all the way through the book! So it's okay if you not planning on doing this as a study.I look forward to re-reading it in a Bible Study. I just finished Ch. 3 of the Study Guide and I'm really enjoying it, too. If you like a more structured study, definitely get the Guide! It has plenty of questions and scripture references to dig deeper.  I could see this being good to use as a youth study, using the book and the scripture list on their website to help relate it to everyday life."
This version was a great choice for me & my teens to read. If you are looking for a Christian book that makes an impact this is a must. We found it to be easy to read & understand. We used the book in our homeschooling & had so many wonderful discussions from it. The study guide that Alan created as a companion to this version was very beneficial. I highly recommend reading the book while working through the study guide. Time WELL spent!!!
"I've only recently heard of the Pilgrim's Progress, and that it was a Christian classic that every believer should read. I also heard it was originally written in old english, which can be challenging to understand. However, in this version with modern english, it is very easy to understand and equally as powerful! Many aspects of Christian's journey stood out to me, as well as convicted me, and I felt as though I was walking right along side him the whole way. This is a book you should always have on your shelf to be read over and over again. No doubt I will be journeying through these pages again. What an encouragement along the wall of any Christian seeking to grow closer to God and other believers! This is officially a must-read!"
"Believe it or not, I have an extremely busy schedule so sitting down and reading Pilgrim's Progress in one setting has not happened.  But in the chapters I have read of Alan's new edition has been a blessing.  It is clear reading and I can leave it after a chapter or two and pick it up later and feel like I never put it down.  I also like the print.Also, as I have read through the book, I realized that I could actually read this to children many , if not all, would be able to understand it.  Yet as an adult, I loved the readability and the clarity as well."
"This modern English version of the famous allegory uses the original names for each character and presents Christian's travails in clear and exciting prose. Footnotes cite the Biblical passage for each of Bunyan's references. There are no illustrations. Arrangement is by chapter, with each chapter given a descriptive title. This version follows the key points of the original and includes effective dialogue. A well done edition that features a complimentary study guide."
Bought extras for our Ladies' Bible study! We all love the book!
"As described, some writing. Good condition."
most definitely recommend this amazing study!!
This was my second Priscilla Shirer Bible study and it was amazing!  I had never done an in-depth study on Jonah so I was interested to see how she would draw out an entire study on Jonah.  It's not just a story about a man and a big fish!  She brought out so many concepts that I could easily see in my own life.  Incredible study that I highly recommend to anyone wanting a good study for a group or individual.
"I am really enjoying this Bible study.  Even though the book of Jonah is small, there is definitely a good message in that book.  It helps you go deeper into what Jonah did and how often we may do the same thing.  Are you really sure you are hearing God when he gives you direction, or do you push the thought aside thinking maybe he wasn't talking to YOU.  Great study!"
"Such a blessing! Used this I'm a summer women's bible study group. The video which accompanies it is a must, too."
I am very excited to see how the book is composed based on a popular but short story.
Jonah is a very thoughtfully written bookPraise God for the author Priscilla Shirer and the way He uses her.We can all be Jonah: and we can all change
"Loved this study! Priscilla  Shire does a wonderful  job of taking apart the story of Jonah so we can see the hero of this story and of our story, God. I love how she really  focuses on the subject  and doesn't  add unnecessary  personal stories."
Great women's group study. I am relatively new to small groups at church so I don't have much to compare it to. But I did learn a lot. Priscilla is amazing!
"This is my first Amplified Study Bible and I love it. The information at the beginning of each book as to the author, the time line in which it was written and the theme is very helpful me.If there was one thing I could change it would to a heavier paper stock. My colored markers have not bled onto the back of the page."
The amplified bible is a great study bible. It is a translation that is easy to understand. The only thing I would like more is if it had red lettering.
I have used the Amplified Bible for years and now they have made it for studying. I love it.It makes studying and reading the Bible so much easier.I love the large print.
"I received my Bible a few minutes ago and I love it! The large print is perfect, very easy to read! It’s heavy but I’m planning on using it at home. The colored maps are excellent. I am looking forward to doing in depth study with my Bible"
This is a magnificent Bible. Bound beautifully and large enough print as I am having vision issues.  I love the explanations of Scripture and that I can understand what is written. Came in a presentation box and would be a wonderful gift for someone new to the Word or someone continuing the quest.
"I have an older edition of the Amplified Bible. When I noticed that several important Truths were removed from the Nkjv and the Parallel Bible I was furious. These publishing companies are trying to make The Word of God of none effect. Purchased 7 months ago, haven't used it can't return any of them because I zealously wrote my name in them before reading them."
Wonderful version to replace my 20 year old worn out soft back copy of the Amplified bible. I'm very happy with the hard back study version. I recommend it!
I love the new amplified translation! I love the size of the print. What I don’t like about this bible is that my pages are already coming out because it is just glued and the cover is very plastic feeling.
"I downloaded this AMPLIFIED STUDY BIBLE, so I could carry it with me easier on my Tablet.  I'm disappointed the Verse Notes are not on the bottom of the same page as the verses, like My regular Amplified Study Bible.  I'm not too tech savvy at my age."
"Pages are really thin but, overall it’s a goodsize and readable."
"This is not only a beautiful hard cover Bible, put the print size makes it a comfortable read and I'm really enjoying the amplified translation."
Scriptures are easy to understand!!!
"Love this Bible.  I wish I had searched further the leather covering because of the weight.  Otherwise, it's exactly what I need for spiritual growth."
Thank you
Wonderful
This is the most beautiful bible I've ever own. They sell pens that dont bleed and work perfect on the pages.
I am so excited to have this Bible as an ebook I can have wherever I go. It is easy to go to any book and verse I desire at the time.
Great bible to have along with the KJV
Great bible
Nice study help. Explains things in a way that is that is helpful to understand.
The color on the Bible is a lot lighter than pictured in the add. The pages and binding are good. Everything about the Bible is quality. I would have liked a richer tone on top as depicted in the add.
I gave this to my wife for a Bible Study she is working on.  This is a great translation vehicle!
"So far I really like this bible. It's kind of like a ""word-study"" bible within the text. I've never had an Amplified Bible before. We'll see as time goes on how I feel."
love it!
This Bible is very good and I am happy with my purchase.
Read the Bible Amazon. Freedom of speech is a God given right
Easy to read  Like this version.
Very nice Bible.
Such a great value for the money! Hard back cover makes them sturdy and when put a nice cover on them they made wonderful gifts!!!
Great additional notes
"I love my Amplified Study Bible! The Amplified is just so expressive. This bible is presented in a nice clear large print. There are footnotes. At the back there are theological notes by location, a topical index and maps. There are also tables such as: major covenants in the Old Testament, Old Testament festivals etc. A really nice study bible. I recommend it."
"I purchased the Kindle version and went to Psalms and it seemed as some have said (noticed post purchase) that to get to eg Psalm 121 you would need to scroll through 120 Psalms to get to it! Thankfully I discovered by accident that its not so, go to Psalms in the index touch it then tap Psalms again and it opens up to another index showing 1 to 150. It's the same with all 66 books of the Bible once you tap a book in the main index tap again to open up the chapter links within the books. I gave it 5 stars for the Bible text but I haven't really looked at the notes yet, as I just wanted the Amplified version on my Kindle."
I can't recommend this highly enough - I bought one for a gift and ended up getting another for myself.The larger sized print in this is much easier for me to read than some of the other Bibles I own.I do find everyone seems to differ on what style of bible they prefer but I am very happy with this one.
"Beautiful! I love it. The bible is much bigger than I expected, and the print is a good size. It's very well laid out and easy to read.I'm going to enjoy reading this. Excellent value for money and I would recommend to others."
"Such a beautiful design with the imitation leather and silver-edged pages. Heavier than I expected, which makes me very cautious about the strength of the spine when holding it. Extensive study notes, which can seem a bit overwhelming at first, but it'll take some getting used to. Lays nice and flat and the font size is exactly what I wanted. Slightly larger than the normal size, so it's not those huge letters that may be required if your sight is not as strong. I'd advise giant print for that."
Love it!I've always enjoyed bible stories and the amplified bible helps me to read them in a story form whilst learning too.I intend to use it alongside the king James version but the amplified bible makes for a comfortable read.It's a heavy book so won't be one that'll be carried around but used at home. It looks lovely.
Never used one of these before and it's great for devotional. There isn't a lot of commentary but what there is is excellent. The pages do not have a lot of ghosting and for a hardback is well built. This is a very easy to read Bible and it can really help when you are doing a Bible study and there are areas that need clarification. I have a few bibles and if there is a subject or a doctrine that I am studying is really helps to have clarity and this helps with that.
"This is such a well published, AMP version of the Bible. The addition of explanations at the bottom half of the pages adds a lot of historical context to understand why things were done the way they were done. The pages are of decent quality. It's a little on the heavy side in terms of weight, not a Bible I'd be walking around with. Best to have as part of a study at home. On the go I'll stick to the YouVersion Bible app."
"Love this bible with large print, concordance & stylish cover"
The bible arrived on time. This is a really good translation which adds meaning and relevance in its text
The book was in excellent condition & arrived really fast!
This is a lovely book telling stories of the inspiration behind long loved hymns.It has a beautiful cover.
"An amazing book that is filled not only with timeless hymns that speak to your soul, but also the amazing stories behind each and every single one. It is beautifully written to the point that it draws you into its pages and songs, capturing your soul and awakening a deep love for the ""old"" songs. I personally am using it as a hymnal study with my 10 year old son for our homeschool and even he loves it! I definitely recommend this book and I will certainly be gathering up the other volumes to this!"
I enjoy knowing background on some hymns and composers/lyricists.  I like to have interesting stories to share with choir when previewing next Sunday's hymns.
"With the passing of hymns in preferential to chorus and worship bands, we are loosing a great resource in the Church when it comes to worships.  Our two oldest grandchildren are members of a worship band and the older leads (15 & 17) leads a worship band in another church.  We hope that as they come to see the stories behind the hymns, there will be a good blend of both types of music in worship."
Read it every day
"If you love the old hymns, you will love this book.  The hymns become so much more special when you know the story behind them.  I will probably buy the other books like this Robert J Morgan."
So many favorite hymns!  Brings much joy to know the background history and remember singing these beautiful songs many years in church.
"This is a wonderful collection, I hated for it to end. I new many of them having sung in church choirs for many years, but there were many that were new to me.  I will recommend this to my church choir and to the men in a men's chorus that I belong to, the Sanity Singers.  Congratulations, you have done a great job.Donald Beckett"
"Interesting, love it!"
"Very good book. Shows the complete song and the history of the writer. It is very inspiring and uplifting! The pages are done in an old style. This book shows the history of where our hymns came from, very cool!"
I am very happy with this book! I like how it has the full music/words of the hymn on the page beside the story. I grew up singing hymns in church & want to pass that on to my children - sadly th hymns are being lost. This is a great book & I highly reccommend it.
I loved learning the stories behind my favorite hymns. How wonderful to learn something of what inspired these Christians to pen the words and music that live through the ages. This would be a wonderful help to Sunday School teachers. IMO
"i loved this book, I love the deckled pages and the stories about the music and the hymns selected. I loved it so much I purchased 2 more copies to give to my sisters. The books came quickly and in excellent condition as advertised. If you love hymns and would like to know more about the origins of them, this may be the book for you."
This is to be a gift and I know the person will enjoy it.
Such a treasure to know the history of some of the great gospel hymns.
Love this book! Exactly what I wanted!!
"These books (there are more than the one...we own two of them) are the great stories behind the hymns we're all so familiar with.  AND, the music is included for those who have a piano (or some other msical instrument).  We found them very interesting."
Since I only purchased this digitally I can only speak to the fact that I wanted the words to the songs and I am not ably to zoom them in an read them. The stories are wonderful and I love that. If I could read the words I would have given this a 5 star.
I will be using it for my own enjoyment. A lovely legacy to share with my family.
"I got this for my aunt and she loved it! I love the old hymns I grew up with, and they become even more powerful when you learn the stories behind them. I really love that the music sheets are included. Someday I'll get back to my piano lessons and those will come in handy. Great book, also makes a great gift!"
Good read
"its not 150 hymns, its 60, big differenceits not leatherthat's  why i say falsebecause of that it an unfair price!"
Great book
What a wonderful compilation of the stories behind the hymns that have nurtured our Christian world.  To know the heart and reasons behind the depth of these beloved hymns.  I have purchased this for many worship leaders and will continue to purchase for anyone who wants to read about the saints before us.
This shipped fast.  I just love this book.  You have the song on one side of the page and on the other side is all about the author and how the author was inspiored to write the song.  It makes for good reading as well as informative.
"Great Book, I have given this as a gift many times to people in Music Ministry."
What a wonderful insight into the hymns we love.
"Good book, but I wish it had a few more hymns.Good overall."
"Praise God and thank you for having ""Then Sings My Soul"" available for purchase and inspiration.So often when we sing these wonderfully moving hymns, we have little to no clue as to the composers, the inspiration, the date, and so much more.THANK YOU! THANK YOU!  Generations to come THANK YOU1"
arrived just as promised. great condition wonderful book for anyone with passion for hymns that we hear too little of these days
love it
Exactly what I wanted.  I been looking for songs and their histories.
"Great book, I t r eating and inspiring."
perfect
"What a wonderful book.  It was so interesting to look up some of my favorite hymns and find out their origin, lots of surprises."
Excellent resource!  This had many newer hymns the older versions of this subject did not contain.
Good book for those who love the stories behind hymns. Like that it gives hymns with music notes.
I bought this as a gift for my husband.  He leads a group monthly in a nursing home and the residents love hearing the history of the hymns they love.
"The book arrived in mint condition, which was my only criteria.  I'd viewed a friend's publication and knew I just had to have this wonderful collection of hymns and the history to match."
Three of my sisters and I now all have this song book. We love it.
I love this book!!! Learning the origin and history with each song brings a clearer understanding and a sense of brotherhood with these saints of yesterday.
Amazing book with stories that inspire!  Gives me strength and hope and great peace as I learn how others have been moved and held by our Fathers loving hands. Great as a devotional!  This book was in great condition. Very pleased!
Great
Excellent overview of many popular hynms!
"Can't get enough of the Then Sings My Soul series of publications!  This particular edition highlights Christmas and Easter hymns as well as many other old hymn favorites.  This book would make a lovely gift for anyone, but especially for those going through a difficult time in their lives.  I highly recommend this very fine publication."
This is an excellent book that tell the stories behind these great hymns.  My brother gave it to his pastor and the pastor could not put it down!
"The songs in this book are inspiring.  When you pair them with the stories that are behind them, this is a very uplifting book."
My heartfelt thanks to the author of this series of books. It has been invaluable in our research of the history of the hymns.
This book has been an enrichment in my relationship with God! Very inspiring stories behind the songs.
Was a gift and the person recieving the book loved it. Came quickly without any problems. Great book with the lyrics of the hymns and a background of when they were writen.
It's a wonderful book I thank God for letting my path cross with this book I love it
completes the set
It's a keepsake of old and wonderful Gospel songs which are uplifting to one's soul.  I recommend it to everyone who loves these old Spirituals.
We appreciated these hymn stories very much.
The songs are wonderful and the history of how they were written is so interesting.  Excellent
"If you like the old hymns or just want to refresh yourself on the words, this book is for you."
I love it!!!!
A real blessing!!
"Perfect, I sent as a gift-she loved it-arrived sooner than expected"
Paid for both got only one
This book was purchased to find out theinspiration behind some hymns that werewritten.  A lot of the songs I did notknow but the songs I did know it wasvery interesting to find out why and howit was written. Only gave it 3 stars becausemost of the songs I did not know.  Otherwiseit is well written.  Good quality and nicesized print...an easy read.
Book made of cheap looking paper. It looks like it won't take much for pages to come apart in book. Got it for a birthday gift- have not given it to person yet. So don't know how it will actually hold up.
The book is informative and helpful - but.  The Amazon (or Thomas Nelson) product will prove to be worthless...Let me explain.  I purchased this book to do devotionals with and copy a few of the very interesting stories to provide our speakers some background to their presentations.  But then it hit.  A pop-up disallowing me to copy-n-paste my own book.  Beware that you can't use your own book like you would think you can.  Amazon! I'm off to Apple.  Read your small print - just don't think you can copy and paste as you might like (DRM) or something like that.  Really?
the pages looked like they were ripped out from another book then compiled to make a new book but i'llgo with it nevertheless  I wont return it
"The Bible says to ""Speak to one another with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord (Ephesians 5:19) and herein one learns the heart-felt background of many of the most important Christian hymns in history. This stirring book ""Then Sings My Soul"" by Robert Morgan is a delightful tool to add to your devotional readings. With 150 hymns of the Christian religion, you get the words of the hymn (and a fascinating exposition concerning the origin of the song) many songs arose from difficulties and suffering in life as the writer focused on the goodness of God in spite of the troubles they endured.In this very readable volume you will learn how many penned their hymns to God including:* Horatio Spafford (It Is Well With My Soul)* Handel* Charles Wesley (prolific hymn composer)* And many holiday, seasonal and national songs* 150 in all!God is so wonderful that we must sing praise to the Lord from out hearts and this volume will assist the reader to make a joyful noise to the Lord in response to the greatness of our God.Psalm 150 1 Praise the LORD.[a]  Praise God in his sanctuary;  praise him in his mighty heavens.2 Praise him for his acts of power;  praise him for his surpassing greatness.3 Praise him with the sounding of the trumpet,  praise him with the harp and lyre,4 praise him with timbrel and dancing,  praise him with the strings and pipe,5 praise him with the clash of cymbals,  praise him with resounding cymbals. 6 Let everything that has breath praise the LORD.  Praise the LORD.I received this book gratis from BookSneeze in order to write a review. I was not obligated to post a positive review.By Mike Robinson author of ""God Does Exist!"""
"So only one page is dedicated to each song. There are MANY songs in here that absolutely require two pages. Instead, they just completely cut out the chorus. I know lots of people like the stories, but... I want a HYMNAL. Not a story book. We bought two of these, we've been using them for about 6 months. We will never buy these again. Looking for something that has FULL songs every time, no missing choruses. Also I've seen hymnals with well over double the number of songs. Again, too much space dedicated to stories. Which is fine, if you like that. I don't."
Then Sings My SoulThen Sings My Soul is a collection of hymn stories.  If you don't know what a hymn story is it is a story about the hymn writer and what may have inspired him to write the hymn.My TakeThis book has over 100 hymn stories each written on one page juxtaposed with the sheet music and words of the hymns.  The stories were well written and well researched.  I especially liked that you got to find out a little more about the composer every time another of his hymns came up in the book.  This volume which is volume 1 contains many standard well known hymns and a few lesser known one.  Having a sheet music is also a plus as even if you only know a little bit of music you might be able to follow along and accompany yourself singing.The book itself is high quality and is very suitable for a gift for anyone who loves the liturgy and liturgical music.  The book is also advertised as having unique ragged edge paper.  This was perhaps the first thing a noticed about it when I received it.  The pages are high quality and the ragged edges make it a true collectors item.What I liked most about the book was the devotional aspect.  These hymns are for the most part heavily biblically inspired and just reading will help to reflect upon the words.  In may religions devotees believe that singing is praying twice.  Just reading this book will have you singing and praising.You should definitely get a copy.I received a copy of this book for review from Booksneeze at [...]This review contains only my honest and unsolicited opinions.
"Then Sings My Soul by Robert J. Morgan is a compilation of classic hymns that includes the music, words and story behind the song.The book is divided into sections that include Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving and Favorites. On one side of the page is the music and words, and on the other side is the story and some fun facts behind the hymn. There are also some Biblical quotations upon which the hymn is based.Not having any background in music, and being rather ignorant of most history, I found the information included to be both interesting and entertaining.This would be a nice gift for a Sunday school teacher, music or choir teacher. The book itself has a neat finish to the pages, they're sort of rumply and ragged.I gave this 4 of 5 stars because I didn't care for the way the book was organized. I didn't understand why Christmas was at the front or how some of the ""favorites"" were chosen.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free for review from BookSneeze, a blogger program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own."
"This is my first review through the Booksneeze.com blogging program, and I was so excited when this book was offered.  I knew from the moment it arrived that I would like it, as it focuses on two of my interests: history and music.  Then Sings My Soul is a beautiful book that presents 150 different well-known hymns and gives the history of the author, if known, and the personal situation or historical event behind the writing of each song. The hymns are categorized according to the occasion on which they are usually sung, and there is a category for favorites, as well.I found many of the stories in the book fascinating, making the hymns more meaningful to me.  I enjoyed reading the verses of the songs after reading the history. The hymns' composers came from all over the world, from many different walks of life and a variety of denominations and social situations.  Some hymns were based on Biblical verses and some were based on specific situations experienced by the composers.  Occasionally, what we would consider hymns for adults were originally written for children.Often the history of a hymn would completely surprise me and it would require me to read the hymn's verses with a new perspective.  For example, ""Onward, Christian Soldiers"" was orginally intended to be a marching song for village children as they went to Sunday School.  The hymn, ""We Gather Together,"" now usually sung at Thanksgiving, was written in 1597 to celebrate Holland's freedom from Spain and the newly acquired right of the Dutch to worship as they pleased.The book itself is very visually appealing, too, and I thought the use of heavier paper with a shredded edge was very elegant.  The three indexes - by hymn title, by composer's name, and by first line - are very user friendly.  I am giving this book a five star rating because it held my interest and the information was wonderfully presented in an organized manner.*I received this book free from the publisher, Thomas Nelson, as part of the Booksneeze.com blogger review program.  I was not required to write a positive review and the opinions I expressed are my own.

Will always love this book. It's great for all walks of life. I read it as a teenager and recently sent it to someone incarcerated and they loved it. Great for self and as a gift to someone else.
"If you're buying this book for yourself or a loved one, God bless you.  Even if you are no expert at Christian service and ministry to others, reading this book and then passing it along to another who could also benefit from it (that's everyone, IMHO) is a simple and easy way to spread God's truth around the world.  I have purchased at least 3 copies of this book so far, and every time I get one, I just as soon find someone who could use a copy :)"
Excellent book.  Enjoyed reading and participating in a group exercise with my church group. Highly recommend this book.
"If you are looking for daily encouragement and direction, this is a great way to achieve it.  There are short daily readings that direct you to scripture.  I always referred to my KJV Bible to verify the author's writings and the translations he used.  I have also picked many of these books up at 2nd hand stores to pass them out.  God has a purpose for your life and wants a close personal relationship with you.  This book and daily Bible reading and prayer helps you focus your attention on God and his plan for you."
Looked old so I can’t give it as a gift
I got this for a co-worker who had questions about purpose.  I have always enjoyed this book.  I have no idea what her thoughts were.
This book is a blessing to me. I read the book and it makes you look at your differently. If you can do this with a group and get everyone to participate its even better. Well worth reading and sharing with others
The book is well written.  The quality of the used book was fair due to hand written notes throughout.
"This was a gift, it's a wonderful book very happy for purchase will be purchasing againto help someone else!!"
Like I said it must be a great read-2 different friends have gifted me one.  I'm not much of a reader but when I did read the book I understood why this book was given to me.  It is an easy read as well as informational.  I have played it forward and have sent copies to my friends.  Many have written back to me thanking me for sending them the book.  They have enjoyed it and I wouldn't be surprised if they also keep playing it forward.  This won't be my last time purchasing this book.
"I had purchased this copy because I gave my original to a friend.  What a life changing book!  Rick delivers wonderful thought-provoking messages throughout the book that really do help to draw you closer to the Lord.  I will be reading the book again for the third time with a friend, and each time I read it I feel that I'm able to draw something more out of it.  If you're unable to sit down and read the book, Rick also has CD's available.  In addition, I also highly recommend his book The Purpose of Christmas."
Open up to NEW!!!  God Bless : )
Thank you
The Purpose Driven Life leads the reader through a Bible study that ends with the participant learning why God had them on Earth...a life with a purpose.
The book gives you insight on how a Christian Life should live their life. This is a book to help you understand why you are on earth and what God's plan is for you.
"After reading this book to recommend it to my therapy clients, it wasn't the right book for me but I felt it had some good insights.  I felt like The Power of Now and Unleash the Rebel Within had more to offer and were an easier read.  (At least for me)"
I BOUGHT THIS BOOK AS A GIFT FOR MY SISTER. SHE IS STILL IN THE PROCESS OF READING IT AND I HAD READ SOME AT ANOTHER PERSONS HOME SO I KNOW IT WILL BE A GREAT BOOK.
When you have faith but you just need a spritual boost this is the book you need to read was very pleased with shipment timing and the quality of the packaging.....
"The book is fantastic - I'm reading it again as if for the first time and loving it!  However, the order we placed was WAY late and put our church study behind about a week. Plus the books we ordered were advertised as new - some had stickers and inserts in them. That was a little disappointing"
What is there to say about this book.  We all need to read this and apply everything in it to our own lives.  Why are we here and what is Go's ultimate plan for our lives.  A book to try to live by.
“Rick Warren shares what the body of Christ needs to hear to get understanding “
The product was exactly as described.
just as advertised
GREAT BOOK  TO LEARN FROM..
Excellent item
This is such a helpfully bok for those how need to find direction in the walk with Christ. It has given me guidance and help me keep my life on track.
"An easy to read book but oh how powerful, life changing for the better!!!I would read and recommend this book over and over again!!!"
Prefect!!!!
great
I did not care for the authors ideas and opinions
"There were too many highlighted areas and written notes in this book for it to be rated as in ""very good condition."""
An absolute must for the young wonderful female that is growing up in today;s harsh culture/society. A very special book to help teach the really important principles/guidelines that really matter in life!
"Excellent guide for living the Christian life.Well written, easily understood, well planned.Simple, easy to follow, suggestions for livinga happy, fulfilling life."
"This is just what I needed(and need) in my life.Not a 'self Help book', more like a direction for a happy  life.Very Good."
I bought this book to do a womans Bible study. It is a great study book. It came quickly and the price was right.
good reading
Great book - highly recommend reading!
This is a very good resource for all Christians.  If we would practice what Rick Warren has written our lives would be so much improved.
This book helped me so much in the very beginings of my walk with Jesus. It was a bridge between not reading the Bible ever and reading the Bible daily. It's a GREAT Christianity 101. I took more than 40 days to read it because I really wanted to digest what I was taking in. I'd highly recommend reading it along with Proverbs- There are 31 chapters in Proverbs- one for each day of the month. Today is the 25th - Read Proverbs Chapter 25. Tomorrow chapter 26 and start over every month. Together with Purpose Driven Life and Proverbs I began to be spiritually nourished. You should try it.
worthwhile
Very good inspirational reading. The book is worth the money and should be read by everyone looking for answers in their life..
"One of the very best written books on my bookshelf, it will require effort on your part; I have bought several copies now and give them to those close, some along with the journal sold separately, this book has been a life-changer for many, the cover states that over 30 million copies sold, I have no doubt, feel its an investment you will make for your life, and those around you will see it."
life-changing book right here...
Review of basics of Christian life.  Very helpful and definitely worth the time reading.
Very good to read.
THE BEST BOOK OF LIFE I EVER READ. IT IS BY FAR THE WAY TO LIVE AND THE WAY TO DIE.
Im not to big on reading but this is by far one of the best books i have ever read. It's very uplifting and positive. It gives you hope.
This is a book everyone should read.  I've bought and given away probably 20-25 copies.  It was tremendous help for my daughter when she was going through the dying process.  I sent several copies to Iraq at the request of a military person (not a chaplain) there.  This last copy I ordered and had delivered to a young man on his way to prison.
good!
"What On Earth am I Here For? This book is an amazing opportunity to follow a concise, structured program and get in touch with God created you for."
"Five of us in our small group. We do not feel the study guide was worth the cost. It isn't helpful, save your money.The book is good and the video is worth getting."
"This book goes with a video study of the same name.  It was good, but I wasn't quite as impressed with it as I was Uninvited (another study by Lysa TerKeurst)."
I very much enjoyed reading Lysa's newest book and I had so many good takeaways from it. She feels like a friend who is encouraging you to keep going despite what you may have in front of you. We all need more cheerleaders in our life like Lysa!
This study guide is a perfect companion for the book. We are currently going through this in my women's Bible study group. The study guide will aid you in a better understanding of the book.
The bottles are awesome.  They keep things cold far better than other bottles we have had.  The only minor complaint is the pics on the site don't always match the item sent.
Lysa Terkeurst has insight into God's Word and the study help is just that . It is a help to get you thinking beyond your circumstances and see God and a reminder of His great love. .and how is plan is woven throughout history and my story too. I am enjoying the study with our women's group.
Wonderful
"This book spoke to me in so many ways.  It made me cry, rethink my priorities and grow closer in my relationship with God.  I think anyone would find something useful in this book because we all experience disappointments at some point in our lives.  I enjoyed it so much it inspired me to start a discussion group, so I am now leading the group and reading the book for the second time!"
Learned that sometimes we’ll have ups and downs in our lives.  I used it for an online Bible study.
Good explanations and plenty of room to write. Good layout and design. Matches the video series.
Attended bible study at my church using the DVDVery relative and down to earth study  Lysa did a good job as expected.
This book is right what I need right now and our ladies group at church just started it
If you purchased the book you will love the workbook as they go hand in hand. I love mine its a good reference when you need to go back and forth etc
"Great for ladies study. Buy the online video and book, definitely worth it."
I don’t even know how this happened but they shipped it to me looking like this. It is sliced clean through. The entire last session of the book is damaged.
This books author is very authentic in dealing with emotional pain
This book is great for anyone who has experienced any disappointments in their life. I would definitely recommend that everyone reads this book. I am planning on getting more books by this author.
Purchased for a women's bible study. Lisa Terkhurst bears her soul. Great book!
This book is a game-changer. Lysa wrote this book for me and every woman and it will change your relationship with Jesus and this world. I will be forever grateful.
"I am a leader of a life group. This book was very impactful and helpful. The book, workbook and dvd worked in conjunction to make for a very easy 6 week session. The homework was thought provoking. And the points made gave reason to pause and reflect on one's self."
This is one of the best books I’ve read in a long time.  It is well written and speaks to the heart.  This is the first book I’d ever purchased by Lysa and since reading it I’ve purchased several others.  She’s very real!
"This book is helpful & insightful to help all who find themselves saying, “It’s not supposed to be this way! How did this happen?!”You do not need the DVD or study guide to glean so much from this book. I just completed the course. The DVD is lovely;however, the ‘meat’ is in the book. Could not more highly recommend."
This book helped me through an extremely hard time.
Got this for my mother in law for a Bible study.  She loved it
"It's easy to read, great references/layout of the book. Wonderful way of integrating scripture into an understanding of difficulties in our lives."
"I should have read the reviews before I bought this.  THE BOOK IS NOT INCLUDED.  This is just a study guide.  I recently saw this book on the shelf at the airport and looked forward to ordering it, but I am so disappointed in receiving just the study guide that I do not plan on trying to buy the book anymore."
BEST SELLING book for a reason!! We are using the study guide for our Life Group @t church.
This book has helped me as I go through a dark and difficult time.  Thanks!
GREAT
Lysa never disappoints. Great book . She’s always so personable and real.
Liked the metaphors and personal experiences cited..Bishop is a genius!
Suppose to be a good read
"I do a great deal of speaking for my business, ElevatewithJE.com and This book helped me to refocus and Realign with what really matters !!!"
This particular book captured my attention in the Preface.  Long before the first chapter Bishop T. D. Jakes' vocabulary is extraordinary.  An excellent read hands down!
I love this Book a lot of knowledge and great experience
Mom love her books
Very good book! Bishop Jakes has done it again. If you want to learn the insides of communicating you should read this book!!
I love It All
I love the book gets you to understand life and how powerful prayer and words can be. Thank you needed this very much in my life!! 🙏
This book has blessed me so much and has answered a lot of questions thank you Bishop Jakes
"I have enjoyed Bishop TD Jakes for a long time and have some other books from him. This book takes way too much time talking about the importance of speaking but not giving the nuts and bolts. Actually, the best chapters of the book are from the co-author the Rev. Dr. Frank A. Thomas. After reading this book I felt like it was a big waste of time with nothing specific so I did get my money back. Something I have done twice with 100's of books I purchased."
"As with everything Bishop Jakes produces, it's an on time word. It uplifts, while correcting and encouraging you to stretch your faith and become the best version of yourself that you can be. You know the you that God created... I'm grateful Bishop didn't drop the mic or I would've never had the courage to step up to mine."
"This book is one where Bishop T.D. Jakes breaks down what goes into crafting a sermon that shares God Word and captivates your audience. He helps us see how our body language factors into the messages we deliver. How even the silence factors into the message we deliver. And if you’ve ever heard Bishop teach then you know his messages are always impactful.Now note that you will not find anything on how to study the Bible, because it’s kind of given that if you’re delivering a sermon, you know how to study the Bible. This book is on how to take your notes from your study time and turn it into your sermon.FYI I received this book from the publisher in exchange for my honest opinion."
"Although I had never heard of this author before, I was blown away with T.D.'s skills, tips, and tricks for clear and effective communication. As a Christian, I found many of the points applicable for public speaking, preaching, and teaching. Because I am an educator, I especially found the portions on communication helpful, as I am always seeking to learn and grow in ways that help me to better connect with my audience. Overall, if you want to improve these skills and assets, I would give this book a try."
"TD Jakes is an anointed servant of God. His books inspire, encourage and illuminate the Word of God. Drop the Mic is no different. Don't give up, don't go back, go forward in all that God has for you and have faith that what the Father begins in your life will come to fruition!"
"Bishop Jakes always has an encouraging word and wonderful insight. This is right on time, and as always, something that can be used in everyday life!"
"2021 is the pivotal moment and time for Don’t Drop the Mic by Bishop TD Jakes.Following 2020 and now into 2021 this book is pivotal and key into helping us to re-engage with our family, friends and associates in community. As we begin to communicate, we must keep everything together, mentally and physically. Our words are often our first impression and let us NOT drop that.This is the one must buy for 2021"
"So I purchased “Don’t Drop The Mic” yesterday and it has already greatly surpassed my expectations. For a communicator on any level, it will feed your desire to me be more excellent at what you’re called to do. This book feels like you are in a one on one private class with Bishop Jakes on how he does what he does. I highly recommend this book for anyone that communicates. It will equip you and encourage you to be the version of you. THANK YOU Bishop Jakes!!!!"
"I'm an introvert and not really big on public speaking.  This book gives pretty good tips for anyone who is or is not a fan of public speaking.  Using examples from the Bible, as well as from his personal life, Bishop gives practical,  useful and helpful advice to guide people in to communicating better with others.I received a copy of the book via NetGalley and am voluntarily leaving an honest review"
"In reading, T.D. Jakes book "" Don't Drop The Mic, I've learn how much words can bring life to dull moments and dead  situations.  If you are looking to improve  your communication, or dialogue,  for personal growth,  in small groups ; in large settings or in an intimate partnership, then, Don't Drop The Mic is a good reference to use.  It improved my life. It can possibly change yours too.  Tomiko."

My daughter loved it
Grand kids loved it.
Great book great price. My 2yr old love peppa.
A fantastic little book about a changed life. Profound yet simple is the Way of Jesus Christ !
"Bonhoeffer is detailed and analytical in his observations regarding daily life in a close-knit Christian commmunity.  I found this book to be highly thought-provoking and practical.  He covers a lot of ground, and I found many of his thoughts to ring true with my own experiences.  His discourse is firmly anchored in the Word, with frequent scripture citations to validate and expand the thoughts in his writing."
So many great truths about doing life together in unity and how to cultivate genuine and deeper relationships through a rich relationship in Christ.
Just read the book.  Words will not do justice for the experience had by the reader.  An exceptional description of how to live a successful life.
Ordered this book for my mom.  She liked it.
"One of the greatest and most challenging books I've read on the subject of Christian community, Bonhoeffer's ""Life Together"" was a beautiful and engaging picture of Christian fellowship in it's truest form.  I've never read anything that spoke so truly about Christian community in modern context and I would recommend it to anyone curious about this subject."
"If you approach Life Together as Bonhoeffer's educated suggestion on how a Christian community should exist, you'll gain some great insights into relational living. But if you take his description as the only model of a Christian community, then you'll most likely end up frustrated. Bonhoeffer competently explores important concepts - such as confession, prayer, Scripture readings - that make for a healthy community of faith, but I found myself disagreeing with some of his ""musts"" and ""have-tos."" (For instance: he says when singing as a group, we must only sing in one voice, because we're one community, and having harmonic voices in addition to the melody would undermine the unity of the community. To me, that takes the logic way too far.) So while this book is not the masterpiece that The Cost of Discipleship is, it's still packed with helpful insights into forming & sustaining Christian community."
"I'm a ""fan"" of the late martyr, Bonhoeffer. My favorite book, however, is still ""The Cost of Discipleship."" ...and he certainly learned its cost in his own life and death."
A must read if you want to develop deeper fellowship with people in your life.
"The book cover is very good. However, the pages are upside down/printed backyard, Do you have any normal ones?"
Thoughtful writing not to be raced through. A book I found best read with time to digest and let sink in. Only regret is that I had not picked this book up years earlier.
In this book Bonhoeffer communicates well the unique challenges of doing life together as a Christian community. He also answers those challenges with wisdom.
"Really enjoyed this book. The forgiveness, love, mercy we see and receive in Christ we should receive in other believers. The Christ that lives in me should rejoice when I see and feel the Christ in you and together be excited for Christian community. Highly recommend this book and author."
A must read for all Christians. This books is timeless. I've read it time and again and recommend it to all my friends.
Good 📚
"I used this as a foundation for a series of adult religious education classes that I led on ""Beloved Community"".  The principles are applicable to all kinds of community--not just the Catholic monastery."
I am a Bonhoeffer fan. He lived by his conviction. He cared practically about the family of God even though he knew the risks he was taking.
good product purchased
"Very challenging to how I've looked at things such as ""Biblical Community"". Great read."
"Incredible read. Not always an easy read, but very enlightening, inspiring and thought provoking as to how we live, worship and pray together."
A classic book. Very good for thinking about and building community.
Amazing teachings! Every page seems to have an applicable principle that I need to work on. This book goes into detail about what it means to truly love your neighbor and how to practically go about doing that.
I have to read this book slowly and intentionally. Very good inspirational words for brothers in Christ. Some of his opinions are eye opening.
A classic for a reason
This is a great book.  Life changing.
This will help you get real about the Christian life.
"I was led to read this book after reading Eric Metaxas' biography of Bonhoeffer. This book is a classic review of true Christian church fellowship. It is a short book, but it is eye-opening and challenging and will cause the serious reader to re-evaluate their picture of how they ""do"" church. I highly recommend this book to those Christians who seek after truth."
Truly Impactful Insight that blows me away of how far we as a present representation of the church are from doing life together in community. an life changing outlook on life as a follower of Christ.
I would recommend this book to everybody.  Bonhoeffer was an amazing man.  His writing is easy to read and very helpful to the common man.
My son loves this.
"This book along with the Book of Job and Salvifici Doloris, apostolic letter by Pope John Paul II on the Christian Meaning of Human Suffering helps understand the problem of pain and the church's teaching on redemptive suffering.  As St. Paul wrote, ""Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am filling up what is lacking* in the afflictions of Christ on behalf of his body, which is the church."""
Lewis gives some great explanations for common arguments against Christ because of the existence of pain. Will make you think much more deeply as you read through.
"We all need to answer this question for ourselves, and i think God has the answer.  Explore that with this book."
A good small book for anyone who has pain or has had pain to read. I recommend reading this. I am glad I purchased it.
This book will have you considering views you wouldn't otherwise think of. What a treasure. I loved it. This man has depth!
"Clearly a mind expanding experience.  Not for the frigid mind,  or lukewarm seeker."
"Such a deep, thought provoking book. Not and easy read, but necessary"
"I'm on my 7th time through this book and it's just incredible.  New things pop out everytime!  It's not just about pain, it's about our entire existence and our whole relation to God."
"Even though I'm not a christian, I enjoyed his clear thinking, and his perspective on a major religion.  The problem of pain exist for believer and non-believers alike."
Very good at explaining something so difficult to understand. Really liked it. CS Lewis stuff is excellent. Would highly recommend
"An insightful book on the problem of pain! It's analysis of pain though logical leaves one wondering, yet in a strange way also understanding why pain and suffering exist in life. Highly recommended."
Loved this
Not many understand life as well as C.S. Lewis.
Heard about this book from a program on television. For anyone looking for help because of chronic pain will find this book very helpful.
a classic
I loved the way he explained his view points in this book. C.S. Lewis is hard to grasp at times but once you do it is so worth it!
Great buy came on time...
Another great Lewis book
A simple question requires a lengthy but convincing answer.
"Classic indispensable Lewis!  Balanced, deep look at pain we all face."
great
CS Lewis the best!
Thanks
Valuable resource!
a great book
Great!
The book came in quickly and in the condition I expected.  I would purchase from this seller again anytime.  Thanks.
OK
"The book is pretty good, I guess I was looking for ways to ""bolster my resolve"" in dealing with chronic, intractable pain.  This doesn't address that aspect.  More of a societal view of pain and those in pain."
"Content of the book is great, but the printing and quality of the book is awful. Pages are off different sizes."
"""Try to exclude the possibility of suffering which the order of nature and the existence of free wills involve, and you find that you have excluded life itself.""Another serious and powerful work in a long series by C.S. Lewis: why must we suffer, mentally and physically?  He hits on subjects we all struggle with.  Lewis detests the doctrine of hell, but it is written, so it must be discussed.  The chapter on animal suffering is fascinating.  The only chapter that led me to question his words is on man's fall.On human wickedness: ""A God who did not regard this with unappeasable distaste would not be a good being.  We cannot even wish for such a God----it is like wishing that every nose in the universe were abolished, that smell of hay or roses or the sea should never again delight any creature, because our own breath happens to stink.""On saving grace: ""The dangers of apparent self-sufficiency explain why Our Lord regards the vices of the feckless and dissipated so much more leniently than the vices that lead to worldly success.  Prostitutes are in no danger of finding their present life so satisfactory that they cannot turn to God: the proud, the avaricious, the self-righteous, are in that danger.""By the Lord's love we suffer; this strengthens, and it also keeps us on the straight and narrow.  If we are to look for easiness, then we are to look for less love.  It is for our sake.""The full acting out of the self's surrender to God therefore demands pain: this action, to be perfect, must be done from the pure will to obey, in the absence, or in the teeth, of inclination.  How impossible it is to enact the surrender of the self by doing what we like,...........""After finishing the book, a thought on heaven came to my mind:The differences are what makes up a community whether here or in heaven: God has created us after a time where all was God (but that is no more!); we are all unique parts to a puzzle.  He needs us all back to complete it----to rejoin our family in heaven; it pangs Him that many will not make it, and choose to ignore their created purpose, because they have surrendered to the self and not to the Lord.  Once all was God, but after the creation all has changed; we are asked to be with God because we are of God.  We are distinct here on earth, but the maximum distinction awaits us in heaven, to be reunited with our Creator.Wish you wellScott"
"Whether physical, emotional or spiritual, pain is an undeniably reality in this world. C.S. Lewis eloquently explores the pain we endure as humans, as well as the Christian response to it, in this wonderful book.I think many non-believers find pain to be a great deterrent against them accepting faith. They wonder how a loving God would possibly allow His children to suffer. This has never been a problem for me, although I have been fortunate to avoid devastating tragedy in my life. Lewis explains how pain is a product of the Fall, how through the Fall humans have become vulnerable to ""the laws of nature"", which they were not subject to before sin tarnished Man. Lewis also writes of animal suffering, the grim reality of Hell and he concludes with a vision of Heaven: ""But God will look to every soul like its first love because He is its first love""I would highly recommend this book to Christian and non-Christian."
"The Problem of Pain is the first of C.S. Lewis's apologetic works. Having been an athiest(or maybe just a skeptic?) ten years before, Lewis certainly had walked through this problem on his own and in 1940 wanted to help many of his fellow British skeptics through it, too.The book starts, after a disclaimer on his lack of theological schooling, with an explaination of selves that are distinct from God and a description of the fall of man before tackling human pain. His basic argument is that, while human pain is a result of Adam's Fall, God uses it for our good to A)alert us that something is wrong with the universe and B)to refine Christians into better people. Lewis does admit that while pain can ""rouse the bad man to a knowledge that all was not well"" it can also ""lead to final and unrepented rebellion"". He finishes with a very good explaination of Hell,""the doors of hell are locked on the inside"" and an equally good chapter on Heaven.This is a book for those who are struggling with the ""idea"" of pain; in other words, ""If God is so good why does allow people to be in pain and even send some of them to Hell?"" But if your question is more concrete, like ""Why did God allow my husband to die from a fatal illness?"" you will probably find this book to be like salt in a wound. If that's you I would recomend Lewis's other book on pain, A Grief Observed, or Philip Yancy's Where is God when it Hurts. The Problem of Pain is certainly an excellent piece of apologetics, however, and I found it to be very helpful."
"C.S. Lewis was a rare individual. One of the few non-clerics to be recognised as a theologian by the Anglican church, he put forth the case for Christianity in general in ways that many Christians beyond the Anglican world can accept, and a clear description for non-Christians of what Christian faith and practice should be. Indeed, Lewis says in his introduction that this text (or indeed, hardly any other he produced) will help in deciding between Christian denominations. While he describes himself as a 'very ordinary layman' in the Church of England, he looks to the broader picture of Christianity, particularly for those who have little or no background. The discussion of division points rarely wins a convert, Lewis observed, and so he leaves the issues of ecclesiology and high theology differences to 'experts'. Lewis is of course selling himself short in this regard, but it helps to reinforce his point.Lewis sees pain as an inevitable part of the human experience, given our condition of being estranged from God.  He does not pain and suffering as being caused by God.  'The possibility of pain in inherent in the very existence of a world where souls can meet,' Lewis writes.  'When souls become wicked they will certainly use this possibility to hurt one another; and this, perhaps, accounts for four-fifths of the sufferings of men.'  God has a role in that God is the creator of all things, and set things in motion, but God is not responsible in Lewis' view for the individual or corporate acts of humankind in contradiction of God's will.  In this, Lewis does go against the Calvinist strain that goes through Anglican and other theologies.Lewis highlights part of the problem with pain in that it cannot be easily ignored.  'We can rest contentedly in our sins and our stupidities; and anyone who has watched gluttons shovelling down the most exquisite foods as if they did not know what they were eating, will admit that we can ignore even pleasure.  But pain insists upon being attended to.'  Lewis admits that this is a 'terrible instrument' that God uses to draw people back to God's will, and that it isn't always successful.  In addressing the doctrine and idea of Hell, Lewis admits that this too is a terrible idea (in fact, he states it is an 'intolerable' one), but also states that this is not meant to be an intellectually satisfying or comprehensible doctrine, but rather a moral one.  Lewis does hasten to state that people often confuse the imagery of Hell for the doctrine of Hell - the ideas of Dante et al. are very pervasive, and our conceptions of what is meant by Hell usually owes more to such sources than the actual Biblical text.Lewis also shows part of his method of biblical interpretation in different passages in this book.  In the chapter on Animal Pain, he discusses the absence of statements in scripture about whether animals share in immortality.  'The complete silence of Scripture and Christian tradition on animal immortality is a more serious objection; but it would be fatal only if Christian revelation showed any signs of being intended as a ""system de la nature"" answering all questions.  But it is nothing of the sort.'Lewis explores the issues of divine omnipotence, divine omniscience, and divine goodness as possible contradictions and stumbling blocks to the way we see the world (or the way in which we can see a world with God operating in it, or responsible for it).  Lewis comes to no definitive, systematic conclusions that will satisfy everyone.  In the case of this particular text, Lewis is writing is a specifically Christian context, and readers from other backgrounds and adherents of other traditions may find less to connect with in this text.This is a key piece in the overall structure of Lewis' theological construction."
"the problem of pain is classic lewis: an inimitable combination of deep philosophical thought, razor-sharp wit, the ability to poke fun at himself and a heart that is truly amazed by his God.his premise is not to make pain or suffering any less distasteful, but to show that back of it all is the love of God.  the book can really be broken into three sections.  1) the divine heart 2) human suffering 3) speculative ponderings.the first section (ch. 1-3) gives the basis for all of lewis' further thoughts and arguments: the ultimate goodness and omnipotence of God.  this section defines what true goodness and benefit are in the light God's being.  lewis shows that our common conceptions of ""happiness"" and ""what is good"" may be less accurate than we think.  he distinguishes true kindness from what may be called mere pity.some highlights from the first couple chapters:-""love is something more stern and splendid than mere kindness"" - the idea in context being that God loves us too much to simply give us everything we think we want.  (anyone with children ought to be able to understand the truth of that statement).- ""try to exclude the possibility of suffering which the order of nature and the existence of free will involve, and you find that you have excluded life itself.""- ""the election of man, from nonentity, to be the beloved of God, and therefore (in some sense) the needed and desired of God, who but for that act needs and desires nothing, since He eternally has, ans is, all goodness.""the second section (ch. 4-7) is about the actual suffering of humans and how that plays out against divine goodness.  lewis discusses the fall of adam with a lot of poetic license and conjecture on the way things were before the fall... can't be taken as fact, but some very provocative ideas.  also there is a fascinating discussion on the humility of God in receiving us even when we come to Him only as a last resort; He will have us on any terms.here are a handful of quotes from this section:- ""all sadness which is not either arising from the repentance of a concrete sin and hastening towards concrete amendment or restitution, or else arising from pity and hastening to active assistance, is simply bad.""- ""the proper good of a creature is to surrender itself to its Creator - to enact intellectually, volitionally, and emotionally, that relationship which is given in the mere fact of its being a creature.  when it does so, it is good and happy.""- ""God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pain: it is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world.""- ""the human spirit will not even begin to try to surrender self-will as long as all seems to be well with it.""the third section (ch. 8-10) is very speculative, as all the chapters concern things which no human living on earth has had actual experience of: heaven, hell, and pain in animals.  lewis' thoughts on hell are excellent, revolving around the idea that if the fulfillment of our humanity is in submitting to our Creator, then entering hell is ceasing to be human, but continuing existence in some more wretched state.  the thoughts on heaven are equally as fascinating.  the chapter on animal pain is a unique discussion in Christian theology (i can't remember ever hearing someone talk about it as a theological issue).  there are also, albeit highly speculative, great possibilities suggested for what animal pain can and can't mean.  also the thesis of humans ""transforming"" animals in a way vaguely similar to how God transforms man will at least set your gray matter in motion.  however, where lewis really falls short in this section is his upholding of ""theistic evolution"".  sadly, lewis believed that God used evolution to create the world and the species.  this belief, however, skews the whole understanding of goodness and pain.  if pain was part of God's creative process, it is not an evil or a temporary necessity in a fallen world, but rather death is a manifestation of the divine being, part of God's essential nature: clearly a problem for all the rest of the ideas in the book.some excerpts from section 3:- ""to enter heaven is to become more human than you ever succeeded in being on earth; to enter hell, is to be banished from humanity.""- ""the demand that God should forgive such a [wicked] man while he remains what he is, is based on a confusion between condoning and forgiving.  to condone and evil is simply to ignore it, to treat it as if it were good.""-""there are rewards that do not sully motives.  a man's love for a woman is not mercenary because he wants to marry her, nor his love for poetry mercenary because he wants to read it, nor his love of exercise, less disinterested because he wants to run and leap and walk.  love by definition, seeks to enjoy its object.""aside from the theistic evolution, a wonderful book. lot's of food for thought.  chew away!"
"I consider this little book on a par with the author's well-known classic Mere Christianity, as it addresses many profound questions that those in search of truth must have grappled with. Lewis was not an academic theologian so he writes for the ordinary person, which makes his words easy to understand. The introduction deals with the 3 elements found in all developed religions: The experience of the Numinous (sense of awe), the Sense of Morality, and the Numinous as the Guardian of Morality. Christianity contains a fourth element: A Redeemer who reconciles fallen mankind to the Righteous God.The chapter Divine Omnipotence places the problem in context: God's goodness and the problem of suffering. How can a loving God allow this? Here the author discusses the implications of free will and co-existence in a common medium or external world. The next chapter, Divine Goodness, deals with the nature of divine love. Love is sterner and more splendid than mere kindness. Simple happiness in the here and now is not what God has in mind. Love may cause pain but only in order to alter and improve the object of love.The chapter Human Wickedness looks at the state of the human psyche. Our character is, in its current state, not well. Lewis discusses our problems by examining a set of 8 very prevalent illusions. Following from this, The Fall Of Man investigates the abuse of free will while at the same time refuting Monism and Dualism. He suggests that the fall represented our loss of status as a species, and that a new species had then willed itself into existence. But remedial or corrective good exists even in our present debased state.The next two chapters deal with Human Pain. When souls become wicked they will use free will to harm one another. The human will becomes truly creative only when it aligns itself with the will of God. Christianity demands that we correct a misdirection of our nature. The author advances 6 propositions that are necessary to complete the understanding of human suffering. The chapter titled Hell addresses the seemingly cruel doctrine of hell. Pain mostly leads to redemption but may unfortunately also lead to unrepentant rebellion. This means that some individuals will ultimately prefer darkness to light. The author also discusses the apparent disproportion between eternal damnation and transitory sin, pointing out that some souls do not want to be forgiven.The chapter Animal Pain is speculation as Lewis admits, but such fascinating and plausible possibilities are presented here. If you love your pets and animals in general, be sure to read it! It will give you hope and peace of mind as to the mercy and justice of a righteous God. The chapter titled Heaven contains more speculation but of a most awesome, gripping and mind expanding nature. Lewis explores the idea of an eternal special relationship of each individual soul with the Divine Majesty, an eternal dance of joy in splendid diversity. This is not the unconscious nirvana of Pantheism but a condition of maximum distinctiveness of the individual in a higher form reunited with God.The Appendix is a note on the observed effects of pain, supplied by R Havard, MD, from clinical experience. It includes observations of both physical and mental pain. The Problem Of Pain is filled with compassion and illuminating insight. It is highly instructive and edifying, making a convincing case for the profound meaning of life. In addition, it is the perfect antidote for the hedonism and nihilism that are running rampant in the world today."
"Pain is real, just as sorrow, death, and wickedness. Your becoming a Christian will not encapsulate you away from it. Christ did not promise that in the first place. But there are reasons why pain happens, as much to Christians as non Christians, and we should reach a better understanding of the circumstances in which we live, so that we can apprehend the promises that are envolved through that pain. Everyone is to pick up a cross at childbirth, but whether you follow Christ with it depends only on you.This book won't be the treat that 'Mere Christianity' was. It's more philosophical; it assumes the reader is a Christian and has some knowledge of Scripture. But nevertheless, everyone can follow his thinking and it will all make sense. About 160 pages, it has chapters of between 10 and 20 pages, and frames the problem in its right context before reaching his conclusion at the end of the book. This is not a make-you-feel-good (dumb) self-help book. It's a make you understand book."
"The Problem of Pain seeks to answer one of the most consistently asked questions about the Christian faith: why is there suffering and how is suffering possible in a universe created by a God that claims His goodness. Lewis, in what amounts to a very long essay, not only seeks to answer why pain and suffering are present in this world, but how this most negative of situations can actually be used for good in the lives of individuals facing affliction.Pain, whether physical or otherwise, is a problem to be explained precisely because things in the world do not seem right. The pain the Lewis addresses most are the pains caused by spiritual separation. While the pain caused by biological processes is bad, Lewis seems to indicate that much of the pain we suffer through is due to our rebellion against God and our inability and failure to achieve peace and happiness.For those with more modern literary tastes the important thing that Lewis carries away from his speculation is how the origin of pain is absolutely correlated to the dissolution and fall of man. The Biblical narrative's statement that by sin death entered the world is a short, yet profound statement of the origin of pain. By developing his speculative story of the origin of man, Lewis ultimately says that man has refused to communicate with God by natural means, and as a result God has agreed with man and cut man off from natural communication with Himself.Any issue dealing with pain in the lives of modern believers has to be addressed from two angles. The first is the necessity of encouraging an embattled group of people who are called out by and being changed by their Creator. The second deals with the unique challenges of the modern world where naturalistic and pantheistic tendencies point the believer inward to solve his problems of pain and suffering.For those in need of encouragement in the midst of suffering, Lewis is quick to point out that pain is often much to be preferred over many types of temporary pleasure. Here Lewis is consistent with much of Protestant thought in that any sort of sanctification is confined to the earthly life of the believer.  All pain and suffering that is used as a sanctifying process ends in life, there is no possibility of Purgatory.The advances of the naturalism and scienticism of the modern world have for the first time led many to believe that pain can be solved successfully apart from the work of God. The generations, since the late 1800's, have believed as truth that men do not need God, and furthermore, that no sort of supernatural intervention will solve pain and suffering. From physicians to political peace brokers, much of the world has developed deep faith in its own ability to solve any natural pain or any pain caused by the suffering of others. The ever-increasing influence of pain and suffering upon modern man can be said to be inversely proportionate to the level that modern man believes he can escape from pain. The great value of The Problem of Pain is that it attempts to remind any who have a sense of arrogance about modern man that pain for them is God shouting above their pride so that they would recognize his sovereignty and His care for them."
C.S. Lewis remains one of my favorite authors although he challenges me to total engagement in the book. This was no exception. He brought up the hidden value in pain if the sufferer endures and searches for it.
"According to the Author, Lewis took up the daunting task of trying to understand why pain exists if a good God exists too on a suggestion from a colleague.  He notes in the book that figuring the problem of pain out started out as a duty, then quickly became an immense pleasure.  Reading the book may give the reader the same progression of feelings.  One may feel the urge to confront the deep question of pain and how that impacts one's faith is an obligation to be met grudgingly against one's will.  However, while delving into the work, one will find it extremely pleasurable as the author reveals that there really isn't a problem of pain.  The question eventually evolves from why, in a world created by a good and all-powerful God, is there pain and suffering to why, in some instances, is there a lack of pain.Lewis  illustrates his resolution of this problem eloquently and sufficiently, though concisely.  The book could be much longer and still not fulfill every but, though, or what if created by these major life concepts.I recommend ""Mere Christianity"" over this book, but suggest that this is a great supplement.  While some ideas overlap, there is much to be learned by each book."
"There are better books about the theological problem of pain (the biblical book of JOB, Paul Brand's  PAIN: THE GIFT NOBODY WANTS, and Philip Yancey's WHERE IS GOD WHEN IT HURTS?, to name three), but Lewis's book is a good place to start.  Lewis himself makes it clear in the introduction that this book only addresses the intellectual problem arising from suffering, and as such does not pretend to give advice about living with pain.  Lewis offers this by way of observation, that ""when pain is to be borne, a little courage helps more than much knowledge, a little human sympathy more than much courage, and the least tincture of the love of God more than all.""  As a catalyst for considering the theological difficulty of resolving the idea of a good God with the pain and suffering in His creation, this book is worth reading."
"This great book by C S Lewis should not be missed, although some of the theological aspects on Hell would not be accurate depiction of God in this new millennium as more and more contemporary Christians and religious believers sense that God is compassionate and good, but somehow moral evil and physical evil continues.Recently I am aware of a new theodicy that offers deep perspective and solves the problem of evil, undeserved suffering and untimely deaths, namely  Merton Lee's new book on Dynamic Moral Dimension Theodicy (Interview With God). This theodicy is essential for defending the Christian faith and theism.Merton Lee highlights that God is all-knowing, all-good and all-powerful. His Omniscience (Supreme Wisdom) and Omnipotence (Supreme Power) are infinite.  They do not need to be supplemented by the existence of the visible world and human beings.But God is also the divine timeless Dimension. In the timeless non-manifest Dimension, God does not have the opportunity to experience the dynamic moral experiences which require the interactions of individual embodied beings in a visible world where they can make moral decisions and perform morally good deeds. Thus, God's purity and moral excellence are non-dynamic in the timeless dimension. This is God's natural ontological attribute and not a shortcoming.Thus God decided to create this visible world and individuate His cosmic consciousness into small units and live in each human being to undergo trials, suffering and spiritual cultivation. This is to enable God to experience and acquire dynamic moral goodness and excellence in the visible world."
"Probably less appealing (than, say, Mere Christianity) because Lewis is needing to be more ""lateral"" here, more horizontal, more earthbound. There is nothing merely inspirational about his book, in other words, since it is taking as its subject a pretty serious philosophical problem. I'm not a hundred percent on board with reviewers who insist that one must be a Christian to appreciate this book. But an openmindedness to thoughts about a deity, and some grasp that humility and submission can be good things, that one can learn from them, are probably essential qualities to bring to this reading. No proud atheist will be satisfied by these arguments. For my money, Lewis is at his best here when speculating about the afterlife. His subjective version of heaven, as a place where personal joys are extended and sustained, is so much more appealing than centuries of talk about streets of gold, or harps and clouds. He has a way of making heaven meaningful, a place you'd like to be."
"Get the 2009 edition because this one is all screwed up. It has no real page numbers, sentences start without being capitalized, and even table of cONtenTs looks like that! Such a gem of a book so messed up in formatting."
"It is works like this that will have C.S. Lewis ranked, in the future, with thinkers like Augustine and Aquinas. The book is very ""readable"" but must be re-read over and over to start to get a hold of the momentous implications of the ideas he is proposing. Do the work to try and comprehend the message and you will be rewarded with a far greater sense of personal peace in this suffering world. Changed my life 14 years ago. Changing my life again as I read it now.There are astounding ideas captured in words. For example, in answer to people saying that they couldn't believe in a God who needed our worship, comes a lucid response about how God doesn't need us, but humbles himself for us to relate to.  Lewis writes:""A man no more diminishes God's glory by not worshipping Him, than a lunatic can put out the sun by writing the word ""Darkness"" on the walls of his cell"""
"I would recommend this book--The Problem of Pain--very strongly to the Christian reader. Certainly, the thrust of this book is NOT to convince agnostics and atheists of the validity of the Christian platform, and anyone choosing to live in the Fool's Paradise that is agnosticism will come away from a reading of this book just as incredulous and empirically-minded as before. As any well-versed Christian knows, a testimony of God and of Christ comes not through study and reason alone. Any agnostic or atheist wishing to investigate the fundamental claims of Christianity would be better off studying C.S. Lewis' ""God in the Dock,"" or ""The Grand Miracle""(an abridged version of ""God in the Dock"").Chiefly, I think that this book is meant to help Christians--or those with Judeo-Christian leanings--to reconcile the existence of pain with the realities of God's mercy, benevolence, and grace. Christians--and people of many other religions--believe life in the universe to be the result of a deliberate and calculated act of creation (nothing random or irrational, as the agnostics postulate). In light of this fact, a great number of Christians wonder why God would knowingly and intentionally create a world in which pain and sin had the possibility of being introduced.Lewis very accutely observes, in this book, that free will--while certainly POSSIBLE without the option to commit evil--would be utterly WORTHLESS without the option to commit evil. As I have prayerfully contemplated this doctrine, I have come to know if its truth. For instance, when my father or mother told me--and still tell me--that they love me, it was and is deeply meaningful because I know that they CHOOSE to love me. If all my parents could possibly have done was love me, with no active decision on their part to do so, their love would have no meaning. They COULD have chosen to abandon or abuse me, but they did not. And that gives meaning, indeed, to all of their love and nurturing. We do not congratulate fish for breathing under water, after all (it's the only way they possibly can breathe!).Lewis also observes, with emphasis, the fact that Jesus Christ could only have been one of two things: A lunatic or a God. The combined multitude of witnesses that knew Him--according to both Scriptural and Non-Scriptural documentation--affirm that if there was one thing Jesus constantly declared it was His own Godhood, and His Sonship to God the Father. When all of the evidence is taken into account, the representation universally set forth is that Jesus of Nazareth claimed to be God. Some denied it, some believed it, but all knew that this was, at least, His claim.And, of course, all things taken into consideration, only a madman would have even the slightest inclination to make such claims unless the claims were true. Jim Jones and David Koresh are two primary examples of men who falsely claimed to be God, and who were, as is undoubtedly known, both certifiably insane.Lewis makes the point, also, that with pain comes humility, and with humility comes receptiveness to God. If we were never to experience pains or disappointments in life, we would always take our blessings and gifts for granted. Either that, or we would worship the gifts (blessings) instead of the Gift-giver (God).The point is also made--and it agrees perfectly with Emerson's essay on the Law of Compensation--that every ""loss"" in life is, in reality, a sacrifice offered to the acquisition of something else: If a man loses his left arm, he develops an impressivley strong right arm; If a woman loses a husband to death, she is relieved of her duties as wife, and thus is free to go about doing other things.Finally, the Tester and the tested are both positively identified. Unfortunately, many--including some professed Christians--assume to be testing God. If, for example, they read in the newspapers of an elderly man shot down and robbed by thugs, they will say, ""God failed him."" But, the fact is, through all of the tribulations and turmoils of life, WE are the ones being tested, NOT God. God is already the paragon of absolute perfection. We, on the other hand, must prove ourselves in the test that is life (and, in the case of thugs robbing elderly men, such thugs fail the test quite horribly).To love and adore God in a perfect world--a world without pain or opposition--would be no major accomplishment. But, to love and adore Him in spite of all temptation and adversity is a most supreme accomplishment.This is a most praiseworthy book!"
"While I read this book (in fact, an old, battered version of my mother's)  in order to answer some questions regarding pain and why it exists in a  universe created by a loving God (if one accepts this hypothesis), Lewis  not only convincingly answered those but also dug into topics such as free  will and election, clarifying many other not necessarily pain-related  questions in the process.  I am now convinced (my apologies to all the  Calvinists out there) that free will is an essential ingredient to human  being and that it is necessary in order for Christian self-surrender to  have any sense at all.I usually don't riposte to other reviews, but I  don't believe the reviewer was correct in saying Dr. Lewis chickened out,  largely because his concept of innocent children seems erroneous to me.  I  remember my younger brother was fully capable of scheming before he could  even talk.  The helplessness of children does not make them innocent.I  fully recommend this book to anyone grappling with problems of pain."
"Out of all Lewis' books I have read this is the one I dislike and disagree with him the most. I will start out by saying that Lewis builds up to his points on this subject whereas in, say, ""Miracle"" he gets right to the point and then builds up his thesis. Also, with most of Lewis' books, this one will require another read through. Before I list my main contentions with this book, I am not aware if Lewis ever revised his thoughts on the subject or the particular claims which I take note with. I think he is dead wrong on certain principles of Christology - mainly the ability of God-knowledge to reside in Jesus. To say that God is incapable of this is to say that God is not all-powerful. I will say that Jesus gave up certain aspects of His Godhood to become human (for example, omnipresence). I also disagree with his assessment of where goodness comes from. With the statement of the Euthyphro dilemma, Lewis chooses to say that goodness is subjectively dictated by God, if there is a way God can be subjective - but I digress. I'm not sure why he doesn't make mention that the Euthyphro dilemma is a false dilemma and goodness arised out of God's character so God appeals to Himself. So what is good is of God and not just commanded by Him or He appeals to a status of goodness above God. The false dilemma answer has been around since Aquinas so I'm not sure why he doesn't comment on that. Another problem he spends too much time on because of the philisophical gymnastics he has to go through is the doctrine of Creation. Lewis comments on man existing before Genesis 1 and appealing to evolution to get to Adam. Adam arrises out of animalism. I'm not sure why Lewis doesn't take the Bible for what it says and it clearly leads to some murky backbending that Lewis isn't quite sure of himself what to do with it. This leads to my last negative point which is his theory on animal pain. He leaps way too far out from his main point and appeals to ""mights"" and ""maybes"" and ""hopes"" of God's character not stated in the Bible. Thus Lewis' basis for such claims are just as good as those wishes made on falling rocks from space. He agains lands in murky waters in stating that animals arrived not from Creation week but on the building upon death that evolution requires. Lewis reckognizes the problem with saying this and assumes a multitude of conclusions that have no biblical basis and are very, very weak - even in his own arguements.I do not wish to say there is nothing good about this book, because his formation of his main thought is decent. I have no issues with it in general but he does make some really great points. Another reading might pull my grade down farther or it might build it up. However, I think Lewis is way off in many parts here. Final grade - D+"
"Granted, while I do not quite get into C.S. Lewis' works as I do other Christian authors (A.W. Tozer, Andrew Murray, E.M. Bounds, Charles Spurgeon, Charles Stanley, Chuck Swindoll), The Problem of Pain will challenge you to think of the book's seems to address the age old question - why would a loving God allow suffering in this world?  Sometimes I wonder if that is the right question to ask.  Perhaps a better question would be - apart from God's grace through Jesus Christ, why should we demand any better treatment in this life than did Jesus?  Indeed, as a Christian, since I am identified with Jesus Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection, I have no right to demand that I be spared the pain that is prevalent in this world.I like Lewis' assertion that perhaps God would not love us any more if we did not experience pain.  I submit that the times when I and countless other Christians most experienced God's presence and comfort was during times of pain and trials.  Readers will note that Lewis himself experienced the loss of a wife through illness.Lewis will challenge you to think through why you beleive what you believe and this book is no exception.  This is not an easy read and you will have to concentrate on this one!  Lewis touches on the following areas in The Problem of Pain:1.  God's Omnipotence2.  Heaven and Hell3.  Human Wickedness and Pain4.  God's GoodnessRead and prepare to think and be challenged!  Recommended.  Lord have mercy on the scientist who classifies herself as an ex-Christian turned atheist:1.  If you were really a true Christian, then you would not have turned to atheism.  If I were to generous to say that you knew about 25% of everything there is know in this world, would you allow the possibility that God exists in the 75% that you do not know?2.  Please consider John 10:10-16 in terms of folks who think they are Christian but in essence really are not.3.  Is it possible that the reason you deny the existence of a literal hell is because deep down in the crevices of your soul, you really do believe there is a hell and just do not like the reality of it?"
"Jack wrote this toward the beginning of WWII, and it was sort of the beginning of quite a bit of attention focused on the problem of suffering.  This problem was particularly something that he had to deal with before his conversion to Christianity, so you find a tincture of his theodicy in many of his fictional works.What is particularly fascinating about this work is the way he used myth to handle the unknowns of Christianity (Eden, Heaven, Hell).  When you read this book and all of his books regarding theology, keep in mind that he is not a theologian, as he admits himself.  What he writes about suffering is not even how he actually believed it was, it was what could have been.I suggest reading this work along the side of the Space Trilogy or The Great Divorce.  He incorperates much of his own theology presented here with these pieces.  I've focused a bit of study on Lewis' handling of suffering, though I'm not a scholar by any stretch.  If you would like to read a little I've written on the subject, let me know.All in all, what Jack wanted to do with this book was to take the reader's mind's eye on a pilgrimage to the gateway of possibilities that lie within God's own imagination.  Although we may certainly never be able to totally conceive the mind of the Lord, Lewis does the best he can to take us to the edge of knowing Him as we are known."
"Beautiful book! I read it daily every morning. Many people are so busy, going from one activity to another. The readings encourage us to do the opposite. Start the day by being still in the Lords Presence and listening to Him."
Absolutely LOVE this devotional. I use it every morning to start my day off with the Lord. The book is beautiful and compact so you can take it with you anywhere. The devotions speak straight to your heart with encouragement for your day. This author writes really well and has a heart for Jesus. Each devotion is short but has a big impact. It is perfect if you do not have a lot of time but still want to grow closer to the Lord.I am going to be buying several copies of this devotional to out as gifts.  I would highly recommend it. Best purchase ever!!
I searched through so many books of devotions before coming across this and its exactly what i needed to read every morning as soon as i get up. Each page speaks something in me. I love that some pages have a quote and after every reading theres a small prayer. Definitely would recommend
This is my first devotional book and I’m in love with it. The book and pages themselves are absolutely beautiful. The words written in the book are even better. I’ll definitely be buying more copies to give as gifts.
When I think about this devotional the words refreshing and focusing come to mind.  This devotion has set a great foundation for my morning quiet time. Keeping me mindful of the value in being steel.  I’m definitely putting this book on the top of my list of gifts to give this Christmas!
Love the messages and bible verses in this book. Love that it had a prayer at the end of each devotional too. I have another devotional that has what day you are supposed to read each message but I like that this doesn’t so I read more than one a day or reread some. It’s a good size book to fit in my purse and has a built in bookmark.
I have never written a review for a product before but this book is just that good!! It is seriously gold! Don’t think one second longer! BUY IT!! It will change your life!
My new Go To Devotional! This girl can writeAnd has a beautiful heart for the Lord!
"I’ve passed this along to 7 other women (6 of us are reading it now!!!) One of my best friends, who lives 2 hours away, and I are intentionally going through the book together. We video every day and talk about it! There are no words for how much I love this devotional. I will be reading it over and over!!!"
I absolutely love this book! I highly recommend it! Worth every penny! I sent pages to people as I read them and they went and bought the book! It is also a great gift idea too! It is very simple 2 pages on each verse! I usually read 1 per day but sometimes I read ahead :)
"Bought this for a highschool graduate going off to college. She had some anxiety leaving & I bought this in hopes it would help. I eead only a few pages, but seemed like a REALLY good devotional. Thinking about buying more!!"
"During the COVID-19 pandemic, I was looking for a devotional to help bring peace and hope during uncertain times. I've never been a devotional reader so this was a high task for a book, but I could not have made a better purchase. The tone is hopeful but not condescending, the biblical passages are mixed with practical guidance, the length is short enough to be an easy read and long enough to give you time to settle into the page for the day. Highly recommend."
"I love this devotional. It only takes me a couple minutes to do in the morning. I love the way she relates it to life and seems almost always relative. I recommend to anyone looking for a great start to your day, religious or not."
I love this devotional book! Looking forward to buying more books from Cleere!
"This is AMAZING! Bought 2, 1 for me and 1 for a friend"
I am always looking for a great and straight to the point devotional. This one hits home. They remind you to be still and listen. The pages are of great quality. They even give little nuggets of quotes.
Each day I read the devotion and it is spot on! Like it’s talking to me. Such wisdom.  Highly recommend.
"A perfect devotional for those who want to slow down, focus and have a ""your switch"" off for a moment. Cleere speaks in ways that makes the reader realize what matters in life and what is time to put behind. Perfect for thoughtful gifts to people who matter most to you."
Wow! This is such a wonderful devotional that really helps put so many of life’s struggles into perspective. A truly wonderful read to receive encouragement and to spend time with God.
I love to read a devotion each morning.  It’s very up-lifting.  I’ve also gifted this to a few friends who were going through tough times.
Best devotional that I have ever had (which I’ve gone through quite a few).
"I love the heart behind Cleere!! She totally loves Jesus and desires for everyone to know and experience His love, grace, strength and power!!"
"Focus is spot on! Just what we need in this crazy world in which we live. It gives scripturally based applications to everyday situations one word at a time, while drawing closer to God."
Great devotional!  Beautiful written and to look at
I just buy what Jen reed tells me to. Still not mad about it. It fills my soul and centers me each morning. Also gifted one to a friend !
I bought four of these devotionals as gifts for Mother's day. I did a lot of research before deciding on this particular book and I am so happy to have found this one. It is so encouraging and uplifting and it is for all ages and stages.
"Not only is this little devotional perfect but the author herself is wonderful! If you ever get the chance to meet her in person at a signing event, go for it!!"
I bought several for Christmas gifts and everyone is raving about this great devotional.
Great Gift!  Fast Shipping!
I ordered this for my neighbor's birthday.  She loved it.  I also ordered one for me and I love it too!
Pretty good gift!
"Even though I haven’t been able to read through the whole devotional yet, I am loving it so much. Can’t wait to continue!"
My cousin picked this as a Birthday Gift.
Love this devotional!
Love this devotional. Easy and to the point but gives you lots to think about.
"This daily devotional came highly recommended to me and when I received it, it didn't disappoint. Beautiful messages along with a prayer at the end of each devotional."
LOVE this devotional. Perfect start to my morning! Cleere’s new devotional and Cleerely Stated products have touched my life in so many ways! Hope this isn’t her last devotional!
Great devotional. I use it every morning. It is great for spending time with God.
This was very useful and taught me so much. Just passed it on to my sister.
What an amazing devotion to start my day. I have purchased more for friends and family.
Got it as a gift for my grandma. She lives using it!

This is a great everyday devotional! I highly recommend!
"An absolute must have!! Such a great devotional for any season of life because it is the Word of God!! This girl writes from a heart filled with Jesus! I love how I can wake up and read this in a short amount of time and be motivated and reminded of our God’s timing, love and truth! What a beautiful gift for a friend, family member or anyone you want to help share the love of Christ with!"
Last year was crazy and this book spoke to me in many ways. I have enjoyed every devotional. Many times recalling the words to myself or a friend.It is compact in size. Well written. Beautiful lay out. Genuine in tone.I look forward to reading my next book.I recommend this book for women who want a simple reminder that God is faithful.
"This book is full of such encouragement. Its fresh presentation of timeless Biblical truth is a breath of fresh air. As a mom of four, I don’t have a lot of free time - but these short devotions are just right to start the morning or end the day. Each devotion  contains a passage of Scripture, a brief discussion of the passage, and a prayer. I highly recommend this book and all of Cleere’s work!  It is so well done."
I saw this devotional in a store while on vacation in TN and thought it would be great for the New Year.  I got it and after reading the first two sections the writing was not making sense.  Maybe this is geared ore to teens.  I ended up returning it.
"This devotional is wonderful. I love starting my day with this book. The design of the book is beautiful, but even more so are the words inside. Every page is filled with truth, inspiration and love. You won’t regret getting this book!"
Great little devotional.  Well written and perfect for short devotions with big impact.
This author shares the joy of Christ in all of her work. I received this book for Christmas as a gift and then I bought it for seven of my friends.
I have this on nightstand in guest room
Bought as a gift for my sister...she loved it!
This was a gift for a dear friend. She loves it!
Absolutely love this!
"Not sure how I feel about the messages. I like that it is not dated so you can just flip open to where spirit draws your attention... they are very basic messages that we have probably already heard time and time again and each includes a bible passage. Its a good reflection to ignite journaling perhaps or inspire deeper thought. Have had it for a few weeks now and haven’t necessarily been as touched as others seem to have been. I feel it tries to combine real life and bible circumstances as most devotionals do, simply hasnt impacted me in a way I expected. It is however, a very “pretty” book with beautifully crafter colorful thick paper and fonts."
"Short, but meaningful daily devotionals - a beautiful to start or finish the day."
"I have always had a problem understanding Revelation, ever since I read the Bible for the first time, I have read it a lot of times by now in many different versions, from the King James through the NIV. And while the NIV and the English Standard are my preferred choices, nothing has helped me understand Revelation.  This book does!  First it covers ALL the prophecies that are in the bible, that refer to the Messiah and the end times.Then it breaks them down into how they relate to us today and they EXPLAIN what the mean!  Its very clear and covers everything about the Second Coming and the End Times.Now I understand!  And you will too!  This does not mean that I fully understand the bible, you have to continue to read to digest what you are reading. It's a never ending cycle, but I'm a better person (I think, because of it).  I highly recommend this book for people who read and study the bible."
"Every time I read something about the end times, I learn and understand more fully the prophesies.This is a step-by-step guide through Revelations, the tribulations and what is to come after the return of Christ.  Since it’s written for easy understanding, I was able to glean so much more from the verses.  The new heaven sounds truly amazing beyond all human imagination.  What a glorious future for those who embrace Christ as their savior!"
"I have studied many books about the End Times, usually with authors attempting to interpret prophecy in ways that may fit some belief.  This author defaults to the literal meaning and only deviates when the imagery is obviously something other than literal.  Many people try and try to find a way to include the USA in the End Times prophecy as mystery Babylon, etc.  it ain't there.  This scholar sticks with the literal."
"Almost through with this book. If you area an avid Bible reader, you may already possess a good working knowledge of the end times scriptures. And you know that they are scattered throughout the Bible. Rhodes has done an exemplary job of clearly pulling it all together and placing it in chronological order. The book is helpful and can clear up confusion between the timing of rapture, seals and bowls, antichrist arrival, and so on. Rhodes admits where there are controversies, and the book is well notated. Rhodes' writing is clear and succinct, a necessary aspect when the material comes from so many areas of the Bible. However, for the same reason it isn't just a simple read. You must still pay attention. I especially like that each chapter has its own contents list, each item being a link to that content in the chapter. This Kindle version is amazingly easy to use, something I wish I could say for all Kindle books."
This is an excellent book both for the new christian as well as the more mature believer. Ron highlights the major prophetic events in an easy to read and understand format. His writing style and content greatly assist the reader in avoiding much confusion relevant to Biblical prophesy that is so prevalent today. I highly recommend his book as it should be part of every believer's library.
"The Jews in the time of Jesus' earthly ministry were confused about what the purpose of the Messiah would be.  Most of them didn't understand that his first coming was as ""the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.""  Instead they focused on prophecies that described the second coming and millennial kingdom.Similarly, many believers today are confused by prophetic scripture concerning the events of the end times that will lead to the new heaven and new earth (eternity).I gave this book 5 stars because it sorts out past, present, and future events and helps us to understand which scriptures match the each time period.It also gives perspective to our current life on earth through the lens of eternity to be spent in the presence of God.Have you accepted or rejected God's gift of forgiveness through Jesus' shed blood on the cross? Where you will spend ETERNITY hangs in the balance.Say ""yes!"" to Jesus while the is still time."
I found this read to be most informative!! Simply in terms that's easy to understand and it makes one feel encouraged and reminded of what an awesome God we serve and the sacrifices Christ and the Holy Spirit has made. It be hooves ALL of us to prepare oneself for the second coming.
"The Jews created a new state in 1948.  The average life expectancy of a person born in 1948 is 84 years.  “Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place."" -Matthew 24:34.  Could this make the year 2032 significant?  It could mean a lot of people alive today will experience the Rapture or the Tribulation and I wanted to read something from a person with credentials to help me understand the signs of times.As other reviewers said before me this book lists the areas of the Bible where the information comes from.  By no means am I a Bible expert which is why I wanted a reliable educated source for such an important topic.  It's hard for me to know which parts of the Bible should be interpreted literally and when it comes to The Book of Revelation things are even more confusing.  While there are tons of websites with interpretations and inaccurate opinions of people that don't know what they're talking about, the author of this book seems to have a relevant interpretation that makes sense to me.  Jesus tells us no one but The Father knows when the End of Times is to come but this book helps me understand the Bible better than I could by myself.  I also like that the author of this book references greater hope in the Bible for Christians in the End of Days and the coming Tribulation period.  I'm glad I purchased this book and I'll be keeping it as long as I'm alive.  If you're like me you won't be disappointed in this book."
"This book attempts to take all of the end-time prophecy in the Bible and put it into a single, chronological narrative. But apparently they didn't read Matthew Chapter 24. For someone who hasn't read or studied end time prophecies at all, it is a good overview. But take the ""chronological"" as a ""wish"" not a guarantee."
"This is a great resource for the big picture of end time prophecy. I read this while studying the book of Daniel. It is a clear chronology of events. Especially helpful are the references from the other prophets, including the minor prophets. Also integrates references from the New Testament. The author is easy to read. A very enjoyable and informative book."
"Ron Rhodes does a good job of putting the chronology of the end times in order. There are, however, places where Biblical scholars disagree. Being fairly well versed in Scripture myself, I think that, from a ""bird's eye"" view, it is an interesting read. One thing for sure: Christ's return is closer today than when I first came to know Him. For the twice-born Christian, we are living in a combination of freighting and exciting times. We are seeing Scripture being fulfilled on a daily basis. Every religious and non-religious adult thinking person on the planet today knows we are experiencing perilous times.We should not be overly concerned with what exactly will happen, when, or how, but let us fearlessly understand that which IS happening now, and pray for strength and wisdom to know God, and to be centered in His will day by day.  Luke 21:28."
"This book is not negative.  Events are chronological and is quoted by scripture.  There are interpretations by so called well known people-But the author support scripture.  Very enlightening because you now will have a clear (with a bunch of opinions' and words) clearer understanding of the bible-cool-really cool.  Plus, you can reference and find the quotes as stated in the book with the bible and other references.  THANK YOU!  Finally someone has clarified in chrono order and scripture, especially without opinion and negativity.  eom"
"This was insightful, well - documented, argument that we are, indeed, in the beginning of The End. I appreciate the calm exposition rather than emotional cry that “the end times are here”.  His rational is clear, precise and he is not adamant about the exact presentation or timing of events. He allows - and - explains other differing opinions and points of view."
"This is the book to buy if you want to read the typical Hal Lindsey/Tim LaHaye-pretrib rapture fantasy theory of eschatology, rewarmed and dished up with nothing new to account for its publication. Frankly, I wish I would have left the book behind!"
This book is extremely beneficial to understanding the end times and chronology of events.  I have learned more from this book then any I have read in years.  I plan to read it again to fully grasp the end times and how events unfold.
"Finally, a summary of end-time events in chronological order! Dr. Ron Rhodes is a trusted author who tells you when he is giving his opinion and when there is something with more than one possible interpretation. He provides ample Scripture references and writes in an easy to understand style. I keep this book as a reference on my desktop! This is a must- have book for anybody who wants to know what will happen in the future according to the Bible."
From trembling to rejoicing This wonderful work has enhanced my understanding and has been a real help to motivate my efforts to see folks saved by the power of God's Spirit! The judgement lost people face is beyond any human understanding. Are you a soulwinner? This book will give  you real urgency that the end times are near and time is so very short!
"Author comes from a Pre-mil, Pre- Trib viewpoint, does a great job at laying out the end-times events. I don't agree with everything but I am sure not everyone would agree with me so it's all good. Definitely worth the read."
Ron Rhodes brings supporting citations from leading theologians and scholars. I enjoyed it very much. This work reminds me of all the wonderful things the Lord has in store for those who love His appearing.
"Excellent book. Would highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a clear, understandable, scripturally accurate account of the end times, broken down nicely to support the Book of Revelation, as a great reference guide, and a side by side companion for Bible Study. A must read without any gaps or confusion. Ron Rhodes is well versed in his Theological Studies."
"It totally met my expectations, was easy to follow.  The author gave good explanations and reasons for his educated beliefs. The ""timeline"" was well explained and I especially liked that he gave current names to countries mentioned in the Bible in the ""End Times.""  I recommend this book!"
"Wonderfully compiled and explained.  There were so many areas explained that even this Christian learned a lot.  Many unanswered questions were answered.  It proved to me how unworthy I am but for Gods Grace and salvation through the blood of Jesus.  Truly, the good news one needs to persevere in this crazy world of today."
"This book really breaks down the end times and makes what's happening in the world today more understandable from the point of view of a Christian. I read this daily and could not recommend a better book. I have tried other which only confused me but this breaks it down and takes you through the order of things. The author gives you not just one perspective or argument on scriptural prophecy, but many and dissects them as well. I would recommend this book to anyone seeking to know the truth of the end times."
So far the book is right on target and is in agreement with what the Bible teaches about the end times and the second coming of Jesus Christ. It's an eye opener because something are already happening right before our eyes. Excellent book!
I have always been drawn to the book of Revelations but never quite understood the events in the exact order the bible says they will occur in.  This book stays away from too many personal theories and sticks to scripture to give a detailed outline of what the bible says will happen and when.
"Very easy to read. Lots of scripture given to explain each phase of the last times. I've read Revelation several times, but keeping the events in order and what happens when? Was looking for a book that would help me through that and this book does it. The author is on staff at Dallas Tech Seminary which was important to me"
The over all picture generated is very thorough. Applying the Scriptures chronologically is critical to understanding their purposes in Gods professed plans. Ron Rhodes does a good job presenting with compare/contract so as yo discern them in sequence.
Written in a timely manner very appropriate for today. So much is going on that we don’t seem to understand or be able to explain but within these pages will gain better understanding of the world we live in and what lies ahead for those of us that belong to Christ.
I love Ron Rhodes easy to read prose while at the same time providing deeply researched and highly logical explanations of scripture. I especially enjoyed his detailed analysis of the phases of Armageddon.
Well researched an d explained so that even those not well versed in prophesy can grasp the future timeline and how God works for the good of all who accept His gift of salvation and a!so the future of those who don't.
"This book helps sort through the maze of symbolic stuff and boils things down to what's next,  without diluting scripture. I found it very calming during this chaotic time,  and highly recommend it to all who may be feeling anxious."
"What I like best about this book is that it’s been well researched and every claim the author makes is backed by Scripture. It’s also well written and an easy read. It sure got me flipping through my Bible a lot, which is always a good thing!"
"Im studying the Bible, and this book is one of the many I have purchased. I learned so much and so many things I don’t fully understand were made very clear. It’s very informative and gives Bible reference for everything.  I had a hard time putting this book down and I book marked pages so I can go back through it with my Bible. I am so happy to have this book."
"Clearly articulated and referenced in scripture.  Provides a solid  foundation for the Christian beliefs—guidebook into key aspects of the spiritual journey, past, present & future."
"I like this one by Rhodes because it answers questions about what the Bible says will happen, and when, during the end times. Rhodes gives a good timeline for prophecy and supports his beliefs with passages from Ezekial, Daniel, Jeremiah, Revelation, and many others. It's easy to read---chapters are short---less than 230 pages."
This is an excellent book on eschatology (end times) by a very knowledgeable author. Ron Rhodes writes a very compelling book.  Excellent read and study.
"This book is an overview that walks the reader through end times chronologically, without being dogmatic. The author graciously leaves room for differing opinions on interpretation.There are many references to Old Testament prophecies that parallel Revelation and many helpful quotes from other known and respected Bible scholars."
I chose to rate it highly because it is a very readable book on a difficult subject. I recommend it to all readers.
"The End Times in Chronological Order by Ron Rhodes is is so well written and easy to understand. I have learned so much and found so many golden nuggets answers to so many questions, that now I fell more confident to continue additional reading and research. This book will enhance reading and understanding of the book of Revelation and the entire bible. I feel confident enough to present what I have learned to the church members at church."
this author writes in a style that is so easy to understand. If you want to know more about the end times start here you wont be disappointed.
"This book really shares a ton of information on Bible Scriptures and prophecies. Translating the Bible can be challenging, but this book provides an in-depth examination of the Bible for you. Can't tell you how inspiring it is to have Scriptures and the Book of Revelations translated for Christians. I feel blessed to have read the book. I have shared the book with my wife and I plan on sharing the information within the book with my family. It's important for Christians to understand the Bible, but it's more important to share the Word. Great book! I highly recommend it to Christians and non-Christians alike."
I heard about this author's book on a radio station. I am really learning so much reading this book. It is an eye opener and really makes you think about what your doing in your life and how to be a better Christian so you are ready for the final return of God! So much information and as you read a lot of the things you read makes your jaw drop!  Seller shipped very promptly!!
We are doing this book as a group study. I find that it is well written and it’s not complicated to read. It is encouraging and gives hope :-)
Downloaded on my nook and decided I needed it in hard copy for easier reference. Great for any prophecy student.
"This is good if you believe in pre trib rapture! If not, this still might be informative!!"
Ron treats every reader with honor by how he communicates 'deep' and 'shallow' truths of prophesy. A subject that can be very intimidating for many.  Rhodes brings the scriptures alive and utilizes plenty of reminders for points and principles that may not have been caught or understood the first time read and I appreciated this because I am not 'the sharpest knife in the drawer' when wrestling with prophesy.
Amazing revalation. Thank you
"Well written, Biblically based and extremely informative. It’s rejuvenated my spirit. I highly recommend this book. I will be reading it again and really studying it along with the Bible. Be Blessed and seek Him who Loved us First."
Easy to read and comprehend. Only on page fourteen so far.topic of biblical end of time.
"Even though there are some terrible things about to happen, it is not without purpose and hope. Hope for the existing church today as well as those who will have to endure future events. I found the information in this book to be balanced, biblically accurate, and very well written. I would recommend it to family and friends!"
"Thank-you, AVAPRO, for a very positive buying experience. Book arrived in perfect (as described) condition and on-time."
I love to study bible prophecy and this book is laid out well so far and I've been wanting this type of chronilogical explaining these events in order
Easily understood and excellent description of the approaching End Times.
Easy to read and understand; written in laymen terms.I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting a better understanding of the end-times
"A great easy to read book on end time events. Explains the order of pre trib,in trib and post trib events. Easy to follow."
I was pleasantly surprised in reading this book. The author presented the end times in a very clear way. He walked through John’s Revelation account and referenced old and New Testament Scripture to validate all of what he was presenting.
"I have studied Bible prophecy, for many years. I have not understood many things. Mr Rhodes puts the Bible end time in order that makes sence!  It has been a blessing for me."
I just started reading through this book for the second time.  I will be using it for a small group Bible study.
I sent it as a gift to another person who had a different view on End Times events!!  I KNOW it made an impact!!
Absolutely the most accurate and complete compilation of the steps of prophecy that I have read. A constant companion and reference book as it is written in simple form with the purpose of presenting truth. Answered many technical or controversial topics without being argumentative but rather basing the evaluation on solid scriptural reference. Highly recommended.
This is the best book I have ever read on how the end times unfolds. Very easy to understand and backed up by scripture. I highly recommend this book.
A good overview of end time events from the Futurist view.
"This book describes the end time events in chronological order according to the Authors understanding of Revelations, The new testament and the other old testament prophecies. It is easy to follow and a good read if your interested in the subject.  It is relatively easy to read and understand."
This book explains the Bible timeline clearly.  Makes total sense.
This the best book I’ve found on end times study. Good reference material and well documented. I highly recommend this book!
"Will not purchase any more by this author, did not read all the way through."
"If you want to know how it all ends, read this book. Jesus is victorious!! Then pick up the Bible and start with the book of John."
Used to get a better understanding of the end times!
I was disappointed. It didn’t do what I expected.
READ IT FROM 1 ST CHAPTER TO THE LAST !!  EXCELLENT WRITING SKILLS WITHLIFE CHANGING INFO  !!
This book is laid out in a very easy to understand manner. Good to read while studying scripture of Revelation.
"A good, concise source for understanding what is coming in the order it will transpire. Time is short, now is the time to understand the times and tell someone about Jesus Christ. A good supplement as you read your Bible."
"Great book, scripturally correct."
Very informative. Quick delivery.
"Was looking for a book based on just actual scripture.  Great adherance, explanation and order. Well written, have recommended to others"
fast shipping and great shape
This is a must for everyone to read. This book is for people who believe in the Rapture.
Puts everything into perspective. Eliminates a lot of confusion associated with the original chronology.
I liked the chronological ordering of events prophesied for the last days and into eternity.  The author also explains why these events can be taken literally.
Helpful but wordy
Good product
Love the topic
The book arrived on time and in good condition. No problems. It’s heavy reading so only buy it if you’re serious.
"Great book, a must read !"
Well written commentary.
"This is a great tool to help study your Bible regarding end time prophecy.  The author starts the book with a thorough explanation on how to decipher scripture and then gives scriptural references for all points shared.  If an opinion is given, the author states that the information is based on his beliefs.  I would recommend this book to anyone who seriously wants to study end time prophecy."
"I LOVED this book.  I will read and re-read it. It will be a fabulous reference for discussion.  It is easy to understand.  I have actually been under the teaching of Arnold Fructenbaum, whom the author often sites as a resource.  I think this is an essential and exciting read.  Everyone interested in end times prophecy should get a copy.  The author presents his beliefs, supporting evidence and explains why other popular thoughts on subject won't work according to scripture.  Excellent writing style.  Absolutely riveting book!  Buy it today!"
Great book 👍😃
The mysteries of Revelations explained in everyday language.
Well-presented!
This is a great book for getting a panoramic view of Bible prophecy. It's a wonderful read.
"I knew a lot of what is in this book, but I did learn some things.  The first several chapters lay the foundation for the rest of the book.  I did like how he laid the future out in order of events.  Very readable."
Best book I've read on end times.  Ron Rhodes is such a good author.  Easy to read and understand.
"The only downside to this book is that it contains too many explanations (commentaries) of the various symbols and verses as it relates to the book of Revelation. It would have been preferable to learn or hear from one sensible body of knowledge, rather than being offered all of the alternative explanations out there."
It was a good product and it was cheap.
"Nicely done.  From a pre-trib POV.  Author makes some assumptions, but they are not too wild and unfounded usually.  Borrows a lot from Walvoord  (not a bad thing).  Laid out nicely, which is what I was hoping for in this book."
Liked the fact that Mr Rhodes presented other positions and then drew conclusions on the one he thinks is correct.I would recommend this book to everyone. Both believers and nonbeliever
Loved it
Great!!!!..
Straightforward read.  Biblical references provided for each prophetic event.  Alternative interpretations and timelines are addressed and refuted on the basis of scripture.Good summary of biblical prophecy with sound basis for interpretation.
Well written with plenty of research and references to check on the validity of the statements made. Very descriptive language in the interpretations! I very much recommend this book!
"Very enlightening regarding the End Times. This book really helped to put things in order for me. Sometimes studying about the end times is very hard to understand, but this book is very clear. If you are a student of End Times prophecy, this is a very valuable book to study."
"I've read a lot of books about the end times,but I consider this one of the best. It answered quite a few questions I had about end time events."
With so many Endtime books out its hard to find something new.Ron is also a very good writer and easy to read.
In these times. This is what every person should read and take to heart.
Time for all of us to wake-up and acknowledge what is happening around us and what's about to go down! Trustworthy reporting and attention to detail make this book a reliable source you can count on!
what I needed and wanted
Great Read concerning what has taken place in Bible History and Prophecy and what's ahead now and the very near future!
".Easy read, and a hugh help those of us that want to understand. Great big Thank you to Ron Rhodes."
"This book is a careful and thoughtful review of the books of Daniel and Revelation.  Dr. Rhodes systematically presents the prophecies given by God to Daniel and John.  Twenty-five years ago some of these prophecies would have been difficult to imagine.  Given current events in many parts of the Middle East it is logical and easy to understand what has come to pass and was predicted in ancient times.  There is a glut of books and postulation about end-times, and I was skeptical about yet another wild and fanciful rendition of personal opinion.  Having heard Dr. Rhodes interviewed on the radio a number of times, thought I would take a chance on this book.  What I appreciate besides the scholarly research and serious study is that there is no emotional thrill-seeking or attempting to bring the reader to accept personal opinion.  If, or when, there is some speculation he so notes that it  is just that.  I was not disappointed with this book and highly recommend it."
Interesting book. Easy to read and understand. Helps in the understanding of Revelation in an organized way.
I have read the bible several times but didn't understand the end times prophesies. This book gave me much to ponder.
"It's a pretty interesting book,he backs everything up with scripture. I am glad he gives scripture for pre trib. Makes the most sense. Besides I am taking the first tribulation out,those of u who believe in mid or post, I will wave to u as I am going out."
Rhodes puts a straight forward and logical order to one of the most confusing books in the Bible. A must read for anyone who wants to understand end-times prophesy.
Good for study in Bible prophecy.
This is the first book on Revelation I've read that really breaks it down and explains the order. After reading it I am looking forward even more to the return of Jesus.
"I've enjoyed this book very much. Rhodes' systematic ordering of Biblical Prophecy is well done and takes some of the disorder out of prophecy. Biblical prophecy has always been a puzzle to me but still fascinating to read about. Revelation and the seal judgments, the bowl judgments, etc., their timing and how it all plays into the final judgment are very well ordered, definitely worth reading."
"God is good,God is Love,God is patient,God is forgiving,God fore warns,God does rein,God is here.  Forever Amen, Thank you Jesus"
This book is filled with scripture and the writers knowledge of Revelations.  It helped in explaining what is symbolic and what is not.  Thank You Mr. Rhodes
"After reading this book, I chose it as the chief material for my Sunday school class.  Everyone loves it, especially how Dr. Rhodes gives good reasons for his interpretation of Biblical prophecy backed by abundant scriptural sources."
Helps me get things in order
"Excellent book on what Scripture describes about the end times...which are fast approaching.  Just read your newspaper and listen to your news cast.  Things are winding down for the soon second coming of this world's Savior, Jesus Christ."
DON RHODES IS A GOOD READ ABOUT THE END TIMES.
"I'm more than halfway finished with this book. It's great! I think Ron Rhodes' arguments are very well thought out. I don't agree with some of his theory so I recently purchased a Strong's Original Concordance to assist my studies. Still, a great read and an even better starting point for learning about end times."
"Okay, but I've read other books similar that held my interest more."
"Thought this would be just another ""end-times"" book, but tried it anyway. Very pleasantly surprised. Well written and in great order. Once started, hard to put down."
"Been looking for a book like this for about a decade and decided to look one more time as I decided to do a study on end times chronologically.  His book is great and easy to read. Very well put together.  If you ever had questions or want proof of end times information that is truthfull, get and read this book."
"It's an interesting book, but the author makes several unequivocal statements that are refutable through more thorough Biblical study. I wouldn't recommend the book to anyone who isn't already thoroughly grounded in end times prophecy."
I just finished this book. I have to say that it is well written and one of the best books about end time prophesy. I appreciate the authors style of joyfully presenting Revelation for the believers.
"This book is the most complete account of the End Times I have ever read. The author interprets, gives his view point and also the view points of other authors who study eschotology. The author backs up every point with numerous scriptures. It's a longer read but definitely worth it.  Some parts are a bit redundant, however the author appears to be over infacizing his view point in this instance. Would like to have seen a chronological map or scale of some kind. If you are a student of eschotology, this is the book for you. It leaves no questions unanswered!"
This so straight forward and easy to understand. Very happy.
very clear and easy to understand
This book is well researched and absolutely clear. I love the way he organizes the information.
Was trying to find something biblically based to understand more so about the end times.  This book was an easy read but a huge depth of research brought forth.  I will for sure be reading this again to grab more truths missed the first time around!
Backed up with scripture as well as the opinions of some renowned Bible scholars.  It helped to clarify the confusion between events mentioned in the OT and NT.
Terrific book on End Times prophecy.  Not too long but there's a lot to digest.  I plan on reading it a second time and taking notes as I go.
Loved it!
"Love it, love it, love it!I don’t agree with everything he says, but you’ll never agree with everything that everyone says. Still a great book!"
The book is very small and looked much bigger in the picture
One of my favorite books on prophecy!  Love the timeline in chronological order for my linear brain!  Bought as gift for our pastor.
"This book covers in detail the sequence of the end times, beginning with the rapture, then the tribulation followed by the Second Coming of Christ, and then the millennium.  It is supported with scripture references and other documentation.  I would recommend it to anyone."
Great outline and answered all my questions.
I connect with Ron Rhodes and dispensational thinking.
"This book makes sense of the many end times prophecies by ordering them chronologically, a really helpful guide to understanding the big picture."
Written in a way that is easy to understand. Awesome piece.
Very concise book & a good summary of prophecy.
Great product and service!
Ron Rhodes has done an amazing job of presenting the information in an easy to understand way. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand more about end times.
enjoyable read
Excellent and easy to understand.  This is one of the best books on the end times that I have read.
Excellent.  Easy to understand.
Very thorough
"Ron Rhodes has written a very easy to understand book which is very helpful in the study of end time events. Putting events in chronological order which pertain to God's plan for end time events is such a blessing in keeping track of so many events without getting lost in ""the tall grass."" I highly recommend this wonderful study. You will be blessed as you see God's timetable unfold and His offer to anyone who believes on His Son, alone, for eternal salvation. God always warns about impending judgment and offers His grace to anyone who trusts in Him, before He executes His wrath on unbelief. Thanks to Ron Rhodes for this book's high view of Scripture."
Easy read and factual.
"I haven't finished reading the book but Ron Rhodes certainly is knowledgeable and I can't wait to finish the book, then I will be more able to make a comment.  Thanks."
"Great product, fast delivery!"
This is good everyone needs this book. Especially with the way things are going today. Very good read.
Can’t get it to play on any of my CD players. ☹️
Fascinating read.
Good book
A perfectly well written book on very difficult times to come. His knowledge of scripture was surprising to me. He knows his scriptures. I actually cried when he explains our lives in heaven. Most awesome.
Outstanding
I truly believe this book gives accurate insight to what’s to come for us all. I like how the author continually references the Bible. This is a great guide for all Christians to help understand the end times.
"Very informative, a great selection for Bible study,"
outstanding based on the Bible whose prophecies have all been true to date no reason to think that the future prophecies are not going to happen.
Really a good read. Easy to understand and backs everything up with scripture.
"Very logical, well written book.  Easy to understand.  Our small group is reading it and we have very lively discussions."
"For most of my adult life I have enduring confusing and misguided musings regarding ""The End Times"". This book provided the most intelligent examination I have seen. It revealed a hopeful future for Christ followers and a healthy dose of warning to those who choose to resist God's generous offer of salvation through Jesus Christ."
Excellent book to explain the end times according to the Bible.  Better than others I tried
Very informative.  Easy to read and comprehend.  I now have a picture of what is to come. I would recommend this book to anyone  who wants an easy to understand view of the end times.
"Very interesting. Of course, no one really knows, but it was put together Biblically well"
Great book.
the book is written just as the cover says. I brushed up on my own understanding of end times.
Graphs and tables and context is easy to understand. Great to keep for reference!
Great reference
"Interesting and concise,m very helpful for my New Testament class at the university I teach."
The book is everything that I anticipated it to be.  Refers to Bible verses that one can look up & study further.God Bless & God Bless America.
This was bought as gift for a relative who had mentioned the book.  They have read partt of it and it has met their expectations.
Astounding book.  Clearly put clarification on the end of days
Great book!
Sometimes we would like to know how things are going to come about...now I know!  Are you ready for the End Times?
"Really fast shipping! great service, easy to follow end times prophecy based on the Scriptures."
"For anyone interested in the Book of Revelation, this bookTakes you through the chronology of events of the end timesand gives explanation and perspectiVe to God,s plan for all believers. Highly recommended!"
Good end times book.
Excellent book
My studies @ D.T.S.
Looking for soft back not kindle
"Such a great book, could hardly put it down!"
I have not had a chance to read it yet but like the author.  I will probably use in mainly for reference.
"Excellent Biblical reference for prophecy and end time events. This is well written and comprehensive, yet easy to understand."
I loved it
Great to do business with and very reliable.  Excellent book and very useful
Great book
"Haven't read all of it, but what I have I beginning to understand the tribulation & rapture."
It was exactly what I believed therefore I am so satisfied.
"To be intellectually honest, one must conclude the Bible and  prophecies contained therein are true beyond a reasonable doubt.  A great study tool."
"Excellent,,very well informed, just what I was looking for and a good read for myself and the NSA and anybody else !"
Chronologically a great book that is accurate.
A+
Received just as described in a timely manner
This book is a great eye opener to all God has written in His Book of Life. I will be there. Everyone should read this. I have read it twice and learned more the second time. Reading it the third time is coming up soon. Thank you Mr. Rhodes
I like the book very much
Ron Rhodes is one of the best. This is a much-needed addition to any collection of prophecy works.
"This book is very timely because it is clear from what is going on in the world, especially in the Middle East and Israel that Biblical Prophecy is being fulfilled about end times, not the endof the world but the end of ""This Present Era """
to read
Happy with my order would buy from this seller again.
EXCELLENT BOOK!!
Helped me put things in perspective.
"Lots of detail, and covers the subject."
This is a must read for anyone interested in End times Biblical prophecy. It is very clear and well organized.
This book gave very clear meaning to a subject that has been a bit confusing for me and many others. It describes the Word in very clear and very literal phrasing which only makes sense. All prophecy has come to be in a very literal way so it makes sense that the end times would be happening in a literal way. It gives perspective to a fascinating subject that concerns us all.
This book made understanding the true words of GOD as He gave them to those who were chosen to pen His words into the book of the Bible. This was my first reading but will not be my last. Old scripture has been identified in a new way. Many Blessings to those who read this book.
Perfect!  Answered many questions.
Anybody serious about their eschatology needs to read this book.
This book is very detailed about what is to be taken literally and figuratively and how the church today relates to the churches then.
Excellent book!  Ron Rhodes lays everything out perfectly and clearly.
A wonderful book in helping me to teach my SS class the right scriptural order of events.  Thank you.  In his service!
"Wow! If you ever had questions about ""when"" something in the end times is going to happen, this book informs you and backs it all up with Scripture. Loved it!"
I highly recommend this book as it is easy to understand and enjoyable.  The author is one of the better Bible teachers for today.
Well written and easy to understand.  I love that I can buy it and read in on my kindle.  :)
glad to have this book
I find as I read this book that it contains the most Bible references that support the author's interpretation of end time events.
Very Well Written and brought an insight to events that I had not pondered previously.
Certainly explains why things are the way they are now!
"So on the mark for Christians that are not at scholarly levels, the first time things made sense and out in a time order and in a way that was easy to follow and understand."
Well written.  Thought provoking.
Great study
"This book took prophecies from all over the Bible and made sense out of them. Also much other research was done, and many meaningful quotes were included from other Bible experts."
"Great book, highly recommended."
News applicable to all - a good read.
"Great book, just as the information said it would be."
Good solid Bible teaching. Clear and easy to understand. Takes a hard subject and makes it easy. Thanks. Good job.
Very detailed with Bible references.
"Good, insightful and informative."
"Very Informative and insightful reading material. Book was like new, very pleased with complete transaction"
great study of revelation
Great!
I was disappointed in the content. Not what I was expecting. Not as detailed as described. Good basic information for onenot informed on this subject.
I have just started exploring Revelation and am finding this book great for my study.  I can see things unfolding today.
A great read.
Wonderful
good study guide
well written
Great to see how the end times will unfold in the right order.  Thanks.
Help clear things up
Very helpful easy read
Great
Awesome book...
I would recommend this to any reader who wishes to increase their knowledge of Revelation and End Times.  It clarifies reading of Revelation.  It will remain on my book  shelf for further reference.
Good book.
Very clear and helpful to sort out End Times.
Easily understood.
This was a great book. I would recommend everyone reading it. It shipped in record time and was in great condition
I have yet to purchase any book by Ron Rhodes that was disappointing. He researches very well and this book on the End Times is a great study resource. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes prophecy and needs a clearer understanding.
Very well written.  Sound doctrine.
Great book.
"The chronology of future events is much easier to understand now, having read the book. Although I found a couple of places where my interpretation of events did not quite match the author's, I agreed with him most of the time. He also brought out things and perspectives I had not thought of. Easy to read, and the chapter divisions helped solidify and simplify my study."
Very good
ok
"This book is very well-written, clear, easy-to-follow, yet thoroughly bathed in God's Word. We have a marvelous future ahead of us--we need to know what it is! We also need to share Jesus with those who don't yet know Him so they can join God's family too!"
"a great help in understanding the chronology of end time events. thanks, dale"
This book cleared up many 'murky' areas of my thinking regarding end time events.  A must have reference.
Very good chronological information. Excellent teaching support.
Excellent! Mixing in real life people and facts. Cannot wait to read them next book!
The book is understandable to me and moves me to a more precise walk with Yeshua.
This just arrived today and I can't wait to read it. The contents have so many topics I've wanted to know about prophecy of the end times.
Great Book!  Very informative and from scripture.  It arrived on time and in good condition.  Could not put it down until I was finished with the whole book.Thank you.
Very well written and accurate.
I am pleased with this book.
Easy to read and a very informative way of educating the reader about Bible Prophecy.
"Hoooold up. I'll begin by saying that I am not necessarily well-versed in prophetic scripture, although I've always had a basic understanding of the major events that will constitute the end times. That being said, I've been questioning a lot of Ron Rhodes' authoritative tone throughout this book. He employs a lot of absolutes, which may inspire confidence in some, but for others such as myself, may lead to increased questioning.Well, the section covering the antichrist finally triggered me to leave a review on here to shed some light on the misleading discussion.He writes with complete confidence that ""the antichrist will NOT be a Muslim"". That's dangerous to say, given the extreme relevancy of radical Islam in today's world.Please, readers, understand this: The Quran teaches that, in the end times, the ""messiah"" will come in the form of a man, tagged the 'Final Mahdi'. According to the texts, this man will reveal himself to be god, perform many wonders to awe-struck people, establish a new world order, wherein Islam will be the only accepted religion and all who refuse to worship him will be executed.. Yes, to establish a dominating caliphate and to enforce Sharia law on a global scale. Sound familiar? This is a DIRECT parallel to the description of the antichrist as stated in the Bible. So it wouldn't be far off to say that Islam's coming messiah, may be Christianity's antichrist! In fact, it seems more likely than not.The author is quick to dismiss the idea that Islam could actually be the one-world religion, as described in prophetic Biblical Scripture.. VERY misleading. Islam could very well be the oppressive religion that will come to be reigned by the antichrist, which will lead to the massive onslaught of Christians.I appreciate Ron's objective here, and the writing style makes for an easy read, but readers would do well, while reading, to actively distinguish between Biblical facts and subjective opinions. God bless!"
"I love this book with one exception. Mr. Rhoades uses another translation of the bible.I have read and memorized a lot of verses of the KJB and everytime I read the verses of whatever bible he uses it , it confuses me. The KJB says that GOD is not the aurthur of confusion. He says heaven and earth shall pass away but my word will always be with you, We need to understand that a good way for satan to destroy GOD's word is to create confusion by getting everyone to read different verions of the bible. I would highly recommend this book and will buy other books by him but I wish Mr. Rhoades would start using the KJB.  James Callahan"
"Already knew a lot information, but it was nice to see where everything fit exactly."
"easy read, lots of bible verses  on second reading love this book"
Clear and well written. Good overview. Stays true to a premillenal dispensational position which I agree is consistent with the full counsel of the scripture.
This book is a chronological outline of End Times prophecy as described in the Bible. Though it does not go into as much detail as I would have liked in certain subjects it is a very comprehensive description of the End Times.
This book answered many of my questions regarding 'The End of Time'.
OK
Ron Rhodes does an excellent job organizing the eschatological events that we are blessed to be allowed to witness today.  Highly recommend it.
excellant book--explains everytrhing very clearly so you can understand it. i'm reading it for the second time.
I highly recommend this book on End Time Prophecy. Get yourself ready and know  the signs that are coming soon!!
Great Bible study reference. It reminds me that God is sovereign and is working all things for our good and His glory!
It was well written and biblically sound.  It was worth the purchase.
"Great book, easy to understand."
"Looks like an informative reference book, thanks!"
The book was fairly well-written with scriptural back-up for what he was attempting to prove.  Some of his interpretations of Scripture were questionable.
Very interesting reading. Augments his other books. Seen Dr. Rhodes on TV on numerous shows. Very knowledgeable and very informative.
Well organized....straight forward information.
Enjoying it.
Great book.
There are many theological positions that are foundational for the interpretation of Biblical end time events.  This is a helpful insightful tool for anyone wanting to fit the pieces together in a reasonable and Biblical way.
I read this book at the time I was reading Revelation by John Walvord.  Together the books make good teaching materiAL
Great if you enjoy textbooks Good information though
Very thorough study of the Book of Revelation.  You can tell that MR Rhodes had carefully researched all his scripture references.
This book is very informative; backed up with scriptures from the Bible all the way through. Any person who reads will know where we stand in the time frame of Jesus' coming.
"Although disagreeing with the idea ofPre-tribulation rapture, this book is very well written & goes deep into end-time information that everyone should be aware of."
Very clearly laid out for laymen's understanding using scripture as it's foundation. Ron Rhodes is indeed a scholar.His position is correct from all my years of studying prophesy.
Highly recommended.  I am not new at studying the scriptures but this book set me straight on several issues.  The serious student of end times prophecy shouldn't be without it.
"Ron Rhodes makes correlations between what is currently going on in our world, and what the Bible predicted for the end times.  Interesting to make the connections............"
Excellent book it's exciting to be in the end times Ron Rhodes is a good trusted author
Get one for yourself and another for your family!
"This book is good so far, as I have not had the time to finished it as quickly as I did with Harbinger, but will soon get to finish it, it is good, for what I have read. Thanks"
"Would recommend this book very highly ,a must read if you are in to bible profursiWitch is here now."
Excellent
Ron Rhoades is a great writer. This book is easy to understand and anyone can read this book and understand it. Ron is one of my favorite authors.
It is another great resource when you are studying Bible prophesy.  It is great that it gives end time prophesy in chronological order.
Really enjoyed this book and would suggest you read it. Good references to the Bible verses and rather unbiased in nature.
I would recommend this book to any Christian that would like to know what's coming it can give you hope also any non-Christian should read it hopefully they will be aware of that point that they need God so they don't suffer forever
"good for beginners, Not theological and exegetical as I like"
Ron Rhodes is one of my favorite Christian authors and this book doesn't disappoint.  A very easy to read and follow preview of the things to come spoken of in scripture.
This book was very helpful and gives clear explanations that helps to get a grasp of the prophesies of the end times.
recieved book quickly and in very good shape.  Seems interesting but did not finish it yet.  Finally a book that gives the chronological order!
"THIS BOOK IS VERY INFORMATIVE AND VERY WELL RESEARCHED, AND WELL WRITTEN. I SURELY WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ALL."
"Easy to follow and logical. A critical read given today's political and theological climate. Regardless of where one resides, speak the word in love and humility. The author simply states facts an allows the reader to decide without falling to personal  attacks."
The book is excellent in explaining the progression of events within Revelation. I found the book very easy to understand and a good resource to go  back through again when studying Revelation.
I enjoyed this book.
I love the layout of this book.  Have read several end times books but I love hoe this has it in chronological order  Made more scense
Very thorough. Had some interesting points that I had not heard .Would recomend to anyone who loves to study end time events.
"This book was so easy to read and understand. I would recommend it to anyone, in fact I bought a paperback copy for my brother-in-law. Could not stop reading it."
Did not find in library
Love Ron Rhodes!

This book has already been a great help to me in my study of the end times. It arrived in good time and in  good order. Nigel.
Best book I've read on Bible prophesy.  Good references to Bible scriptures.  Easy to understand and very well written.  Many new discoveries and is the most current I have read.  Easy to order from Amazon.
This book will really help you understand the book of Revelation. It puts places and time in perspective.  I highly recommend this book for everyone to read.
Super easy to read and very informative.  Would recommend it to anyone.  Gives other perspectives but explains why he believes his understanding of Scripture
VERY PLEASED WITH CONDITION OF PRODUCE!
A must read
very helpful
"Ron writes simply and clearly about the End Times events, so that even those of us without any Theological Degrees can understand. I found this book to be very helpful, as I taught others in Prophecy Bible Studies."
Very useful in my attempts to better understand difficult passages in a hard to understand Book of the Bible.
enjoted
Raises interesting ideas. A good read.
Excellent
"only one chapter in, but i enjoy this book. seems to be written by a really level headed author, who proposes his arguments logically"
ANY DAY NOW THE RAPTURE WILL TAKE PLACE!  FOLLOWING WILL BE THE END TIMES----BE PREPARED AS WELL ASYOUR LOVED ONES.....
Good book
My Kindle version of this book is missing pages in every chapter!
Good read.
We have used the book during our lunch time gatherings for reading and discussion.  It is an excellent book discussing the end times..
Well writte and laid out very well.A great reference; a cosistant reviw will help one to keepthe events in mind.
Difficult to follow and it doesn't seem to leave me with the feeling that I a better grasp of the chronological order than I had before I read the book. It is an honorable book but it did not scratch my back..
"The information is fairly good but the writing is not. The books deals with some of the most controversial, explosive parts of scripture in as boring a fashion as possible."
"I haven't finished reading the book yet, but so far I like it very much.  I would recommend it to a friend."
ok
item as described.
"It did cover a lot of the information, but I've read many other books that really was in order with the bible. This one not so much."
"This is an only ok book. Better out there. Here’s my main problem. The author lists piles of scripture reference. And only actually reads some. I find this extremely annoying and lazy. I would have much rather the author actually took the time and give the scripture, not just merely the reference. This only works if you have the entire Bible memorized. I find myself trying to keep stopping to go look up the scripture. He does this way to much. It actually hinders the book. Please go back and actually mention every single scripture. This has just become rather annoying and an obstacle."
"I'm so disappointed, the bold type displayed here in the ""sample pages"" is not true to what you actually receive.  The print is so light in the copy I received as to be almost unreadable and am considering returning."
"I found the title to be the most challenging part of the book. As I read Revelation and Matthew 24, they seem to align chronologically. Despite Rhodes’ book title, he not only rearranges John’s timeline (clearly marked by “After this / After these things” nine times), but distorts the message into a thrilling narrative with many conjectures and (I believe) misinterpretations.Dr. Rhodes also spends five pages explaining why it is wisdom to take “a literal approach to interpreting Scripture.” His reasoning for this approach is sound, but in practice he falls victim to defending his personal beliefs as being what Revelation 'really means.'"
Well written and referenced..... .. ... .... .. .... .... ...... ..... .... ... ...... ....... .... ... .... ....
"This was a very encouraging and excellent walk through Revelation and related end time prophecies.  The author grabs your attention and holds it through out, while deftly illuminating the scriptures and leading you along the general timeline of events."
This is more of a TEXT book material.  Could not understand most of it.
"Do you believe we are living in the last days? Do you believe that the rapture of the church will be happening in this lifetime? What about what is happening in the Middle East in regards to the threats against Israel by her enemies and threats to ""wipe it off the face of the Earth?""If you've never taken the time to read the Bible and gain some understanding of where we are at in regards to the fulfilling of Bible Prophecy, now is the time! I've gained some study in the past in the book of Relevation and in understand the symbolism found there but I had the opportunity to review, The End Times in Chronological Order by Ron Rhodes and found this to be an amazing study to work through. In fact, I got my husband involved and we literally dove into the Bible through this book working through not only the book of Revelation in the Bible, but the four Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, but also 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 Peter, Romans, Daniel and Ezekiel just to name a few.This book charts everything from how to understand the symbolism found in different books in the Bible, understanding context clues, figurative language and which passages to take literally. Ron does an exceptional job at showing us the history between the Old and New Testament passages including bringing Israel back into statehood in 1948 and the continual migration back of the Jews has been increasing at an alarming rate since then.He outlines what should be happening next according to the Bible which should be the rapture of the church before the attack and fulfillment of Bible prophecy regarding the deadly attack on Israel from the countries surrounding her, including Russia, Iran, Turkey, Libya, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Algeria, Tunisia, Armenia, from the Book of Ezekiel 38;  rise of power of the antichrist, the signing of the peace treaty of Israel, the coming tribulation and judgement against the unbelievers and the second coming of Christ.It is chilling to see the current state of the United States and why it seems to be missing from the end times prophecies. Is it because the United States comprises most of the world's population of Christians (believers in Jesus Christ) that if we should all vanish in the rapture of the church, this would cause the once powerful country of the world to give up her super power status in the eyes of the world?For those of you that LOVE Bible prophecy and end times Bible Study's, then this is a MUST read for you. I received this book compliments of Harvest House Publishers and Net Galley for my honest review and am so glad I got this one. I've been spending more time in my Bible now than ever before and LOVE that I was able to follow the logic in this book so seamlessly. Without a doubt, hands down a 5 out of 5 stars! I'll be reading this one again and again as I continue to learn more about where we are headed and for me, I truly believe we are in the last days unless this country comes to a deep understanding and give up her complacent ways in regards to God's Word to how we should be living our lives."
"""A Complete Overview to Understanding Bible Prophecy""""Bible prophecy expert Ron Rhodes offers an easy-to-understand yet detailed chronology and explanation of end-times events.The chapters are arranged around the major end-times themes: the rapture, the tribulation, the millennial kingdom, and the eternal state. Each chapter begins with a list of the specific events it covers, making this an extremely user-friendly chronological guide to end-times biblical prophecy.Rhodes allows for various interpretations among Christians. Yet the sequence he describes is faithful to the biblical text, based on a literal approach to prophecy, and held by many Bible scholars.As readers discover that they really can understand Bible prophecy, they will come to love and trust the Scriptures like never before."" (From the Harvest House Publishers Website).About the Author: Ron Rhodes, president of Reasoning from the Scriptures Ministries, is heard regularly on nationwide radio and is the author of Unmasking the Antichrist, Cyber Meltdown, and The Topical Handbook of Bible Prophecy. He holds a ThM and ThD degrees from Dallas Theological Seminary and teaches there and at several other seminaries.My Thoughts About The Book:I readily admit I am fascinated about Biblical Prophecy and devote a portion of my time studying it. The good news is that I can tell you we know the end of the story. We may not know when certain events such as the Rapture of the Church, the beginning of the Tribulation, the rise of the Antichrist, or the 2nd Coming of Christ will take place but we do know for certain that they are going to occur in the future. For those of us who are Christians knowing that the Rapture is going to occur and that our glorious Lord and Savior Jesus Christ one day soon is going to return and establish his rule and reign over ""the new hearth"" is a great comfort.In his book Dr. Rhodes truly delivers what is promised on the cover and that is an easy to read and understand chronological order of prophetic events. Even though Dr. Rhodes may have 2 degrees and be highly educated he writes in such a manner as laymen and Bible scholar alike can learn and benefit from his book. And just for the record, I am definitely a layman - so easy to read and understand works really well for me.In Chapter 1 author Rhodes lays the foundation for the rest of his book by providing us with a brief introduction concerning Biblical Prophecy. Dr. Rhodes holds to a literal interpretation of the Scriptures and wants us to know that we not only can understand the Scriptures but that we can understand ""Prophetic Scripture.""In Chapter 2 we get an idea what the times are going to be like prior to the Tribulation, with details about how difficult the times are going to become, which is a good segue into Chapter 3 where Dr. Rhodes writes concerning what the Bible teaches about the ""Rapture."" And for the believer, even though, the times leading up to the Tribulation are perilous and filled with much heartache and sorrow the grand event that occurs before the Tribulation actually begins will be indescribably marvelous. Dr. Rhodes addresses the controversial issue of the Rapture sharing the different views that Christians hold concerning it with his belief being that ""Pretribulationism is the preferred view."" And remember this point regarding the Scriptures and Biblical Prophecy that there can only be one correct INTERPRETATION; however, there can be many different APPLICATIONS. And context, context, context is always what is critical to coming to a correct interpretation and understanding of the Word of God and Biblical Prophecy. And Dr. Rhodes ably provides us with the context so that we can come to the right Interpretation of the Scriptures concerning Biblical Prophecy.After writing about the ""Results of the Rapture, the Church being with Christ in Heaven, and the Invasion of Israel"" in Chapters 4-6 he then provides us with the details concerning the Tribulation- from its beginning with the ""Emergence of the Antichrist"" to its bitter and sorrow filled end - with there being sorrow and misery unlike this world has ever known. And Dr. Rhodes stays right on point not going off on so called rabbit trails or tangents but staying on track referring extensively to the Scriptures - both from the Old Testament Prophetical Books to the New Testament as he writes about the Tribulation from chapters 7 to 13. What a terrible time it will be. And reading what Dr. Rhodes shares from the Scriptures about the Tribulation and what is to happen after should drive us to our knees praying fervently and without ceasing for the lost.In Chapter 14 author Rhodes reveals what is going to happen after the Tribulation and before the Millennium - that there a ""75-day transitional period"" separating them with a number of significant events transpiring. For example he writes that the ""image of the antichrist that had caused the abomination of desolation at the midpoint of the tribulation will be removed from the temple after 30 days."" He also reveals that ""Satan will be bound from this point till the very end of the Millennial Kingdom."" He also shares other events that will occur up to the point when the Millennial Kingdom is established - that is that period of time when ""Jesus will personally set up his Kingdom on earth."" In Chapter 16 author Rhodes informs us of what is to happen after the Millennial Reign of Christ concluding his book with Chapter 17 in which he addresses the issue of ""The Eternal State."" He is referring to that eternal state where ""Christ delivers the Kingdom to the Father,"" the heavens and the earth as we know them today will be destroyed and a New Heaven, a New Earth and the New Jerusalem will be established and the saints of God - the multitude of believers from all the ages will forever more be with the Lord and one another enjoying the perfection and majesty of God and his son Jesus Christ as well as the perfection of our eternal dwelling place. And if the thought of that doesn't make you want to shout a Halleluiah then nothing can or will. If you are interested in learning about Bible Prophecy - maybe you don't understand it or you are worried about what is going to happen and the things that are soon to take place, this book is a must read for you. Through reading the book with your Bible and heart open God will open your eyes to glorious Biblical Prophetical truths as well as to the glory of his Word and His person causing you to want to know him better, love him more and worship him both now and forever.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Harvest House Publishers for reviewing it.

"n where in the  description  do i see where it GIVES THE  PRINT SIZE, CONCERNES ME . I AM PLANNING ON ORDERING THE BOOK SO CAN'T GIVE ANY REVIEWS ON IT, SOUNDS GOOD THO.  DESZCRIPTION IF LACKING FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SIGHT PROBLEMS"
I could not put this book down!  If you have any interest or questions about the end times and prophecy's surrounding it you must read this book!  As the author states there is going to be disagreement about how to interpret certain verses.  The ways scholars interpret scripture are all explained in detail at the beginning of the book.As you read through the timetable presented here be sure to look up the verses mentioned.  Not a lot of verses are written out but there are ample amounts of references that the author refers the reader to.  I did not look up each one but did look up most and found it really helped me grasp what was being presented.I think reading this book will make you excited about what is to come and make you want to read even more of the Bible for yourself.  I learned much from this book and will be keeping it on my bookshelf for reference.  I gave this book 5/5 stars because it met all my expectations and I learned from all the information presented.I would like to thank NetGalley and the publisher for the copy of this book I enjoyed reading.  I gave an honest review based on my opinion of what I read.
"Chapter 10 is titled: ""The First Half of the Tribulation: Judgements, Martyrdom, and Apostasy""When a word such as ""Apostasy"" is a part of the title for a chapter you would think that some discourse would take place in the chapter discussing that portion of the title.  Judgements and martyrdom are discussed, but any discussion of Apostasy is totally absent for some reason.  If Dr. Rhodes reads his own book reviews, then maybe he can enlighten us in a comment as to why chapter 10 contains no discussion about the Apostasy.Dr. Rhodes does state in chapter 10 under the section ""Martyrdom Increases"" that ""there will be many conversions"" which is just the opposite of apostasy.  Which is it?  Many will be saved during the tribulation or many will fall away during the tribulation?In Matthew 24:10  Jesus said, ""At that time many will fall away and will betray one another and hate one another."" NASB  So, we will definitely have apostasy take place during the tribulation, but I have found no place that says many will be getting saved and coming to Jesus during the tribulation.  Why didn't Jesus tell us about the many that will be saved during the tribulation?When Dr. Rhodes stated ""there will be many conversions"", he referenced Revelation 7:9-10 which refers to a great multitude.  Verse 14 states: ""These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation"".  Since Dr. Rhodes believes and teaches a Pre-Tribulation Rapture he has to construe whether right or wrong that all those who came out of the tribulation were converted during the tribulation even though Jesus said many will fall away, not many will be getting saved. ""But the one who endures to the end, he will be saved.""  Matthew 24:13  Immediately followed by ""THIS GOSPEL of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come."" Matthew 24:14  Sixteen of eighteen online translations ([...]) use the word ""this"" which makes me think the word ""this"" is definitely germane to what Jesus just finished speaking.  But, those who preach pre-trib rapture teach you don't have to worry about enduring to the end because you are not going to be here.  To me, counting on that outcome is like an atheist counting on there not being a real God when his/her days down here are done.  Good luck with that! Pre-Tribulation Rapture is based on conjecture, speculation and a whole lot of convoluted reasoning not based on sound scripture.  Believe it at your own risk!  According to Corrie Ten Boom's 1974 letter (you can google: Corrie Ten Boom's 1974 letter) it is very dangerous to believe in pre-tribulation rapture and very harmful to teach it.  Now, Dr. Rhodes will tell you that Corrie was a fine Christian lady, but she is no theologian.  Which kind of reminds me of certain others referred to as unlearned men by the erudite Scribes and Pharisees of Jesus's day.  Jesus said, ""Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."" Matthew 10:28  Paul instructed us: ""Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm."" Ephesians 6:13  But, those who are getting raptured out of here before the tribulation, I guess you can disregard those two scriptures because you won't be needing them, right?And Jesus answered and said to them, ""See to it that no one misleads you. ""For many will come in My name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will mislead many."" Matthew 24:4,5Corrie said in her 1974 letter, ""There are some among us teaching there will be no tribulation, that the Christians will be able to escape all this. These are the false teachers that Jesus was warning us to expect in the latter days.""""For this reason God will send upon them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false, in order that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth, but took pleasure in wickedness."" 2 Thessalonians 2:11,12If men of acclaim like Hal Lindsey, Tim LaHaye, David Jeremiah, John Hagee, Jimmy Swaggart, Mark HitchCock, and Ron Rhodes are preaching and teaching a lie concerning when the rapture will take place along with the peace and safety pre-tribulation rapture portends to provide is not a deluding influence, then I can't tell the difference between a bull and a heifer.Chapter 3 covers the Rapture and all 5 views: Pre-Tribulation,  Post-Tribulation,  Mid-Tribulation, the Partial Rapture view, and the Pre-Wrath View.  Mark Hitchcock who also believes in a Pre-Tribulation Rapture did a much better and more thorough job of covering the different views in his book: ""The End"".  Mark Hitchcock also said that the Pre-Trib and Post-Trib positions are the two dominant views. 

  
The End: A Complete Overview of Bible Prophecy and the End of Days









  
  
    
  When you read or hear reasons to believe in a pre-trib rapture, such as Imminency; Blessed Hope, etc.  ask yourself how much conjecture and speculation went into that conclusion as opposed to sound scriptural evidence.In Chapter 8 ""The Beginning of the Tribulation: The Temple and Signs of the End""  Under the section ""Moral Signs"" Dr. Rhodes draws a sobering parallel with Matthew 24:12,37-39 and America's current condition.  He makes it clear that the referenced passage pertains to the future tribulation period and not the deplorable signs already among us.  I wonder what men like Dr. Rhodes will say should the actual mark of the beast be implemented before they are raptured, ""This can't be it! Cause we're still here!""  hmmm.Now ""Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth."" 2 Timothy 2:15  And, may the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob bless all the serious truth seekers!"
This book dosent line up with the scriptures.
"Got this as a gift for my sister.  She loves it!  Makes it so much easier for her to understand this part of the Bible.  Thank you, Dr. Rhodes!"
After trying to read 3 of this mans books I have come to a conclusion  he cannot write !!
Ron Rhodes did an excellent job of explaining the End Times as written in the Bible. I would recommend this book to anyone.
This is an excellent book.  It is easy to read and yet packed with information.  I've read it several times and keep learning more.  Helpful and highly recommended.
This book helped me alot.  I dropped ship two (2) copies to pastors and both supported the text and both passed the book onto a friend.  I highly recommend this book to provide a logical and straight forward presentations of the facts.
Not too deep theologically. A good overview of evangelical prophecy.
"So much garbage, so much of it based on the false doctrine  of the rapture.  All through the Bible the wicked are removed not the good.  It also splits off the last week from the seventy weeks which is also incorrect.  A complete waste of my time and money."
"I am still reading this book, but so far I find it very interesting and informative. I have studied prophecy for years, and this book helps get it all together. I recommend it."
"Rhodes’ theology is seriously off.  He ignores the Lost Tribes of Israel.  The Bible makes it clear that while every Jew is an Israelite, not every Israelite is a Jew.When Solomon’s son, and successor, refused to lower the taxes that Solomon had imposed on Israel, certain of the Israelite tribes revolted and set up a separate kingdom.  The Tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and a portion of the Levites became the Kingdom of Judah and then became the Jews.  The remaining Tribes and the rest of the Levites became the northern Kingdom of Israel.The northern Kingdom was conquered by Assyria and its People were exiled.  Babylon later conquered Assyria and then conquered Judah and exiled the Jews.  But when Persia conquered Babylon, and Cyrus the Great told the exiles that they could return to their homeland, the Jews did while the rest of the Israelites did not.  Instead the non-Jewish Israelites dispersed around the world.Rhodes sees the reunification of Israel as solely a Jewish event.  But Ezekiel 37:16 clearly makes a distinction between Judah and the children of Israel- the Jewish and non-Jewish descendants of Jacob. And in verse 17 the two are joined together.Rhodes compounds his error when he places the Ezekiel 38 invasion of Israel after the Rapture.  But notice Ezekiel 38:10-14Thus saith the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass, that at the same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an evil thought: And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates, To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land. Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil? Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely, shalt thou not know it?Would a post-rapture world be peaceful?  In my view the Gog/Magog invasion of Israel is what triggers the Rapture.  I see the Rapture coinciding with the sealing of the 144,000 Israelites in the Book of Revelation.  The Israelite victory over Gog/Magog will make the non-Jewish Israelites realize that they are Israelites and will make the Jews return to the Lord.But what about Israel living in peace?  That can’t happen until Islam is neutralized.  The U.S.A. and British Commonwealth (Islam’s main targets after the Jews) do not now have the political will to conquer Islam.  But, something like ISIS may lead to the creation of a coalition of nations (which may be one of the beasts of Daniel Chapter 7) which will conquer Islam, and the Antichrist (if the Antichrist is a human and not a geo-economic-political system) may emerge from the leadership of this coalition.  But Rhodes ignores Islam; he makes little to no effort to apply his book's conclusions to the real world.  The reader is still left wondering how the world is going to end.This book may be good at identifying the things that must and will happen, but Rhodes does not put them in the correct order.  And he is too quick to declare that his interpretation (A Literal Approach Is Best; Pretribulationism Is the Preferred View) is the correct one.  If you do not already know about the different ways that prophecy can be interpreted Rhodes isn't a good place to start.On a technical note the book has inconsistent formatting.  On one page things will be listed with bullets while numbers are used elsewhere.  Some quotes are set apart with narrower margins (as proper formatting requires) while other quotes are just placed within the book's regular text.  Someone with doctorate-level education should have known better."
"Up to date resource on Pre-Mil, Pre-Trib, Dispensational prophecy.  Time gap between Rapture and Tribulation is particularly unique."
Really kinda sucked in my humble opinion.
A great study. Ron Rhodes uses Scriptures to make clear what is sometimes ambiguous.
Everyone should read this!!
Great book to read!
wasn't what I expected
"Good book , good theology"
love
"Sorry Ron but no cigar for you.  Shame on you for using CORRUPT versions of the bible to make your case.  I suggest that you rework your chronology after reading ""Revising God's Words"".  You will discover that the Authorized Version of the King James Bible is the only biblical source you need.  Your flitting around among the three most corrupt versions on planet earth demonstrates that even you cannot rely on one version.I also suggest that you rethink your timing conclusions concerning Daniel 9:27.  Reading ""Daniel's 70th Week"" would be a good start.  You also have a blatant contradiction concerning the identity of the ""restrainer"".  You can iron out that contradiction with a KJV where you will learn the distinct difference between the ""day of Christ"" and the ""day of the Lord"".Finally, you have a very serious problem with ""right division"".  For example, you MIX Christ's earthly ministry to the JEWS with the apostle Paul's epistles to the CHRISTIANS.  This has caused you to encounter numerous contradictions that you can't explain.  Likewise, you MIX the book of Revelation which is written to JEWS and GENTILES with the apostle Paul's epistles to CHRISTIANS.On a positive note, you correctly portray the rapture as pre-tribulational.  Unfortunately, it is not PREWEEK as you claim but MIDWEEK as the scriptures teach.  The rapture occurs in the MIDST of Daniel's 70th week when the 7th king is killed.  He is the ""restrainer"" who prevents the revelation of the 8th king, Satan Incarnate.  The 2nd beast (i.e. the False Prophet) then sets up the image (i.e. the Abomination of Desolation) of the 1st beast (i.e. 8th king) and the ""Day of the Lord"" begins (see Zechariah 14:1-2)."
Ron is one of my favorite authors.  Very good Read!
Very detailed. And I think accurate.
This is the best book on end times prophecy that I've read.  This book makes a complicated subject much easier to understand!  Excellent book!!!!
"The entire premise of this book hinges on a fundamental misunderstanding of the word prophecy. Prophecy in scripture does not mean--was never intended to mean--stories about the future told in the past. Prophecy in the Old and New Testaments means speaking God's truth to its contemporary audience. It does not mean stories that only apply to events 1,800 years later which would be completely meaningless to their original audience. The Bible is not the Farmer's Almanac.The amount of exegetical work needed for the author to imply that a given passage means such and such awful event will occur on so and so date is significant. However, if you were to ask the author to apply that same amount of interpretation to say, the creation story in Genesis, he would likely say that the creation happened exactly as depicted. It took six days, the end. We could suggest that the author examine Romans 16:1 and consider what it says about ordaining women. He would likely say women can't be ordained, the end. In other words, the author insists that a great deal of interpretation be used on the topic of the end times, but none at all on other topics if they raise questions about his particular worldview."
"Anyone who believes in a futuristic interpretation of Daniel, Revelation and even the Olivet Discourse show a plain ignorance of apocalyptic literature. Plus a general ignorance of the recent history of futuristic predictions, especially since the 1970s. There's nothing new in this book that has not been predicted before in utter failure."
Answers and explains Revelation in an easy to understand format. I would recommend that everyone should read this book !!!
The context is truth and should be ready by everyone..we Al need to be ready for the upcoming. events. Please read
Great for Bible study
Excellent read and very enlightening.I have listened to Ron for several years now.He is an expert in bible prophecy and has appeared with Dr David Reagan on many occasions for Lamb and Lion ministries.
I do not agree that Israel is living in peace and security and in unwalled city’s without walls gates or fences
This is a book that appears to be well researched and is laid out in a fashion that the complexity of biblical wording is explained along with references to the relevant biblical passages.  It is a book that I will definately keep in my library as well as seeking out further books by the same author.
I really liked the way this book was laid.
A very comprehensive and uncomplicated book. Easy to both understand and read. Very interesting too from an historical and geographical point of view>
"Good read,"
An interesting read.  Aids understanding the order of events.  Easy to read and digest.  Will make a good text book too
A good account of the book of revelation
Excellent book to read
"Recommended reading which helps to understand what the world is heading for, as defined by the Bible.  It took time coming from Wordery because of brisk business but was worth waiting for.  It was exceptionally well priced."
a good addition to my library
Biblically sound- a good read for these 'End Times'.
Thanks
"I am reading this book alongside with the series ""Left Behind"" by Lahaye/Jenkins, and it has been, and  is invaluable for me to get a deeper understanding of The Book of Revelation and the Left Behind series.I like that the author presents opinions of other theological scholars, and draws his own conclusion and states that it is his opinion. I actually have several End Times books, but this one is by far the one I favor the most, because of the clear chronological order it is written in. What the title promises, it delivers.Highly recommend it if you have any q.'s about end times, because it is presented in a way not to fear the comings. Before I read this book, I did not grasp the immense Grace bestowed upon us by our Father, and was honestly a bit weary of the Judgement, but Ron Rhodes explains it where I realize the Lord honors each and every ones contributions according to their capabilities and their personal life story. Nothing to worry about, He loves us unconditionally. I have been told that and read that over and over again, but somehow that never penetrated ""my not good enough"" belief, but Ron Rhodes with his way of presenting the Word, has blasted through that belief, and now I look forward to all God has in store for us with His  Glorious Appearing."
"This book has left me with renewed peace. Although written a few years ago it carries great weight for our current situation. The book is riddled with scripture references and gives credit and incite into the other views regarding the end times. If you are not at peace, consider reading this. Finished reading Sept 17th 2021 as the passports roll out in Canada."
"Il libro si legge in scioltezza perchè è scritto in modo semplice ma accurato, quindi per chi come me non è madrelingua ma ha un inglese poco più che scolastico posso dire che non ho avuto problemi di comprensione. La tematica affrontata è quanto mai attuale e viene descritta esponendo le varie correnti di pensiero sicchè ognuno può farsi un'idea personale"
"An excellent book for an overview of the events of eschatology.Unashamedly written from a dispensational point of view and all the better for it.If you are unclear of the unfolding of forthcoming events, this is the book for you, if you already have a good understanding of the unfolding of forthcoming events, this is the book for you, either way it should be on your bookshelf.If you are of the opinion that we cannot know the lay out of prophecy I would suggest you study this book and prepare for the Holy Spirit to open your eyes to the truth of foretold events.Why is the last book of the Bible called Revelation? Because it is a revelation, an unveiling of future events. This things are not to be hidden but to be an encouragement to His people of the things which must shortly come to pass.God does not want us to be ignorant of the things He has written, Ron Rhodes is a gifted teacher whose work helps us in this matter.Rev 22:7Behold, I (Jesus) come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book. (Revelation)"
Very nice book ..i just started the interface of the bible and i m just impressed by the explanationz...Having this book no need to join bible course..
"I loved the book, explains it all.."
What a brilliant read. I have never understood the book of Revelation as well as this book by Ron Rhodes lays it out!
I wasn't very impressed by the book and felt it to be a little off in areas.Would not recommend.
Well written. Trusted author. I am not a replacement theology person. To that end those that are will be properly corrected to that wrong teaching. Buy this book.
"This book was easy to read.  It does a great job explaining what we will see in the near future and beyond, according to scripture."
Informative
"Very informative and a pretty easy read! I read it within a day or two, the author is very knowledgeable, I definitely recommend this book!"
This book takes the confusion out of the prophetic teachings of the Bible. It's an easy and understandable read for anyone.
A must read for every Christian as we are living in such an exciting time as foretold in the Bible
We can easily get mixed up about end times events. Ron Rhodes helps get it in order. You may not agree with it all due to your particular view but its worth reading. Jesus IS Coming!!
Very interesting and informative.  Now I know what's going to happen and also when it's going to happen.  Good stuff.
A clear concise easy to follow sequence of end time events.
An excellent study of end times prophecy all biblically sound. This is the sort of teaching that churches should be giving but is sadly lacking. This is a must read book for all Christians and good for non Christians too as a great witness. Would thoroughly recommend it.
Book came on time and was a really easy read. Would recomend this book to students at any degree of learning. Thanks
"This book is very well researched and offers a great insight into the last days.This book,  I believe is closer to the truth that any other book I have read, Brilliant."
"This is an excellent, well written and informative book. It's one that everybody should read and pay attention to. Encouraging for Christians and a warning for those who have not yet made the decision to follow Jesus!"
This book is so good that a Misionary I lent it to wanted to buy it from me to use iin her Bible Class!
"Thanks very much. Just what I expected and a good price too, David."
An excellent book revealing the future.
This was a real eye opener for me and puts things going on in the world into perspective. It also brings clarity into the end goal of the Christian walk and to know truly the good news of Gods ultimate redemption plan! I really really recommend this book !
Theology is wrong in several places but useful none the less.
Some snippets of this powerful tool!! Such a great little book with a wealth of great advice on how to apply the Word of God in your life. Every Believer should have one and share as gifts with their loved ones.
"it's a wonderful little book that fits nicely in your purse or large pocket ... its packed with words of love, faith, courage, strength, and belief...  it reminds that words spoken do have meaning...As when God created the heavens and earth he simply spoke the words and it was created.  I love this book.

  
God's Creative Power Gift Collection: God's Creative Power Will Work for You, God's Creative Power for Healing, God's Creative Power for Finances [BOX SET] (Leather Bound)"
"I purchased two of these little books as a gift in early 2018 for $10.00 and wow some one has really raised the price a lot now that Charles has died. I cannot afford to give these as gifts anymore, sorry.I was so amazed with this little book, It grows faith! And the verses which are for declaring really get things moving in the spirit realm. It is such a nice gift of inspiration and encouragement from scriptures and from the author, who has a great testimony. Beautiful little leather bound book has gold writing and gold edges with a book marker, Love it!"
I bought this for my daughter who has stage 4 breast cancer and is relying on God’s promises to get through the long fight. She had one but someone misplaced it when one of her caregivers was tidying her house for her. I also got one for myself. This was one of her must-have items she took with her for her recent 12 day hospital stay. If you want to have a good reference for quickly digging deep into the Bible to find promises to guide you through life’s ups and downs this is a great resource.
I was introduced to this book by a girlfriend that was in county jail.  She had me order it online and her mother mailed it to her.  About 2 years later I was in her shoes and her mother thought to bring it to me.  Since that time my whole existence is different.  I have preached The Power Of The Tongue to all with ears.The best part was when I started receiving back from my 20 year old daughter and her sharing testimony with me filled with the Holy Spirit.  That was such an amazing Blessing.  I have purchased this book 6 Xs and I'm sure to order more.  God Bless Charles Capps.  R.I.P.
"We are reading and confessing this book for over 6 years by now! This is truly great collection of Scripture, which you can use to hear the Word and fill your spirit with the power of His Spirit! Thank you, Lord!"
This is the best tool for meditating on Gods word. Its a declarative statement toolkit direct from the word. I give these are gifts all the time. This takes biblical principles and makes them easy to understand and implement. Its a great teaching tool and life giving tool because its full of the word. I have never given this to someone that did not implement the reading of it as a daily habit of their life. Glory to God!
"I found this book at just the right time in my ""inter-active miracle"" healing from pancreatic cancer.  If I had only one ""tool"" for keeping this miracle going, this book was it......I, of course, added an anti-cancer lifestyle including diet, sleep, etc.; however this book was my open door to God's Word that ""became flesh"" and brought out my healing.  I try to keep several in order to have one to give to people I minister to.  I once ""turned away"" all my pancreatic cancer symptoms by reading the passages in this book aloud 3 times a day for a week or so and had perfect scans and lab work two weeks later.  I read from it daily and it holds health within it."
This book is power packed with the Word of God. Capps simplifies the Gospel and provides biblically sound and strategic approaches on how Christians should trust God at his Word. The Word of God stands alone and Capps is anointed and used by God to instruct and correct the Body of Christ on how to stand on the promises of God. Life Changing! Even my 23 year old son have been blessed by this book and our home has never been the same. This little book is TNT for the Body of Christ!All I can say is Glory to God in the Highest for this collection!!! :)
I actually received my shoulder healing after confessing the material for a few days. I woke up one morning HEALED. GOD IS MY HEALER!!!
