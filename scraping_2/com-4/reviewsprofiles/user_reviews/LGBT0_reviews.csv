Review
"For a book with over 56,000 ratings and 9000+ reviews, I'd say my opinion counts for squat. However, my average rating reflects how this book made me feel.Parts were great, parts were boring, overall it was meh. After the forth or fifth? marriage, it was like Groundhog Day.For me to be invested in a story, I need to care about at least one of the main characters. That didn't happen in this instance."
I read a review of this book that said it  was an excellent summer read. I am half way thru and thinking about dumping it. Not very interesting. I guess the fact that the central characters are lesbians and the fictional writer is biracial it's enough to make it edgy and interesting for the author. Pure device. Better to read a bio of Elizabeth Taylor if you want to read about an interesting actress with a multitude of husbands. This book is plain dull.
"This was not what I was expecting.  The writing and storytelling was good and kept me reading to the end but turned out to be a preachy propaganda piece for a certain agenda.  If I had known that I would not have purchased the book.  If you are a conservative reader, pass this one up."
"Do NOT buy! This is Propaganda at Best! The media spews propaganda in the daily. I don't care for my leisure time of reading to have assaults on the ""white male"", and the Lord's name in vain as Printed. If I could put no stars, I would. What a shame and a disgrace. When you are reading a story, you wish to escape. There is no escape from liberal propaganda by the likes of Taylor Jenkins Reed. Do not waste your money."
"I read this at the recommendation of someone and I think that someone owes me a box of tissue.What to even say about this? I was at a loss for words when I finished reading this last night, and I'm still struggling.I don't want to recap the book because that has been done before already and I feel that it would be full of spoilers if I attempted to.The way the book was organized to take us on this journey was clever. It is alternately narrated by Monique, the reporter who has been appointed to write the biography of Evelyn (Herrera) Hugo, and Evelyn herself. Going back and forth between past and present while we move forward through time in the different era's of each of Evelyn's seven husbands. Tricky but creative. And it worked.This entire book had me feeling so angry and heartbroken. I kept thinking about how terrible it was that people had to do so much to maintain secrecy out of fear of ridicule (or worse). Then I had to remind myself that it is still that way today at times and in some places. I have been so fortunate that I have been able to live my truth with very little conflict or turmoil.I read a 1 star review for this saying  race and whatever was added to be titillating. I wish I could say that was funny considering the themes of this book. Clearly that person didn't understand  the message. But it just isn't funny,  it is sad. I appreciated the diversity. Half back/white narrator. Black boss. Cuban American title character. That isn't titillating, it is representative of the REAL WORLD.Ultimately this story is about the love of Evelyn Hugo's life and her desire to tell her truth once and for all. She experience so much pain and hardship through all phases of her life. It was difficult reading everything she goes through. But I felt that one thing lead to another authentically. I think her actions were based on her experiences. I didn't agree with some of them, but I could understand them.The ending was a surprise, for sure. The author did a great job of planting seeds throughout the book that kept you hooked to want to know what this was all about.Evelyn was full of sexuality and sex was a constant theme. I'm so impressed how the author wrote about it without ever being explicit.In the end, I was moved by the story. I shed many tears. I may not have liked Evelyn Hugo. I don't think we are really supposed to. But I definitely felt empathy and sadness. As well as a sense that I had read something wonderful."
"You know the saying about potato chips “bet you can’t eat just one!”? Well, don’t eat potato chips while reading this book. For starters potato chip grease gets on the pages, which is a pet peeve of mine. But, more importantly you will not be able to stop reading chapter after chapter and your stomach can’t handle all those chips. This can definitely be a one sitting book read.If you are looking for a book to start your summer off right: this here is your jam!As a teenager, Evelyn Hugo knew she wanted bigger and better things than Hell’s Kitchen. Her mom dreamed of Hollywood, and after her death Evelyn would do everything in her power to make her mom’s dream her own. She married her first husband to get her to Hollywood and the next six to keep her there.You only knew what she set up to tell you; only a few knew the real Evelyn. At the age of 79 she is ready to tell all and hires an unknown journalist, Monique Grant, to do the telling. Why now? Why Monique? And, what the public wants to know is out of the seven, who was the love of her life? Well that I will not tell you: you need to read the book!It was an addicting, brilliantly written story. Author Taylor Jenkins Reid reeled me in: hook, line and sinker. This is the first and certainly not the last book I will read by her."
"My God, this woman can write!It's all here: scandal, honesty,  brutal words, delicate words. Sentences that take your breath away.  Definitely not a beach read,  but a book with great depth."
"Taylor Jenkins Reid knocked this one out of the ball park and into the parking lot as far as I'm concerned!! What an amazing, excellent story of an even more exciting, extraordinary, vibrant, woman!!Evelyn was 14 when she made her way to Hollywood she knew what she wanted and she went after it with all she was worth. She had Grit! She also had Seven Husbands, and one daughter, and one Great Love!!You have to admire a lot about what a woman or women of Evelyns generation went through because they're the ones who were the trail blazers for the stars of today. The women who work in that industry now I hope they thank those women from that Golden Era.The one thing going into this book that did surprise me about Evelyn was how it revolves around her sexuality. I didn't expect this but it was done tastefully I have to say. There was nothing vulgar about how it was written about it, Reid was very tasteful.I experienced the full gamut of emotions with this story from joy, tears, frustration, sadness, anger. But its a piece of art in my opinion. Thanks Taylor Jenkins Reid for sharing your talent and heart and soul. I highly recommend this book to adults 21+"
"So I don't understand all the rave reviews - it's not even a fun beach read, just another gently left of center story with the correct Ivy League opinions where the lesbians are as attractive as in a Penthouse forum letter, the characters are white inside with beautiful Carmel colored coatings, and you can see the twist coming from M. Knight Shyamalan's porch."
"I read Daisy Jones before this one and absolutely loved that book, so expected to love Evelyn too.  Was very happy with the first part of this book... but felt that a bait and switch was pulled on me and all of a sudden was reading the author’s political beliefs put into fiction.  That was annoying.  I didn’t even feel like she painted the agenda she was pushing in a good light because the characters were unlikeable and the love story wasn’t believable.  I can’t see Evelyn sticking with her “one true love” in real life - this person was way too needy.2 stars because some parts were well written, the beginning was interesting, and the ending did somewhat redeem the book a little tiny bit.  But come on Taylor, you can do better than this :("
"I thought this would be a classic about inspiring, if not admirable people. I'm aware of how many men and women had to to hide behind fake marriages and major spin to continue their studio careers.This tale is a huge bore -- not one likeable character among the lot. Don't waste your time or money on this book no matter how the masses adored it.  The dialogue frankly sucked. The story all told is the big joke on the reader. Not even Liz Taylor could pull off or even try to be Evelyn.  Monique is a spineless sponge. Frankie is a greedy little media slut.Who's to like or care about? Not a one I guarantee to all discerning readers."
"Personally, I wouldn't have chosen this book to read but it was the May choice for my Book Club that I am in.From the beginning, it is clear that Evelyn wants her Biography to finally be written but she will only tell her story to one person...………..  Monique.  Monique is a writer for a magazine but nowhere near exclusive interview status for the famous Evelyn Hugo.  Why is Monique the one chosen?Parts of Evelyn's life is no secret to the world especially her seven husbands.  Evelyn decides to reveal to the world her entire story and what happened with each marriage.  She explains how she did things to divert her fans attention to other aspects of her life and how she made her way to the top.  She also explains extreme heartache she went through and covered things up from the media for the people she loved.  Now that anyone who could be hurt as a result are dead, she can finally tell the truth and Monique is just the person to do it.As I was reading the book, I can't help but wonder if it was encouraged by Elizabeth Taylor with her being married so many times.  However, once the reasoning is revealed, I am sure a lot of celebrities are guilty of marrying for the same reason she married a few of her husbands.  I am also sure things are thrown at the tabloids to distract us from what is really going on.  I am not one to believe any of it but I do hold a magazine at the register while waiting in line. I will admit to that.There are a lot of characters to remember in the book.  At times it did drag a little but overall I enjoyed it."
"Unfortunately a great amount of readers were focused only on the sexual preferences of the characters rather than on understanding the entire context of the story. I read this book in one day and I couldn’t put it down from the moment I started reading it. I know the story might be scandalous for some conservative readers but hey, it’s 2021! What were you expecting from a contemporary novel that’s titled “the seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo”? The story begins in the 1950’s when a lot of social, sexual and human situations where the cause for discrimination, abuse and also a cause of shame for some of those who lived in that era. It could have been the secret life of  grandparents, o parents, aunts, uncles, godmother, godfather  or  neighbors, anyone!  . The  worst/saddest part  is that 70 years later there’s still people out there hiding their true selves and living a fake life just to protect themselves and their loved ones...Anyway, this is my first book from this author and I will be getting more from her. I like her style and loved the entire story from beginning to end."
Started off ok but the storyline was just ridiculous. Thinly disguised romance novel. No thank you. Won’t be reading this author again.
"The golden age of Hollywood is such rich source material and there were so many important topics raised, domestic abuse, family neglect, LGBT issues and sexism but sadly this book glossed over all of them, skimming rather than providing any depth - which is lazy writing. I didn't feel emotionally invested in any of the characters and the switching of characters perspectives was unnecessary and jarring. Could have been so good - unfortunately fell flat like a deflated party balloon..."
"I did not know this author or her past work, but based on reviews I was expecting something different. It is basically a Harelquin Romance.  Not that there is anything wrong with that, just not what I was expecting."
This book was extremely disappointing. It was either written for young readers ( albeit sexually knowledgable ones) or romance readers. Not for me!!
"These are my two take away thoughts from Seven Husbands. I think I was supposed to be moved and transfixed on the love affair Evelyn & Celia had to hide bc of the era in which the book takes place. *SPOILER ALERT* She is a bisexual movie star, Celia is a successful closeted lesbian movie star. Who cares? I mean, if Evelyn had been played as a lesbian, having to hide her sexuality--okay, slightly more meaningful. But it's pounded into the reader that she's bisexual. I'm less interested. Evelyn is also a screaming cliche. She's a composite of countless 1940-50's stars (pick one), who manages to convince 7 (see the title) men of varying sexual orientation to marry her. I get it. It's a peek into the lives of what celebrities had to endure. It was, in fact, the price of fame. Still, I had trouble mustering sympathy. Evelyn coerced and contrived so many situations, ruined countless lives, for what--to keep her career afloat? Why did Evelyn's men have to pay the price too? Evelyn, by her own account, was no picnic. If she was that in love with Celia and vise versa, the two should have taken off for greener pastures and a life of anonymity. Regardless, Evelyn put her career first. It was the late 50s. Was I supposed to believe she was going to come forward and declare her love for Celia? Right away. That's taken a generation and is still an obstacle for mainstream Hollywood. Also absent was the pull of a meaningful subplot. We wade through the book waiting to discover ingenue Monique's connection. It's another, ""Who cares?"" when we learn her father (blamed for his own death while driving drunk) was really the lover of one of Evelyn's ex's. Say what? I barely recalled that Monique had a father--how or why Evelyn thinks revealing his sexuality and betrayal of her mother, at this late date, will somehow be a gift, was lost on me. Monique's character plays such a small present-day role, and is never established to the point where the reader empathizes or cares. Three stars as the writing was quite good. But if there's a larger than life message here, it's only that Evelyn Hugo looks great in emerald green."
"5 stars!“I want them to know the real story. The real me.”“All right. Show me the real you, then. And I’ll make sure the world understands.”Evelyn Hugo is an iconic aging actress, famous for her work in the movie industry but also famous for having been married seven times to seven men. Monique Grant is a writer for a magazine, but has been in a bit of a career rut as of lately. On top of that she’s getting divorced, so she jumps on the opportunity to interview the famous Evelyn Hugo. When she meets Evelyn, she discovers Evelyn wants more than a simple article, she wants to tell her life story to Monique for a biography. And Monique is getting the story exclusively.“I’ve spent a very long time learning how to spin the truth. It’s hard to undo that wiring.”I absolutely loved this story! Taylor Jenkins Reid has this uncanny ability to suck you into the lives of her characters and never let you go. They feel so utterly genuine, I felt as if I was a part of their lives instead of an outsider reading about them. Reid also does an amazing job developing her characters, I was rooting for all of them to get what they want and to achieve their goals.I never really know what to expect when I dive into a book by Reid, but I can honestly say this book was full of surprises and twists I didn’t see coming. This book spans from the 1950’s to the present day, and we get to know all of the loves of Evelyn’s life. Evelyn herself was enchanting, I found myself fascinated by her life story, her choices and her perseverance. While love was a motivating factor, to me this was mostly a story about success and survival. Evelyn was always going to do what it takes to be a star and stay at the top, and she would fight for what she wanted.Hollywood and the film industry can be a ruthless place but it can also be one where greatness can be achieved for the lucky ones. I think Reid captured the industry and the time periods this story took place in perfectly.This is one of the best books I’ve read all year and I think if you go into it with an open mind and a kind heart, you’ll fall in love with this book like I did.“If you love someone enough, you should be able to overcome anything.”"
"Even when I was a teenager, movie magazines were not part of my reading material. If not for some reason I am yet to learn at my forthcoming book club meeting, this was the chosen section for September, I would not have selected on my own, to have read this book. It was, in my opinion,a poorly written and  predictable story about people about whom I could care less."
"I had high hopes for this book. It was highly rated, which is something I look for when seeking out a book. But it was a disappointment. The author skimmed over a character and then went on to the next. It didn’t grab me and keep my attention. I never felt connected to any character. It was easy to put this book down. I slugged through it and just finished it. Glad it’s done and I can move on.The book’s back cover overview is misleading as well. Had I known the woven storyline of this book, I would have likely saved myself time and money by choosing not to buy it."
"I had no idea it was a gay love story.  It started out so well, had promise, and then lost me around 1/3rd into it.  Disappointed."
"Sad and disappointing to the end. I heard such great things about Reid and this book, and I'm left wondering where the rest of this book wound up. As a book exploring a woman's sexuality, its not very sexy. As a book about a longtime actress, it spends a lot of time talking, not showing real life for an actress. As a book about a woman with seven husbands, the chapter titles as punchline ruins the point of the chapter about the husband... if you're just going to reduce the character to a punchline, you don't need them in your book. Was this book supposed to be about Evelyn? An annoying conceit in the book were the tabloid excerpts. It really took me out of the rhythm of the story just as it was starting to build some energy. As a book about a murder mystery, it very easily glossed that over without a second thought. I wish the author had put all of the focus on trying to survive life in the closet for decades for these characters instead of adding six more plot points to flesh out the book. I think a huge opportunity was missed just unpacking the harrowing journey so very many LGBTQIA+ people have experienced, especially what life was like for so many men living and dying during Reagan's tenure of denial. Even Stonewall was glossed over, and Harvey Milk's life and death wasn't even mentioned. I had hoped that there would be more than a mention of these high profile events in the LGBTQIA+ community because they have led to some progress over the years. There was no mention of why Celia told Evelyn she could lose her daughter in the 90s, which I think was a very important point to mention if you're writing about life in the community. If an author is bridging a gap, they should certainly pay tribute to the people who lost their loves and their lives fighting for rights today...but there was no mention. There are still people fighting against the LGBTQIA+ community and their right to exist RIGHT NOW, but that wasn't mentioned either. What a colossal disappointment.The truly sad thing about ""new"" fiction is that it feels so sloppy and disconnected, like a tweet thread instead of a story with heart and guts and real soul. I'm convinced that all one has to do to be a writer now is phone it in. The editors aren't tough, the publishers are desperate for content, and the story doesn't really matter cuz you'll get published anyway and most people read at a fifth grade level anyway."
"I’m just coming out and say it here and now – this book deserves ALL the stars. Not only because of Evelyn Hugo herself, but also because of the story, the plotting, and all the emotions it evoked in me. It’s with one word a MASTERPIECE!!!I don’t think it’s necessary for me to talk about the inner workings of this book. Just let me tell you, that Evelyn Hugo is one of the most intriguing and fascinating characters I’ve read this year.Strong, ruthless, beautiful, and loving. She deserved an Oscar for her performance.Her life was incredibly fascinating. And each husband brought her closer to her ultimate goal.I honestly didn’t know what the book was about when I picked it up. I had no idea where it was going, and that alone, this uniquely different portrait of a Hollywood bombshell, made this book so much more unforgettable.It was emotional, heart-breaking at times, touching, and never less than amazing.I know that I’ll be reading everything this author is releasing from here on out. I’m hooked. Two 5 star books in one year by the same author is all the proof I need.BRAVO!!!"
"There was nothing exciting or spectacular about this book! I read it because of the comments, & it seemed interesting. It wasnt........."
"Loved the premise, but poor execution.Reid tried to cover a multitude of incredibly complex topics throughout this book (abusive relationships, gender equality, LGBTQ rights, racial equality and being biracial, the ugly sides of fame and the film industry, divorce, raising a family in the spotlight, addiction, terminating illness, assisted suicide, and more) AND the seven different marriages of Evelyn Hugo. While all of these topics are very interesting and worth discussion, it was just too much to cover in a few hundred pages. Result was it ended up feeling very surface level and cliche. Never really got to know the characters in depth (besides Evelyn) and also didn’t particularly like any of the characters either."
"I do think this is a really good book BUT in spite of that I was torn between giving it 3 or 4 stars. I went with 4 in the end just because of how fantastic (in both literal and colloquial senses) Evelyn Hugo’s life story is. I read this in one sitting, literally taking it to the bathroom and to dinner as well. I think it has really important themes about women’s bodies as commodities and commoditizing yourself and personal branding and owning failures and mistakes and identifying regret, or most of all the different forms of love and how fragile they are. This novel also does a lot to expose the impact of the suppression and discrimination on LGBT experiences and I think it was handled in a very sensitive, empathetic way that even non-allies would find accessible and understand (not that that’s the author’s goal, I’m sure, but rather a side effect of her excellent writing). Because of the diversity of sexuality expressed in this book, one could say this is a book that celebrates diversity. However, where this book fell flat for me was in dealing with race. You can imagine that within the first few pages upon discovering a biracial (black and white) character with a black boss, I got excited by the opportunity for diversity to be presented. But in the end, minus some throw away comments, Monique (the biracial character who is the vehicle for Evelyn’s story) could have as well been a white woman. There were definite opportunities where her racial experience could have been discussed but all these opportunities were missed. By including ethnic characters in the story like Monique, her boss Frankie,  Evelyn’s first housekeeper Luisa from El Salvador, and her subsequent housekeeper, Grace, who is Asian, we are teased with the idea of diversity. All these characters play a role around Evelyn and in fact, there are opportunities for depth and identity to be explored but it’s like they are throwaways.I felt particularly let down by Monique as a character. I found her pretty insipid, uninteresting and unnecessary. Especially after the twist is revealed at the end, I felt like it would have been more useful to have learned more about her and added a few extra pages to make her a stronger character that the reader can care about. All the opportunities to make her a better character are in my opinion, ununtilized, in favour of throwaway phone conversations with her mother and a weak divorce plot.  Monique’s failing/failed marriage is kind of dealt with with a carelessness that didn’t match or fit the attention to detail and careful writing of the rest of the book. I kept thinking there were bits of the book missing that must have been edited out. Or conversely, that the main Evelyn story was written and then Monique was added later because of the shocking twist at the end. What I’m saying is that the two sides of the book didn’t match in quality, standard or interest. Fortunately, this novel is about 80% Evelyn and 20% Monique.With my ambivalence for Monique and the treatment of racial diversity as a theme in this novel, it may be surprising that I ended up giving this a 3. But the storytelling about Evelyn’s life story is impeccably executed. It’s empathetic, emotional, sensitive, dramatic, annoying. This is not a book you will be able to read without emotion. I’m glad I took it on on a quiet Sunday afternoon."
"*Please be advised this review is a SPOILER review*I usually divide my book review into sections: plot, writing, characters, and thoughts. However, I wanted to do something a little different with this review since I just simply want to talk about how magical this book is as a whole.This is my second Taylor Jenkins Reid book, the first one I read was Daisy Jones & The Six. I have watched countless BookTube videos and read countless tweets on the comparisons of both Daisy Jones and Evelyn Hugo. People recommended that you should read Evelyn Hugo before Daisy Jones because we wouldn’t be disappointed blah blah blah. Blah because that’s exactly what it is. There is absolutely no comparing Daisy Jones and Evelyn Hugo. I loved both of them equally as much for different reasons. The writing styles are completely different. I don’t believe that one is better than the other. In other words, Taylor Jenkins Reid is a genius and I need to read all her books.Anywho, I cried. I cried a lot while reading this book. You can easily say that Evelyn Hugo is an unlikable character. However I loved her. I loved her ruthlessness and her knowingness of the power she had and how she used that power to get what she wanted. Yes, there are things she did that I would never do like sleep with people to climb to the top or get married for less than 24 hours just to pull the tabloids away from the gossip that was going around at the time. Her morally gray character is something that I loved because although I didn’t agree with some of her decisions, I understood it. It was a different time back then, there were different rules and she played them all to her liking.My favorite characters were pretty much the main characters; Evelyn Hugo, Celia St. James, Monique Grant, and Harry Cameron. I loved the dynamic between Evelyn and Harry. I wasn’t even surprised as to why they had married, it made all the sense in the world to me. Keeping each other safe in a time where the LGBTQ+ community was not accepted at all. They’re platonic relationship really made me smile but his tragic death shattered my whole existence. Seeing how people kept leaving Evelyn’s life in tragic ways one by one broke me down.My favorite relationship was between Evelyn Hugo and Celia St. James. For a book that is titled The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, I was not expecting this budding beautiful strong relationship between them both. Everything they went through together and how they tried to make it work when the odds were stacked up against them, the ending where Celia tells Evelyn to marry her brother so when Celia dies, she’ll have everything…I get teary eyed just thinking about it. WOW WHAT A BOOK! Reid had me staying up later than usual just to finish this book. They’re relationship mirrored real life relationships which is what made me love them even more and how they always came back to one another pulled at my heartstrings.But can we talk about that plot twist that I was not expecting at all???? The story of Monique Grant’s dad?!? OMFG! I was literally yelling! I did not expect that at all. Once again, Taylor Jenkins Reid is a genius!! It was executed so well because it was a hidden twist, something that was not mentioned much. Actually, I would love a companion novel only on Monique and her life after Seven Husbands because I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NOW THAT SHE’S RICH AND DID SHE TELL DAVID TO GO F*** OFF AND WHAT ABOUT HER MOM?! I have all these questions that I want answers too lol.Also!!! Not to mention that ending really did it for me. How Evelyn still took control of her life and when it was going to end????? UGH THE WATER WORKS!! This is the type of book that will stay with me forever. I will forever recommend and I need more books like this."
"I bought this book blind. Meaning I didn't look at the summary, reviews, or any info related to this book it was an impulse, solely done by someone posting about it on a quick tik tok video. You know the ones where it flashes like the ten best reads- yea that's all it took for me. After it was sitting on my shelf for a month or so I decided to read it in between classes. The best and worst mistake.This book deserves your full undivided attention. It deserves a full day in your coziest socks and a nice cup of coffee next to you. I was so annoyed that I had to put it down that I couldn't focus on anything but returning to Evelyns story.I've never read anything like this before. The writing style, the story, the setting... everything about this book was fresh and exciting.This book follows Monique (a not-so-well-known reporter and writer) and her experience interviewing the one and only Evelyn Hugo. Evelyn Hugo was the stable 50s Hollywood star actress. She was known for her beautiful bronze skin, toned body, and of course her famous 7 husbands. She lived a life full of glamour and scandals, after living a full life no one to this day knows the full story of all those husbands, until now.The way the story was written is from two points of view- Monique and Evelyn.Monique is in the now as she deals with her recent divorce and tries to figure out why Hugo choose her. Evelyns point of view starts with her as a 16-year-old to her current age of 70? 80? not sure. But when we read E's point of view, it's not as if she's solely talking to Monique. She's always talking to us as the reader. Confusing right? That's how amazing this writing is. We as the readers are transported through time and follow right along the side of E as she struggles with love and fame.I love everything about the Author's writing and her characters, so much so I have purchased three more of her books and I've never been this excited to dive into them.It's beautiful, complex, challenging, heartbreaking, powerful and enlightening.It's funny because this is a story about how a woman explains to us about her 7 failed marriages and the loss of love ---let me tell you I learned more about love and acceptance from this book than any other romance novel. (sparks, Hoover, shein, silver etc.)please please please read this book, you wont regret it."
I did not like this book at all. I never write reviews but feel like I disliked it so much that I needed to put my opinion out there. Read almost halfway through. Not for me. Wish I could get my money back.
"Columnist Monique Grant is shocked when her boss tells her that famous actress Evelyn Hugo has specifically requested her to write an article about her for their magazine. Monique has no idea what the now 80+-year old actress could want with her, but she doesn’t have to be told twice. When Monique shows up to Evelyn’s luxury apartment, she doesn’t know what to expect—and she certainly doesn’t anticipate Evelyn’s request that Monique write a tell-all book about Evelyn’s life, to be published upon her death. Confused but willing, Monique begins the process of listening to Evelyn tell her story, using her infamous relationships with all seven of her husbands to slowly reveal the more important peaks and valleys of her life, the stuff that no tabloid ever got right. In the end, not only will Monique have one hell of a story to tell, but she may also discover a missing piece of her own story (whether she wants to or not).MY THOUGHTSWell, it took me forever to finally read this book, but now I see what all the fuss is about. The story is solid, start to finish. It’s fun, unpredictable, and wildly entertaining. I still can’t believe that a book about a woman with seven husbands can be so authentic and downright believable, but it’s truly both those things. And I loved it, I loved Evelyn. She’s fierce and headstrong and unafraid. Even through the pages, her pull is magnetic, and I was rooting for her from page one. There were some parts that I wish had been explored more deeply, but I don’t even want to get into that criticism too much so as not to spoil the plot for the (very few) people who have yet to read the book. Suffice it to say that I enjoyed The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo immensely and am now completely pumped to (finally) read Daisy Jones & The Six."
"""Heartbreak is a loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.""I- I- I- * babbles incoherently with hand gestures * I was forewarned that this book would wreck me, from start to finish, and yet at about 10%, I thought to myself, Oh god. This book is going to put me out of commission for days, at least. And it did.There are many things to rave about in this book: the incredibly well done portrayal of Old Hollywood, of actors and actresses who had to hide much of themselves (background, sexuality, etc) in order to have a scrap of a hope at success, a heart-wrenchingly poignant connection between the seemingly worlds-apart stories of our two narrators, and an incredible queer love story that was as beautiful as it was truly heartbreaking in its' longevity and many trials and tribulations.Yet, what stuck with me most while reading, and has not yet left my brain in the past week, is how thankful I am that Taylor Jenkins Reid wrote Evelyn as the ambitious, selfish, cunning, and (occasionally) single-minded woman she was. It has taken me a very long time, as a reader, to separate from the cult of ""likability"" that all women ( and people born w vaginas) are indoctrinated into at our birth. Even with fictional characters, I often struggled to like or root for the more complex, self-serving female characters, even as male characters who were quite literally villains, or antiheroes, I worshipped and empathized with their reasoning and trauma without a second doubt.Evelyn Hugo is maybe my favorite female character I have ever read, because she is so painfully real, and so painfully human. Not only that, but her choices and thought process reflect also the time period and subsequent societal constraints that she lived, grew, and flourished in. As a young adult, it felt like looking into a mirror, only to see my mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother looking back at me.It is the rare book that can so deftly navigate so much tragedy, heartbreak, and raw ambition and still have you rooting for a character, let alone a relationship. The Seven Husbands did this SO effortlessly that it left me flabbergasted. Evelyn, Harry, and Celia- and their relationships) had my heart in a vise from the very get-go, and have not let go of me even now that I am done.This book was superb, from start to finish, and left me contemplating about the ways in which life transforms, smooths, and sharpens us, and how each phase of life gives you the same picture but from a slightly different angle.I want everyone I know to read this book. Absolutely everyone."
"“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is “You’re safe with me”—that’s intimacy.”Every moment I had a chance to pick this book up and read, I did...with great anticipation. I loved everything about The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo: the format (newspaper articles and interviews), the characters (I deeply related to Evelyn, despite the two of us having nothing in common), Evelyn's stories (they're engrossing), even Monique's struggles.While I wouldn't say this story brings anything new to the literary world, it's pages are so satisfyingly juicy and beguiling, I genuinely didn't want them to end.Covering many decades of Evelyn's life, up to and including present day, the book, in interview form, chronologically reveals her relationships to each of her husbands...and ultimately answers the question as to ""who was her greatest love."" It delves deeply into old Hollywood, sexuality, domestic abuse, and divorce, obviously.“Heartbreak is loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.”I rarely give 5 star reviews...maybe 2 or 3 per year out or the 150 books I read. Evelyn was a 5 star read. This novel is compelling on so many levels. Recommended to everybody I know!"
"Eh. There was definitely an underlying agenda to this book. It was pretty far out of my comfort zone andddd very predictable. Just not for me. It was pretty boring and slow through several parts as well. Had to force myself to continue reading. It’s just okay, not worth the hype. Love that it’s very LBGT+ positive, but it goes a lot further than I expected into it."
"I thought the plot, the story line and relationships were intriguing. But, I perceived the dialogue as being stunted and too treacly for the most part. There also was no subtlety to the narrative, i.e. points were not only made but reiterated and, I felt, the reader clobbered over the head with them.In a nutshell, I believe that The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a good book written poorly."
"The character Evelyn Hugo reminds me of a fictionalized version of Elizabeth Taylor. And yes, the book is full of ""old Hollywood glamour"" like the cover inset says, but it's also full of the rot underneath the shiny golden veneer: The studio literally owns their stars and micromanages every aspect of their lives. Actors are remade and their back stories rewritten to make them more ""marketable"" to the fans. Homophobia forces people into sham marriages to cover up the truth, because being ""outed"" would destroy your career. People turn a blind eye to domestic violence because the abuser is a mega ""star."" Substance abuse touches almost everyone.There is a lot of good to this story, but also a lot of drama and negative behavior. It's 50/50. Evelyn Hugo is not a very likeable character. She does some atrocious things. But she also shows she is capable of great love and devotion.If you like tell-all celebrity memoirs, it's certainly an interesting story. And it would probably make a good movie..."
"The mystery aspect of this book was sonewhat interesting, but how much can you read about an actress obsessed with her chest? It was a bit tawdry, with few redeeming qualities. Not the worst book I’ve read, but not a serious work."
"I keep seeing reviews about this book being “propaganda” and “slander.” There are many deeply relevant, upsetting ideas in this book (read: racial inequity, ethnic cleansing, prejudices, abuse) and the heart of this book revolves around lgbt+ rights and exposure. If these sound like themes you will not enjoy, then DO NOT READ this wonderful novel.For everyone else, this is a good read. In my personal opinion, it was a bit slow when starting before I got to the main plot. However, there are many subplots that kept me interested through the book. Reid does a good job of planting seeds throughout the story so you want to keep reading to find out their significance.Personally, I saw where the book was going but I’m the type of person who doesn’t just enjoy the story but thinks of every possible storyline. That being said, I still thoroughly enjoyed the way Reid wrote it and the journey she took me on to get there. I even found myself tearing up along the way.Bottom line: I will recommend this book to friends and keep it on my shelf. It is different from anything else I’ve read lately. I hope this becomes a movie, I would love to see this play out on screen!"
"The story of Evelyn Hugo, an actress from the golden age of Hollywood who married seven times, I found this book a really fun and page-turning read. There were a few spots that I felt were underwritten, and a couple of places where I thought the dialogue was overblown, but overall I had a really good time with it.It's difficult to discuss this book at length without bringing up spoilers, so, more briefly: the book is divided into sections covering each of Evelyn's husbands, and what I really liked about this was that each section felt kind of like a satisfying story in its own way (despite occasional hooks like 'I didn't know how this would go so badly next' or whatever). However, the book didn't feel disjointed at all, and each section flowed into the next really well.The story deals with a lot of heavier topics for a large cast of characters, including domestic abuse, reproductive rights, death, and queer themes in a very homophobic era. None of these were glossed over, but the story doesn't get bogged down in them or go too serious. Sort of as a result of this, one of the things hinted at in the story--a plot twist near the end--misses the mark a bit, as, at least to me, it didn't have a lot of impact. Also, near the end, there's an attempt to sort of draw parallels between Evelyn's life and another character's that feels clumsy, like spoon-feeding, that just didn't hit.The rest of the story made up for it, however, and overall it was a positive reading note to start the year out on."
"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Reid completely took me by surprise. While I have heard tons of people raving about this book, I just did not expect it to hit me as hard as it did.The story is centered around the life of Evelyn Hugo, a Hollywood movie icon. In her old age, she has become more of a recluse. However, she is now ready to tell the truth about her life. She chooses Monique Grant, a relatively new and unknown magazine journalist, for the job of writing her biography. Evelyn then recounts her life to Monique, including her rise to fame and the seven husbands she had along the way. Monique quickly learns that there is much more to Evelyn than people may think.I truly did not expect to love this book as much as I did. I have never really read anything like it, and I feel as though I will constantly be looking for books just like this one. It was emotionally devastating at times but was also so beautiful at the same time. I loved Evelyn and Monique’s characters, and I enjoyed seeing how they interacted with one another. Reid’s writing was exceptional. It was hard hitting and beautiful. I especially enjoyed the moments about identity and sexuality. I love how the author handled bisexuality, when people do not understand it, and how people are constantly trying to fit others into boxes. I also loved how she wove together the past and present. I enjoyed learning more about Evelyn’s past, but I looked forward to see how Monique was forming a bond with her in the present too. I was so shocked by one of Evelyn’s last reveals, and Reid’s writing perfectly captured both Evelyn and Monique’s complex and complicated emotions. I sobbed my way through a good chunk of this novel, but it was beyond worth it.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a book I know will stay with me for a very long time. Since I finished this book, I have been looking for others like it. However, I do doubt that another book will make me feel, on the same level, what this book did. I really do not think I can praise or recommend this book enough. I’m definitely more than excited to check out Reid’s other books now too.*Content warning: sexual assault, rape, domestic abuse, alcoholism, cheating, homophobia, biphobia, suicide, death of loved ones, illness*"
"4.5 Stars ☆The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is about the endless complexities of human nature and life, loving and being loved, the complications, exploits, and misadventures of stardom, and the ultimate truth behind all the well-manicured, scrupulously crafted lies built because of who the world has suppressed you to be and how you have chosen to respond to that in an act of what you think is your best chance at survival.Monique Grant, an up and coming, relatively unknown writer for the prestigious publication Vivant, is mysteriously assigned famed actress Evelyn Hugo’s story for what she thinks is a cover issue. However, she quickly learns that nothing is what it is purported to be. Evelyn wants her and only her to do a post-humous, tell-all biography of her life. So after some thought and much negotiation of terms, Monique decides to do it, while still being in the dark about why her? And page by transfixing page we can’t help but wonder the same thing.But, ultimately in doing so, she learns that Evelyn is more real and layered than the sexualized pedestal people put her on. However, like Marilyn Monroe, she is still known for her outright portrayals of sexuality, as she drips with glamor and notoriety and flashes skin and Colgate smiles for the camera that catches all her best angles. But Evelyn doesn’t want to be remembered for only that, because being known for something she didn’t do like her looks latently unnerves and also viciously disappoints her in ways maybe she doesn’t always let on because that would betray the overarching role she has been playing her entire career, but I know are still there. Her view of stardom is affected with age as she has watched what it turns people into.And she also wants to be able to tell her story on her own terms for the first time ever and in doing so laid out before us is an individual we love to hate. She has hurt people, objectified her body and self for Hollywood, let herself be controlled by the voyeurism of the male gaze, made up things for the media for her own profit and the profit of her inner circle, but she has also made things up as a means of protection for those that she loves and holds dear, gone after what she wants with unrelenting, admirable tenacity, built herself from the ground up, is smart enough to know the difference between being heartbroken because you loved someone or disappointed and able to be truthful with yourself because you failed at a relationship/marriage, been a genius marketer/awing in her street smarts in terms of all her life simultaneously giving people just enough to desire more, and she is at the root of everything painfully human. I could take the good with the bad, the light of her actions and the dark, and despite it all I found myself falling for Evelyn Hugo through and through.This book has a way of pulling you in precisely because it tells the truth even if it is painful or unflattering. Evelyn isn’t scared to admit who she is and never claims to be above things if she isn’t and there is something empowering about that in what can be the harmful superficiality of the world she has lived in for so long. I found her story to be genuine, humanizing, and in subtle and not so subtle ways heartbreaking as who she was came more and more to the forefront. This story made me realize the importance of maintaining who you are and being proud of and advocating for that person through all the ups and downs you go through, including your moments of being flawed and making mistakes, and I think that that’s a beautiful, important lesson to take away from it!"
"The most unexpected of love stories!This might sound like a frivolous book of a Hollywood star, of the Golden Age, running through marriages carelessly, one man at a time. However, it is actually much deeper & more beautiful than that.An unconventional love story - one of true love. It is complicated & they mess it up quite often, but it is true nonetheless.I will not tell you who or which one she loved though. That is for you to find out.Evelyn is an old woman now and she wants to tell her story - the whole of it, no holds barred - before it’s too late. She wants the world to know what really happened, beyond all the tabloids.She “randomly” chooses a young intern at a high-end NYC magazine & refuses to tell her story to anyone else, to the frustration of all the higher ups at the magazine. Why? Well, that is also for you to find out.Has Evelyn been an angel? Far from it. She has been selfish & devious & determined. But she made her own life. She loved who she loved. And with this book, she is not apologizing, but she is making things right.A fun & fascinating story. I would definitely recommend it. The author, Taylor Reid Jenkins, has many great books that I suggest you also look into.I think this is a new favorite of mine."
"I could not believe what I was reading!  This book has me drooling for more. I did not want it to end.  I absolutely adored every single character and was blown away by the skill TJR had in creating one of the best books I’ve ever had the pleasure to read and pass along.The several-decades storyline was seamless and creatively crafted (newspaper clippings that summed up chapters worth of information, magazine articles that would spill the T and fill in many gaps along the way).Evelyn Hugo is like no one I’ve read before. She’s at once Elizabeth Taylor in Marilyn Monroe’s body and yet she is as calculating as the Mata Hari and just as dangerous.  One minute she’s a vulnerable, homeless kitten and the next she’s a fierce, protective tigress.Tragic, glamorous, beautiful, sad, exciting, secretive, haunting, explosive - this book has it all!You will NOT be disappointed.  The Amazon reviewer of this book said to read this book and we would thank her later. Well, it’s later and I want to thank her from the bottom of my heart!!"
"I really want to kick myself. 😤 This book has been in my possession since February of this year. Over and over again I bypassed it to read something else. I'm not really sure why...maybe all of the hype associated with it? 🤷‍♀️ But now I'm mad I've had it so long and waited all this time to read it. But I'm so VERY glad that I finally did.Without giving too much away, this book is not at all what I thought it would be about. The title is accurate yet deceiving at the same time. It is hard to review without spoiling it.Evelyn Hugo is a scandalous Hollywood icon in her late seventies who is finally ready to have someone publish her tell-all. The ""someone"" she wants to publish it is Monique Grant, who works for Vivant magazine. Evelyn reaches out to Vivant and says she will do an exclusive interview about a gown auction she is having for the American Breast Cancer Foundation, but only with Monique. Monique has no idea why Evelyn has specifically requested her and neither does her boss Frankie. However once she arrives at Evelyn's home, Evelyn tells her she wants her to write her life story and warns her that she will end up hating her by the end of their interview. But why?I thought this book was phenomenal. Evelyn  seemed like any real Hollywood star you watch or read about. I felt sorry for her for how much she had to hide in the 50's through the 80's and how much she had to go through just to get to the top.I liked the dialogue between Evelyn and Monique throughout the book, how Monique started out nervous, then gained confidence (she asked Evelyn direct, tough questions) and ended with complete anger. What Evelyn ends up telling Monique in the end came as quite a surprise 😳 I would have never guessed it but it makes everything come together and makes perfect sense.Taylor Jenkins Reid has a way of developing complex characters that you do not want to stop reading about. I grew to love Evelyn despite her imperfections. She was so brave and fearless in so many situations. I'll miss reading about her.""When you're given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn't give things, you take things."""
"When I suggested my West Side Stories book club read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, I didn't know what we were getting into. There is no better way to jump into this book, in my opinion. If you thought you were going to read a historical romance, you're right… but you're also very wrong.Evelyn Hugo is not what she seems and that makes her one of the most complex characters I've ever read. She knows what she wants, or thinks she knows what she wants, but sometimes doesn't know how to get it.But without Monique, Evelyn's story would lose some of its power. Monique is a younger, biracial woman who is going through a divorce. She gives us the lens to reality we need to understand how Evelyn's story applies to us all. This isn't just about Hollywood glamor - Evelyn's experiences are the same experiences we all can, and in many cases, will have.It's impossible to discuss this book without discussing feminism. Evelyn's story is about race, identify, sexuality, misogyny, and having to conform to societal norms if you have dreams beyond becoming a hermit. While this might seem intense or overwhelming, Reid's exploration of these topics is slow, subtle, and methodical. I was sucked completely into Evelyn's story and only when I came up for air did I realize what an exceptional job was done sharing these themes.If reading The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo taught me anything, it's that life is too short to pretend to be something we are not. Those who love you will only love you more for being yourself. And if for some reason they don't, then they never loved you in the first place. Loving people who are worthy and deserving of our love is all life really means."
"No secret that Taylor Reid can write and the concept grabbed me. How could it not with old Hollywood and shades of Liz Taylor? But as the marriages piled on, my interest deteriorated. I kept wondering where Monique figured and when we got to that bit, I was incredibly underwhelmed.  I expected a meatier connection between the two women and a meatier story in general. Did not happen."
"This book was a fascinating tale of a famous Starlet who got her start in Hollywood back in the 50's. We follow her life through a series of interviews with young journalist Monique Grant. We learn about her life through her POV from the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s and then current day. We learn her story about succeeding in Hollywood, her love life, scandal and her many many husbands. I thought the throw back news clippings were an interesting touch to the story. I also liked how each section of the book was separated by the husbands.I was mesmerized by the story of Evelyn Hugo. But I kept forgetting about Monique Grant. And I could have read the whole entire book and loved it without her side plot.This book was tragic and heartbreaking (which is not usually a typical read for me) I kept wanting to throw the book across the room because I didn't want to read what was about to happen next. Right when she was happy - of course - something was right around the corner to rip it away. Sometimes these things were of her own making and sometimes people are just cruel. It felt like a very realistic story of an actress who had to fight and claw her way to the top and then try to stay on top. It was as if the curtain was pulled back and we were able to see how Hollywood really is.The writing was absolutely beautiful. I highlighted some very poignant life lessons in this book. It will stay with me for a long time."
"The SEVEN Husbands of Evelyn Hugo - Review⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5“Whatever book you write about me, it will not have easy answers” -Evelyn Hugo.I beg every person to read this book. This is not a happy book. This is not light. But this is the realest thing I have ever read..QUICK LOOK: Strong Female Lead, Raw/Real/Messy/Gray Characters, Old Hollywood, Women’s Roles, Media Spins, Life in the Spotlight, Domestic Violence, LGBTQ+.SYNOPSIS:Longtime Moviestar Evelyn Hugo is known for her many husbands, her beauty, and her ferocity...because that’s exactly as much as Evelyn wanted the world to know. She controlled her image, her story, and carved out her name in lights..But at 79, she has decided to do a tell-all book with a completely unknown writer...because what the world knows isn’t even half of it. This scrappy woman who left an abusive home in Hell’s Kitchen at 14, used every skill and every gift she had to survive and thrive in a cutthroat world..WHY 5/5:I once heard a reviewer say they only give 5 stars to books that change them. That is absolutely true for this book. When a talented author can put you so deeply inside a character’s story like Taylor Jenkins Reid, and then proceed to show you what raw and real grief, heart-wrenching pain, and emotional turmoil feel like through Evelyn’s lens, you will be changed. Stories have the power to change us. Evelyn’s story has the power to change us..ALL THE STARS."
"I found this story to be original and intriguing. Evelyn Hugo is a reclusive movie star and chooses an obscure journalist to tell her story to. She’s outlived everyone and is finally going to reveal the truth about her life. Monique is a low-level journalist at a magazine and has no idea they have a connection. I love reading about old Hollywood. It was a different time and this story takes us there. I found it a bit disconcerting whenever the point of view changed from Evelyn to Monique as each is told in the first person. I think Evelyn’s influence over how Monique viewed her life could’ve been written more strongly. Monique’s chapters felt a little weak. Evelyn also didn’t come off as very likable. She had a no-apologies personality that I liked, but it was difficult to care. Several timely issues are touched on, which gave the story some depth. I enjoyed this book, and I’m sure it reflects many of the secrets that stars in Hollywood had to hide in those days. I enjoyed the clips from gossip magazines and especially liked the last one. Interesting story, a page turner, but still could’ve been written a bit better."
"I stumbled across a Tik Tok video of a girl talking about this book and she was in TEARS because of how raw and beautiful it was. I had to order it immediately. I finished it in a day and then took some time to ponder how I felt about it. I knew I didn't really love the book but I couldn't put into words why.This book covered so many important and very deep conversations but only at a surface level. None of the characters were likeable and you could tell that the topics on blackness, being bi-racial, and being LGBTQ were being portrayed by a person who doesn't know what it's like to be a part of those communities. You could tell the author was foreign in that regard.I enjoyed the story because it was a light read, but overall it was a no for me."
"“Nobody deserves anything,” Evelyn says. “It’s simply a matter of who’s willing to go and take it for themselves. And you, Monique, are a person who has proven to be willing to go out there and take what you want. So be honest about that. No one is just a victim or a victor. Everyone is somewhere in between. People who go around casting themselves as one or the other are not only kidding themselves, but they’re also painfully unoriginal.”The seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a story following the loves and life of the iconic Evelyn Hugo, a story filled with love, trust, heartbreak, betrayal and so much more.⚠️TRIGGER WARNINGS!! ⚠️sexual assault, rape, domestic abuse, cheating, homophobia, biphobia, alcoholism, mentions of suicideWow! When I first started reading this book I had very high hopes because of all of the surrounding hype. However, I was also very hesitant in picking this book up because of all the love and amazing things I’ve heard about it. Let me tell you something...this book, is worth ALL the hype.To start on reasons why I love this book, it has a fantastic cast of characters, who genuinely feel as though they are real people. Reid’s writing makes it so that not only do these characters FEEL real but you’re able to connect with them whether you’ve gone through what they have personally or not. The writing is very well written and fast paced, not once did this book feel like it was dragging, in fact I was surprised at how quickly I was able to get through it considering the genre isn’t one I usually gravitate towards. It’s so easy to get sucked into Evelyn, and her story. As for plot I feel as though the plot was very consistent, and it was very much there, I’ve noticed with some read the plot can sometimes get lost, but Reid made it so that this wasn’t the case for Evelyn’s story.  I love how raw the story was, we’re following one of the most iconic woman of her time and yet with most books with a setup like this, they show all the glam and perks of being a celebrity or being the center of attention and they tend to lose the more darker and more truthful aspects, with this story it felt as though Reid was able to perfectly capture not only the glory of being such a famous and well known person, but also reveal the truths behind what goes on off camera and behind closed doors.Despite my gushing love for this book I will say the only thing I feel as though I didn’t like was that this book ended leaving me heartbroken. Just kidding! Seriously though this book will leave you a mess.❣️Details❣️~romance/historical fiction~2 POV (however we mainly follow Evelyn’s)~385 pages | paperback⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/"
"Wow. I did not expect to love this book as much as I did. Absolutely LOVED it. This is a story of a powerful love between two women in a time when it was unacceptable. The author has a huge command of language and seamlessly shifts from first person present tense to first person past tense and even to second person. Amazing. I marveled at the writing craft, the storytelling. The language and the passion to communicate the love is mesmerizing. The main character Evelyn Hugo is a swirling whirlwind that pulls everyone that comes near into her vortex. Even though Evelyn Hugo does some truly heinous things, the justification and motivation is clear and we pull full her.The atmosphere, setting and flavor of old Hollywood is captured in just enough detail. The underlying plotline, the mystery that was carried along and always there lurking really paid off in the end. In all the thousands of books I have read in my life time I have found very few that have been able to pay-off with the last line of the book. This author does it with stunning panache and verve. Loved it. For me this book is a true “tear-jerker,” as my mother used to call them. (She was married five times, so I might’ve had a little insider experience with Evelyn Hugo. Mom, married three Jim’s, a Bill and a Bob. The third, and last was a Jim and my sisters nicknamed him Jim de jour. Sorry, I digress).This one is going up in my top five of the year.Highly recommend this book."
"What an interesting storyline.  I am curious how many of our favorite Hollywood stars from that time were not able be themselves.  Think Rock Hudson!  Such a sad story.  I knew early on why Evelyn chose Monique and wanted to see how it all got tied together.  I was correct but had hoped for a happier reason.  To ""love"" that many men but never really able to be with the one you really loved.  Enjoyed!  This would make a very interesting mini series on TV."
"I just read this novel for my book club. We were looking for something a bit less dark and heavy than what we've been reading. Well, I guess we accomplished that. This is a shockingly trashy, salacious, and truly stupid novel. I yawned through most of it wading through it to find out what the ""shocking"" bit of news was going to make the journalist hate her subject. Totally not worth the wait.I rarely write book reviews and I usually do so to offer accolades to the writer. The fact that this book has so many good reviews is an indication that the dumbing down of our country has worked to a depressingly high extent."
"After three months of waiting for “The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo” to be available to me on Libby, I finally had the chance to read this book and it was worth every minute of the wait. Evelyn Hugo moved me a way that no book has ever before, landing itself in my top five favorite books of all time.This book is phenomenal, spectacular and simply perfect. Evelyn’s story is one of being a Cuban, bisexual Hollywood starlet in an era where being attracted to another woman was demonized by all of society. Every chapter of her story is as breathtaking as it is heartbreaking. The LGBTQ+ and POC representation in this book is some of the best representation I’ve seen (and something we oh so rarely get to experience in the historical fiction genre, let alone this powerfully).I loved this book so much that I ordered myself a physical copy right after returning it on Libby, just to grant myself the ability to re-read it whenever I desire. I wish I had the words to do this book justice, but all I can do is ask you to pick up a copy if you haven’t already."
"I had heard great things about this novel so I was anxious to sink my teeth into it. However, I found this a breezy pop sugar gossipy kind of tale that was a piece of fluff. This is not to say that one can't enjoy the story but it had no depth. I had figured out the ending in the first few chapters and the only satisfaction I received was as a snooping voyeur pouring over the central character's life. All in all it was a distracting beach read.(Even if you can't go to the beaches now)"
"if i’ve ever recommended a book, it’s this one. complex and heartbreaking. as someone who mostly reads mystery/crime, it had just enough mystery to reel me in and the story kept me flipping through the pages. as some other reviews say, i do NOT agree that this is pushing any kind of narrative or using sexual orientation or race to seem edgy. i think it’s very well done."
"When I purchased this book I did so simply because I wanted to read something that was different from my usual historical novels.  I wanted something light and easy.  Well needless to say I was quite surprised to find that wasn't to be the case.  This story was overwhelming as it's main character was brutally honest, self-absorbed and self-adored. Is  this the typical story of a Hollywood actress, especially those in the 1950's?  Did it conjure up those huge celebrity egos I was in awe of  in Hollywood's golden years?  It most certainly did.  Every page beckoned me further, until I finished it in 2 days time.  Well written, I was hooked from page one.  I'll save it on my Kindle and read it again."
"A book can sometimes take something from you, something that you can never quite get back and that’s what this book did to me. This is one of the most beautifully written books I’ve ever read. It’s thoughtful, paced, intriguing. Taylor like Evelyn reveals nothing until she’s ready to. After reading this book I felt so empty, so sad that it was over and that after all is what we look for when we read isn’t it? To feel something. This book delivers on that and then some. The main character is as charming as she is cunning, almost every sentence she speaks is a life lesson and it seems like we’re all Monique just sitting down and absorbing as much of the knowledge as possible. The characters feel so real that I feel like I’m sitting alongside Monique on the couch listening to Evelyn tell us her life story. I could envision what she looks like in my mind with great detail, I could see the world for what it was then.... sometimes a little too accurately. This book was a trip I never wanted to end and it will go down as one of my favorites of all time."
"I went into this book blind and was extremely pleasantly surprised. Not only was this an intriguing and fun read, but it was heartbreaking in really great ways. I got through this book blazingly fast, which I can only do with a great story. Unlike most books I read, I thought this one ended just the way it was meant to. It didn't feel rushed or didn't feel like it was poorly planned out. The only reason I can't give this book 5 stars, unlike Evelyn Hugo, I'm not the biggest fan of Taylor Jenkins Reid's no-nonsense writing style. Don't get me wrong, she can write, she's talented and it certainly didn't distract from the fabulous story, not too often, at least. If you wanna know what bad no-nonsense writing reads like look to ""The Sleep Experiment"" by Jeremy Bates. I would have preferred more description, if it'd been written with a little more passion, it might have gotten the tears that brimmed in my eyes to actually fall. Other than that, it's a great book. Highly recommend this one."
"It wasn’t what I was expecting so feel like I got a little tricked.  It’s a book about being bisexual and gay in Hollywood during the 60’s, 70’s and 80’s. Big whoop.  I thought it was going to be a great mystery with lots of glitz and glam but it was much more about interpersonal relationships and it was just boring as hell and the end was so easy to predict."
"Amazing story about a strong, brave, courageous, and rather manipulative woman. I could not put this book down. IF this ever turns into a movie… Veronica Falcón MUST play Ms. Hugo!*SPOILER ALERT/OPINION*This book covered an immense array of topics: Fame in Hollywood, social pressures/societal norms, power with wealth, and yes… God forbid… bisexuality?!To all of those warning “conservative” people about this book- It was written in a decade where A VAST majority of issues were kept quiet (like women being beaten by their husbands or being gay). You’re allowed to have different beliefs and that’s ok! That’s the beauty of FREEDOM OF PRESS (if we’re throwing politics into the mix). Anyone can write books and create a story that you may not like (and that’s ok!!)Some words/phrases were repeated more than I would have cared for, but, it’s over a 300 word page book. Every “husband” served her in a way that helped her up the Hollywood ladder, but, in the end it didn’t matter. Because she wasn’t happy. (A book based on happiness?!… what?!)Lighten up, people. This was beautifully executed and extremely creative!"
Strange book
"First off, I read this entire book in just 3 sittings. It was phenomenal and probably my favorite book of all time (at least in my top 5). I was captivated at every page turn and it's hard to keep my attention.Evelyn Hugo is a Hollywood Starlet who was in her prime from the 50's-80's. So, much of the book gives you the glam lifestyle of a Joan Crawford and Bette Davis type actress in LA and NY.However, the juiciest and scandalous part of the book comes from the secrets of Evelyn Hugo. Yes, she married Seven Husbands...but which was the one that she LOVED most? Which was the TRUE love of her life, or was it any of them? (Rather not spoil that part for those of you who haven't read it yet).But this is a MUST READ!"
"After reading and loving Daisy Jones and the Six, I had to try another book by Reid, andI was not disappointed with her writing. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo was just as engrossing and descriptive as my first foray into this author’s work.  And as much as I transported into the music world of the 70s, Reid does wonders with Hollywood over the decades…Evelyn Hugo is quite a character. After captivating audiences for decades, she had been out of the public eye for many years. But she reaches out to a virtually unknown journalist, and makes a deal with her to write her biography. Monique Grant is a woman who has paid her dues as a blogger to now writing at the very trendy magazine Vivant. Her personal life is on the rocks with a separation from her partner, and she knows that this deal with Hugo might be the career move she needs.  There’s a reason Hugo chose Grant… and that question provides some great tension throughout, along with the inevitable question: Why so many husbands?!?!?!In their interview sessions Evelyn relates the story of her move out west from Hell’s Kitchen and her subsequent start in industry. From one film to the next, some are successes and some are flops, and with each part of the story, Reid/ Hugo relates a very poignant lesson or insight into life. It’s a rich narrative that dives into abuse, sexuality, and a drive for perfection and success. Each part of her life is broken up with articles from tabloids reporting her dalliances or her successes. This cuts to themes of storytelling and manipulation of the word. Many good layers to this one!I think the big difference for me between these Daisy Jones and Seven Husbands is that I’m just not that big a fan of Hollywood. I don’t watch many films and have almost no interest in the actors and actresses of the big studio era of Hollywood. Yet, I have great love of rock music. And beyond Reid great writing, that is what connected me to Daisy Jones.Recommended for those of a love of film, historical fiction, and truly fine writing."
"________________________This is going to come as a shock to some and definitely a shock to me but...I LOVED THIS FLIPPIN BOOK!!!I mean, not just loved but LOVED LOVED. Like passionately loved. Like held it to my chest and caressed it like a lover loved... ok things are getting weird here... but you get my meaning.I loved Evelyn. Like LOVED LOVED. She is one of the most fascinating characters I have ever read. I simply could not get enough of her and luckily Taylor Jenkins Reid was astute enough to write the majority of this book in her voice.I thought I knew just from reading the description why Evelyn chose Monique to write her biography, it seemed so obvious. Holy bajeezus was I ever wrong. I felt like I had been physically slapped in the face when the truth was revealed.This book is exquisite.It is without flaw.It is worthy of all praise.________________________** I read this book because, luckily, it was on sale and I was stupid enough to not request it on NetGalley. All opinions are my own. **"
"I enjoyed this book. It was an easy read. I think the story is unique and interesting. The writing was mediocre at best. If I hear “deftly” one more time... The author also screwed up her own time line and blatantly contradicted herself about the amount of time that had passed or how old Monique was so many times that it was really annoying. That bothered me quite a bit. For instance, Evelyn had supposedly been holding on to the letter for “ nearly 3 decades” but a page before, it states that Monique was “almost thirty” and we know that  the letter didn’t exist until she was 7. Do some math Reid!I wouldn’t read it again but I did enjoy it."
"I have read countless Hollywood biographies and autobiographies so I loved this fictional version of a ruthlessly ambitious woman clawing her way to fame and using marriage as a career tool and a PR smoke screen. At the end of her life, having outlived all seven of her husbands and her only child, Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to reveal the name of the one true love of her life. For her own obscure reasons, she selects a relatively unknown writer called Monique to tell her life story.I enjoyed comparing this to real Hollywood stories - why did Lana Turner really elope with Artie Shaw?  What did Rock Hudson and his wife talk about when they were alone? What would Joan Crawford have said about her marriage to Douglas Fairbanks Jr if she was really honest?The story in itself was very engaging and interesting, although I wasn't convinced that Evelyn Hugo was really such a great actress as she didn't seem to show any interest in any aspect of film-making beyond seeing herself on screen. I can't believe she starred as Jo in Little Women and as Anna Karenina, yet she had nothing to say about those characters or their stories.Spoiler alert, maybe...The flaw in the book was the gay characters' obsession with keeping their sexuality hidden from their colleagues in the film industry. While Old Hollywood did work hard to keep gay stars looking straight, most of them could relax in the privacy of their own home and I think the industry did close ranks to protect itself. Back then, someone like Rock Hudson or Tyrone Power would have lost all credibility as a hero if he'd been outed as gay. This would have been bad for the box office, and co-stars and producers and directors did not want that."
"The story of Evelyn Hugo is familiar yet foreign. You see glimpses of the headlines and the fashions of several Hollywood starlets-turned-icons, but she becomes a woman all her own. Just when you think you know who she is, Taylor Jenkins Reid makes it clear that Evelyn Hugo is absolutely singular. I highly recommend this novel to anyone with a love for old Hollywood lore, feminism, and a realistic love for the rarely well-written female antihero. Evelyn Hugo, like all women, is complex and endearing."
"There has been hype for this book in  my social circles for some time. I can't tell you when or how, but it seemed to have just appeared one day and never left.Now that I've read it, there's a wild part of me that breaks itself in half for Evelyn, walks with Monique through this complex woman's life and I find myself wondering if there's a part of the book that's been imprinted on me for the world to see.Reid has a masterpiece on her hands with this. It presents itself as the love story of two women, but the truth is that it's nor that, at least not primarily. What it is, is the story of a woman learning to love herself from the story of a woman who learns what love trily is and that, I think, is the one thing that has me completely sold on it."
"I rarely read books but read this one in 3 days! Couldn't wait to get back to it each night. It really held my interest and kept me coming back for more. I enjoyed the way the author plotted the story out by going back and forth in time. It was easy to follow. I initially started writing down a character list/description, as they popped up, to help me follow along more easlily, but I didn't need one at all. I would highly recommend this book. Buy it, you can't go wrong! I will order another book from this author."
"Sadly, I did not care for this book.  I found the main character to be unsympathetic and selfish!  I kept reading with anticipation that there would be a redeeming story line but it was not to be.  The author's Daisy Jones and The Six was much better!"
"I have yet to read another book that hit me as emotionally as this one did. As a bisexual woman, this book was so TRUE to a bisexual experience. heartfelt, emotional, well paced, well plotted and just overall a joy to read. It was bittersweet and lovely; it had humorous parts, and many parts where I cried.it was easy to read in that the plot moves quickly.  there is a lot  going on but easy to track and it keeps your attention.The characters are believable, not perfect, but flawed, but you find yourself rooting for more than one. A beautifully told love story (more than one!)  that you don't see coming. This one started with me for weeks after. It made me feel like the author was speaking directly to me. Highly recommend. I would LOVE to see this made on the big screen. With the right cast and director, it could win all the awards"
"I can’t say enough about this book. The love, the intensity, the ugly, the heartbreak, I loved it ALL. This is one of the most dynamic books I’ve read in quite some time and I’m just not sure all the nay-sayers read what I read! I LIVE for strong, outstanding, compelling and badass women and Evelyn was all the above. Who doesn’t love a girl making it on her own, against all odds? I am fully obsessed with this book and so sad it’s over. I was engulfed in this book and now I’m not sure what to do with myself! READ. IT."
"One of my favorite literary finds is a book that’s light and easy to read (I call them Brain Candy), but that’s also extremely well-done and has substantial depth. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is the best in this class I’ve read in a long time! Evelyn is an Elizabeth Taylor-type character who did whatever it took to further her career…and she finally wants the whole truth to come out.""I’m not saying the gossip columnists printed what they knew to be a lie. I’m simply saying they were all too happy to believe the lie I was selling them. And of course, that’s the easiest lie to tell, one you know the other person desperately wants to be true.""The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo goes behind the curtain about how the Hollywood machine really works and exposes how much of what the general public sees is orchestrated for appearances. There’s an Old Hollywood vibe, yet also an undercurrent of feminism. You may not like Evelyn (she’s completely unapologetic about all the ruthless moves she made during her career), but you kind of have to admire her guts, and I did feel sorry for her by the end. It’s not often that a Brain Candy book can make me cry, but this one did. It’s a book I’ll be recommending to tons of people and is going on my Best of the Brain Candy list.For more reviews, visit my blog, Sarah's Book Shelves."
"I have never reviewed a single book, even when I've really enjoyed one. However, I have never enjoyed any book quite as much as this one. I loved it so much that I couldn't put it down while also telling myself to try and take breaks because I knew I'd feel sad once I finished it!I won't leave any spoilers here, but I will say I'm glad I went into this story blind (other than reading the synopsis). I think no matter who you are, or what stage of life you find yourself in, this book can speak to you. It revolves around love, sex, family, career, sacrifice, friendship, and being true to oneself. I loved all the characters the author created, even the ""bad guys"". Also, the way the narration shifted between the two main characters kept things moving at a great pace. I felt so invested in both of their stories and I couldn't wait to see what happened in the end.I cannot recommend enough that you give this a read, if I could give it 10 stars I would. I'm in my 30's and have loved to read since I was a young kid, and there are not too many books I've come across that moved me like this one did."
"Where do I even begin with this book?It was well-written, fascinating, hard to put down, and totally not what I expected. I laughed, I cried, I was shocked, and I was delighted by the story. At times it seemed so real that I had to remind myself it was fictional because googling “Evelyn Hugo” would not result in any real hits beyond the fictional world and characters of the story.The story of Evelyn Hugo is at once private yet universal. While fictional, it does provide a glimpse into the lives of the rich and famous. In these pages we meet Evelyn the mega star, and Evelyn the person behind the persona. In many ways both are similar yet different.I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a tale about the many faces of love found, love lost, and love regained."
"This book is one that will stick with the reader for some time. It is sassy, heartbreaking, enthralling, and immerses you into the world of old Hollywood.Evelyn Hugo is a woman who made her start into Hollywood at an early age. She was a sex symbol and known for her many relationships with men. But Evelyn only let the public see her as exactly how she wanted to be seen. This book follows a small-time journalist, that’s offered to tell Evelyn Hugo’s true story about her life and her loves. She knows the is not perfect and wants everyone to know who she really is.The format of the book is part current time where we follow Monique and her struggling with understanding how Evelyn’s story is impacting her life for good or bad. Every time Evelyn begins retelling her past, the narrative sucks you in and you feel as if you could really be living in the time period of old Hollywood and the beautiful stars that are a part of it.I found myself hurting for Evelyn at the same time being furious with her at the same time. Taylor Jenkins Reid is exceptional at character driven narratives that make you feel every emotion.I had my doubts with this book and how I would feel about it due to the tremendous hype surrounding it. But again, TJR did not disappoint and I found myself not wanting this book to end.This book had so much representation: bi racial characters, LGBTQ, and more. There are some trigger warning to abuse, physical & alcohol.Five Stars for this amazing Historical Literary Fiction!"
"This is a book I picked up on sale a while ago based strictly on the recommendation of J A DeRouen, an author’s whose work I enjoy.It’s fun to sometimes go into a book blind and this is a read that definitely rewarded the effort.Well written and intriguing, the Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo tells a tale that was as unexpected as it was raw. I was captivated hearing Evelyn’s story from her point of view. There were times when her truth was uncomfortable, but it was hard not to feel for her at the same time.Monique is a secondary character and facilities Evelyn’s story, but has a unique tale of her own.Both women and the web of characters around them were worth getting to know. Several hard topics were addressed - including what Love really means.This author is new to me, but I will be seeking out more of her work in the future."
This book was everything! It’s been a long time since I’ve read a book that I could not put down and this one did just that. I blew off adulting the last two days as much as I could to read this stunning tale. The writing is beyond beautiful and the story is incredible. Twists and turns that I didn’t see coming had me turning the pages as fast as I could. Then there were the pages that had my eyes filling with tears. Completely heartbreaking at times. I fell in love with this book from the first chapter and Evelyn Hugo is a BOSS! I might just have to read it again in case I missed something. I’m so not ready to say goodbye to reading more about Ms. Hugo. I’d give this book ten stars if I could.
"I didn’t really know what this book would be about when I picked it up off the shelf at Barnes & Noble, except that one of the employees said it was really good and was just now back in stock after selling out over and over again. This is such a beautiful story and I found myself loving and hating Evelyn Hugo all at the same time. Harry is by far my favorite character in the book.The only thing I wish is that we knew a little more about Monique’s father—but I also understand why his story couldn’t feel fully developed. As the reader, I had the same questions I’m sure Monique had at the end about her father. I love that the book had a strong LGBTQ arc that was so emotional and eye opening. Fun, easy read with a great plot that kept me guessing!"
"“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.”Absolutely speechless. There are not enough stars for this heartbreaking, stunning and powerful story! The story is a tour de force about Hollywood, race and the staggering price of fame.I have been sitting on this review for a while and finally felt enough distance from this story to write down my thoughts. I had this book on my Kindle FOREVER and for some reason, just ignored it. And now it has turned into one of my all-time favorites. (If you are an audio book lover, I highly recommend the audio, the narrators are SPECTACULAR.)The book begins with Monique, whose husband has left her and who has been struggling a bit with her journalism career. At first I could not fit the pieces together as to why Evelyn, a world-renowned, reclusive movie star would single out Monique to write her no-holds-barred biography. But the pieces fit together perfectly and I urge every reader to stick with this book! It is well worth it.I absolutely adore Hollywood stories - fiction and non-fiction - so I was enchanted by Evelyn's story. She literally narrates the Golden Age of Hollywood, from the days of contract players to modern-day Hollywood. There are pieces of Elizabeth Taylor, Great Garbo, Rita Hayworth and Doris Day mixed in here and the characters are vivid and real. And Evelyn, the center of the story, was a woman ahead of her time. And she paid the price for her independent streak and her brains.“I am under no obligation to make sense to you,” Evelyn said.Evelyn marries a series of men but each one never held her heart. That person is best left for the reader to discover, as I did, never having read a spoiler-ish review. Some of her husbands were friends, some were lovers, and some were simply for good press. It made me wonder how many Hollywood actresses in the past were victims of the studio system and their ironclad control over their actors?“It’s always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.”This book perfectly zeroes in on the price of fame. It is truly an epic book, spanning several decades and examining the changing morals of Hollywood. Evelyn sacrificed so much on her climb to the top but really all she wanted was to do good work. She was sometimes ruthless but would have given it all up for her one true love.“She always made sure the bad was outweighed by so much good. I...well, I didn't do that for her. I made it fifty-fifty. Which is about the cruelest thing you can do to someone you love, give them just enough good to make them stick through a hell of a lot of bad.”This book has a whopper of a twist and it made all the pieces of the story come together perfectly. The author writes with real emotion and honesty and it shows. Don't miss this one. It is a must-read. I will never forget Evelyn Hugo and these characters.“Never let anyone make you feel ordinary.”"
"I’ve never read anything like this and I read a lot. I struggled to put this down and I’m a mom with kids that are very distracting. I had to finish it, dishes be damned. Do you like love stories? Read this. Do you like a mystery that you try to figure out the whole book? Read this. Do you like reading a book that pulls you into its world and you have to blink several times to remember your real life? Read this. Do you like crying and laughing out loud in the same book? Reeead this. Just read it. Trust."
"(Lightly spoilerish later in review, will mark that section) I could not put this book down! I need you to understand that I typically only read the type of books like The Hot Zone or Andromeda Strain, so this wasn’t exactly my cup of tea. But I picked it up on the recommendation of my best friend and over the next 48 hours, only put it down to sleep and cook a meal (thank god it arrived Friday afternoon, I would’ve had to call in sick to work otherwise). It’s amazing! Evelyn Hugo is such an intricate and interesting character and Monique is a star. I’m not a romantic but this had me wanting to start searching for my soulmate. It also truly inspired me to be more confident in grabbing what I want and can make out of this world.*spoilerish starts here, because there are still awful people in this world*And to all the conservatives in the reviews? You need to hush, your outdated and homophobic opinions are showing. I don’t care that you were straight-baited for seven husbands, this book is delightful and if the only reason you don’t like it is because it’s “pushing an agenda” (an actual review I read) then you’re really not understanding one of the main themes of this novel.Truly wonderful, will be one of my annual re-reads!"
"was able to read ""Daisy Jones and the Six"" a few weeks ago via @Netgalley. I wanted to read more my Taylor Jenkins Reid, and had saw rave reviews about this book as well.And it did not disappoint!The Book is about Evelyn Hugo, a woman who grew up in humble beginnings and her rise to be one of the biggest stars in Hollywood. Evelyn was a gorgeous woman, and she knew it. Evelyn was tough, and she knew how to use her body to get what she wanted. Even though she seemed to have it all, she carried a big secret all of her life. The book is about her rise to fame in Hollywood, her many failed marriages and a twist at the end. It was an easy read, I was hooked by the first few pages.I have since purchased 2 more books by this author, that I can't wait to read them as well! I highly recommend this book!"
"Evelyn Hugo has been through seven husbands and a lifetimes of amazing stories. She is ready to break her silence. She chooses unknown reporter Monique Grant to write her story. Why Monique? What amazing things will she tell Monique? These are the questions on everyone’s lips as Evelyn begins to layout her entire life for everyone to see.Oh-my-gosh. This book is freaking amazing. While going over the passages I marked, I had to stop myself from rereading the entire book and I am not a person that rereads. You can see how many tabs I have. There are so many amazing quotes in this book that I can even put all of my favorites down.While reading ‘The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo’, it was as if I was watching a movie. I never had to go back and reread lines to understand them. I was never confused about what was going on. I just flew through the pages. The writing is flawless.After reading this, it is as if Evelyn is a real person. Reid so personified the perfect Hollywood icon that it is unbelievable to me that she is not a real person. Just when you think you have Evelyn and her life figured out, you learn that you are wrong. Totally 100% wrong.I don’t think I’ve ever read any book or seen any movie that really captures both the glam of hollywood and the price fame. One of the most interesting dynamics of Evelyn’s story is that her biggest power is her sexuality. How in a male dominated industry this is the biggest tool that she has. Evelyn does not play the victim in this though. She embraces it and doesn’t feel sorry for herself. She acknowledges that men are going to use her. She turns this around and uses them in return.If this book is not made into a blockbuster movie I will be amazed. I can’t wait to read Taylor Jenkins Reid’s next book coming out next week (Daisy Jones and the Six). Although I do wish we could have more of Evelyn!Everyone must read this. Don’t relieve me? Scroll through goodreads and see how many reviewers have but this one on their favorites shelf!"
"Evelyn Hugo is one of the biggest, most fabulous Hollywood stars of all time (think Marilyn Monroe, Sophia Loren, and Elizabeth Taylor all wrapped into one magnificent actress).  Although she’s gained fame from the roles she’s played and the movies she’s made, she’s just about—if not more— as famous for her personal life.  Now that Evelyn is older, with even her “golden years” behind her, she’s ready to tell her story.  When she chooses the virtually unknown journalist Monique Grant to not just interview her, but to write her biography, no one is more surprised (and suspicious) as Monique.  Just as with her book, Daisy Jones & The Six, Taylor Jenkins Reid has a way of making the reader “see” her characters.  As Evelyn tells her life story to Monique, I felt as if I were watching it on television.  All I can say is I want more, more of Evelyn, more of Daisy, more of these characters – more Taylor Jenkins Reid!"
"Neither The book description nor the front cover were of interest to me. I read several reviews and decided that I needed to see what all of the hype was a out. I’m glad I did.The story starts out with Evelyn doing whatever she has to do (literally) to get out of Hell’s kitchen and become a movie star. She uses her sexuality to get to the top, but how far will she go to stay at the top? How will she know when she’s at the top?Why did Evelyn select a virtual unknown to write her memoir? I knew there would be a twist at some point but I was unable to figure it out until the last chapter.A good book. I’m glad I read it and feel like I really do know Evelyn Hugo."
"Love the lesbian romance. If you want a slow burn heart aching story of forbidden love this is the book for you.But if you are looking for depth and richness to the writing this isn’t it. The storyline is captivating but simple, nothing too complex to people’s emotions of thoughts. I also thought that the portrait of Evelyn as a bisexual was a bit forced and sounded so much like a personal agenda from the writer to have that down on the paper than a true feature of the character.I would still read it over again but that’s just because lesbian romance is so good yet so scarce in literature. Giving 5 stars to support the effort"
"I enjoy the way this author writes, always giving interesting perspectives to think about. The story intrigued me because this Hollywood starlet, Evelyn Hugo, had multiple facets to her life and personality, but very few actually knew the real person underneath. And having seven husbands is rather indicative of a colorful history. However, Evelyn was far from perfect and she knew how to manage the spotlight, but she made sacrifices for the sake of stardom and it did cost her. She definitely delivers a fascinating biography that could not have been guessed by reading the tabloid headlines and teaches the writer, Monique, some very complex lessons."
"This book was a page-turner, but that’s not to say that I read it super fast. I kept wanting to read because I was curious about the connection between Evelyn Hugo and Monique, but at some points, my interest waned. Towards the end, it picked up a lot, and I presumed that I’d figured out the connection, so I read it even faster to see if I was correct. I was, which I rarely am. So I think it was an interesting book, lots of complexities and discussion topics, but I’m not OVERLY enthusiastic about it. I also wish Monique’s marriage and divorce had been explored some more, and not wrapped up so hastily. Their last discussion was pretty profound, but I wanted a little more substance."
I think I saw this at Thrift Books  as a highly rated book.  Very disappointing. I barely got through several chapters before discarding. The plot has zero depth.
"“There’s Evelyn Hugo for you. Somewhere in the middle.”I think that’s what I take away from this book, besides me feeling completely annihilated. People and relationships are never perfect. The author knows this fact and tells the story in such a way that no one’s a true villain or a hero but all are flawed and vulnerable humans beings. Evelyn Hugo’s life unfolds in layers and messy nuances like a real biography. I fell for it. I hated her; I loved her. There are lines on every page that I want to highlight. I’m going to be thinking about this one for years."
"I quit reading this book about 50 pages in because the writing was so god-awful.  After a while, even with Evelyn Hugo's sordid lifestyle, it didn't intrigue me enough to continue reading.  I closed the book for good with the hope that the person who buys it off Goodwill will like it better than I did."
"I felt misled by this book and its plot.  The title, the summary...everything. If you are looking for a book that revolves around a lesbian love affair---here it is."
"I don’t think I’ve devoured a book this amazing (and purposeful not in one night) in a very long time. Why did I not read it before?!?! It was like Evelyn Hugo, beautifully suspenseful and always knew just how much to give and tease the reader.Before reading the book, I’d heard rumors that this book contained an LGBT+ relationship in it. I was skeptical tbh and thought it was all going to be a tease but, boy, was I wrong. This has mass diversity rep all throughout novel. Also, I liked how the time skips were set 👌 . They worked really well and it didn’t skip too much or too little.Before 2019 is over, I’m definitely reading it again!"
"4.5 starsI fell in love instantly with the cover of the hardback edition.  When I found out it was a story about an actress during the Old Hollywood era, I knew I had to get my hands on this book as I love that type of stuff.  I am so glad to report back this is a book that is worthy of the hype!Aging Hollywood star Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell her life story.  But she's only willing to spill her secrets to Monique Grant, a fairly unknown magazine reporter.  Monique's husband has just left her and taking on this job opportunity might provide a healthy distraction and potentially be a huge career booster.  As she learns more and more about Evelyn, Monique realizes ambition can sometimes come at a cost.This is the type of book that I think everyone might take away something different.  Love is certainly a theme of the book whether it be romantic relationships, friendships or even the lengths parents are willing to go to for their child.  For me the strength of the book was just Evelyn.  The author did an amazing job capturing this complicated woman.  I love these types of books that span a person's lifetime and you get to share in pivotal moments in their life, the good and the bad.  Showing old Hollywood with the glamour and also the seedy side really added to the story as well.I only have a teeny, tiny criticism and that is I just wish I would have connected more with one of the relationships in Evelyn's life.  Other than a few touching moments towards the end, I was disappointed I didn't feel more.  I guess that's why even though I did love the book, it didn't quite reach 5 star level.  However, this truly is a gem of a book and I don't hesitate in recommending it if you haven't already checked it out!"
"This is a story about Evelyn Hugo, a young woman who is determined to get to Hollywood, and will not regret any of her decisions to get there. Now she is at the end of her career and those she loved are gone, she wants to have a her biography written before she dies. She pulls Monique Grant, a young woman just beginning her career in journalism to record her story much to her surprise and that of her employer. There is a reason for this choice which is not revealed till the end of the book. Not only does Evelyn's life story keep you repeating to yourself  “ I cannot believe this...” but you’ll wonder what Monique’s connection is to Evelyn’s life."
"I expected an all fluff read and what I got out of this book was so much more. This is both a quick and easy beach read but also a deeply moving, emotional story of a life.... lived. Neither well or badly I suppose.This book is peppered with good advice all women should heed - never trust a man with something to prove and it’s ok to grovel for something you really want- and so many different relationships with varying degrees of intimacy that we all experience at one time or another. The lesson Evelyn Hugo taught me will stay with me a long time."
"Something happens in the beginning of the book that kind of turned me off to our protagonist and I was worried that it would ruin the book for me BUT, that didn’t happen.Evelyn Hugo is one Badass Bitch. I love her. She is smart, beautiful, and ruthless. She got everything she wanted...almost. As she takes you through her life and the hard lessons she learned, the stories become more and more heartbreaking and by the end, you are just sobbing.I stayed up until 5am to finish the book last night and I have to say it was hard this morning to not open the book and start reading it all over again.Great book."
"Before reading this, I wasn’t sure what to expect. At first I thought maybe the story revolves around one specific person that Evelyn loved and that would be the end of it. Instead, this story far exceeded my expectations, and I’m amazed.I loved how the story was split into the different era’s of Evelyn’s life, and how each relationship shaped her into the person she became. That being said, I wouldn’t say each marriage defined Evelyn, but she was the kind of woman who, took charge of her own life, and was absolutely fierce.I feel like I’m talking about a real person, but after reading this book I can’t help but imagine her to have been a real person. This book was a roller coaster from beginning to end ( in the best way possible). This book gave us a look into the glamorous yet dark reality behind Hollywood, and the life of Evelyn Hugo.I can definitely picture myself re-reading this book, I fell in love with the story, and now I want to go out and get my own emerald green dress.Highly recommend reading this book! Happy reading!"
"I had seen this book everywhere and everyone was giving it lots of great reviews so I was definitely intrigued. But sometimes a book being reviewed so well gets me nervous that I may not like it. Fortunately, I was worried over nothing, because there is no doubt that this book met the expectations I had because of all the great reviews. Evelyn is irresistible in every way. She’s bold, beautiful and gives her opinion freely which is why I loved her character. I couldn’t wait to find out more and more about the story of Evelyn Hugo. This book dives into the many stories of Evelyn’s life and relationships plus a secret that she has held closely for decades. Also, since June is pride month I encourage you to read this book now. You won’t regret it! This is one of my favorite reads this year."
"Great summer read! It’s one of those books that you cannot put down once you start it.About a a girl coming of age, while turning into a Hollywood Starlet in the 50’s and 60’s. When men had all the power and if you were a woman who wanted power of her own, you had to do some not nice things.The style of writing and the details make you feel like you’re watching a movie, not reading a book. The “articles” dispersed throughout the pages give it a feel of realism while giving the reader the perspective of the outside world at the time- while the reader continues to get the inside story from Evelyn Hugo herself. You see the distortions from what people see, compared to what is actually happening.If you’re a fan of ‘Daisy Jones & the Six’, you will like The Seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo. It had the same feel and pace."
I have owned this book since it came out and just didn’t have a chance to read it so when it was a book of the month for an online book group I belong to I thought I should join in.I am almost sorry that I waited so long to enjoy this luxurious story of old Hollywood Glam! The detail and narrative  in which the story is told felt incredibly real as if you were watching a film! You could visualize every detail and at times felt like Ms. Hugo was having a conversation with you!  The brutal honesty of Evelyn Hugo is refreshing and heart wrenching at the same time.This is a brilliant read that digs deep into the soul of this fictional movie star and shares secrets that you know many have lived through in real life.
"Evelyn Hugo is an aging Hollywood sex symbol and icon who has had her picture splashed on the front pages of tabloids for over half a century. By ""icon"", think Olivia de Havilland, Lauren Bacall, Sophia Loren.Over the years, the public never seemed to tire of reading about Evelyn, particularly her love life.  There was plenty of juicy stuff to write about. She married seven times. But in reality, the public knew very little about the real Evelyn Hugo. She'd never allowed an ""authorized"" biography, never given in-depth interviews, and was always coy when reporters' questions got too personal.Monique Grant, a 35 year old magazine writer is beyond surprised when she learns that Evelyn Hugo wants her to write Evelyn's life story.  Why? Why now, and why Monique, when anyone would jump at the chance to write it? A tell-all book about Evelyn Hugo would be sure to hit the bestseller list before the ink was dry. (The connection between Evelyn and Monique becomes apparent at the end of the book.)When Monique and Evelyn first get together to collaborate on the book, Monique asks which of Evelyn's seven husband's was her one true love. Evelyn doesn't answer directly. But eventually we learn the answer to that question.This book grew on me. It went from three stars to four, and kept getting better, and the ending did not disappoint.  It was a five star ending. So that's what I'm giving this book. Five stars."
"I was afraid this book was gonna b boring & lack depth, but it definitely had DEPTH & the story was fantastic from beginning to end!I loved the fact that every woman can deeply relate to the characters.Evelyn was both “good” & “bad” & in the end, she found her peace in being TRUE to herself…..I believe  peace can’t come without being our authentic selves. ⭐️This book, in a way, was about living our TRUTH….  Living for the things that really matter to us.And the ending is like an extra cherry on top!💥💥💥💥"
"Without question one of my FAVORITE reads of 2017. I have long been a fan of Taylor Jenkins Reid and yet, with this newest release of hers, I found myself thinking multiple times at just how much she'd upped the game.This is a novel that transcends book club fiction and is borderline literary in the way Curtis Sittenfeld and J. Courtney Sullivan straddle those two worlds. I had one of those reading experiences where I simultaneously couldn't put the book down and yet kept drawing out the time I was spending reading it because I didn't want my time with the Hollywood starlet Evelyn Hugo to win.I have always appreciated how TJR can masterfully weave twists you don't always see coming into her works and this book was no exception. The final chapters were gripping and I finished the read believing it was one of the most satisfying endings to a novel I'd had in quite some time.Would HIGHLY recommend and am excited that my book club let me convince them to read this for our summer pick. One friend who borrowed my copy and plowed through it in two days told me that Evelyn felt more real to her than Hollywood startlets like Liz Taylor and Rita Hayworth. I couldn't agree more."
"This is the third book I've read by Taylor Jenkins-Reid. I really enjoyed the first two, but yet I was still surprised how much I loved The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Maybe it's because I've never met an Evelyn I didn't like, or maybe because Mrs Jenkins-Reid is an extraordinary creative writer and story teller.  This book had me at page one and kept me interested until the very end. I had to force myself to stop reading and get off my couch to be productive. All I wanted to do was keep reading about Evelyn, Celia, Monique and the stories they had to tell.  I cried often, laughed, and was sad when the story ended. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a good story, strong characters, and a book you don't want to put down."
"What a wild ride. Quite different from what I usually read. A tale of a manipulative woman at her best...and worst. A story from 50's Hollywood and an actress who had the power. Fame made her life wonderful and horrible. Seven marriages, one true love and everything she had to do (or not do) to maintain her lifestyle. Character development could have been a little deeper, I had a hard time really imagining what Evelyn looked like, other than her trademark assets. A pretty good mystery too involving her chosen biographer. Compelling read."
First of all I love fictional history stories where I can drown myself in these characters.  Evelyn was such a total wreck of a character that I fell for her immediately and the way it was written there was no sugar coating at all.  Taylor Reid has an immense way of writing and this is the 1st book of hers that I have read.  The backstory was engaging with teases along the way of what was to come BUT I still wasn't ready when it came.  The emotion I felt along the way is something that is rare and I appreciate the creativeness needed to write this type of book.  Bravo Taylor and great work!
"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugoby Taylor Jenkins Reid⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 4/5My Thoughts: (Instagram @clarasreading)This is the first book I have read by Taylor Jenkins Reid.  I read it based on many recommendations. Although it was an easy read, I cannot say I share the same level of admiration others have expressed.I did appreciate that the author gave us a realistic, multifaceted perspective on the entertainment industry's true inter-workings. The era, media platforms, and elitist actions may have changed, but disturbing practices still exist.I found the plot predictable, and I could not become invested in the characters as much as I usually would for a book I rate with four stars.  So why did I rate it four stars?  Two reasons. First, I appreciated the ownership of the intention and actions of the main character. And most importantly, I believe the overall message the author conveyed is an important one. We must remain true to ourselves, and no amount of money or fame can make you happy otherwise.My standard disclaimer: I read and review mainly historical and literary fiction that focus on human and social elements that are adult in nature and often present sensitive topics. I recommend that anyone potentially interested in reading this or any novel research it thoroughly if there are topics that you would prefer to avoid."
"I did not expect how much this story would affect me. This book took me through an emotional roller-coaster as I experienced the life journey of Evelyn Hugo. I was immersed in the writing and couldn't put the book down - I laughed, I got angry, I felt bad, I cried, and ultimately, I fell in love with all of the main characters. Through the magical and genuine writing of Taylor Jenkins, I got to experience the lives of the rich and famous in Old Hollywood, the betrayals, the ruthless ambitions and ultimately the tragedy of real love. After I finished reading this book, I went to the bathroom and had a good cry. Even though I personally have not experienced any of the events described in the book in my real life, I felt like I have and could relate. This book is amazing and I wish they would make a movie out of it."
"This is now one of my favorite novels.  Ever.  It caught my interest immediately. Was I reading People Magazine about Elizabeth Taylor?  Well, no not exactly. But I was reading about Hollywood in years gone by.  The development of the story, the manipulation by Evelyn Hugo, and the path she took will stay with me for years to come.  My favorite line, without giving away a spoiler:  ""...they are just husbands.  I am Evelyn Hugo.""  For anyone with a secure sense of self and self-concept, this line resonates.  Bravo, Evelyn, and thanks to Taylor Jenkins Reid for the ride!"
"This book... Taylor Jenkins Reid can just slay me with words. I don't think I have ever read a book of hers I didn't love. Evelyn Hugo was amazing as a character, as a person, I just loved her refusal to take anything less than she deserved. She is so strong and yet so real and so sad. I had no idea where the story was going until I did and I refuse to spoil it for anyone else, I just need everyone to pick up this book and read it. Then I need everyone to yell about how amazing it is as much as I am because I don't want to be screaming alone. I don't know what took me so long to pick it up, mainly because it is a very hyped book but it's worth its hype."
A 4.7 for me.  I felt like I was actually a part of Old Hollywood.  I could picture exactly how the characters looked and what their voices sounded like.  I loved the character development and interactions.  I loved the honesty and the grit.  I loved how the author made sure we wouldn’t “pity” Evelyn.  Nope- Evelyn owned all of her choices.  But that doesn’t mean that I wasn’t devastated for her in the end.  I wanted a little more from Monique.  I will definitely be thinking of this book for a long time.  A great read!“Don’t ignore half of me so you can fit me in a box.  Don’t do that.”  Evelyn Hugo
I enjoyed reading the seven husbands of Evelyn hugo.  It was an easy read with strong character development.  I would recommend this book as a good choice during travel.  It's a book that you just want to continue going.  You can easily put this book down and pick it up a few days later and quickly remember the story line.
"It was very well written, with an appropriate amount of complexity, and I did enjoy reading it, but I was disappointed in the ending. As a breast cancer survivor myself, I'm concerned that it sends a message to other women with that diagnosis, especially if it's the early stages, that suicide is better than treatment. I realize the character is an old woman who has lost everyone she's ever loved, and she deserves to die with dignity, but as a reader, I wish the author would have picked a different diagnosis for the character. When 1 in 8 women are diagnosed with this disease, having a main character give up without a fight, may send a harmful message."
"I made it through 25%. A great premise but had to repeatedly emphasize  everyone's skin color, gender issues and of course there's a gay character. Would have been nice to have more well developed characters and a  novel storyline. So predictable."
"I’m not sure you could really say this book has a happy ending, but my heart feels so light after finishing it. I laughed a lot, there are some truly hilarious moments, but I also thought a lot - quiet deep thoughts. And yes, I cried. There’s something really deep and tender and heartbreaking about this book. Maybe that’s because I know that there are many many people keeping secrets the way Evelyn does in this story.Over all, this was a marvelous engaging story with the added benefit of artful writing."
"For the first time, I dove into a book I had no expectations of. I read the synopsis of the book and thought, ""Could be good."" What I didn't expect was to be enraptured, captivated, and emotionally attached by the end.From the Golden age of Hollywood to modern times. From subjects that were taboo in the 50s, 60s, and forward (even in Hollywood), to scandals and impossible life choices. This story grips you and keeps you until the story is done. I laughed, I cried, and felt every emotion the author wanted you to feel. This book is a must read."
"I was really enjoying this book for about 85% of it. I was making comparisons to The Thirteenth Tale and Valley of the Dolls, two of my all-time favorites. The portions of narration by Evelyn are completely riveting and I wanted to know what happened with her story.The frame story, not so much. I mean, it was okay, but it did not compare to the underlying story.But.BUT.That ending, man. That was so completely trite and just...no. No. It completely flattened my suspension of disbelief and left it for dead. It was maybe the worst-written ending to a book this fabulous I've ever read.I gave the other 85% of the book four stars because it was so enthralling I read the whole thing in less than 24 hours. But that ending, man. I am NOT a fan.4 stars. But it was a 5 star novel up to a point."
"Laying on the couch, reading, and sipping tea as the last days of the winter break fade away. I wanted this to be a fun read. A lazy afternoon read. The story touches topics that might have lead to a meaty tale but in the end it just skims the surface. LGBTQ, gender issues, poverty, abuse, addiction, racism -- all in a short 3 hour read. Such a smorgasbord of topics told with about as much depth and realism as scuba diving in a kiddie pool.  The book is filled with opportunities to tell a meaningful story, they just never happen. Too many clichés, too much heavy foreshadowing; I couldn't fall into the story. The switch in tenses between Evelyn's history and Monique's brief interludes was annoying and unnecessary."
"This book is not bad. I read it for book club, and am looking forward to the conversations at said club around the themes in ‘Seven Husbands’.The pace was good, the mystery was good. The character development was inconsistent; both main characters read like the same person. Also, the period-piece aspect of the book was underdeveloped, especially apparent in the dialogue-I could never quite believe that Evelyn Hugo was from a different era.Looking beyond the syntax and the shortfalls of the writing, I liked having an easy read to dive into while my in-laws visited, though I wouldn’t recommend going out of one’s way to read it."
"I started this book and I was hooked , engrossed, engaged ,obsessed with finishing it. I was intrigued and was just loving this book so very much. The storyline is wonderful and heartbreaking and fascinating at the same time. It's a story about a entire life ,nearly 80 years of a life and all that happens in those yearsThe good the bad and the heartbreak.The author writes so well, the editing is perfect and the characters are so unique , some you love ,some you hate , some are so endearing and others end up in total  redemption in my eyes.I highly recommend this book, it's excellent and filled with pure fiction greatness and I'm excited to have found this amazing new author.5 star read, well done !!!!!!!"
"Wow! This book was enthralling. I couldn’t put it down. Reid flips between past and present, painting a vivid picture of Evelyn navigating her rise to stardom in old Hollywood.  Reid’s Evelyn is a strong, multi-dimensional character who shares her story with Monique, an unknown writer. Through their interviews for Evelyn’s biography, it becomes clear to Monique that there’s a specific reason that Evelyn chose Monique to write the biography. Reid weaves a complicated and intriguing tale as Evelyn reveals all her secrets - and the secrets are not what you expect!"
"I ordered this book because I was looking for a quick fun read but it was that and more. This was my first book written by Taylor Jenkins Reid, but it won’t be my last because I have already ordered more. If you are looking for a fast fun book to read with hidden insights on human nature, this is the book you are looking for. It reinforced my belief that most things in life are not always black and white but  with some tones of grey. I hated for it to end and I’m anxiously waiting for my next book to arrive."
"I am a little disappointed to see the negative reviews on this book, so I thought I'd write one myself. At the beginning of 2020, I was desperate to find a book with a good storyline as I was tired of reading self-help books. I came across this novel during a book review on Youtube, and I purchased it from Amazon immediately. You'll notice pretty quickly that this is an easy read and written with tons of details to help you imagine old Hollywood (which I can appreciate). Without giving any spoilers away, there is a mystery behind the main storyline, and it wasn't at all what I was expecting. The most important thing I took away from this novel was that nothing is how it seems in Hollywood.  We may think we know the stories and the people behind the camera when, in reality, we are just fed whatever entertains us. I felt inspired by the main character, Evenly Hugo's strength and savagery. She made the sacrifices necessary to make all her dreams come true with a tremendous amount of pressure as the whole world was watching. There are so many more brilliant things to say about this novel. I recommend anyone who loves keeping up with celebrities or enjoys a good love story to read this book."
"It was fun to read a bit of fluff during a pandemic,  but I was disappointed that this was essentially a merger of the real life stories of Rita Hayworth and Elizabeth Taylor. I envisioned the author flowcharting the plot as a set of modules slightly modified from those biographies. I guess that’s one way to churn out a novel in short order."
"What an unbelievably good book. After reading Daisy Jones and the Six, I knew I had to pick up another Taylor Jenkins Reid book and I’m so glad I did.This book follows the story of Evelyn Hugo and the life she lived as a major Hollywood Star, the scandals that were woven throughout her life and the lengths someone goes to protect themselves and the ones they love. Beautifully written, completely captivating and surprises at every turn. Loved this book!"
"I couldn't even read the last third of the book.  Just because a lot happens to a character, doesn't mean you are developing the depth of them.  I mean,....how many things can happen, how many tragedies could one endure, and still....you don't care because, they are all flat characters."
I gave not enjoyed a book this much in I don’t know how long and I read all the time! The character of Evelyn Hugo was so well written I couldn’t stop thinking about her. I couldn’t put this book down yet I didn’t want it to end. It’s a good reminder that things aren’t always what they seem and don’t believe everything you read. Thank you for this incredible book Taylor Jenkins Reid. I’ve loved all of your books but this is by far my favorite!!
"The Book is almost 400 pages.. and I read it in 9 days... I did not read the summary prior to purchasing it. I just happened to see people on instagram posting about it and I decided with all my life troubles, I needed to escape through a novel and this book did just that for me. It's a great story, easy to follow, and her thoughts are clearly expressed. I love this author now and will look into more of her work. You would never expect this to be an LGBTQ novel by the presentation, and it kept me intrigued the entire time. I also want to note the quality of the pages, theyre not too thin like some paperback books where the pages tear."
"Wow, how to put into words everything I feel about this book? TJR owns me! I read Daisy Jones & The Six earlier this year and loved it so much I had to read TJR’s other books. This book is a masterpiece, I could not put it down. I enjoyed getting to know Evelyn Hugo, I carefully listened to her recount every memorable moment in her life and had to constantly remind myself that she wasn’t a real person and I couldn’t actually just go search and watch her movies. This has become that “one book you always recommend to everyone” for me, and I can’t wait to make all my family and friends read it. EVERYONE MUST READ IT."
"I ordered this book because I like tales of the old Hollywood, real tales or fictional.  This book was such a tale, and a whole lot more.  To avoid spoilers, I'll just say that it goes to places that I never expected.  It's a book about a strong-willed woman several decades ahead of her time.  It's also about values and compromise and the damage of living a false life.  I enjoyed every bot of it.  It was hard to out it down.  Highly recommended,"
"Wow, I’m always so thankful to find a well written book that is hard to put down.  Thank you Taylor Jenkins Reid for gifting us with this novel.  Intriguing. I hardly noticed the length of the book. And, easy to stop and start without going backward.  Ok, nuff said. Best book of year for me."
Born in 1952 I lived threw rag mags of movie stars. This is definitely Liz’s life and all most suggested Debbie’s. You definitely did not create Evelyn. Waste of money. If you wanted to  glorify LGTB pick people more plausible.
"This book came highly recommended by a good friend and it did not disappoint. My first read by this author and I thought  her writing was flawless in how she glided from the past to the present...and tied all loose ends at the end. I completely understood Evelyn.....she did what she had to do in the environment she worked in...ruthless yes at times but also loving and kind.  It was a page turner....I read this book over Christmas weekend with overnight guests and all the cooking and finished it in two days!  I also loved the character Monique...she found strength which she never realized she had until she met Evelyn.  I highly recommend this amazing story, you will mesmerized by the life of Evelyn Hugo."
"What do I say about this book that hasn't already been said? Here's the thing, I was nervous to go into this one because I had not heard a single negative word about Evelyn, and I wondered how a book could transcend so many varying tastes? But when a story is this well-written, this captivating, this readable, this tragic and profound and lovely, it's going to win the hearts of many! The twists kept me guessing pretty close til the end and it was not what I thought it would be. The way that TJR weaves so many plot threads back in is just stunning. Evelyn herself is such a complex character. You love her. You hate her. You root for her. And you want to just slap the ever living shit out of her. But damn girl. Respect. She went out and di her thing and made no apologies. Her story is tragic and empowering and frustrating and beautiful. I am certain that i will be thinking about this one for years to come. Well worth the hype!"
"While I liked the premise of the story and how it addressed many crucial topics, I could not get past how awful Evelyn's dialogue was.. It sounded like she was 25-30, not 80 years old. I was hoping her words would be more dignified. Other than that, it was an interesting read. Some parts even had me emotional. The connection to Monique became pretty obvious at a certain point, though I wish Monique backstory was more intertwined."
This book will remain one of my favorite books of all time. I simply cannot recommend this book enough and harass all of my friends to read it so that they can experience the greatness of this book. It is simply a delight and took me by complete surprise. I binge read it in 2 days and could not put it down!! I love Evelyn and all the other characters in this book. This story was a beautiful one of love and loss that I couldn’t get enough of it! If you need a really good book to completely escape in this is the book for you! It is a masterpiece and will be one of the best books you will ever read! You will not regret reading it!
"The author is able to write and keep a story moving, however from the very first chapters she felt compelled to make us as “Woke” as she apparently is...yawn.  The main character is a mixed-race woman ✅✅, who found some recognition writing a paper on Pro-Human Euthanasia ✅. Then the story revolves about the hidden life of an actress revolving around LBGQ ✅✅✅✅.  I was annoyed I wasted my time and wish I had liked the characters more. I don’t understand the rave reviews unless written by those who also believe the whole world is a great big green evil meanie, and who feel compelled that everyone should grovel in constant angst.I now feel more compelled to find books that do not waste my time parading as novels but are just another link to forward the social justice agenda."
"In this novel about Hollywood glamour and the less-glamorous goings-on behind the scenes, the focus is on Evelyn Hugo. Evelyn was a huge star, and she led a very tumultuous life, almost the least aspect of which involved her having seven husbands. The husbands seemed to happen as asides, moves in a strategic game. This is a very good read, with a few messages about love and life deftly woven into the narrative without making it ponderous. Not profound, but very engaging."
"Poorly written, no redeeming quality. Elementary language. No development of plot, or of Monique’s life, or Grace’s or Dave’s. Very obvious statements to make you aware of a twist coming at the end & then no development there either. Very disappointing!"
This book was fine. I got about half way and wished she would wrap it up. I read her rock and roll book for my book club and that was way less developed and interesting. I don't get the hype about this author and no one in my book club did either.  There are better things to read.
"I read this as part of a bookclub and I loved it. I think Evelyn’s character was perfectly constructed. She wasn’t easy to like, but that is exactly how she had to be to thrive in the cut-throat world of fame. She made no apologies for how she was or how she lived her life, and honestly I think that is a lesson that a lot of women could do with learning – maybe not to the extreme that Evelyn took it but still. More of us need to be more confident and resolute in our decisions and do what is best for us. Ultimately it was a great love story, one that anybody can appreciate. The story flowed nicely and I didn’t see the twist at the end, how the main character was connected to Evelyn’s past. The reason she would hate Evelyn. It’s not often a book surprises me. I would definitely recommend other people to read this book."
This book was excellent! This is not your typical story at all! I truly had no idea what the book was about other than what the title implied. Evelyn Hugo is a rags to riches story of a young women who made her way to the top (and then some) in Hollywood. She is nearing the end of her life and wants to tell her life story and along the way wants to right a wrong. Her story is one of success and lots of twists! I don’t want to give anything about this story away because you’ll enjoy it more as it unfolds if you are surprised. I did love that the book was divided into sections based on the husband she was married to at the time. And the interspersing of tabloid stories was a hoot! You will enjoy the adventure of Evelyn’s life and maybe learn something about yourself along the way! I loved it.
"OMG! That's what I kept saying when I ended this book. Booktok made me buy this book and chile, I have been recommending this to everyone. This book was not only amazing, but very well written with the intent for you to feel emotionally connected to Monique and Evelyn. When you read this book, read it with the intent to be well immersed into both of their stories. I cried a little bit at the end of this book because of how beautifully written it was. This was amazing and is most definitely a must read. Don't thnk twice just buy the book. Let Evelyn and Monique break your heart and help you piece it back together. You'll definitely love this book!"
"The author does a fantastic job of capturing the pain of loss. It's a really well told story - Evelyn Hugo really does have an interesting life.  This book is ultimately about sexual preference, though.  I wish I had known that because I probably wouldn't have read it. I'm a little weary of being constantly bombarded with LGBTQ issues. This book ends up being one big lecture when most of us already don't care who you sleep with."
The reviews on this book was quite high. So going into it I had hoped it would live up to the hype. I hated it! Honestly the main character is detestable and because of that I couldn’t care less about what she went through. I wish I could get my money back.
This book was cleverly created in several ways. We read a little about the narator who is interviewing and gathering the details for a biography. Her task is something she has not saught out and it seems too good to be true. The aging movie star who has summonsed her to write her life story gives us insight into old Hollywood and the magic of rising to fame with all its costs. Both are very different voices. They are clear independent characters and they appear to have nothing in common. A feeling of foreboding is generated as the book nears closure. The end is a surprise that neatly seals the deal. Easy to read and well crafted writing.
"I was really hoping to love this book but ultimately found it to be vapid and weak. It was a quick read, and from a pure storytelling aspect, it was a pleasant read.  I think that this author isn’t a good fit for my reading taste. Clearly, I am in the minority."
"Yes!!!I have been waiting for a book that lives up to its hype and makes me want to recommend it to all my book-loving-friends... here it is!Evelyn Hugo, award winning beautiful Hollywood starlet, recruits Monique, a writer not quite known for her work, to tell her life story.  And that life story just happens to include her one true love.But is it even one of her seven husbands?Incredible writing, character development, and writing style!"
"I love books whose world and characters I can dissolve into temporarily as pure escape. This was one of those books. I would happily retreat to bed each night knowing the world of Evelyn Hugo was waiting for me. There were complex and clever aspects of this book (some, including the meaning behind the narrative device) that do not get revealed until the end. There were characters you loved and hated, and often they were the same people. This book of glamourous times of yore manages to read fresh and modern, with the main themes still resonant in 2017. Thank you, Taylor Jenkins Reid, for a very satisfying read."
"I kept hearing from my book friends, read this book. I of course procrastinated it. It's one of those books where I'm sorry I did. I love the bisexual representation of Evelynn in this book.The other thing I really appreciated, was how none of the characters in this book were good or bad per say. All of them, and I do mean all, were just fundamentally flawed people, being people, who mess up in life and make mistakes.This book had me laughing and crying. I really bawled my eyes out in the last five chapters. I needed whole box of tissues. Haven't had a book make me cry this hard ever!"
"I expected to think this book was ""meh"". I expected old Hollywood glamour and scandal and romance and those are typically not my thing. But it was on sale and had amazing reviews. I'm so glad I went for it. It's one of my favorite reads of the year. AndI've read a lot. It's beautiful and touching and surprising. A lovely page turner that will keep you thinking about it long after you've turned the last page."
"This is not the typical type of book I would choose to read, and quite frankly when my book club announced we were reading this one, I rolled my eyes. I'm so glad I ended up reading it, though. There were many prolific quotes that stuck with me, and I found myself highlighting them while making my way through it. Although I really thought that Monique was a terribly weak character and sort of pathetic, Evelyn Hugo made up for it tenfold. What a force to be reckoned with. A great read."
"I am so impressed by this author's writing talents and this novel held my interest throughout! This novel and her to be released novel in 2021 (eARC in exchange for my review) are the only two I have read by her and I am already a fan. What versatility she has to write on such varied topics! I would read DAISY & THE SIX if I were a music fan but since I'm not, I'd like to spend time reading other novels."
"I loved this book! Evelyn is a character you should hate but you don't. I love the rep in the book! The honesty of the struggles women, POC, and LGBTQ+ have to go through in Hollywood back in the day was interesting, not that things are close to perfect was today. There were so many interesting relationships in the book, almost all seemed to be built on lies except for a couple special ones. I definitely cried in this one more than I have in awhile. So happy I read it though!"
"I wanted to like this book. I couldn’t get past the first five pages. The central characters are biracial and homosexual and yet it’s written by a white heterosexual woman. As a biracial woman, I found this to be problematic. I would rather elevate black and queer voices by reading their true source material than to read a white woman’s interpretation of the black experience."
"Very much enjoyed this book-the author’s style is unique & I found myself wanting to know everything single detail from the very start...the book is terribly sad in many ways...society, systemic culture & pressure of living in this world is tremendous in itself - incorporating feeling you can never be authentically your true self...this book was a wonderful read for someone who wants to have all ‘the feelings’ I certainly did...and I recommend it to everyone."
"After reading the reviews, I thought I would give this book a try. I feel like the reviews are over hyping this book. After 3 chapters I thought maybe the story would get better but it didn't. It's super slow and kinda boring in my opinion."
"I bought this after completing Daisy Jones and the Six, so I knew I was a fan of the author's writing style.  I really love how she pulls a story together, and also delivers key ingredients in bite-sized portions, so to speak.  I like that this story is both complex and easy to read.  I have been reading it for 3 days and I'll most likely finish today or tomorrow.  Highly recommend."
"This book took me on a journey. I suppose that I already knew I would cry based off of other reviews but I didn’t think that it would grab my heart outta my chest and really make me ugly cry like it did but here we are... ballin like a baby. I loved it, I loved how calculated it was.. I truly feel it’s a top book for me and I would recommend it to anyone else who is in need a good book."
"This seemed like creative nonfiction rather than fiction. I had to keep checking. It’s rang so true to me. With the perspective of the journalist and the movie-star as narrators, it worked very well. Also, this seems like the perfect time to read it as there are a lot of themes in the book that deal with the miss perceptions of people who were “other” back n the 40s and 50s. Big thumbs up."
"I enjoy reading, but I am typically the type of person to pick up a book and read very slowly... like months will go by before I pick start the next chapter, but I can honestly say I have never read a book so fast in my life! It took me only about a week to get through. It had me captivated at every page and wanting to learn more about all of the characters and what happens to them. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone, its easy and light, but also discusses some tough issues along the way."
I understand the hype behind this book now! I loved reading about Evelyn's life and I liked how complex Evelyn was a character. I liked that she was unapologetic about who she is and that she says that she would do it all over again. Celia I didn't like so much...without getting into spoilers there was something about her I didn't like and although it was sort of resolved at the end I just didn't like her
"WOW. Okay, I had a feeling I would love this book but I did not know I would devour it the way I did. I could not put it down. It was just that good. I majority of the book over a two day period and I could have finished in one. Also, why hasn't this book been picked up for a movie??!! I loved everything about this book and the story kept me engrossed from the first page. I had to know all the secrets and lies of Evelyn Hugo. The writing and storytelling were captivating. If you like a mystery and old Hollywood glamour, you will love this book. Even the side characters were wonderful and delightful. My only critique is that I wish there was more.I will leave you with one of my favorite lines from the book:""So do yourself a favor and learn how to grab life by the balls, dear. Don't be so tied up trying to do the right thing when the smart thing is so painfully clear.""5/5 Stars just go read the damn thing."
"This book arrived early and in great condition. In addition the story in this book is FLAWLESS. The characters feel so real that by the end i was looking up if they where real people. This story and these characters hold a special place in my heart, and if you are looking for a book you physically can't put down, this is the book for you. And yes. It is worth the hype."
"Interesting story. The perspectives of celebrity media - both how it's used to manipulate the public and manipulate the celebrity- is used to tell the story of an actress moving her way up the Hollywood ladder and the many things she has to hide, fight, fake, and exploit. And then a writer who gets rich off of the ultimate celebrity gossip: the tell-all. It sounds petty and shallow, but really, it was a good read."
"I tend not to read this genre of books but gave in to the hype and I am so glad that I did.  You know things like this go on in Hollywood, Evelyn's story made me think of some couples.  I kept trying to figure out the twist, but I was not able to, and I enjoy that.Three other people have borrowed this book already and they LOVED it as well and read it within days."
"This was our book club read this month.  I rarely have time to read during the school year, but I was so obsessed with this book, I was reading it while brushing my teeth, walking down the hall, etc.  You will love and hate Evelyn.  Every actor is so thoroughly built, you feel like you know every one of them.  The only issue is what do you read after this roller coaster of a book?!?"
When I saw about this book I was excited to read it and had heard so many great things. So I bought it and when I started reading it I found it hard to get into and was extremely disappointed. I had to push myself to finish it and overall thought it was a huge let down because I had such high hopes for this book.
"I read this for book club, and it wasn't my favorite.  I didn't really like Evelyn or her motives and at least one of the ""twists"" at the end could be seen coming a mile away.  I realize much of the novel was based in different, more conservative times, but I also know that money shelters people from much of what almost everyone in the novel seemed to fear."
"This book was astoundingly brilliant. Every sentence was purposeful. Taylor Jenkins Reid had command of the narrative from beginning to end. It made me want to scour the internet for an Evelyn Hugo movie even knowing that she was a purely fictional character. Complex is too simple a word to describe this story, Evelyn Hugo, or her seven husbands. She’s the definition of Gaslight, Gatekeep, Girlboss. Unironically. I don’t want to spoil it so I can’t give as thorough a praise as I would like here but this was the best book I’ve read in a while. I’ll be thinking about it for weeks. It’ll creep into my dreams. I’m still reeling."
"I have a new favorite author. I enjoyed ""Evidence of the Affair"", and was intrigued enough to read another book. And after the 2nd book I thought ""I THINK I have a new favorite author"". ""The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo"" clinched it. I OFFICIALLY have a new favorite author. I was spellbound during all the books and couldn't read fast enough to find out the conclusion even though I knew it would be the end of the book. She reaches a depth in each character that I rarely have found with other authors. I'm sucked into the story and am powerless to fight it. Just what I'm looking for in each book I pick up."
"Count me among the “it was OK” crowd. I guessed the twist at the end (partially, at least) by chapter 2, and was surprised at Evelyn’s lack of character development (other than her sexual orientation) given the rave reviews. It was a strong start despite seeing the twist coming, but by the last third of the book I was losing interest fast, but was determined to finish and see if I was right. 🤷‍♀️"
"Meh. Spoiler:  I think this could have been good if the author had focused on her marriages, left out the lesbian bit. It was somewhat contrived and ‘tried’ too hard. The story could have stood alone as a story about a shrewd actress with several husbands  without the secret lesbian love plot."
"I love everything about the bygone era of Hollywood and my favorite non-fiction books are biographies of actors from long ago, which I collect, so this story was right up my alley. This book had all the feels of the old Hollywood glamour system, and the scandals and heartbreak that came along with it. I loved everything about the character, Evelyn Hugo, and was rooting for her the entire length of the book.  She is the epitome of so many actresses of that era.  This has quickly become my favorite book out of my most recent reads and, with the current quarantine, I've been reading a lot.  The only negative I felt was when I got to the end.. I was sad that the emotional, wild ride was over."
"Honestly, I bought this because I liked the cover, but once I started reading, I was hooked.  What a great story, and such a unique way to tell it.  It led me straight to ""Daisy Jones and The Six"", another Taylor Jenkins Reid fantastic work. I've now ordered the rest of her novels and just finished ""After I Do"".  She is my new favorite author."
"I loved this book. The only people who left it low ratings seem to be people who can’t handle reading a book that has a main character with a different set of ideals than their own. She isn’t meant to be you, she’s meant to be herself. It’s literally a fictional book, don’t be a snowflake. The story keeps you turning the pages, wanting to know what else will happen."
"I was attracted to the story from the beginning! I kept working hard to picture all the Directors and Movie Stars from the golden age of Hollywood. I couldn’t wait to get back to the story! Toward the end, I almost couldn’t put it down. I enjoyed the setting, the characters and the story. I didn’t know if I liked Evelyn or hated her. What a complex character. It made me wonder how many real public figures have had to hide their true identity. That was a disappointing thought, but at the same  important to think about. I enjoyed the book!"
"Contrary to popular opinion, I did not enjoy this book. There really was no climax, and it was predictable. I couldn't wait for it to end."
"Evelyn Hugo was such a complex person. She was good and bad, beautiful and ugly, smart and savvy and she owned it all. She knew she wasn't always a good person but she owned her life. She did what she had to do to survive and make it in life. I loved that about her. I loved her confidence, her assurance that her life was her own. I also enjoyed watching Monique grow and become a more confident stronger woman because of her interactions with Evelyn. Great story, great characters. I loved it!"
This book was seriously amazing. It was really interesting and gripping but also heartbreaking and thought-provoking. It was funny cuz I thought initially it would be a light read about a woman that marries a bunch of different men but it was so deep and so so good. I would recommend it to anyone. I honestly can't get over how good it was.
"After reading this book, I can 100% see why it is so highly recommended all over bookstagram and booktok. This story was amazing and each character was so well developed and thought out. I found myself invested in the telling of Evelyn's life as well as learning about Monique throughout the chapters. This is a highly recommended read from us at Well Reds!"
"I had expectations for this book so I went into reading it expecting to be wow’d. I did stay engaged while reading it and it does move fast enough for my ADHD brain. I finished it in about 3 days.I like the twist, and the political stand didn’t bother me. However I found most of the characters pretentious, boring, and lacking any real personality at all. It’s not a sophisticated book and it did not challenge me to think in any way. Despite liking the love story, I think this book just bounced around way too much, had very little depth, and character development was poorly executed. Not to mention I HATED the themes and ‘old Hollywood’ really does not intrigue me. Would much prefer an old classic like Jane Austen.Would recommend to mature teens and maybe women in early 20’s but that’s pushing it."
"This story is a lesson of love and life.  You can't always choose the person with whom you fall in love.  It depicts the old Hollywood standard of movie stars and how they achieved stardom.  But in the end...the only reality is love. Loving is the reason we are created.  Wonderful book, but sad and surprising at the same time.  Worth reading."
Interesting read on Hollywood movie stars and their rise to fame.  The idea of different types/reasons one would marry had never seemed so ordinary before this read!  Also interesting to understand why someone in the spotlight would keep quiet in such a political topic!  Sad how many people married and had other relationships but I love how those relationships were portrayed as beautiful respected companionship and love!
"Absolutely loved this book. It was amazing and such a beautiful insite on gow love and relationships can be so complex and simple all at the same time. It definitely has  times where the fairytale of how we imagine a marriage to be is shattered once you really get into the thick of things, or even just after the honeymoon stage is over. You get a little of insite to why (maybe) celebrities now have so many relationships... In the end people do things for different reasons. Some reasons good some bad, but they put in motion the ""machine"" that molds you and shapes your life. I LOVED this book."
"This book stays with you. The story of an iconic Hollywood actress/sex symbol/star and her as told to biographer, this book works on many levels.  It is a behind the scenes story of movie making, image making and the general business of Hollywood.  It is also  heart felt story of the nature of love in all its manifestations-parental love, romantic love, friendship, lust...  What I thought would be one of those Hollywood tell all novels,was surprising and nuanced.There's lots of sly humor and the characters are deeply drawn.  Loved this book.  Highly recommend and no spoilers here."
"A masterpiece of a evolved person who was afraid to live out her truth.  This book took you through the life of Evelyn Hugo and what sacrifices she made to find love. And when she did she didn’t know how to deal with it. Until she realizes life is what you make it. A whirlwind of friendships, passions, and most importantly LOVE."
What an incredibly well written and intriguing book!! This book is nothing what you think it will be!  Highly recommended it to anyone in the LGBTQ+ community. It really opened my eyes to some of the issues in the world today. It also helped me understand some of the internal struggles some people face when it comes to their own sexuality.
"I read this in a sitting. Enjoyable fun of everything I want in a beach read— glamour, sex, intrigue— but lacked the teeth it thought it had. It wants to make a statement but it came across as cliched and predictable. Still, an enjoyable read."
I just love the author! And I really enjoyed the story! I don't understand how people say it got boring or repetitive. NOT AT ALL! I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS ISN'T A SHOW! This would be a great limited series. Streaming networks need to get on this! Since reading this i have bought 3 more books from the author. It's worth the read!
"The story draws you in quickly and holds you to the end. Several of the plot twists are unexpected. Checks the boxes for Hollywood’s golden age, the price of fame, LGTBQ fight for equality, the meaning of family, the messy rules of attraction and the loss of love.  At times breezy, other times tearfully heartfelt, I’d highly recommend (and I typically read suspense or biographies.)"
"The ending partially redeemed this 1.5 star book, most of which I found sophomoric and plodding. Evelyn Hugo is not a character anyone could feel deeply for, nor is the narrator. Rather than the exciting movie star she’s supposed to be, she’s one-dimensional and boring. The reader is left with a vague regret for lost time better spent on a good novel."
"So many people were talking about this book when it was a Kindle Deal, I snapped it up, thinking it would be totally worth the low price. To my surprise, I couldn't put it down and I would have paid more for it had I known how well-written it was. (I usually don't like the latest ""popular"" books.) I was completely caught up in Evelyn's story. I highly recommend this book. It's instantly readable and you will love (or in some cases hate) the characters."
"After seeing many good reviews on this book, I immediately got my hands on a copy.This book was well written, I enjoyed it from beginning to end. Every detail given, story behind each husband and the things one as a woman must overcome for simply being them made it a good story. The detail I loved most about this book was how the author made her characters life be part of the LGBT community, from their personal life to how they were able to help, it was just a perfect touch. Overall if you're looking for a book that will keep you engaged and be hard to put down this may be one of them, at least it was for me."
"Very layered, very lovely. There are two huge bombshell moments in this book. One was telegraphed from early on but not in a specific way, just ominous. I was truly surprised by the reveal and it worked well. The husbands/scandalous love stories were compelling and fascinating. Evelyn is a mix between Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor."
I found this book to he such a great read I finished it within a week. The premise is about a fictional Hollywood icon who at the later years of her life decides she wants to tell all. She didn't have seven husband's without there being alot of juicy details to talk about. And the ending totally was not what I expected!
"Simply fantastic! I loved the writing, the story, and most of all the characters. The twists and turns were astonishing and I was totally riveted to the page. This is the kind of novel that you finish, sigh dreamily, and say, damn, that was a hell of a book! It certainly wasn’t what I expected and I loved every minute of it.Highly recommended to everyone, and not just readers of women’s fiction. I think we could all learn something from Evelyn’s life. 💚"
"I loved this book!  Evelyn Hugo is an enigmatic anti hero.  She’s beautiful, talented, tenacious, driven, and she used her beauty and sexuality to charm her way to a successful career in Hollywood.  This story was loaded with surprises and secrets.  Evelyn is the Scarlett O’Hara of the 20th century.  I am recommending this book to everyone I know and I can’t wait to discuss this at our book club."
"This book was absolutely amazing!!! I could not put it down and found myself thinking about the story for days after I finished the book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading, no matter the genre. There are so many aspects on social commentary that everyone can get something out of this book."
"I would recommend this book to others. From the reviews, I thought it would be mind blowing. Maybe my expectations were too high. I found it all very predictable. I can't deny that it kept my attention and I spent a whole day finishing the book.  But, I kept waiting for that ""spark"" that left me in wow. It was almost there! With all that being said, I did enjoy Taylor Jenkins writing style and will definitely be checking out her other books!"
"Worth every single penny!! I was sooooo not wanting to spend the money on this book. I am very glad I did. It was amazing and I will be nursing my hangover for days. Just a great, great story so very well written. I usually read ""trashy"" books (insert blushing embarrassed emoji) and this was out of the normal realm for me, but I couldn't put this down. I literally barked at my whole family ""I'm reading!"" for 2 days. Loved it!!"
"Entertaining beach read. Easy read, then pass it along.  4-stars because I found myself wanting it to be over vs some books I wish they’d never end.Not a book that makes you think or ponder for days after it’s over.  Lots of sex and lesbian themes (if that’s something you are or aren’t looking for)"
"I'm not much of a fiction reader, but I really enjoyed this book.  Could not put it down.  It had the old Hollywood, but sometimes you don't know what you think you know.  We don't know anyone in Hollywood, just what they want to be seen, and I kept that in mind.  This story, I'm sure, is more of a reality than many would like to believe.  It didn't disappoint.  In a nutshell:  You don't know what you don't know, in all kinds of ways."
I was looking forward to reading this book with all the hype however I was very disappointed. I gave it three stars it dragged on I was sick and tired of hearing about her sexual life her dual sexuality  etc. I was very disappointed in the book it was overhyped it is not in any way warranty any four or five stars.
"This book was a incredible story.. I felt so many emotions. I completely fell in love with Evelyn and her story. I didn’t want it to end.. I am just heartbroken. This was definitely one of the best books I have read this year.. maybe one of the best ever. I just couldn’t get enough of it. This was nothing that I expected, it was so much better."
"Goodness. This book started strong for me. I began to lose interest mid-way. I couldn’t figure out where the plot was going. What was the point?I’m glad I finished though. Some things were predictable, but a big twist at the end made up for some of the hum-drum earlier on. Overall, thought provoking. Nice story."
"This book is unbelievable. I had a hard time getting invested at first. But I am trying to read as much as possible right now, so I think that may have made me impatient for the story to draw me in. By the time I was quarter in, I was hooked. I have read the last 200 pages today and I find this book remarkable. I love the character of Evelyn Hugo and her story. Her passion and resolve are incredibly inspiring from a fictional character. I was not as big of a fan of the other main character, Monique. She was a little hard to root for or care about until the very end. I would actually rate this 4 1/2 stars if I could."
"For those readers who were growing up in the 60's, this is an interesting take on stars and their sexuality and how it was viewed at that point in time.  It reminded me of all the marriages of Elizabeth Taylor.  The characters were not super likeable as they were all very into themselves.  But it's entertaining just not great."
This was a very negative read for me.  Evelyn’s character was like reading the biography for Cruella Deville. It was a bit redundant toward the end. I was disappointed especially after a build up of so many positive reviews.
"It’s deep and introspective. When I first came across this title, it was described as a perfect book for the beach. Well, I don’t think I would have a great time at beach if I did read it there. I would have a sullen time. Haha! This book had me brooding and looking deep into myself.It was really good. It showed how life is, messy and strange and tragic all at the same time. And now it has left me thoroughly depressed, but you know in a good way."
"There are not enough stars in the sky to give to this amazing book. I loved every word. And it's rare that book makes me sob three times. If you want to read a wonderful epic love story, a story of sexuality and sensuality, passion and love, read this book! Evelyn Hugo  will stay in my heart forever."
This was chosen as a book for our book club. I wasn’t sure what to expect going in....it was very well written and on a topic that I had no clue was even going to be discussed! Very interesting to hear about how individuals in the spotlight navigated this “taboo” topic. I wasn’t really “riveted” but it was still a good book.
"This was a great story told really well. I picked this up because I loved everything about Daisy Jones and the Six. This story has a similar vibe in that it revolves around fictional famous people in and around Hollywood in decades past. I enjoyed the writing and thought the portrayal of love in all its forms was well done. There were a few things in the plot that I found far-fetched and the second 1/2 of the story dragged a bit, but otherwise, I'd recommend this one as a great beach read."
"For the book, quick delivery and great condition. As for the content, I can understand not liking it, opinions are valid and nothing is universal,, but I LOVED this book one of my favorite reads of the year and already i'd say for sure top 10 favorite books I've read ever.I also want to warn potential readers, trigger warning for underage/pedophilia themes (its hollywood)."
"I had placed this book in my cart at least 10x and removed it every time after reading the negative reviews that always seem to be at the top of the review list.  I finally caved after another friend read and loved Malibu Rising… and I am so glad I did.  Taylor Jenkins Reid and Evelyn Hugo kept me wanting more until the very last page and beyond, enough so that I went out and bought both Daisy Jones and The Six, as well as Malibu Rising the day after I finished it.  The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a well paced story with captivating characters that will have you hooked until the very end.  If you are on the fence buy it, you will not be disappointed!"
"I enjoyed this book because the seven husbands were definitely not what was expected. For being a book about Hollywood, it was much cleaner than it could have been, which I appreciated. There are several truisms that are pointed out in the course of the book that will stay with me. Nicely done."
I absolutely loved the novel! I appreciate the story and the recognition of various lifestyles. The normalization of bisexuality and same sex relationships is well done. The complexities of what is involved and how people are regarded is captured well. I also loved the Hollywood “norms” and how difficult the lifestyle is.It was a wonderful read which I highly recommend.
"Evelyn Hugo is strong, knows what she wants and doesn't care who she hurts to get it. And she's not very likable. But you won't need to like her to enjoy this book. It's not what I expected. It wasn't predictable. There were times I was frustrated with some of the characters. But they were very very genuine."
"I've forever been a fan of old Hollywood...the stories, the scandals, and its stars. This feels like old Hollywood, for sure. Evelyn has a Liz Taylor feel about her with many husbands, glamorous lifestyle, and many scandalous secrets. The book is excellently written and unfolds in a manner that kept my interest, and I wouldn't have normally chosen this type of read."
I think I’ve found a new favorite author. This book and Daisy Jones & the Six were great and hard to put down. I’m so excited she has more for me to read. And I’ve heard we’ll be watching Daisy Jones on the screen sometime soon. I think the Seven Husbands would make a great movie too.
"I loved this book! The author had an uncanny way of bringing you into Evelyn's life over and over again until you begin to realize the complicated essence of Evelyn comprising her self for fame, daring to put herself our there to achieve her self-coveted fame, yet always trying to balance her real being at the same time! How conflicted she was in life, yet how real her personal life was to her in a time when one couldn't be themselves and yet maintain theirFame! What surprises this book holds!! An amazing read!!"
"This is so not a book I would typically read but I saw so many recommendations on a FB reading group, I decided to try something I would not normally choose. I was captivated from beginning to end and felt the character development was superb.  I felt like I knew them, flaws and all."
I absolutely loved this book. There aren’t even enough words to describe how much  I loved it. A love story that has everything you can imagine. I needed more Evelyn Hugo in my life. It read so well and the writing made this seem so real almost as if it were nonfiction. I couldn’t put it down.
Wish I had been warned I’d be reading about a lesbian relationship. Real bummer and I had to quit the book half way through. Sorry but it’s not what I’m into and I didn’t enjoy reading about it. It was also incredibly predictable and got annoying.
"I bought this book based on the title. I thought it would center around a fictional, glamorous, old school Hollywood star. An Elizabeth Taylor/ZsaZsa Gabor/Marilyn Monroe character. Wow, did I get more than I bargained for! Evelyn Hugo is such a beautifully layered and complex character. This book is about love, intimacy and sexuality. It’s about the different ways we love different people in our lives. It is about what really matters and how it can take a lifetime to figure it out. It is a beautiful story you have to read."
"I liked the pace of the story, there's a lot of ground to cover but I never felt bored.  She really captures the social norms of the decade she's writing in, so important for this story to work.  I was a little shocked to find myself weeping near the end, it's not often a book has done that to me. Thank you for an awesome read."
I am an emotional mess just finishing this book today. The characters will stay with you long after the story has ended. They are written strong and smart with a satisfying finality. This is one of the best books that I have read this year and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a great story about an iconic life.
"Jenkins Reid weaves a tale that is absolutely breathtaking. Evelyn Hugo comes to life as a complicated soul- her life full of contradictions that make her so perfectly human. I was hesitant to read this. But after so many good reviews, I took a leap. And I’m so very glad I did."
I was so touched by this novel! It was sad how she used her body to get what she wanted to build her career! But I believe the actresses of Evelyn 'a time period did what she did! It's sad that many actresses of the 40's and 50's depended on their looks because the male directors didn't believe they had the talent! Great read!
"I liked that this book I bought paperback, because it was more affordable than hardcover and that I wanted a traditional in-my-hands book. I loved how I was taken through the story of Evelyn Hugo's life. I do not want to give spoilers, but a plot twist happens in the middle of the book that keeps you guessing until the very end. I feel that someone like me who has difficulty imaging or guessing can have fun with this book. I was intrigued from the beginning about all of these characters."
"i cried on a train in europe when i finished this book. i have rarely read a story that mirrored so many of my own experiences and it hit me really hard. i will say that there were a few moments where i could definitely tell it was not written by a woc, and for that i’ll dock a star just bc it pulled me from the narrative, but otherwise an incredibly engaging read that i HIGHLY recommend. i read it cover to cover in 24 hours."
"I enjoyed this book. It's a different take on a Hollywood star, and has a great twist in the end!!An easy, and fun read for your commute or vacation."
"I was truly captivated by how wonderful this book was! I think it might be the best book I've read in 2019 so far! Taylor Jenkins Reid delivered a well written, masterpiece! Highly recommend it if you are looking for a great page turner that will keep you guessing page after page."
"I doubt this is a book I will always remember but, it was memorable. The constant topic is sensuality and sexuality in the main character got to be repetitive. It would have been better to understand the main characters love for each other rather than it simply being so."
Evelyn Hugo was just like everyone else. She simply wanted to be loved. Loved by her fans. Loved by one person with all their heart. All her marriages had one thing in common. They were all for the person she loved most in the world. The seven marriages were really one love segmented.
"Folks, I didn't realize this book was gonna be queer until 100 pages in, but it is a lovely moving romantic story about bisexual invisibility and the gay/bi closet. Spoiler alert, sorry not sorry, because the bi readers need to be able to actually find this book. I cried 3 times. Highest praise."
"Reading this book was like viewing a soap opera. You get sucked in but nothing interesting really happens. In the end, there was an opportunity to assess one’s opinion of “what exactly is love?”.  Throughout the entire story, I never cared about any of the characters."
This book was absolutely incredible—I couldn’t put it down. Evelyn Hugo is such a fascinating character and she tells about her life through her seven marriages. The end has a great twist I did not expect. Highly recommend to anyone into the old glamour of Hollywood!
"Made it about 2/3rds through and gave up. Didn't find any of the characters to be likeable...even in a love-to-hate capacity. I felt like the author was trying to be a little shocking, but it came across as dull. Couldn't finish it."
"Evelyn Hugo was once Hollywood's reigning star. Her personal life kept her in the spotlight, and those seven husbands kept her mysterious to the general public and the fodder of gossip rags. But the real story has yet to be told, and Evelyn wants to tell it on her terms, and to the reporter of her choice. What follows is an unexpected story, ahead of its time in many ways. With a connection between her and the reporter that keeps you interested until the very end, this book was a page turner. A quick read and an interesting story."
"This book was written in a way that allowed a self absorbed celebrity who will do literally anything to maintain her image and career become a character you are rooting for.  Simple, yet spacious with just enough suspense.  I did not expect the twist.  Well done."
"I had love and hate with this story. It was really good I might say. I think Evelyn was right, people only want one thing....but sometimes, there is this one person, who will give you all you want and all they want in return is you. Amazing, and the end? Have Kleenex ready."
"The characters were very real, complex and engaging. People are unique and imperfect; the characters in this book are a reflection of the decisions we could all make both good or bad and our ability to choose to live with those choices and thrive or wither away."
"I couldn't put this book down! I read it in 24 hours! It was such a succinct telling of self compassion instead of regret, and that no one is ever all good or all bad. I loved the incredible clarity and insight Hugo had retelling her story. I was enchanted and moved."
I really enjoyed this book set in the early days of Hollywood.  The ending just disappointed.  I do not want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't read it but can we just read a book for the enjoyment and not have to be lectured to about alternative lifestyles?????
"Evelyn's story is an unapologetic, moving, roller coaster ride. Whether you love her or hate her, you can't help but to be impressed with her cunning intellect. She was a world renowned bombshell who owned it and used every tool in her arsenal to leave Hell's Kitchen and find success."
I would have rated higher but so much of this is told that we never quite get inside the characters heads. We appear to but the distance never quite goes away. However the story is fascinating from start to finish. How does one acquire seven husbands? Considering the twist it becomes even more fascinating until we get to the end and things fall into place. Was it predictable? Yes it was. Did it matter? No. Fascinating remained very tightly entrenched.
"WOW. One of the best books I've read this year. I wish Evelyn Hugo was real, and I'm really sad she's not. This book kept me guessing the entire time. There are two plot lines happening, one with Evelyn Hugo's story and one with our main character Monique who is personally selected by Evelyn to interview her. We don't know why she was hand chosen and the reveal is remarkable. I laughed and cried. A must read for literally anyone."
"Wow. I just finished reading and this is promptly going on my rare 'shelf of honor.'. As just a lover of books and the creativity and beauty of writing, this book floored me. When I was reading it, I would re-read pages just to savor the anticipation of Evelyn Hugo's next move, and when I wasn't, my mind kept wondering back, thinking of the next opportunity I could get in a few pages.As a fiction piece, I wish that she was real, because she becomes so visceral, beautiful and evil at the same time. She's the person we love to hate until the shades are drawn and the truth behind the mirror is seen. Incredibly beautiful writing; I could not speak more highly of it and hold it in such a high regard. I am looking forward to becoming a Taylor Jenkins Reid fan!"
"Even though a sister of mine recommended this novel, I tried twice to read the book, but I couldn't get into it.  So, unfortunately, because of that I rate it one star."
"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is the first book I have read by this author.  I felt myself admiring and disliking Evelyn Hugo. I found her some of her choices to be both selfish and unselfish.  But I also found her to be strong and real in her own way. A great read, I will definitely be looking into Taylor Jenkins Reid's other books."
"I liked this book more than I thought I would, more than Malibu Rising.Evelyns story was more interesting than the small remainder of the book after her life was told. The last chapters seemed to drag a bit.Yes, I would recommend to a friend."
"I started the book with a feeling that it was a trashy holiday novel but I was wrong. I ended up riveted and amazed at the truth of the main character's life. The sadness and complications of love, friendship and fame, parenthood and old fashioned prejudice. One of my best reads this year."
"I don't normally go for this kind of book, but picked it up on a recommendation. It was good! The story of her lifetime spreading out, the subtle mystery of the biographer, the portrait of LGBTQIA relationships and struggles over time... it made for a great book!"
"I really really wanted to love this book, and there were some chapters that I was intrigued and captivated but the ending fell flat. It ended very abruptly and just left me feeling like, “that’s it?”It was overall an ok read but not great to where I would recommend another person buy this book."
"This is my first book review although I read reviews all the time. This book is a great beach read and the characters you feel like you really get to know. A surprise twist ending that you never see coming, also a bonus. The seven husbands all have a purpose in her life. I highly recommend and everyone I've passed it on to loved it also."
"This book is definitely my favorite book of the year so far!I’m not sure what genre to put this in. It’s a little contemporary but also historical fiction. This book really digs deep into concepts that have been told a thousand times, but the way Evelyn told this story it all felt new.I was so invested in this story. I absolutely recommend this book. This honestly is not even the type of book I ever choose to read, but I am so happy that I did."
I read a lot of books so it takes a lot to totally surprise me with the ending .. I loved the way the book flowed . I lot of information but it all made sense . You got mad sad happy and delighted . I don’t usually write reviews but this book was good.
"That’s two in a row for me, Taylor. I have really been able to get lost in her books. I don’t know if the characters seem so real to me or if it’s that she writes about two things I truly love, 70’s music, and Hollywood gossip. I just found myself reading and reading till late in the night. Looking forward to more works by this talented writer."
"My feminist cockles were twitching in the first few chapters. I had to continually remind myself of the period. Everything about Evelyn screams ""character"" but Reid does a superb job of weaving uniqueness and humanity into Evelyn. I loved not knowing what to expect and the twist at the end; not like a murder mystery twist but a twist all the same!"
Everything about this book was stellar...from the way the author chose to tell Evelyn's story to the intricacies of the relationships and the eras Evelyn experienced. So refreshing and a quick read....and that twist at the end?....or should I say twists?....
The story is great and I am enjoying so much I don’t want to return the book.  The reason for two stars is as I am turning the pages they are coming out and it’s is making it difficult to read because I have to be so careful.  This book is extremely poor quality.
"This was such a joy to read. It had both a refreshing classic Hollywood feel to it as well as unexpected surprises that mirror current social issues. Though foreshadowing is heavy in this novel, when events take place, they are so well described and so evoking of emotion, at least some part of you is still caught off guard. Evelyn Hugo isn't your everyday heroine, in fact her vanity, ego and stubbornness often make her hard to like. However, her story is one that is both heartbreaking and inspiring to those of us who struggle with making decisions, taking risks and the uncertainty of our paths in life."
"""It’s always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.""Evelyn Hugo is my beautiful complex queen. I felt so many emotions while reading this. I was crying when I finished. There needs to be a movie adaptation immediately and I will watch it 12 times in theater.I wasn't super in love with Monique's character but I did appreciate how her story intersected with Evelyn's."
"This book was definitely a good read. We all know what's coming when Evelyn Hugo said all her loved ones are already gone at the beginning, but still I bawled my eyes out over two (I bet) most loved characters in this book's deaths. Evelyn Hugo's stories are the ones that draws me to keep reading this book. Monique Grant, not so much. But I guess it was on purpose since EH is the focus of the story, although I prefer if the author touched a little more detailed about her father rather than about her boring divorce and career. To be honest, a little too Hollywoodesque and too much vanity for my taste, but it was a fun journey."
The reader was hooked in the first chapter with an unexplained connection between the two main characters. With each each additional character (mostly husbands) the reader got a new twist or two which were often unexpected. How we humans interact with others involved in our lives  - business or personal - is displayed with more objectivity than usually anticipated.
"After reading Daisy Jones & The Six, I just knew I had to digest another Taylor Jenkins Reid novel. Her talent and style of writing is unlike any author I’ve followed before now. Beautifully written, always interesting, surprising, never disappointing, clever and tricky to the end. Devour it."
"I loved this book, I enjoyed reading it from beginning to end.She was such a great lady, knew what she wanted and where she was going . She had her fair share of bad things in her life but rose above it all.She seemed to  remained on top of everything despite all the heart breaking and awful things that happened to her along the way.Interesting read all the way through but a lot of it was very sad. I don't how she remained sane till the end, such a strong lady.Im now looking at other biography`s as this one was so interesting!"
"This book was really good, high recommend. It took some unexpected turns all the way until the end.  It was an easy read.  I could see the conversations between Evelyn and Monique, so vivid and realistic. I look forward to reading more by this author."
I loved this book and really wasn’t expecting to. I seriously could not put it down. Unlike most “twists” - you are trying to understand the connection between Evelyn and Monique and the author keeps you guessing until the very end - and it was not predictable. I thought that was particularly well done.
"This is typically not my genre of book, but I absolutely loved it- so much I am making my husband read it.  It was so well written and I thought the ending was prefect.  This is the type of book that definitely deserves the buzz and I am so glad I bought it!"
"I have read a long and very descriptive review of Reid - the seven husband of Evelyn hugo and I cannot make it more profound and elaborate the goodness of this book.I put it off for awhile before reading it but I should have not. It's been an amazing experience reading this book. You would think, 7 husbands? Really. But reading the story - it made sense. The twist of the story - you would not see it coming.Cannot say enough to convince people to read it. It's a very good book. Well written."
"Enjoyed the story of Evelyn Hugo and her life of working to prove herself to the world, and coming to grips with who she truly was to herself. Enjoyed the back and forth narrative from Evelyn’s perspective, Monique’s story, and the news clips that reveal the “truth” that was portrayed for the public."
Idea of devotion and do anything to succeed!  Yet a little too much information on true love of her life.
"This book was so well written! I loved the detail, the visceral feel of every emotion, and the pace. I couldn't put it down and read it within 24hrs. Truly enjoyable and it addressed some real issues of that time period. I'd recommend this novel highly!"
I absolutely love this book. I don’t read a lot of fictional books but I could not put this one down. It was awesome. I found it on tik tok and it did not disappoint. You won’t be disappointed. It’s not a predictable book and it keeps you hooked.
I absolutely LOVED this book! The situations she went through and how she handled them were amazing and sometimes shocking. I felt such empathy for her having to hide her love. We have come a long way as a Country or have we? Great read!
"A unique book. I didn’t binge this one but rather read a few chapters a day before bed. It felt like sitting down with someone listening to them tell a story. And I looked forward to it each day. Excellent writing, captivating story. Can’t wait to read more by this author."
"this is one of the most raw and complex stories i’ve read which has taken over my mind enough to finish it in less than 48 hrs. i am so floored on the ways one can be both good and bad, the ways we can love one another; the painful sacrifices one does for both themselves and others. all i can say is wow... the pain she had had to endure and the love she had. such an admirable thing yet to be cautious of  ? thank u, taylor jenkins reid for crafting this lovely novel."
"Beautiful, stunning, surprising, important, enlightening, eye opening, relatable, complex. This story made me think about some things with a new lens and changed me as it changed Monique. The best story I have read in a long time!!"
"A very fast read for fans of the glamor days of Hollywood. Evelyn Hugo is an interesting character with a slight resemblance to Elizabeth Taylor if Elizabeth were Cuban and blonde. As fascinating as the story of Evelyn and her many loves is, the back story of her interviewer Monique is equally compelling."
This was hard to get into at first. It wasn’t until about halfway through that I found myself getting interested in the story. It was easy to read which I like every now and then. I don’t regret buying/reading this but it wasn’t my favorite.
"This book really tells a tale of misconceptions related to Hollywood stars. This could be anyone in Hollywood, New York theatre, or any and all of these scenarios. I really soaked up every word, and appreciated love at its core."
"I don’t know, I’ve read so many good books over the past few years and this was highly rated and well liked. It just didn’t grab me. I tend to lean towards more historical fiction and this had little history. Hence, I suspect, my boredom.  It was well written."
"I loved this book.  It’s sad and it’s sweet and it’s funny and I think it’s the most fake reality I’ve ever read.  I think I will read it again someday because there is so many truths to digest about life and love and how many ways you can love, to include loving a book."
"An interesting novel that lends itself to a lot of discussion about the ethics of what people will do for their children and how far is too far.  Justice taken into the hands of everyday people, Fate, riding the wave of public opinion....this and so much more is here.  This one stays with you, even if you are still a little angry after you're done reading."
"Definitely a quick, interesting read.  It wasn’t at all what I expected.  Lots of twists and turns, a bit depressing at times, and not a fan of the ending.  However, it is beautifully written and I recommend it overall."
"Definitely a must read!  Evelyn is a woman to be admired, loved and hated.  She does many terrible things in her life with one final one that may be unforgivable.  As the reported/writer Monique hears her story she has. I idea that she will eventually become part of it."
"I, instantly,  became intrigued with Evelyn from the moment I picked up the book. She made me laugh, cry, and dislike some of her actions all at the same time. I honestly felt sorry for her and understood why she made many of the decisions, even when I didn’t like the choices. This story gave you a clear view of how hard it was to be yourself in those times. Although we still have a long way to go, it makes you appreciate how far we’ve come with accepting ones differences."
I started this book at 8pm last night and finished it this afternoon. This is one of the best books I have ever read. A little slow starting but once it gets going you are absolutely addicted. This novel is INCREDIBLE!
"This has to be one of the most well written and intriguing stories ever written, especially of the last few years. I couldn’t put this down even for a second. I laughed I cried I gasped. Everything about this was perfect"
"I loved, loved, loved this book!  Amazing characters that I grew to love and root for!  I highlyRecommend this book because it takes you back to an era in Hollywood that wasn’t as glamorous as you think.  Truly a beautiful novel."
"I loved this book! I hate spoilers, so I will just say that I was drawn in by the first page and loved the ride. A fun book with a bit of depth as well. I've recommended Evenly Hugo to multiple friends and everyone has agreed - don't pass this one up!"
"I have never fallen in love with a book as I have fell in love with this one. This was such a beautifully written story, and with so many things that will make you gasp, cry, laugh, feel immense hatred, and all the above!!! I fell in love with Evelyn Hugo, and the way Taylor Jenkins Reid made her come to life. You will not regret getting book, so do not wait!!!!"
"Excellent read. Easy and enjoyable. The story is simple but complicated; as life often is. Just imagine being a female public figure in this era, with a complicated life. Everything swirls together to ultimately create the need of who you are to be hidden, so much depends on it. Excellent, thought provoking story."
Wonderful characters. Great pacing. Little bit of mystery. I felt so invested in the story and the outcome I didn’t want to put it down. Wound up getting both the audiobook and Kindle versions - both great.
I was happily surprised by this story. I had no idea what was going to happen and I am so happy to have read this story and I was pleasantly surprised by the ending also! Highly recommend. This was my second #quarantine2020 read and I had previously read “My One True Loves” as my first quarantine read without realizing they where both by the same author. Pleasantly surprised and will be reading more of her books!
"I found this book as a amazon suggestion, soon found out it was a bestseller right before starting the book, and i feel like with as much as everyone is talking about, i didn’t connect to it the same way, was definitely an interesting read and i finished it because i wanted all the secrets uncovered, but honestly didn’t really resonate with any part of me"
"I loved this book. I loved the way it was written, I loved the story, I loved everything about it.I wasn't sure if I was going to like but I loved it! I would recommend this a good summer read."
I am not a Hollywood follower. This began and was more like a magazine gossip article. I continued to read because it was a book club assignment. It ended as a pretty good book with many issues to discuss.
"This story is beautifully written. It is one of the most heart wrenching and moving stories I’ve ever read. It’s beautifully tragic. As a bisexual myself, I connected to it on a deep level.Must read and I will recommend it till the day I die"
"I loved loved this book. I read a lot and just wanted something to read on a last minute vacation. Boy was I entertained! The story is so good! I really enjoyed the format. I don’t want to say anything about the book. If you like reading something that is well written, a captive story  and heartfelt sentiments then this is the book for you. This is the quintessential ‘beach book”."
"How much can be expressed in so few words- this book is brilliantly written and chaptered.  The book feels like an express train with tantalizing and vivid views.The author has found a way to make you value truth in the way you hope all of us value truth ' as the foundation and reality of life as it is, not as you want it to be."
"An unusual but heartwarming love story. I highly recommend this book. Unless you are a right-wing, judgemental, evangelical, bible-thumping, homophobe. Then you may not enjoy it as much..... and it's your loss."
"I loved the unpredictability of the story, how the author kept you in suspense until the very end.  How difficult it was, not that long ago, to live your life hiding from your true self, your true identity. Evelyn chose fame and glory over coming out as a bisexual woman, knowing full well it would destroy her career. She was a very strong woman in a time when anything other than being heterosexual was no acceptable."
I read a lot of books. This by far is one of my top favorites. The storyline is amazing and the writing is superb.  I will not give away anything to spoil it for future readers. Pick up this book and read it now!
"This was a page turner because the main heroin, Evelyn Hugo, was a complex, strong and engaging character. By the end of the story, Evelyn did become somewhat predictable. You did always feel that there was an underlying reason for Evelyn choosing Monique to write her biography, but that secret was not revealed until the end and the author was successful in not sharing that detail until just the right moment."
This book was everything!  It was the first book I've read by Taylor Jenkins Reid but it will not be the last.  This book was a masterpiece and the ending blew me away!  Do yourself a favor and read this book!
"This book had me constantly wanting to come back for more. I couldn’t put it down and am so sad it is over. Evelyn Hugo’s story, though fiction, captivates you and sucks you in right till the last page"
"I didn’t want the book to end, but couldn’t wait to find out what next.  This book was well written and held your interest with the life Evelyn created.  Though you expect something big to be revealed at end, I was in tears and unprepared for Harry’s death.  Evelyn loved hard and loss hard as well.  She handled her death as she did her life, own her own terms!  Great book.I would recommend to anyone who likes romantic and mystery."
"I can’t even remember the last time I buried myself so deep in a book. My face is a train wreck, I’m going to kill the friend who reccomended it to me, and I don’t think I’ll ever think about love the same way again.I’d probably recommend it to the rest of you but I’m not a sadist so I’ll simply offer a warning: if you do pick it up, grab the Kleenex."
"So well written! This lady has quickly become one of my favorite authors. Didn't expect the character surprise near the end. I knew that something was going to involve him just didn't know exactly what. Not fluffy, sappy, predictable, just a good story."
"Read this book.It was not what I was expecting, but SO SO much more. Not only is it fun and sexy, but deep and so powerful with connections to the characters you only DREAM of in other books.I fell in love with Evelyn and her story, and you will too. You’ll laugh, you’ll CRY, you’ll wonder how many secrets Hollywood actually has, and there will be line in this book that you reread over and over until they truly sink in. Highly recommend.“Never let anyone make you feel ordinary” -Evelyn Hugo."
"I enjoyed this book. As I was reading it, I almost forgot Evelyn was a fictional character. It’s like reading a biography of an old classic film star. It held my attention throughout and I’d recommend it."
"Just like all of Reid’s work, this did not disappoint. I’m blown away by the beauty of this book, the joy, the sadness. Pretty sure I spent the last portion of this book in tears, but it was well worth it. Highly, highly recommend."
A beautifully written story of a great love and the inner struggles that came with it. As the story progresses we come to know Evelyn Hugo and the complex woman she is. I highly recommend this book.
Loved this book. Tara Jenkins Taylor is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. I like this better than Daisy Jones and the Six. I envisioned Elizabeth Taylor being the muse for Evelyn! Great read!!
"If you want a traditional Hollywood romance novel, this book is not for you. If you would like to explore same sex love and relationships, in a time that it was all but forbidden, then this book is for you.  I wasn't expecting that twist, and I didn't prefer it."
"I purchased this book on a whim based on the title. 7 husbands assured to be an interesting read. Just a few chapters in I realized this book was about so much more. Exploring the life of Evelyn Hugo donning back to the days of the old Hollywood glamor, political era of the 50s and 60s, this book will not disappoint. An absolute must read!"
"Wow! This book is so well-written.I love...- how every little day detail is put together and how they connect with each other.- how it incorporates different relevant issues.- the quotes. I found myself highlighting so many parts of this book.- the character development. So good! I love how she built Evelyn's characters and the others.- the plot, how this story is intricately weaved."
"Enjoyed this read!  Ending ties everything together.  A great story of love and loss.  Will definitely read more from this author.Great book club read.  This one prompts plenty of social view discussionsThought provoking on how a person wears a mask for acceptance.  Do we really know those who we interact with at work, socially,  what lengths do we go to in order to protect our perceived identity and family?Would you tell your true story before your demise?"
"Like another reviewer, I found the book a bit under-written.  Some of the key relationships could have been developed in more detail so you understood why the characters made the choices they did.  Also, some of the situations were a little too pat, and not believable.  Interesting premise that could have been executed better.  A lot of tell with not enough show."
"So worth the read. The complications of life, the choices we make and their importance vs our perception of them.The characters are fabulous, the plot is perfect, on the whole a lasting story."
"You are invested immediately.  A page turner to keep learning about all the husbands and the mystery of Evelyn.  It also has a twist at the end.  It's not rocket science, but a lot more depth than a basic beach read.  I picked it for my book club and everyone loved it."
This might be my favorite book of all time and I have read A LOT of books. Taylor Jenkins Reid is amazing characters that feel so real that her books could almost be nonfiction.Read this book!
"This is - without a doubt- the best book I have ever read!! Taylor Jenkins Reid’s writing style is fantastic - I started to believe Evelyn Hugo was a real person! I was captivated the entire time and did not want to put the book down. In fact, I stayed up until 3 AM reading this book and when I woke up the next morning, I immediately continued to read until I finished the book. I loved it so much, I even read the acknowledgments at the end! If you are in a reading slump, this is the perfect book to get you out!"
"One of the most beautiful characters I have read, there so vivid I actually got sad once I knew it wasn’t a true story, it feels so real.It became one of my top 10 books of all time.Just  beautiful."
"This book was so good, I want to read more by this author. The details of the “Golden Age of Hollywood” were so fun to relive with the main character. Also, to see how those are real lives that have failures and mistakes and regrets, as well as true love."
"I had seen this book for quite a while when looking for a good novel and finally I bought it. I am so glad I did---great characters, great book.  Every chance I had, I quickly picked up my kindle, to read more of it."
"I have to admit I was only reading this book for book club, it is not the type of book I read, but this book was fabulous. It grabs you from the beginning and you just can't wait to see what happens next."
"This book isn’t something I would normally read, but it was so hard to put it down, I read it in 4 days & the ending had my jaw dropped.I highly recommend this book if you’ve been looking for a good book!"
I felt like I was right there in the book meeting each character and rooting for the main character. It ought to be a tv series. It felt like I was watching it on tv or the movie theater. I’ve recommended it to others.
"This book was an unexpected delight! I sat down with it about 7pm and read it straight through! Yes, I looked up and realized it was 8am! I could not put this book down! So many surprising twists! I say this as someone who almost always sees the twist coming and I didn't, this book was not predictable. I don't want to give away spoilers so I can't really say much about the plot. Just buy it and read it, you'll be glad you did!"
"This book bounces current time to bygone era with a flow that made the story interesting. I like the diversity, the openness of love is live and an ended that was not expected. Bravo"
This book goes straight and plain to the hearts of a real woman and the author writing her story.  It helps me accept all emotions and people.  I’m grateful to know Evelyn Hugo and Monique Grant.  Thanks Virginia for giving me this book.
"This was a phenomenal and original book, one that I almost didn't read because I thought it would be some fluffy romance. It has a bit of everything, but the plot twist nailed it!"
I give it a three because it was entertaining. But nothing out of the ordinary  I was hoping to read it with two friends and I had to finish it because I wanted to know the ending.
This book was wonderful. One of the very best books I've read in a long time. It was a min to 'The Paris Wife' in that I felt I was reading about a real movie star's life. Evelyn's story is captivating on so many levels. And the twist at the end as to why she chooses Monica to write her story was totally unexpected. Loved it through and through.
I am reading this novel now . An interesting insight into the lives of Hollywood actresses ! This particular edition has been published in extremely small print . I guess the company wanted to save on paper . I have to use my reading glasses as well as a magnifying glass . I would not recommend this edition unless your eyesight is absolutely perfect🧐
"This was another amazing read from Taylor Jenkins Reid! It was certainly different from her other books that I've read but no less spectacular.Evelyn Hugo is a famous Hollywood actress who went from being a poor Cuban immigrant living in Hell's Kitchen to one of the most famous, highest paid actresses in Hollywood. There are definitely traits about this heroine that I hated including denying her heritage to get more movie roles and lying and scheming to get to the top was certainly not foreign to her. However, you have to respect that she owned every single flaw and for the most part she was unapologetic for her actions.This story IS NOT AS IT SEEMS. At least I certainly was not expecting the huge TWIST that this story takes. I'm still not sure how I feel about it to be honest with you.I really could not decide if I loved or hated Evelyn. Most people would call Evelyn a whore for having so many husbands and so many of her marriages were for convenience rather than love. But you also had to respect that a lot of the decisions she made were to protect the ones she loved.As is the norm with books of Taylor Jenkins Reid, the writing is top notch and is just set a at a higher standard. There is drama, humor, sex (no overtly steamy scenes) and betrayal and it is all very tastely done with shock factors thrown in for good measure.I would definitely recommend this book."
I just read Daisy Jones and The Six and now I have to read everything by Taylor Jenkins Reid. This book is fanatic!!
"This is on my top 3 list of best books I’ve ever read. I literally laughed, gasped and cried out loud! I am genuinely sorry to be through reading this book. I miss Evelyn in my life!!!!!"
"Could not put this book down!! Such a convoluted love story that kept me reading into the wee hours. I loved Evelyn & hated her, admired & pitied her all at the same time!"
"First book by this author for me and loved her writing style.  Even if you didn't agree with all of Evenlyn's decisions, she made you understand why and you had to keep in mind the years this was happening in."
"We read for our book group.  Most of the ladies thought it was fine but I lost interest after a while.  Parts were interesting but the main story line just dragged on, and on, and on........"
"The book was fine. The writing didn’t bother me and the characters were ok, but it was nothing spectacular. I love when books are thought-provoking, and I would read this, set it down, and not think about it once until I picked it back up again. I didn’t care for the characters at all, there was nothing that made me feel for them, and I found that I thought Monique was a bit annoying. It was a quick, entertaining read, though."
Fascinating story as an older Hollywood Legend tells her story to writer with so many surprises along the way. And you thought a Hollywood was just glamour! Maybe not. But wait for the ending.
Cheesy.
I loved this book because it took something everybody takes for granted and turns it on its head.  I like to think this book is based on Elizabeth Taylor and Katherine Hephburn.
I had no expectations for this book and I just loved it!  I love how the author writes and I found myself craving this book- I couldn’t wait to read- read it in a weekend.  Great read.
"This was an ok book. The story was interesting but just not very believable.  There seemed to be plot holes.  This would be a, good book to discuss with others. Just not a great book for me."
I could not put this book down once I started reading...truly kept my attention...from beginning to end...really enjoyed it...still remember the story...some 4 weeks later...stays with you...for various reasons.Cheers!
"This book was not quite what I expected, and I have to say I loved it even more just because of that reason.  Wonderful nostalgia walking through Eleanor's past in old Hollywood juxtaposed with today's ramifications and consequences.  Fabulous read!"
"It is difficult to explain how this book affected me, but it did. In a good way. It is very generous with life truths I hadn’t considered before. Thank you for that. I look forward to reading more  from this author."
"It was an exciting book for most of the chapters.  An easy read for sure... I liked it but didn't love it.  It was entertaining enough, and the end was a tad of a surprise..."
"Taylor Jenkins Reid has recently been added to my list of favorite writers.  After reading Forever Interrupted, I immediately came onto Amazon and ordered all of the books she had written and so far have not been disappointed.  The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo takes a little bit of a different direction than the TJR books I've read so far, however, the substance and the story is still there and most importantly, Reid's ability to impress upon the reader the amazing strength at the core of love.  I'm going to give you a heads up, if you read this book, and I hope you do, when you get to page 331, get up and get yourself a tissue and proceed on.  You will need that tissue on page 333!  Don't jump ahead and see why because everything from page 1 leads up to this moment and the continuing pages and I'm sorry but the only word I can think of to describe the remaining pages and the ending is WOW...!  This book was a very good read and I look forward to many future books from TJR."
"Unfortunately for me, this book was good but didn’t live up to all of the hype. I personally found the storyline a bit basic and the plot twist I had easily figured out before it was revealed. Still a good read but I was expecting more based on all of the 5 star reviews"
"I finished reading this book about a few hours ago. I could have finished it in one sitting but had to space it out in three days because I did not want to finish it! I cried when I finished it. I can relate to the main character, Evelyn Hugo, on how part of herself is either erased, mislabeled, etc. You  won't regret buying it. Will be listening to the audio this week and waiting for paperback."
"i LOVED this book. It was not at all what I was expecting, it was better. Amazing characters, everyone is super well developed and dynamic. The writing is good, i loved everything about this book"
"This is one of those books where you're a different person after reading it.I found myself just walking around lower Manhattan listening to this book, contemplating skipping class because I didn't want to put it down.Evelyn Hugo's life was an interesting one to read about and this book is one I highly recommend to readers looking for a realistic contemporary that will hit close to home.I listened to the audiobook and it was fantastic! I highly recommend!"
"I’m very disappointed.  I couldn’t even finish the book, and don’t understand how it was rated so high.  Don’t waste your money."
"I don’t know how to begin to describe this book. It was so fun to read yet also heartbreaking. I was scared starting it that it wouldn’t live up to all the praise I had heard, but boy was I wrong. It deserves all the praise it has received and more. You will be completely wrapped up in the story of Evelyn and the weeks Monique spends listening to her life story. Read this! You won’t regret it."
"Just a great read.  I’m wishing there were great stories like this in real life.  You loved her and you hated her, but Evelyn was entertaining throughout the book."
"Read it in a day. I was just so captivated and obsessed with the story. I needed to know how it ended. All I know is within the last few chapters, I was in tears. Splendid narrative. LGBTQ+ Inclusive."
"This is my favorite read of the summer. The characters are rich, the plot is layered and engaging, and the entire story is well-constructed and well-written. I couldn't put it down."
"Beautifully written with nuggets of wisdom. The characters were complex and had just enough depth to keep you hooked (especially Evelyn, to no one’s surprise). Loved it!"
I really like this author and was glad I ordered this book. Really interesting fun read of a bygone era. Book arrived promptly in good condition at a great price
"From the title, I did not expect much. I was pleasantly surprised at how good this book is. Plus, it has a major twist at the end that I did not see coming. Read this book. I think you will also be pleasantly surprised."
This book was chosen by my BOOKCLUB- can't say that I would have picked it based on reading the brief description- but WOW I'm sure glad I did- read it in 3 days- a fun easy read but definitely had some twists- RECOMMEND. Without giving anything away I feel for Evelyn but closed the book being angry at her.
I thought the first 3/4s of the book was a bore....nothing that interested me. I had a hard time getting through it.I only finished it because it was for a book club
"I read the majority of this in one day! Truly a phenomenal, entertaining, heartbreaking, and breath-taking novel that is so well written. Highly recommend it!!"
I am very disappointed that I have not read this book sooner!  I stumbled across it and I could not put it down. Thanks thanks thanks for such a lovely book!!
"This book is excellent. I don’t have much else to say about it, aside from the fact that I read it in one sitting. It’s beautiful and lovely and I cried multiple times during it."
Just a horrible person. Who cares about her life?
"I was so surprised by this book! The title makes it sound like a soap opera but it is sooo much more than that. Beautifully drawn characters, many of whom you fall in love with. I found it hard to put down and was sad when it ended. Highly recommend!"
"i was hooked from the start! i had 2 different friends recommend this book to me and i loved every second of it. flew through it, was so sad when it came to an end."
"I just rode down memory lane with this novel. Although fictional, it sure made me believe that that  was how a lot of famous people lived their lives. And some of us out there may still do."
"This book was great and I enjoyed it from start to end. Definitely recommend this to others, I even gave my husband a play by play after I'd read a section and he was into it too lol"
"Page-turning read with a fun twist. Complicated but lovely characters and lives. Flawed like us all, but really all wanting the same thing : friendship, family and contentment. Peace. The kind money and fame can't buy. Just like Daisy Jones this would make a riveting TV series!"
This is a great book!  I read this for my work book club and everyone loved it!  Half way through the book we all put in a guess on how it will end.  NO ONE got it right!  Highly recommend.
"Beautifully written, captivating story, appealing characters. I planned on this being my “before bed” book - reading a chapter a night or so. I was wrong. Finished it in less than 24hrs. LOVED IT."
Reading this book I actually felt like I was walking through time…50’s…60’s….70’s…80’s. Tara is a fabulous storyteller. I will continue to buy her books.
"The STORY so far is great, and I’m really enjoying it. However, the BOOK itself completely fell apart when I was halfway through reading it. Extremely disappointing."
"There was nothing about this book I didn't like. I loved the love story between Evelyn and Celia. I'm glad that it was the only relationship that worked out in the end. I do wish that they had stayed together longer, but the whole point was that Evelyn made mistakes in life and had regrets. It was very well written and even the characters that weren't Evelyn, such as Harry or Monique were characters I cared about."
"I loved this book and couldnt put it down. I was shocked at the ending no spoiler alerts, but well written will try to find other books by this author."
I enjoy fiction that is close to real life - simple yet complex and filled with fifty shades of gray instead of just black and white. This book was all of that! Great read!
I started this book via audiobook on a driving trip. When I wasn’t driving I’d read it anyway and finished it quickly. It is very well written and never boring. I wish I knew Evelyn. She seems amazing!
"I loved this book. It is so well written and a good story about a woman in the public eye trying to be content with herself in an unconventional way.  It took seven husbands and a lifetime to reach her dream of living happily without losing focus of her profession, her reputation, and her family values."
"I didn’t have high hopes when I purchased and was I wrong.  I read before bed and this was one of the few books I would race upstairs early to crawl in bed to read.  I loved the complexity of the characters, especially Evelyn. The glamour of Hollywood meets great literary characters. The pace moved quickly, yet with appropriate detail.  The ending was spectacular and I never saw it coming."
This book made me feel like I was in romantic Hollywood of the early stars while touching on modern social issues. There were twists and turns and moments where I held my breath and time where I smiled a real true smile. I fell in love with Evelyn Hugo while reading this book.
I loved this book. It definitely kept my attention. Evelyn had a tough childhood which made her bitter but taught her to fight for what you want.
Absolutely adore this book! The older ages of Hollywood are super fascinating to me so I loved that aspect of this book. Also the main characters were super likeable and really came to life. I can’t wait to read another book by this author! 100 percent recommend this book
Captivating from beginning to end.  It gave me some insights on life that had never occurred to me before.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
"What a beautiful book! While reading this the reader will definitely think it's based on a true story. Well developed characters, deeply moving and will keep your attention! Not to be missed!"
"This novel was both juicy and profound, from juicy details about the behind the scenes machinations of a Hollywood career to a love story that survived despite the objections of society.  I wanted an entertaining beach read but got so much more."
I liked this book because I thought the subject matter was thought provoking.  I also liked her writing style.  I will read more of her books.
"It started out cute and very old Hollywood feeling. Then the whole ""pining for her unrequited love"" thing became very cheesy and teenage like."
"Such a phenomenal book. I read the second half in one night. Taylor Jenkins Reid is a wonderful writer. Her characters are so deliciously written, full of intrigue and rapture. Her words are poetic in its simplicity and deep meaning. You miss her characters as soon as they leave the page. I highly recommend."
"I absolutely enjoyed this book. I got so attached to the characters, especially Evelyn.Great recommendation from a friend. I'll definitely look further into more of were world."
First book I’ve read by this author and I’ll definitely be back for more. This book was fast paced and kept me interested the whole time! I was sad when I finished it. I definitely recommend reading it!
"I don’t recall where I heard of this book, where the recommendation came from…but man am I glad it did. What a fabulous story that is wonderfully told."
"The author gives you a hook in the beginning of the book which you hold on to till the very end and it keep you reading chapter after chapter.  Very clever!  This is not just a story about a movie star, glamour and seven husbands.  It is so much more and it reveals a great deal about the human spirit and survival.  I highly recommend it!"
"Just finished this and am an emotional mess. One of the best books I've read. I love this author. I loved  the  characters, thE complexity, the  LOVE."
"What a lovely read. Evelyn Hugo is a complicated woman, and her story, revealed through one long interview, expanded and broke my heart. Read this book for a glimpse into old Hollywood, and an unflinching, incisive portrait of the ways our society tries so hard to keep women in a small, limiting box. Ultimately, however, this story is one of a woman deciding her truth is all that matters - regardless of how complex or painful it is."
Great novel on the value of relationships and the multiple types that make up our lives. No one has to have been married 7 times or be a celebrity to relate to various relationships discussed. Only thing missing was more support on the twist. I would have liked more insight there.
"Love this book! Best book I’ve heard by this author so far! Book came in as a library book, which I’m not a fan of, but otherwise, good condition."
"This book was great, with some twists I didn’t expect. Definitely worth reading.I will be anxious to see what the author does next."
"This book is one those you almost wish wasn't in the actual structure it's told, but somehow it keeps you hooked all the way to the end."
"In the minority here, but this book to me was completely awful. Towards the middle, I started skimming chapters just to get through it without giving it too much of my time. I found the main characters completely unlikeable, arrogant, self-serving...how is it that this book has so many rave reviews???"
"I didn’t know much about the book just the basic description but I saw it had great reviews so I decided to buy it expecting nothing and wow what a surprise! Such an amazing book, character development, story, everything!! I couldn’t put the book down and I read it in two days which is a record for me! I even cry reading this book, definitely one of my all time favorites and Evelyn is a masterpiece of character!"
"I haven't been so engrossed and captivated by a book in years.  What a heart wrenching story of acceptance, love, choices and consequences."
"This book was a good read. I found it interesting at times and less interesting at others. I found it hard to connect with any of the characters but that having been said, I still found it enjoyable to read and would recommend it if you like an easy read. Overall not AMAZING but still found it to be a solid book."
Loved this book from the first page. The complex life of a bombshell actress with a true love no one could have anticipated.  5 stars.
This book was literally everything I had to keep reminding myself that the characters aren’t real (bc I’ve wanted to look them up on google lol).
The book shares some insight into early life in Hollywood and how much the studios controlled so much. Also portrayed how shunned the gays were. Delicious book
"A few twists I didn’t see coming.I think we can all see a part of ourselves when reading this book. Who we are, who we might be."
"This  tale of Hollywood at its worst was very entertaining and I realized I didn't know much about this era until now.You can put this book down, take a dip in the pool, and come back to it and you are ready of what else can happen to Eve;yn.  Never dull."
The book is really good. However remember the smaller paperbacks? That's exactly what this is in a bigger package.  Small font & big margins!There's plenty of room - make that font work with the size of the book!
I totally didn’t think I would love this book. I’m a James Patterson / Thriller & Suspense junkie. But I loved this book! Take a chance!
"I love the book…well organized book…love how it was broken down into her husbands…loved the mystery…I could feel Evelyns love for the loves of her life …I ached for her many times …very enjoyable book…Now that I am done, I am missing all the characters"
Just finished and I am left with so many emotions. One of the only books I’ve read lately that has a real ending.  Highly recommend!
My heart was in my throat reading this book which I could not put down. A must read! I have to get a cocktail after finishing this book!
The story of exactly what a movie star had to do to get ahead in the 50's and 60's.Achievement in such a 'visible' industry meant forfeiture of privacy.
"I absolutely ADORED this book! Such a fun and engrossing read. No, it’s not great literary genius, but it is amazing entertainment and an enthralling story about Hollywood’s Golden Age. It’s fun, exciting, sexy, and awesome. I read it in just a few days and am sad it’s over. Highly recommended!!!"
I cried. I laughed. I was mad. I hated Evelyn. I loved her. Every emotion possible was felt. Not what I was expecting. It was fabulous.
Love love love this book. The story was captivating and I finished this book in three sits / less than 24 hours. Highly recommend!
Great story about the heart wanting what the heart wants. Lots of twists too. I couldn't wait to read the next chapter every time.
Words cannot begin to explain how much I enjoyed this book. The story. The characters. The writing. Everything. This is easily going down as one of my favorite books I’ve ever read.
"This book was fascinating, not only for its glamorous tale of an over the top Hollywood life, but also for its sympathetic portrayal of love in many iterations. Love of husbands and wives, love of family, of friends but also those who are of the same sex, romantic love and love of life and achievement.  All of these things are obtained at great cost for Evelyn Hugo.  The author leaves it up to the reader to decide if it's all worth it . I thought it was inspirational and way too much at the same time."
"An avid reader, it is a rare treat to find a book I don't want to put down. Unfortunately, than happens rarely. A fun read with twists and turns."
"Writing was good.  Didn't like the characters, not likeable people.  Usually I like a character or two, but no one here. Lots of gosssipy info.  I'm not recommending it to close friends."
"A very interesting read. So different, so beguiling, well written.  Bet you can’t predict the ending! Author’s notes/questions are very helpful.  The “reality” is pure and clarifying."
"Loved this book, could hardly put it down. The ending was so unexpected, no matter how many times I had tried to play out the ending in my head, I would've never guessed it."
I wish there was more. This book was so breathtakingly amazing. How it jumps between decades and tells this womans story.. I think everyone would be able to relate to her story and atleast one of her marriages
"It was slow at first and I found it hard to connect to the characters, but then it started to pick up about half way through.  It was very predictable and although I wasn’t as shocked by the revelations as others, it was still decent overall."
"This was a fast paced read, that I didn’t want to put down.  I loved her and hated her and felt sad for Evelyn all at the same time.  Perfect beach read."
"I good story, some surprises, but I really wish she’d developed Monique’s character more. It just didn’t feel believable or that interesting."
This was a fantastic story. I couldn't put it down and had to know what would happen next. The story was well told and enjoyable.
"A very slow read in the beginning, but I’m so glad i didn’t give up on the book. I would truly love to see this novel turn into a film. The author did an amazing job."
Really good read!! It kept my interest throughout and I loved feeling the old Hollywood vibe:)) I highly suggest as an easy book to lose yourself in. We read this in my book club and all enjoyed it.
I had heard people talk of this book for awhile but I still wasn’t prepared for its brilliance. Heart breaking and intriguing and powerful.
"Entertaining, interesting and engaging. I really liked this book and related to Evelyn on a personal level. Well written with twists and turns to keep you interested."
I loved this book and spending time with Evelyn and Monique and their friends and family...this is one of those books that left me with a book hangover when I finished it.
Enjoyed reading all about Evelyn Hugo and her glamorous life! Definitely thought about real life Hollywood stars that could be “Evelyn”.  Book moved fast and definitely had a few twists that may surprise readers.
Excellently written with characters that you felt like you knew. A real page turner of a book with a story that spanned many years.
Read this in 3 days. Great story. I liked the layout of the chapters. Just couldn’t put it down. Definitely recommended.
So far this is an interesting story. HOW EVER the print is so small that I only read a little at a time to avoid eye strain.
"I loved this book. It was very enjoyable. I was truly invested in the story and characters. There's parts that are predictable, shocking, and best of all unexpected surprises. It does take you through a bunch of emotions. Enjoy!"
"This book is nothing that I expected and I mean that in the very best of ways. It’s going to go on my bookshelf as one of my favorite books of all time. It is truly a beautiful, wonderful book."
"I did enjoy this book, it was a wonder why she kept marrying everyone, but I suppose it was the time that was the thing to do."
"I'm not in the business of writing book reviews, but I wanted to say that this was delivered exactly as described. Excited to read it!"
"I loved this book.  It was very well written.  Evelyn Hugo was a character you couldn’t help but admire with a slight mix of pity, disgust, shock, hate but most of all — love."
Loved this book! It’s a great story that spans decades and chronicles a life that was fascinating. I highly recommend.
I’m not sure what everyone liked so much. This book was a quick read but so obvious from the beginning. No subtlety at all.The writer doesn’t make the characters likeable or even go deep enough for you to feel any way about them. I was disappointed.
"I found this a quick,delightful read. The main character is as unforgettable off paper as she is on. I think any woman can see some part of herself in Evelyn Hugo."
"I couldn’t put the book down. The ending felt rushed and I felt like Monique completely contradicted her earlier work when she wanted to go back to evelyn’s apt to stop her, but I’d still highly recommend the book."
"I could not put it down. It wasn’t anything that I would have chosen from the title. But, I am certainly glad that I did read it!"
Although the story at times frustrated me. And I couldn't agree with Evelyn's choices most of the time. I did get drawn in and happily kept reading. This was an enjoyable summer read.
"I checked it out from the library, read it in two days, then went online and ordered my own copy. It’s that good."
".Evelyn Hugo was much like Elizabeth Taylor. A fuel to the author for an entertaining story, looking for part two."
So far this had been my favorite book that this author has written. Saw it advertised on tiktok and was not too interested but I've red 4 of her books now and she is not only a great author but this book is my favorite. Must read.
"My thoughts on this book can’t be summed up in enough words for a review. If you love stories about celebrities either real or fictional this book is for you. If you love stories with drama and finding who you are this book is for you. The novel has a lot of heart and yes, it does have a lot of drama."
I would give this book a million stars. It was so well written and so beautifully portrayed. Seriously just buy it you will not be disappointed.
So many complex characters.  So glad my book club chose this book. Will definitely read more by this author. Go along for the ride!
"Haven't been able to read, pront is so small and light. Bought paperback. Returning and reordered hardcover.  Seems like a great read"
"Absolute page turner. I could not put this book down and the “hook” that kept me reading it took me by total surprise when it was finally revealed. I’m usually pretty good at seeing the turns and curves in storylines but this one was unpredictable. So, so good."
if i were to describe this book it’s like a puzzle. you start reading and try to understand the story plot and the characters. slowly the pieces come together. throughout the puzzle you get frustrated and bored but keep going because you want to see the final product. i dont  think i’ve ever cried because of a puzzle but i cried during this. everything was so satisfying. like it was all connected. it was complete.
I was pleasantly surprised by the plot twist. this was so emotional and complex which is not what I was expecting. such a beautiful book. highly recommend. the beginning is a tad slow but stuck with it. it’s worth it
"While I thought the book was well written and told a great story, I really did not like the main character Evelyn Hugo. In a time of the me too, Evelyn has no problem trading sexual favors to get ahead. I also think it portrays celebrities in a bad light- you never know what is real or what is publicity in Evelyn Hugo's case."
"I could not put this book down. The author develops each character so well, with all of his/her flaws and talents. I was routing for every character. I did not want her story to end!  Fabulous Reid!"
"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a heartbreaking and emotional story that showcases several different types of love, while tackling the fluid nature of sexuality. The book makes you think as much as it makes you cry, and is a worthy read."
"I enjoyed Evelyn’s narration through out the book.  Definitely Not a page turner, but definitely an enjoyable read.  Evelyn was a narcissistic woman who didn’t care who she stepped on along her path to stardom.  Nothing too unusual with the character but intriguing."
I love stories and complicated people.  This book contains both.  I enjoyed Monique and Evelyn’s story as much as I loved Evelyns story.  Life is complex.... especially in Hollywood.
This book was well writtenand it kept you captivated till the end. Once you start reading this book you can't put it down.
It's been a long time since I've read a book and haven't figured out the ending or at least gotten close to figuring it out. This book sucked me in quickly and I spent the majority of my Saturday finishing it.This book is beautifully written and I am so glad a friend lent me the book to read.
I truly loved this book! It is such an engrossing read that I couldn’t put it down. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
"This is the most wonderful book about love, all kinds of love.  It’s a must read.  Absolutely fantastic.  I think it should be required reading in high school."
"This came highly recommended and was well worth the read! It was unexpected, fascinating, and beautiful."
"So much emotions! I was a wreck... made me think of me and my best friend, we're so close. It really hit my heart."
Old Hollywood Glamour and secrets behind the veil…It Engulfed me! Read this one-you won’t regret it!
"I never write amazon reviews but this book is SO good. if you are struggling finding a book because you haven’t read in a while this book is for you. this is a easy read, but at the same time SO good. It goes through past and present. old hollywood glamour, Marilyn Monroe vibes. Evelyn is simply iconic. I already recommended this book to 3 of my friends and my college professors because it’s THAT good."
This book is great! Such an interesting look into life in the lime light in Hollywood! Superbly written and twists I did not see coming. Add this to your must read list!
"So predictable.  A lesbian and a Bi-sexual woman back in early Hollywood… Pat answers, just boring, blah blah blah.  Do not waste your time"
I absolutely loved this book and have zero complaints!  It kept me interested and was well written.
This is possibly my favorite book of all time. I have been telling everyone I know to read it. I am rereading it (a week after the first read) and I’ve never reread a book in my life.
"As far as the plot goes, it was a pretty interesting one and kept my attention fairly well.  However, the amount of incomplete sentences sent me over the edge.  I can’t stand a sentence to start with and, but, or which.  All. The. Time. In. This. Book!  Basic grammar would help this author immensely as she does have talent, but the annoying sentences like that drove me insane."
Love this book so much. The paperback gets greasy really quickly though lol. Just thought I’d share
Loved everything about this story - kept me interested through out. And nice twist at the end. Definitely a must read!
Truly a great read and thought provoking. Well written and truly kept my attention  and hard to put down! Great
"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo was a fun read that kept me entertained until the end.  Since I knew a twist was coming based on reviews I read ahead of time, I figured it out long before the end but that didn’t take away from the tale in the slightest.  I loved all of the Hollywood stories and the manner in which Evelyn’s story unfolded. The book was not at all what I expected it to be, but I enjoyed reading it and was glad I did."
"I gave this book two stars only because I eventually finished it.  The PC really grated on me.  I'm not normally a person to write reviews, but I paid full Kindle price for this book and felt cheated.  Save your money."
"I had to force myself to put this one down and at the same time I didn't want it to end. Amazing storytelling, fascinating characters. One of my favorites ever."
Picked for a book club read and this did not disappoint. Everyone said they couldn’t put it down!
Excellent Book.  Very different.  I immediately downloaded another one of her books and I've recommended to several friends.
"Had such a hard time putting this book down. It was captivating, I’ve recommended to everyone who loves glamorous stories/historical fiction/suspense/whatever. Evelyn is an icon and can’t wait to read more from this author."
"The author of this book is brilliant. I could have read it in a half a day if I wasn’t a full time working mom of 3 kids, lol. Literally could not stop reading it any chance I got. The views on love, being in love, feeling/needing friendships. It’s all so incredibly laid out in this novel. 10/10 would recommend."
"This book was good but it's IMO overly hyped by early ARC reviews a lot.This felt like shipped fan fiction crossed with political Pollyanna outcomes that were so predictable. Additionally it felt like it was going for some NC 17 type mainstream rating. While I don't have to have explicit erotica in my romance, the cross between weirdly glossed through, implied sex scenes and sort of fade to black at the bed until dawn was unsatisfying at best. A little bit of purple prose and I would have been transported back to 1980's Harlequin romances with a lot more pages and a gay twist.Was it romantic to read? Sometimes. I would have rather read a whole book of their emails back and forth, I think that was where the real romance shined with real intimacy. Sometimes it was a dead political bore or infuriating political posturing. Was it fun to read, actually, yes at times but mostly in a way that I didn't see as really very approachable. Was it ridiculous for millennial men under the worlds microscope to not think twice about using email? OMG. So dumb. So, so dumb. Was it lazy and gross for the author to use the trauma of ""outing"" as a driving plot device, absolutely.  Were the secret service basically non existent and incompetent in this book. 100%.Finally, I was actually the most surprised by the editing errors from a major book publisher. The very first sentence after ""Rule Number One"", (this is basically page 1) had a spelling error. I found that to set the tone to find quite a few more, and double sentences and trouble with tense. I assumed for the high $$ ebook price it would have been more professionally done."
"Okay, don’t hate me for this, because my review is certainly in the minority when it comes to this book; I simply couldn’t make up my mind: one star? Two stars? Three stars? Oftentimes, I was annoyed by it— the biased politics— more than that, perpetually frustrated about all the lovey-dovey stuff and incessant faire l'amour (it was excessive!!). Then again, there were moments that really struck me deep, and Lord knows I’m an emotional reader. One key scene towards the end made me tear up a bit, and it’s not often that happens. So, kudos for that. I know this book is going to be a big hit for many people, and I’m fully prepared to defend my unpopular opinion from here on out.Let me say this: it was very clear from the beginning how this story was going to end. It wasn’t surprising... like, at all! But, the joy should be in the journey no matter the outcome, right? Well... no. It was written nicely at times (but mostly it’s a very tumblr/fanfic/glib mess). There were many moments of inspired, descriptive passages and pretty prose, sure, but... It’s a shame that you had to trudge through the too-frequent, unrealistically crude, sarcastic banter to get to it, though, so...Almost every side character is a person of color, and there’s lots of lgbtq representation, which should feel great, but instead comes off as incredibly forced (which is not so great)— like a diversity checklist. The inclusion of multiple POC I perceived as only to be used as a statement, which feels wrong somehow. I dig that here the First Family is biracial, but again, it didn’t feel organic (couldn’t it just be, “This is us. This is who we are” and leave it at that? Instead of it trying to hammer home social commentary?). It’s totally all contrived political correctness. The rep is important: we have multiple LGBTQIA+ caricatures, that came off as disingenuous stereotypes. But mostly, for the entirety of the novel, I couldn’t connect with the MCs. They didn’t feel real enough: too smug, snarky, narcissistic, and the romance was all-consuming (and I hate that)... Give me diversity and representation, but let it make sense! Let it be real!!!A lot happens in the first 10% of the book (it felt like it was crammed in, or one giant prologue that’s multiple chapters long): White House to London, back to USA, then London again, a wedding and three public events— I didn’t know how it was going to be dragged out for the remaining 90%. I wish more time was actually focused on a few of Alex and Henry’s outings earlier on, because they came and went so fast I got whiplash: the trip to the stables was over in a blink, the talk show (I think it was?) was probably a paragraph or two before it jumped abruptly into a charity event. There was SO MUCH room for elaboration... these were missed opportunities for interesting depth progression, and could’ve saved on so much unnecessarily long-winded ramblings later on. After about a third of the way through, the books starts to evolve into something different— more sincere, if you will. Making the first 30-odd percent seem like an infinitely different story/tone.(Side note: the whole ‘young adults debate Star Wars’ schtick is SO overdone).There is a huge identity crisis happening in this novel: sometimes it screams YA, and then other times characters are talking about graphic acts. Fair warning for anyone sensitive to it: there is extremely frequent crude/crass language, and lots of sexual material. One of the more ""intimate"" scenes plays out for like, several pages (too long, in my opinion). We get a dozen (I am not exaggerating!) different sex scenes. Now, I’m no prude (and wholly sex positive), but that’s just TOO MANY! It read like fanfiction-y smut.I also can’t believe I’m saying this, but there was just waaaay too much banter for my liking. It was all “sharp” millennial humor all the dang time. I craved moments of actual sarcasm-less depth and seriousness, and was frequently disappointed most of the way through, which was often, because this book is OVERLONG! I was constantly checking my progress, because the story just dragsssss and I wanted it to pick up the pace.(Not to sound nit-picky, but...)— cool. Another politically-charged book out to vilify Republicans. I get it: it’s AU liberal wish fulfillment about the First Family. They’re Democrats. I’m fine with that, obviously, because I don’t judge people or outright reject anyone based on political affiliation. But couldn’t this book just leave out all the name calling, ignorance, and horrible right-wing stereotyping? The only message I see being pushed here is that Republicans are nothing more than bigoted, racist, fascist, evil, homophobic sexual predators, and Democrats are the ones to save us all. The authoress could’ve done the decent thing: play nice and not be so severely partisan (being pro-bipartisan won’t make you any less progressive), but that’s too much to ask with such clearly imbedded bias. Her disgust for Republicans is scary and, frankly really, really sad. I almost, almost was willing to give the benefit of the doubt, but come the conclusion after the whole “Waterloo” leak, I’m just resigned to the fact that Left-leaning authors will never tolerate opinions outside their own. And it makes me feel bad."
"Alex is First Son of the United States and Henry is the Prince of Wales. Living on opposite sides of the Atlantic means they don’t see each other often, but over the years they’ve managed to have some memorable and tense run-ins. Alex doesn’t quite understand his fascination with Henry, but he knows that Henry wants nothing to do with him. When the two are forced to meet again at a royal wedding, drunk and irritated Alex accidentally pushes Henry, who then grabs onto Alex, sending both men tumbling down a grand staircase in front of hundreds of guests and tabloid reporters.Their parents are less than thrilled with the altercation, and in an effort to smooth over the politically embarrassing moment, Alex and Henry are forced to orchestrate a fake friendship for the next few months. Only the “fake” friendship begins to become something more as both Alex and Henry realize the other isn’t exactly what he seems. Friendship morphs into…romantic feelings? Kind of? Maybe? Which is especially confusing for Alex since he’s (mostly?) sure he’s straight. The two men must navigate their intense and complicated relationship, all while Alex’s mother campaigns for reelection in the States and the Queen scrutinizes Henry’s every move from the throne.So. This was an interesting experience for me. I don’t usually read gay romance, but I have to say this was a really lovely book. Alex and Henry both are extremely well-developed characters. It didn’t take me long to feel like I knew them and was invested in their stories. The plot line itself is sweet and not as predictable as I was expecting. Plus, there’s a lot more going on here than “will they or won’t they?” That dilemma is solved pretty early on, and the second half of the novel is devoted entirely to delivering a much more nuanced message about the ethical boundaries of social media and politics, as well as the efficacy of how we interact with and support the LGBTQ community.In sum, Red, White, and Royal Blue is a really charming book, and (can I say this without sounding ignorant?) I feel like I caught a glimpse into a life I know relatively nothing about and ended up learning a lot. I finished this one feeling happy, yes, but also a little more understanding and knowledgeable. What’s not to love?"
"The plot was fantastically unique, entertaining, and Alex and Henry were the ultimate adorable couple. It didn’t hurt that the entire cast was diverse, lovable, and engaging. There was so much love and palpable adoration between all of them – that I fell easily in love with the entire cast.If you love any of these tropes, you should really give this novel a try.✔️Friends to Lovers✔️Enemies to Lovers✔️Royals✔️Diverse✔️ M/MAll in all the book was ok, but didn't blown me away. I think I was expecting something different. Less politics more romance. I can't complain about the writing because it wasn't bad, and there was more than one scene that made me laugh out loud. And it was easy to adore Alex and Henry, and would have loved to read a more comprised novel just about them. Because this book was way too long.I’m going to be in the minority here, since everyone seems to love this book! But although the plot was right up my alley, the execution wasn’t working for me as much as I hoped for. It was way too long with 432 pages. Also much of the book was about the political background of a presidential campaign and DC politics. And I had a hard time being interested in that part of the story. But I can see how readers might love the in-depth view of a presidential campaign.But besides that, it was a promising debut novel, with awesome characters, well written prose, and smart dialogues.I can’t wait to see what the author comes up with next."
"This book is average. But that's a pretty big let down for a book this excessively hyped. I even pre-ordered my copy.This book reads like Prince Harry fan fiction, set in an alternate reality where Trump never becomes president. The use of private email servers becomes a plot device and it's just too on the nose. The back half of the book is completely dominated by US politics and is largely a literary flogging of Republicans. It was uncomfortable. And boring. It's almost like the author woke up one day and thought, ""I'm going to write a book where Prince Harry is gay *and* use it to tell Americans how to do politics correctly!"" It also didn't ring true, that in 2019, Queen Elizabeth (or whatever her fake version here is called) would be so opposed to a gay grandchild.I enjoyed First Son Alex, but Henry was one of most flat, non-characters I've read in a romance. He's British! And apparently that's all the author thought we needed to know, because nothing else was going on with him. The conflict in this book is some serious weaksauce and all resolved very quickly with a nice, little pollyanna bow. It was too easy for me. Why was this book 420 pages? The plot didn't need them. And, as other reviewers noted, there are quite a few typos in the book.There are a ton of books out there just like this one. It has its fun moments, and young adult romance fans will probably enjoy it, but this book is not as smart as it thinks it is."
"When a book has a lot of hype I tend to stay away from it until the hype has died down. It is a method that has worked for me in the past and I usually stick with it. But after the 5th person told me I needed to read Red, White and Royal Blue immediately, I went against my norm and went with the crowd. And as much I hate saying it, the hype was real for this one and it was 100% warranted. This book was beyond amazing and fantastic and all those perfect adjectives you can think of. It was perfection in a book.Red, White and Royal Blue is the story of Alex, the first son of the United States, and Henry, the Prince of Wales. Alex has hated everything about Henry for a long time and when that hate comes to blows at a Royal Wedding damage control needs to take place. The plan is perfect. Henry and Alex will save face by doing one simple thing, pretend to be best friends. But for these two nothing is ever simple, especially when feelings get added to the mix.First and foremost, Red, White and Royal Blue is so much more than a love story and I think that is why I loved it. It is a story of finding out who you are and a story of acceptance, of yourself and by others. It’s a story of putting aside what is expected of you and just being you. Alex and Henry do not have easy lives and this unexpected romance complicates them even more. But through it all, they managed. And they managed to make me laugh and cry and swoon right along with them.It is so hard to review a book you loved as much as I loved Red, White and Royal Blue. Finding words feel impossible. I want to tell you everything that I loved but I want to leave the mystery for you too. I want you to be able to feel what I felt when I read it the first time. The one thing I can leave you with though… I want to live in the world that Casey McQuiston has created."
"Okay. Buckle up, guys, because I'm so ready to absolutely rave and gush about how perfect this book was. I'm calling it now. Red, White and Royal Blue will be on my Top 5 Favorite Books of 2019 list if not my overall #1 favorite of the year. It was everything my little queer heart wanted and needed! I'm more than a bit obsessed with it and I can't stop thinking about it. Case in point: I have reread it four times since reading it for the first time back in April. It makes my heart grows three sizes too big every time I think about the romance and the characters.The voice in this book is spectacular! You all know how much I love good banter and this book had it in spades! The dialogue felt so real! It's a bit crass. More than a bit smart while being hysterical and romantic. I loved the writing in this book so much! I loved how the author included tweets, texts, and emails as part of the narrative! The emails between Henry and Alex were everything! I’m literally the heart-eyes emoji every time I think about them.I loved how politically and socially relevant it was! I don't know why I was so surprised by the amount of politics in this book especially since the story is told from the perspective of the First Son of the United States but I was. But I also loved how seamlessly they were integrated into the story and how much they added to the narrative. I was also deeply fascinated because it felt like a true look behind the White House curtain. The political issues are so relevant to our current political climate. It was also a little bittersweet reading about this amazing female president that won the 2016 election. I loved that the Claremont-Diaz family and the royal family were fictional but had these wonderful real life optimistic parallels.I love me a relevant woke book and I'll stop gushing about that aspect of it because I haven't talked about the characters and the romance yet! It was the perfect enemies to fake friends to friends to lovers book I didn’t know I needed in my life. The meet cute disaster! The bickering and the banter! The romance! Alex's bisexual awakening was written in this perfectly believable way that made my heart ache in all the best ways. I also couldn't stop grinning like a fool at all of Alex's Oh Crap! moments and at how adorable the romance between Alex and Henry was. It was extremely gratifying seeing how they brought out the best in each other and how they let in the people around them.Let's talk about the friendship and family dynamics and how perfect they were. I absolutely adored June, Nora, Bea, and Pez! The total support that they gave to Alex and Henry made my heart ache and tear up in places. I love seeing positive sibling relationships in books and the ones in this one were perfect! June and Alex! Henry and Bea! I loved it so much! I also loved Alex and Nora's friendship! It's always so refreshing to read about an opposite gender friendship that doesn't turn into the romance. I am low-key obsessed with all the relationships in this book. I loved Alex's parents and his relationship with them. Also, his relationship with Zahra was so great!Also, can we talk about how amazingly diverse this book is? I loved how extremely and truly diverse the entire cast was, in so many meaningful ways. It has a biracial (half-Mexican, half-White) and bisexual main character with a diverse cast with both racial and sexual representation across the board. This book is everything I want to see more of in books. I'm always saying that I want to see more of my favorite and slightly overdone tropes made queer. This book embodies all of those wants and it is a great example at just how good a queer remaking of our favorite tropes can be.Reading this book was like reading a romcom movie and I can't get the thought out of my head about how much I want this book to be made into a movie. I loved this book a lot a lot. Is one book too early to make Casey McQuiston an autobuy author? Because I’m pretty sure she’s just officially made my auto-buy list with this book."
"Okay, first things first: I am obsessed with this book. I read it every chance I could get over about four very busy days and it pained me to stop reading it whenever I had to. It’s hilarious and romantic and stressful and beautiful and, damn, we do not deserve this book.Casey McQuiston’s New Adult debut is one for the ages. This work could be that of a veteran author with years of comedy and drama under their belt. It knows exactly what the hell it is doing at all times. The pace is quick and transitions happen seamlessly like that of a Star Wars film. There are, in my humble opinion, no filler scenes in this book. Every word, every piece of dialogue is important.Part of the reason that I now breathlessly Stan this book is because of the character work. Alex and Henry are both so intricately crafted. There are so many layers to each of our boys and Casey slowly peels off a little at a time to show us who they are. Reading their journey, both together and separately, was like a really, really good therapy session. You know the one I’m talking about. The one where you have a breakthrough and you leave that room feeling like you’re another step closer to figuring it all out.Both of these boys are grappling with the intense pressure to be someone they aren’t. Henry’s pressure mostly comes from the Crown and his sense of duty while Alex’s mirrors that but is more self-inflicted. Alex’s family is very liberal but Alex knows that his image means everything when it comes to being a figurehead in American politics and that’s all he has ever wanted. McQuiston’s handling of these two through-lines is masterful and emotional. I’ve not experienced so many distinct and quick emotion swings while reading a book in a long time. Laughter through tears is something that I was used to at the end of the novel.Her supporting character work is also wonderful. We have Alex’s sister, June, who is fiercely protective of her little brother and Nora, his genius BFF. These two are always there for Alex to either take him down a notch or lift him up. They are superheroes and I want a whole book about them.A recurring theme in this book is duty; specifically to the places you come from and the people that raise you. We see how this takes a toll on Henry throughout the novel through how difficult it is to be a member of the Royal Family and how he is only expected to perpetuate the bloodline even at the cost of his own happiness. He’s the freaking Prince of Wales and he is gay AF and all of the rules tell him that he can’t be the one thing he truly is. McQuiston paints a heartbreakingly honest portrait of what that would most likely be like in real life.Alex’s duty is a little different. Not only is his mother the POTUS, but he is also a biracial boy from the very red state of Texas. Alex loves Texas dearly and misses it very much. Throughout the book, we hear Alex talk about how Texas raised him and how he feels a great debt to the state to make it better. His love and care for his home state, his country, and the people in it drives almost all of his major decisions in the book. It’s a very admirable thing and the emotional power that it holds in the book’s final moments is proof that duty, and the finite power we let it have over us, is the key to what makes every choice in this book work so well.I desperately want more books in this bright hopeful AU of the world today. I finished this story with tears on my face and hope for the upcoming election cycle. Casey McQuiston’s characters aren’t afraid to scream their truth. They aren’t afraid to make a difference. They aren’t afraid to be hopeful that everything is going to be alright and neither is she. 2019 is going to be a bright year for McQuiston and, hopefully, 2020 will be a bright year for us all."
"I was really excited about this book. It was up my alley. The author clearly had no clue about how the Royal family or the United Kingdom’s government works. Moreover, she doesn’t understand the rules, laws, and protocol that govern the Royal family. It’s not obscure information. It’s readily available. It’s an institution steeped in tradition and has changed very little over the centuries. So for me, an avid history fan, it was a complete let down. I understand that the characters in this family are fictional, but she could have created a fake country or use a lesser known European monarchy.Additionally the characters were not well developed. They seemed very effeminate so it was a shock to me that one of the characters didn’t identify as gay or bi. Wow. The relationship was very heteronormative. As if it were written and then the author went back and changed pronouns. It had funny moments but that was not enough to save it."
"Checks all the necessary boxes for identity politics and multiculturalism.  Characters are soulless and contrived, so was the plot.  This book was sophmoric and juvenile."
"I absolutely expected to adore this book. I was a bit taken aback when I didn't immediately love it. Alex, the First Son of the US President, was the narrator and yikes, his mind an exhausting, cluttered place to be in. We're told he's smart, thinks fast and is a high achiever but the person who's mind I was in was the opposite. This discrepancy between traits we're told about and the characters' actual action happens throughout the book, and made me feel detached from the story and its people.The fictive British princes in the story are obvious carbon copies of the real Prince William and Prince Harry. I struggled majorly with the incorrect use of real world facts in the book. Even if this would have been a self-published work, I would have laid into an author who used the British royal titles all wrong, and the sheer laziness of the choice of the name Prince Henry for the love interest... which happens to the real Prince Harry's given name. I got the distinct feeling the author didn't know this about the name Henry.Rant ahead; I cannot fathom that no one involved in the production of this book didn't do simple fact checks before publishing. For a book from a big name publisher, which surely must have been through a dev editor, line editors, tonnes of beta readers—how come no one waved a red flag about all the incorrect facts? No one thought ""Hey, let's get a British editor involved for authenticity"". As the story stands, I'm shocked at the poor level of research that have gone into a story where the British royal family plays a large part. Every time Prince Henry the Spare uses the name Wales as his incognito surname I cringed, as The Prince of Wales honorary title would only be given to the heir to the throne—his older brother Philip in this book.There were some good bits too. I liked the chemistry between the pair, and at first their courtship was cute and sweet. Even though I was entertained in parts, the world never came alive to me. There was a distance that kept the words being just letters on a page, rather than an escape to an alternative world. Sadly by the time the longwinded love letters appeared in the second half of the story, I started skimming to get to the finish line.I'm sure I wasn't the target audience for this story. I found it juvenile, the jokes terribly unfunny and banter unwitty, if there is such a word. I'm glad for McQuiston and the mainstream success this lgbt romance has had, but after this experience I probably won't read any of their future books."
"Gave up about 20% into the book.  Returned for refund.  Too glib, too many f-bombs.  Didn't like the main character, Alex.  (There are already enough rude people in the real world.)  Found multiple grammatical errors."
"First of all, Alex and Henry are adorable. Full stop. You will absolutely root for them from early on in the book. I say ""early on"" rather than from the first page because this book starts slow. It gets a little bogged down in political detritus in places, particularly close to the beginning. But once the romance between Alex and Henry ramps up, the book really starts to flow.Literally the only reason I didn't give this five stars is the political parts of the story. Yes, Alex's mother is president and is in the middle of a re-election campaign. And that plays a heavy role in Alex's life and ambitions. But parts of it really just feel like a way for the author to shoehorn in her own political ideals. Which, you know, it's her book. But it is jarring in what is supposed to be a lovely romance between these young men. I'm just saying, it took me out of the story sometimes when there were such pointed shots being fired. I mean, I read fiction to escape things like politics! But this was a solid romance, and I seriously adore Alex and Henry. I was really hoping for a nice epilogue showing them a few years down the road!"
"Just stay away. Dripping n the author's politics, like a bad uninformed CNN pundit. No plauseable historical way theme could play out or understanding of U.S. Protocol. FYI we're not important enough, let alone a first rst kid with ego issues, to be near the royal family to set up the plot.. Listen I'm alll for parody , but this is 7th grade fan fiction where the race of characters is more important than than facts. Look elsewhere."
"Too much politics not enough love. I didn’t feel any chemistry between Alex and Henry. Also, everyone was over dramatic."
Terribly written which is a shame considering the subject matter is one that deserves a well-written book. The narrative point of view makes it very convoluted and hard to read and understand.
"I suspected I would love Red, White & Royal Blue before I'd read a single page. I mean, I was half in love based on the blurb and cover alone. Once I started reading, I just couldn't (or wouldn't) put it down for anything. I caught a major case of instalove for Casey's debut.I swear, I cheesy grinned my way through basically 95% of Red, White & Royal Blue. The White House Trio was AMAZING. I loved each of those characters so much. None, perhaps, more than Alex however. His voice was honest and authentic and I absolutely adored him. I, like Alex, initially thought Henry was a little too stuffy and boring, but I couldn't have been more wrong. He was endearing and I enjoyed him so much.Alex and Henry's enemies-to-friends-to-love story was just perfect. Their chemistry was wonderful and their banter had me totally cracking up. The progression of the relationship between them was so, so freaking good. They gave me all the feels and swoons. Plus it's just fun to think about the international relations between a first child and British royalty, right? I sure thought it was.Everything about Red, White & Royal Blue — from the characters to the friendships to the romance to the family interactions to the political aspects — worked for me. There were some things that hit ridiculously close to home with the current state of affairs in our country, but that made it all the more realistic. I really want this to be the start of a series. I would love love love more from the White House Trio. Each of those characters was so rich and unique, I'm not ready to give them up. In fact, I need to snag the audio of this one because there will be rereads for years to come."
"Boring due to lack of a complex plot or character development.  Language and train of thought writing is disjointed and juvenile.  From the sample offered at Amazon, I did not expect the soft-porn introduced after the sample material.  I have also learned my habit of ignoring the cover graphics on Kindle books can result in missing clues about the plot.And there is Alex, who is presented as a very intelligent 20/21 year old with the ability to sweet talk ""everyone"" (including senators and representatives in the US Congress) into sharing important political information with him.  Then we are asked to believe he is totally unaware of his pervasive and longstanding sexual interest in males, that he views his repetitive make out sessions with his best friend during high school as ""typical male adolescence"".  Yeah, right.  He is a really insightful young man.IMO, in general it is not a good idea for women to try to write about sexual experiences from a male point of view, nor is it particularly effective for men to try to write from a female perspective.  There are almost always plausibility issues and ends up being more about the author's own fantasies  vs. any plot development. It rarely works."
"If you want to read chapter after chapter of vulgar language explicitly describing homosexual sex, then this is the book for you. It could have been so much better if it didn’t try so hard to be flagrant. Don’t waste your time."
"This was such a good romance book! First off, the diversity amazing! It made me tear up to imagine a First Family that could look like the Claremont-Diaz family. A biracial family, children of immigrants, and queer to boot! I will say because this is a book about the First Family and their presidential campaign 2020, the book might not be as timeless. But in a way, it was lovely to imagine this alternative version of the 2016 election and resulting years.The romance between First Son Alex Claremont-Diaz and England’s Prince Henry was everything you could want in a romance. It was my favorite enemies-to-lovers trope. Seeing the transformation between “hate” to love made me feel gooey and sweet. I honestly thought they were perfect for each other. Henry’s cautiousness and introspective nature combined with Alex’s frenetic energy and confidence complemented each other so well. You saw how they made each other stronger. Their banter and flirting were adorable and so funny. Ugh, these two!!My favorite moments were the emails they sent each other. In each email, they sent an excerpt of a historical document between historical figures. Alexander Hamilton sent to John Laurens. Eleanor Roosevelt to Lorena Hicock. Whether or not you believe Alexander Hamilton or any other person included was truly queer is not the point. These excerpts they shared to each other make such an emotional impact because they are in the same situation as queer historical figures – unable to freely express their love. Not only are both men have to deal with being in the public eye, but they also carry the weight of their country on their shoulders. On a personal level, they love their country. Alex has always dreamed to make the nation a better place for marginalized peoples through politics. Henry was raised knowing he may one day lead England. This weighs heavily on both of them. Being able to share what other influential historical figures felt for their loved one as a way to express what they are feeling to each other made me feel all kinds of emotions.“Thinking about history makes me wonder how I’ll fit into it one day, I guess. And you too. I kinda wish people still wrote like that. History, huh? Bet we could make some.”Another element of the story I loved so much was the friendship and family love. Alex, June (Alex’s sister), Nora (family friend), Henry, and Bea (Henry’s sister) was a beautiful example of love and acceptance. Their crazy moments of getting drunk, dancing, and letting loose reminds you, despite their influence, are just twenty-somethings trying to create a happy and joyful life for themselves.“Take anything you want and know you deserve to have it.”Overall, this was an excellent romance book and I loved how the whole story was crafted together."
"I was really hoping to absolutely adore this book, especially after all the hype I've seen ahead of its release, but it didn't quite get there for me. I very much enjoyed the story itself, and thought the main characters were well-rounded, with believable conflicts and reactions to conflicts.However, the writing style itself didn't really work for me. It was quite choppy, and didn't seem to flow as well as it could have. Also, a lot of the side characters felt like McQuiston was just trying to add as many diverse characters as possible, without giving them the attention they deserve. If you want to have good side characters, there should be fewer of them, because it felt like half the time a character was dropped in for about ten seconds then would disappear for a long time and when they come back the reader is supposed to remember who they are. For my personal taste, I'd prefer fewer, more well rounded and fleshed out characters. The other thing that really bothered me throughout, is that I think it should have been written in first person. I normally trust the author on decisions like that, but honestly, in this case, I think she made the wrong choice. All of these issues may simply be a product of a debut novel, so I would try something by this author again, but I was unfortunately somewhat disappointed in this."
"BUYER BEWARE...DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE READING THIS BOOK. MAKE SURE YOU ARE 100% SURE OF THE STORY LINE BEFORE YOU BUY.  It was not my kind of book.  It was suggested to me by Amazon, I downloaded the sample and enjoyed that, so I purchased the Kindle book.  A few chapters after the sample, the book turned in a direction I was not comfortable reading.  I quickly started reading a new book and never finished this one."
"Despite its critical acclaim, instant bestseller status,  innumerable awards, and snapped-up movie rights, I hesitated to read ""Red, White, and Royal Blue."" The title seemed too … cute. The book cover seemed too … cute. The theme seemed too … cute. Wow, am I sorry I waited. ""Red, White, and Royal Blue"" meets and exceeds the attention it has earned. It has everything: warmly drawn and winning characters, a wonderful story, fascinating settings, romance, cut-throat politics, hilarious humor, palace intrigue, current events, love of family, thrills, pop culture, history, sex (very, very hot sex), excitement, love, courage, betrayal, hope for the future, fireworks, and a cliffhanger or two. Reading this book, you will be utterly charmed. You will also fall in love, you will often laugh out loud, and sometimes, you will cry. Oh, will you cry.I ""read"" this by following the Kindle e-book text while listening to the brilliant voice acting of award-winning actor Ramon De Ocampo. He was a revelation. He nimbly navigated different characters, different accents, even different languages in a way that gave great life to the story and depth to his characters, and he did it all with a seeming ease and total naturalness. I've rarely heard a more assured and enjoyable performance. If you're thinking about buying the Kindle version, buy the Audible version to go with it. You won't regret it.Lastly, ""Red, White, and Royal Blue"" benefits from a second reading. The author's subtle foreshadowing, her placement of little clues of what's to come, is even more enjoyable the second time around and gives a second reading depth and nuance. You'll enjoy it even more the second time.Especially in these times, we need things that bring us a little escape, a little brightness, and much joy. ""Red, White, and Royal Blue"" does exactly that. Highly, highly recommended."
"This book did not live up to the hype for me, unfortunately. Though it was not marketed as such, it was written so much like a YA book with tons of ""cool, hip"" pop culture references mixed in that it really felt like I was reading a work of tumblr fanfiction at times. The characters feel like caricatures of themselves and while I understand this book is an escapist fantasy at best, everything that transpired was so predictable yet unrealistic. Alex's and Henry's romance wasn't very convincing to me. Maybe I'm more of a fan of the slow-burn because they spent most of the book boning and suddenly grow madly in soulmate love through that. It just all felt like lust-driven puppy love rather than two star-crossed lovers that you want to root for."
"I don't read much fiction, to be honest, and even less in the romance genre—I think the last time I read a romance was at least five years ago. But the description of this book intrigued me, and I decided to give it a try.Spoiler: I absolutely loved it. The romance was sweet, nuanced, and sexy, but the book didn't spend too much time on the love scenes for me—I have a limited capacity for sex scenes, and I really appreciated the ratio, here. The sexy bits were hot, but didn't take over the story. I was absolutely convinced of the romance, but even more, I was invested in Alex's story and in all the characters who make up his extended family. I also so deeply respect the deft way that the author navigated the spaces between our current political reality and the world the book inhabited.My favorite thing about this book is that I loved every single character (Nora! June! Amy! Zahra! etc. etc.) and i was cheering for them all. At the climactic scene of the book, I cried, because every character in the story had a stake. I also loved the pacing and the ebb and flow of the emotional beats. This is a masterfully edited and structured romance, in my opinion—one of the best I've ever read. I will read it again, which says a lot—I've only kept two other romance novels over the years to re-read. It's also super-satisfying in terms of diversity and social awareness. What a relief, to read a beautiful, sweet, and upbeat romance that includes diverse people I can relate to. I savored every moment of this book, and look forward to reading more of this author's work!"
"A number of people recommended this book to me, so even though I wasn't wowed by the cover or the blurb, I decided to give it a go.At first I found myself holding back from the story, not engaging with it.  That was in large part because of the use of acronyms and slang that I didn't understand.  I think the book is intended for an American audience, and the author assumes that people will know what she's referring to.  I figured out FSOTUS, but a number of the others eluded me.  On the other hand, I knew a number of the Britishisms.  For instance, I knew what Cornettos and cullen skink were.  However, the author assumes readers won't know these and explains them in context, so I had no advantage there.  Some of the slang may have been generational, but I live with two teenagers, so I'm guessing it was my lack of  knowledge about American culture and politics rather than my age.Another thing was that it's told in present tense.  That was quite disconcerting, but that's a personal preference, not anything 'wrong' with the book.Ultimately, those were my only negatives, and they were incredibly minor in the overall scheme of things.  I'm not sure at what point I got sucked in to the story, but I did.  I got swept up in the romance between Alex and Henry, and the brilliant secondary characters were perfect.I loved the humour.  The humour was brilliant.  I highlighted so many passages for being hilarious.  Here's just one example:'The hosts of This Morning are agonizingly British—a middle-aged woman named Dottie in a tea dress and a man called Stu who looks as if he spends weekends yelling at mice in his garden.'Yelling at mice?  Ha ha!  Love it!   A number of the passages I highlighted are not 'suitable' for an Amazon review, but they definitely made me laugh and smile.Although there's a happy ever after (because it's a romance novel, duh), things certainly did not proceed idyllically for Alex and Henry.  One of my favourite scenes was Alex's panic attack after things hit the fan, because it felt so real.  At that point I fully invested in seeing these two get their Happily Ever After.  I also loved the author's poetical way of writing, which certainly came through in the emails exchanged by Alex and Henry, but also in the story itself.If you like the idea of getting a (fictional) glimpse inside life in the White House or life as a British royal, you'll love this book.  If you don't care about status and the idea of reading about politics bores you to death (me!), you might still love it.  Because ultimately, Alex and Henry are ordinary people who want ordinary things - love, family, support, goals and dreams.  They're multi-dimensional, not coasting along on their family's money, nor does everything come easily to them.  They felt real, and so did the secondary characters.  I loved June and Nora.  It wasn't wholly predictable, which I feared, although I think the key points were.  There was enough to keep you wondering how something would work out though, and certainly plenty to have you turning the page and staying up way later than you ought to.I gave it five stars, because despite my initial impression and frustration with words and letters I didn't understand, I got lost in Alex and Henry's story and couldn't put the book down.  The more I read, the more I loved it."
"I don’t read a lot of M/M books, but I am drawn to unique and different plots, along with a patriotic cover that had me envisioning Old Glory waving proudly in the wind.  Then there was the tantalizing book blurb with the hint of “Royals”.  And finally the fact that it was chosen for Goodreads Choice Award 2019 in both the Romance and Debut Novel categories sealed the deal between me and the one-click button.  I had the need to read and see for myself why and how it had won out over a few of my very favorites in two different categories.A new-to-me-author, Casey McQuiston, is what I refer to as a “wordy” author.  The book was long and, at times, rather slow and lost some of its razzle-dazzle in the deluge of words.Alex and Prince Henry are quite an entertaining couple.  The rest of the cast was just as delightful, as well.  Madam President felt a little stiff and quick to judge – and was my least favorite of the group.  Still, I was cheering her to victory in her campaign for a second term as President.  I loved the vocal sparring between all the relationships – family and friends.  The emails that flew back and forth between Alex and Henry were a snarky- cute-smart tool in bringing them closer  together.Many reviewers have made a point that they’ve found the political language as being overdone. I admit to being a bit of a political junkie, so I really found these parts of the book quite fun-to-read and, at times, quite interesting as well as entertaining.Neither loving or hating, this book fell into mid-range for me. I didn’t cry, didn’t swoon or giggle.  I may have released an ""ahh"" once or twice, but nothing ever overly affected me one way or the other.  I was disappointed that there’s far more “telling” than “seeing” the characters in their portrayed roles.  Frankly, I have read far better “romance.”  I didn't really feel the ""love"" -- more like being awed by your best buddy.  The sex is assumed but takes place behind closed doors – which was fine by me.  My personal preference generally leans towards less graphics. Even in the author's telling, I never felt the overabundance of a  soul-pounding, everlasting love connection between Alex and his Prince Charming.The writing was smart, clever and witty – lots of comical encounters between characters, no complaints with the diversified cast of characters, and it obviously received top billing for many readers. But sometimes it just became a bit too much – almost juvenile at times.  I also felt there was too much repetition throughout the storyline.  Cutting out some of this and making the book a bit shorter in length may have solved some of my problems.""Red White & Royal Blue"" is this author’s debut novel, and I look forward to seeing  what she brings to the table with her next release."
"I am on the fence about this book. I think I was on the fence about it sense it was published, hence it took me awhile to get around to reading it. I was able to pick it up for my Kindle for cheap, and then it was a pick for a group read on a Discord server I’m a member so I finally ran out of excuses to avoid it.The first thing I will say is that I enjoyed the romance aspect of it. It was definitely a shake up on the normal royal romance troupe. I also completely appreciated the entire escapism of the story as the presidency went from Obama to the Claremont presidency. (Sorry, I know that last sentence was clunky). As I was reading it, it was definitely nice to be able to escape into the story and pretend that Donald Trump didn’t exist, a deadly pandemic wasn’t killing people at an alarming rate and we weren’t having almost daily police shootings and race protests going on every single day. So it had that going for it.Escapism only really goes so far though. I don’t know a huge amount of the inner workings of the White House and First Family but it seemed way too lax from the bit I do know. I’m aware that this story is 100% fiction, and there is license to bend things to make them fit into the narrative of the story but I found it kind of annoying (and hence the reason I don’t often read books involving characters that are based on real people or have high profile roles). These are the kind of details that, personally, take me out of the story a bit too much.The biggest thing however was the writing style. I was never able to put my finger on what was off about it, I even pointed it out to the other people in the group and they agreed but they couldn’t point to it either. It just felt off reading at times, and I found myself skimming over entire sections and then realizing I had no recollection of what I had read and then having to reread it…and then there was the profanity. Now, I’m not a prude. I am perfectly fine to let loose with a eff bomb when the situation requires, but there was one character in particular who did nothing except curse. This was suppose to be a character who was well educated, had a job in the White House working directly with the First Family and all she did was curse. It was excessive, exhausting and completely ruined a character that may have actually been interesting.I gave this book a three stars, with in my rating system basically means that I liked the book, but I probably won’t recommend it nor will I read a sequel if one is released. If this turns into a movie/series I “might” consider watching it as I think that might be a fun watch."
"I had high hopes for this book. I saw it recommended all over social media. The Amazon reviews were decent. I'm not usually in the market for some queer male fiction, but I figured I'd give it a try.The queer male fiction part didn't bother me, but the heinous attempts to be hip-to-the-lingo and pithy put me over. I don't particularly like when authors try to incorporate a lot of texting communications or social media interaction within books (just a personal preference), but this book had them out the wazoo. The banter between the characters caused the story to lose any sort of believability. This was a poor attempt at making larger-than-life characters—they just fell flat and I honestly found them annoying.All in all, this book read like some pithy fan fiction and I couldn't even get through the first half. Don't waste your money."
"I need a lifetime supply of Kleenex and a trophy that says Best Book of 2019 to give to Casey McQuiston. My heart now has a space carved out that belongs to Alex Claremont-Diaz and Prince Henry Windsor, to Red, White & Royal Blue, to all of us readers left in a puddle of tears caused by this beautiful, poignant story. Not only is this book an incredible LGBTQ+ enemies to lovers romance, it's also the book you didn't even know you needed in our present political climate. I didn't even know I needed it and now I can't shut up about it. I said it in one of my Instagram stories, I wish I had this book in my hands when I was 18 and preparing to vote for the very first time. I wish I had all the thoughts I have now in my head, but at least I've got them now, and hey a Presidential election is on the horizon.""History, huh?""Cute, funny, and full of heart, Red, White & Royal Blue follows Alex Claremont-Diaz, son to the President of the United States, as he is forced to befriend Prince Henry Windsor, Prince of England to be exact, at least for the media. Alex is the Mexican-American first son to the democratic FEMALE President and he has high hopes of joining the political world alongside his mother. He sees the title President in his future, but that won't happen as long as he is considered the enemy of the Prince of England, which he really is. Prince Henry Windsor, who we shall now just call Henry, is the quiet, arrogant, well-dressed grandson of the Queen. He is charity events, forced smiles, and a media golden child, at least to Alex. When they're forced to hang out in order to put the media storm to rest they discover that they have quite a bit in common and soon their alliance forms into a friendship. Their friendship leads to some startling discoveries for Alex, like he's bisexual, and some timid sharing from Henry, a closeted gay thanks to familial and societal expectations. What started as a laugh-out-loud story of forced friendship soon became a story of heartbreak, hope, and humanity as Alex and Henry explore their blossoming desires for one another. Their romance is told through in person-interactions, texts, phone calls, and the best emails I have ever read. It's an authentic story about two young men discovering their identities and figuring out the shape and direction of their futures, all with an ocean and several titles between them.""Whatever, fine. Henry is annoyingly attractive. That's always been a thing, objectively. It's fine.""Casey McQuiston created an entirely new world in Red, White & Royal Blue. Sure, it's America and England, but it's a world with diverse leaders who desire to make positive changes, who truly fight for the people. Alex and Henry know their position and their families' position in the public will make their relationship, their identities, more difficult to embrace, and yet Casey creates for them a world in which they recognize there is strength and power in owning it. Their friends and families, and employees, come from diverse backgrounds, have various heritages, and love freely. Many are out and proud, many wear that culture proudly, Alex and Henry have just not yet found their footing among them. I loved the secondary characters in this novel just as much as I loved our two main heroes. Speaking of secondary characters and world building, I am obsessed with the character interactions in this book. The relationships felt fluid and natural, there is no stilted dialogue. The characters speak and think like their age, their humor is spot on, and the romance is fresh and new feeling. The language, the prose, all of it just made this book that much better for me. I could live in these pages and I mean that quite sincerely, snotty sobbing and all, this book holds a story I want to live and I'm thankful Casey McQuiston gave me the opportunity to do so with her words.""Straight people, he thinks, probably don't spend this much time convincing themselves the're straight.""Royal romance, politics, and everyone writing about their heart and their tears? Not normally my cuppa tea. I saw the reviews for this though, they were darn good, and one of my closets friends said it was a must-read for my June Pride reading challenge, she also included it was her favorite for the year, so I picked it up and now I do not want to put it down. For the six hours I read this book I sincerely believed every single character was a real person in my life. I was either crying, making heart eyes, or preparing to go fight alongside them. Red, White & Royal Blue took me on the cutest adventure ever and my emotions were not prepared for all the adorable, painful, and realistic moments in is pages. Not only do I wholeheartedly recommend this novel, I also think it should be a must read. It's important, while also being the feel-good story we need."
"Contrived plot, unrealistic situations, cliche characters, adolescent dialogue ... this book has it all. It is almost as if artificial intelligence wrote this book. It is bad. Very, very bad."
"OK, this is going to be a very unpopular opinion and please know that I didn't hate this book I just didn't love it like everyone else has.  Red White & Royal Blue is so hyped that I needed to get my hands on it right away and I was so happy to have the time to sit and read but to be honest it took me a while and when I say a while I mean almost half of the book for things to get more interesting and well just amazing, and I don't think I can give a book a full 5 stars when it didn't really capture me from the very beginning.With all that said, I will also say that even though I didn't love it, I did liked it a lot and the three stars rating is a strong rating if that makes sense.  This book follows Alex son of the United States President and Henry Prince of England, these two didn't have a great beginning but the in between was one of my favorite things in the book.  I love how their friendship even though it was kind of force at the beginning turned to be one of the best I have read so far, the interaction between these two had me laughing out loud at times and they emails, I'm melting right now just thinking back on it.  I will also need to mention all the side characters, they were great and Alex's relationship with his sister and closed friends was amazing.Overall, I did like this book a lot there's great diversity and great character dynamics that I really loved.  The hate to friends and more story also great! My issue with the book is that it took a while for me to really get excited about things but like I said it is a great read."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but for the life of me, I don't know why.I mean, the characters are drawn with all the nuance of a baseball bat. You'll find more subtly shaded personalities in one of Kristy McNichol's After School Specials. The major players are either good, or bad, or good but pretending to be bad. Don't expect anyone to play against type.Also, the plot is entirely predictable. Even if I wanted to reveal spoilers here, I couldn't because there simply aren't any. Once you've read the cover blurb and the first 20 pages, you know where this train is going to end up 425 pages later.And yet, I 100%, unequivocally enjoyed it.Maybe it's because Red, White, and Royal Blue is an airy, storybook romance. I'm not usually drawn to works like this, but someone in my book club chose it for our next read, and ultimately, I appreciated being forced out of my rut.Maybe it's because it's a gay love story. Don't get me wrong, I read a fair amount of LGBT fiction, but most of it is pretty bleak. (See, for example, Lie With Me.) This was a welcome change from the usual.Or maybe it's because, as I write this, the COVID-19 pandemic is raging through my hometown of New Orleans, killing thousands of people around the globe, forcing me and most people I know to stay home and distance ourselves, forego the handshakes and hugs and warm kisses of family and friends. When stressful situations like that arise--situations in which there's nothing to do but wait for a problem to resolve itself--I tend to distract myself with fluff. This fits the bill perfectly."
"I want to start by saying that there wasn't any one thing that was glaringly wrong with the book that has made me rate it so low, but there were a lot of little things that were too easy, too idealistic, too optimistic that made something that was supposed to be a pleasant alternative reality to something so completely unbelievable that I had a hard time finishing it. It also simultaneously suffered from being far too long for what was presented in the love story and far too short for the multitude of other important topics that were haphazardly thrown in there for good measure.As a young, democratic American woman, I want the world that Casey McQuiston paints in this book, but I'm also firmly planted in the actual reality of America, which has to fight for the incremental changes to achieve this. We don't live in a nation in which a divorced, democratic woman president with interracial children, one of whom is openly bisexual (by the end), is running a reelection campaign after having succeeded another two-term democratic president. Do you know what the last time we had two democratic presidents in a row? It was James Buchanan, the 15th President, back in 1857. What about a democratic president who succeeded a two-term presidency from the same part? 1836. And the exact situation in the book with a two consecutive, two-termed democratic presidencies? Never. And of course all this is setting aside the beautiful, but improbable diversity that is depicted in this book but unfortunately is not only not mirrored in our past, but is not in the near future either.Of course, books can be equally about dreaming as they are about reality, and people need an escape. I completely agree and was on board to suspend my disbelief, but then it was one all-too-easy depiction of hard realities and obstacles people have to face after another. This book touched on so much--from grief over the loss of a parent, struggling with your sexuality, being interracial, living in a blended family, experiencing an attempted sexual assault, addiction to drugs, dealing with anxiety, depression, and panic attacks, and having expectations on you and not getting to choose who you want to be--and yet did nothing for any of these experiences because none of it was real enough, even for an escapist book. It's important to have books that normalize the different experiences people go through and make them positive, but it felt so far from reality that it was bordering on insulting and diminishing.If none of these hot-button topics interest you, here is my brief review on the romance itself rather than the context it was in.I was surprised and a little disappointed at how fast this enemies-to-lovers story progressed. I don't think this trope would actually accurately define the book as feelings of hatred were completely one-sided and over by a quarter to a third into the book. Because of that, it also felt closer to insta-love than slow burn or the regular progression of a relationship. The timing and progress was a miss for me for these reasons and because the book was so long for a romance that it seemed to completely strike a dissonance with the relationship's progression.Finally, a few random, contributing factors to my rating:This book had a lot more politics (hence my long-winded review of that section above) in it than I thought there would be. It isn't just a background. It is part of the story in its own right. If you don't like politics or political intrigue in your books, I don't think this would be for you.I also didn't get much enjoyment out of was all the drinking and partying. Not that these things aren't a part of adult lives, but the frequency and degree of it just seemed to clash with the more mature themes of the book and the fact that two of the main characters were highly public and important figures.Finally, and least directly related to my rating, I didn't care for the voice the novel was written in. It swung heavily back and forth from ""teen speak"" to ""posh British,"" no doubt to mirror the love interests. It rubbed me the wrong way as it felt like it painted the American as crass, loud, and less educated and the Brit as posh, cold, and humorless, both of which are obviously harmful stereotypes. While, by the end, the characters developed more nuance, the voices and tone changes stayed the same instead of also evolving. Again, just didn't fit.Overall, it was a new adult that tried to achieve a lot with its faster-paced read (but also over 400 pages) with not-quite fade to black sex scenes, big topics covered, and a happy (improbable) ending. It wasn't for me. Maybe my negative review will persuade some people that this book is exactly what they are looking for, though. Do with it what you will, and happy reading.TW: Grief over loss of a parent, questioning sexuality, attempted sexual assault (told not depicted), addiction to drugs (told not depicted), dealing with anxiety, depression, and panic attacks, getting outted"
"I enjoyed this book  but it was very uneven, going between a a ""fan-fictiony"" feel (where I have to admit my attention lagged at times,) through lots of political correctness, to then surprising heights of romance.  There was a very self-conscious effort to be all inclusive with every stripe of sexuality and ethnicity represented -- this is a fine thing but it felt like the author had gone through a checklist and made sure each box was ticked and it felt forced; it was so obvious that it took me out of the story -- as if the author was adding each time:  ""NOTICE THIS"" .  It just felt clumsy.The romance part was a bit uneven.  However, the ""Waterloo Letters"" were the height of romance and I may even reread those parts because they were excellent.  In fact, though I generally dislike  ""epistolary"" novels. in this case I could happily have read the whole story through these kinds of letters, they were that good.The snarky humor was fun and kept things light.In all this was a very uneven book but it was easy to read and really touching at moments.  For sure I will read more by this author."
"I really did not like this book at all. I knew it wasn't for me within a few chapters, but it was part of my book club so I continued on. That was disappointing because I'd really been looking forward to reading a romance (not a genre I tend to read) with non-hetero characters. Perhaps The Song of Achilles spoiled me, since I had read that one maybe a month prior?For my taste, there was far too much sex and not enough character development, or relationship development between those characters. Alex, the main character, is simply annoying as hell. He acts like a child in some instances (begging for the turkeys to be put in his room), then is always snarky or sarcastic in others (for instance, when he shortly thereafter asks the vet if the turkeys are bloodthirsty), like he's always ""on""... it makes it hard to get to know a character--or a person--if they're always showing you what they want the world to see, instead of who they are.But Alex simply isn't a nice person. He dislikes Harry for... a perceived slight at an event which took place shortly after Harry's father died, which of course Alex knew about? He calls England a ""garbage country"" because of the food they have for breakfast? He uses gendered slang as a put-down (""douchey""), and refuses to apologize once he realizes he's judged Harry unfairly. And he thinks about using his mom's position (aka, his privilege) to get him into the law school of his choice, rather than apply and be accepted on his merit? All of this just doesn't square with the supposed high ideals and forward-thinking nature we're supposed to believe Alex has, who wants to do the right thing simply because it's the right thing, when he is constantly judging people and ridicule that which he doesn't understand.The other thing that bothered me was Alex's political ancestry. I couldn't really suspend my disbelief enough to believe that Alex would have two parents in Congress, in two very different states (Texas and California); that his mother would be able to rise from a being at most a representative when Alex was born to President within 18 years; and that his father could move from Texas to California and have the political backing to be able to successfully mount a Congressional campaign when there would already have been an undoubtedly active and well-oiled political scene there. I know that some people have multiple family members in Congress (hello, Kennedys) but two parents? And this isn't one of those situations when a Congressperson retires or dies and their spouse then runs for the seat. No, this isn't something I can believe.Lastly, as I said earlier, way too much sex. Perhaps the biggest problem with the way too much sex is that it simply didn't seem to advance the plot; it was just there to be there and remind us that these are two gay men who feel they have to keep it secret for their family's sakes. I simply cannot believe that they fell in love through a few text messages and random hook-up sessions. The relationship didn't grow very organically; lust, I can absolutely believe, but if I'm supposed to believe these two fell love, there wasn't much here to show me that. We barely even see them in the same room but for when they're having sex, and the text messaging stuff left little to be desired.Overall, a disappointing main character (I may have been more interested in Harry's POV), mostly vapid side characters (Nora in particular), and little development of anyone makes this a book I was glad to put behind me."
"This is an MM contemporary title of good length and professional editing. The cover is not a great one and not very fitting to genre  but perhaps still apt thinking on the contents. I think it best fits for those looking for a romantic story. Those that like to read stories with princes, royals in general, british royals especially, or the US presidential family, election stuff, very mild intrigue, literary excerpts, long distance relationships, secret affairs, and like when it's done romantic, or without very explicit sex.It's not a bad title but I'd not go so far as to call it good or great either and considering it's been sold with a big price tag for a good long time not worth that amount and not that good at all as winning a Goodreads Award implies. There's a gazillion better books even in this genre. It's just from a big publisher with a big pricetag and about british royals and american ""royals"". Dressed in fine clothing but not anything special from the inside. I've read many of these british royal prince being gay versions last years and where this differs is being by a big publisher.The prince is left a bit tepid and distant while the presidential son is the main character through whose eyes the story plays out. He and those near him are described better.This was some sort of a disappointment in comparison to all the hype which seems a bit incomprehensible but good marketing will do that. Too lukewarm somehow. It's a good - safe - one for those who want to try out the genre and not get too much gay sex summarily thrown at their face and who like these types of themes otherwise.It's good that a big publisher is willing to publish MM. It's simply not quite the typical type to the genre."
"There were several layers to this story:1.) The love story -- rivals-to-lovers, the push-pull of attraction, the growing affection, the letters (loved those), and the angst around family acceptance of the relationship2.) The political suspense -- international politics, a national election, double-crossing, under-handed tactics..3.) Celebrity and privacy, growing up in the spotlight -- celebrities/public figures deserve some privacy, too4.) Social/Family obligation vs. Personal choices -- break from the family 'business,' or do one's duty?I loved the historical quotes, Henry's beautiful words, and all the Layer 1 stuff (love story). I wasn't as in to Layer 2 (politics) because I felt it was a bit cliche, but okay... It wasn't the biggest part of the book. Layers 3 and 4 were written very well, and I felt so outraged and happy by the end (public opinion saves the day this time!). It was a book that made me think about it for several days after. Recommended."
"4.5*This is a heartwarming and funny tale of love between the son of the U.S. president and the Prince of England. Escapist fiction at its finest and all told from Alex's perspective.💜Alex: bi-racial (half white and half Mexican) and son of the U.S. president; bi-sexual; wants to be in politics for the rest if his life; so busy with his mother's campaign he has little time for anything else and doesn't have a lot of friends;💜Henry: Prince of England; closeted gay except to all his closest friends and family;💜June: Sister to Alex;💜Nora: an MIT wiz and statistical genius; daughter to the Vice-president;💜Bea: Henry's very supportive sister;This romance starts out with our popular hate to love trope that seems to be present in many books as of late. Henry's brother, Philip is getting married and Alex has to accompany his mother and her cabinet to the wedding. During the reception, a spat between Henry and Alex ends terribly and in the destruction of a $10,000 wedding cake. This incident calls for Henry and Alex to be publicly seen together on many occasions to instill faith in the stability of the diplomatic relationship between the U.S. and England.I do love the hate to love trope (if done properly) and I feel this fit quite well into our storyline overall as it helped to create a natural conflict that led them to spending tons of bonding time together. I love witnessing the progression of their friendship and ever closer into love.Do not mistaken this book to be all hearts and love letters. Before they were in love, they were two friends that ""pleased"" one another. The beginning instances of their relationship were met with gritty descriptions that had little to do with love itself. As someone who reads these books for all the mushy details, it was a shocker to see such gritty descriptions laid raw in such carnal detail. I couldn't knock this too much though because it also lead an element of realism you don't often get with a modern romance. This angle also made sure to keep away the dreaded instalove trope, which played no part in this slow ascent into love.Love was never just a ready made thing with this book. As their relationship built upon itself with time, so the depth of their love increased.Alex also bridged the gap of his sexual self discovery and he went from not being 100% sure of his sexuality to knowing what it was. A love that you can find your true self in is so rare and valuable and I loved that we saw Alex blooming into the person he was meant to become.The supporting characters in this were incredible and as the U.S. president (who was female 😍😍 and Alex's mom) had everything to possibly lose in her re-election campaign by a possible sex scandal, she always stopped to check in with Alex to see how he was doing. First and foremost she was his mother and second a president. I loved her so much and knew what support him may cost her, but she did it anyway. This is such an ideal that so many kids in the LGBTQ+ community don't always have the benefit of having a support system, and I loved how his mother emulated what a parent should be doing for their child.Along with a cast of highly likable and heart warming characters you get a mix of comedy with this. There is an instance at the beginning involving domesticated Turkey's that made me laugh out loud. I won't say more because seriously, you need to read this.This book had so many layers. It wasn't just two boys who were learning how to love one another; it was two boys learning how to love themselves in a judgmental world. And being that both Alex and Henry are very public figures, it was also about the rest of the world learning to love them too.Overall, I really only had one problem with this book. There was a part toward the beginning of the book when they were just starting to ""get to know"" one another in which Alex threatened to put Henry on a No-Fly List if Henry didn't come to Alex's room so he could do ""very bad things"" to him. To me, this was an abuse of power for personal gain and that is ""never"" okay in the context with which this was used. I found it hit a nerve that didn't set well with me.In spite of my one problem with this book, I did enjoy reading the rest of it. It made me feel so many things and it was so touching and beautiful."
"When I saw the blurb for this book the first time, I passed it over. Politics is not my thing, I have no interested in fiction about the first family even in an alternate universe. But an artist I follow posted a positive review and art for it, so I checked it closer and decided to give it a try with my amazon coupon.Cons: 1. The plot of this book is the development of the relationship between Alex and Henry. Actually, there’s no main storyline. It’s more like a character analysis or novelized biography of the main character, Alex, and short snippets of his life. There were a lot of scenes that didn’t add anything to the story, other than maybe show-casing his relationships with various people.  As a person who has a short attention span and high criteria for picking books, I put this book down for days at a time. There was nothing exciting enough to keep me turning pages and staying up late. 2. This book is very American. I appreciated the wide range of characters on the American side, so to see Henry’s family painted pretty black and white was disappointing. Henry’s actions were quite passive despite the author trying to show he wasn’t that kind of character— so a lot of Alex urging him to do The Right Thing (The American Thing) and then Henry following through I guess. Maybe this is simply because Henry doesn’t have the main narrative, so we only see what Alex is doing. I would have preferred to see a 50/50 split between his point of view and Alex’s.Pros: 1. As I mentioned, a wide variety of great characters including POC and LGBTQ+ representation. I loved Alex’s biting attitude and the deep relationship he develops with Henry, which we get to see start to finish. Love love love this pair! 2. Using email, social media, and other formats mixed it up (but some people might not like that) 3. Lexically this was fantastic, there were even some words I had to look up as an adult! 4. A long story, which I appreciated after reading a few 300 pages or less books (but as I mentioned above, a lot of fluff content); honestly I would have rather read a continuation of where they were in the future rather than so much to fill in the space between big events that happened.Overall I’d recommend this book! I mean, as long as talking politics doesn’t give you a panic attack, and you have the attention span to read fluff. I’ll be digging into the  Alex/Henry fan verse as soon as I can."
"“An hour later, there are several cartons of Chinese food and a Powerpoint cued up. The first slide says: SEXUAL EXPERIMENTATION WITH FOREIGN MONARCHS: A GRAY AREA. Alex wonders if it’s too late to swan dive off the roof.”This book is absolutely hilarious. At several points I caught myself laughing aloud at the amusing and poignant commentary on American politics and social relations. Written as though the 2016 election went in a different direction, it is both a romance and a wistful view at how politics would be different under different leadership.It is written in third person, but mainly follows the perspective of Alex Claremont-Diaz, the 22-year old son of the President of the United States. Ever since the Rio Olympics, Alex has despised England’s Prince Henry. After an accident at a royal wedding, and the media circus that follows, Alex and Henry are tasked with crafting a very public, fake friendship. The two end up bonding and what started as fake, becomes something much more real, as the two explore their feelings for each other.I loved this story. It was both unique and whimsical. The sexual tension and chemistry between Alex and Henry is electric and enthralling, but their relationship is also incredibly sweet. I found myself more than once wishing that this story was reality and not fiction, and that the Claremont administration was really in charge of the country."
"This is a story that has plagued the book community. Everybody loves the love story between Alex and Henry. I’ve seen nothing but amazing things about this book. Unfortunately, I didn’t love as much as everyone else. This is not a bad book by any means. It just didn’t do it for me.Alex’s mother is America’s first female president. I thought that was an amazing aspect of this book and it’s part of the reason why I really enjoyed this book. I loved being able to read about an America that I want. Also, Alex’s mother is the funniest person in this book. Her slideshow was freaking hilarious. The pamphlets about safe sex was just the icing.I love Alex and Henry’s relationship. It’s a bit hate-to-love. I love when they finally get to the point of acknowledging that they both find each other attractive. It’s steamy! This book itself has a bunch of steamy scenes in it, if you’re uncomfortable reading sex scenes this book is not for you.The main reason why I’m not going to give this book a full five stars is because it actually took me a while to get into this story. I was bored throughout the first few chapters (until Alex & Henry get together). I also feel like the end of the book kind of got resolved too quickly. I’m not a fan when problems get solved as quick as they started."
"**No spoilers were harmed in the making of this review**""He dreamed of love like it was a fairytale, as if it would come sweeping into his life on the back of a dragon one day; he also learned about love as a strange thing that could fall apart no matter how badly you wanted it, a choice you make anyway""Hey guys, so I finished Red, White & Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston and wow, it was more than I was expecting, in a good way. I went into this book thinking it was a light hearted romantic comedy, something to break the pain some of my other books have given me. And what do I get? I get a book that way more than just funny with some screwing. I get a book with heart, with soul, with love, with pain, with joy, relief, sorrow, happiness, a spectrum of emotions. THis book made me feel. It was quite the journey. And I was enjoying every second of it. And the humor, gods it had me dying laughing, truly. The writing, it penetrates into your soul. And its atease, especially during those extra special scenes, giving you just enough of detail to picture whats occurrng, but lacking enough that its up to your imagination to picture how certain things are carried out. That really got me, like ugh, the suspense and tension. The book was actually easy to read, the background details easy to read through, and added communication stuff, that was pretty cool. THis book had more than humor, though that was a huge chunk of it, it was a story, a story of two males whose country raised them and of males who had to figure out who they wanted to be on their own, and with each other. It was so heartfelt. The storyline itself was really good, and the political stuff and historical stuff was really great. It kinda made me look at history in a different perspective, making and remaking history it seems. THe storyline of course, had its highs and lows, its love and its heartbreak, its triumph and its tragedies. It was packed full of others thing to, like family, friendship, loyalty, betrayal. It had everything. And of course, the drama, how I love that drama. Heh, cakegate. And all this was made possible by Alex and Henry. I honestly loved Alex so much and can relate to him in so many ways. He is funny, daring, rebellious, brave, and bold. but he also leaps before he looks, rushes into situations head on without thinking about them, he can be reckless and he overwhelms himself with work load and other heavy responsible, all so he can stay focused on the future, and not the present. Until someone in the present made it worth living in. And Henry, oh my poor, tortured, unfortunate british soul. OH my sweet baby who is hurting on inside but forced to smile on the outside. A bird trapped in a gilded cage. Henry is soft, precious cinnamon roll who needs to be protected at all times, kay? Prince Charming indeed...And the two of them together....sparks, sparks I tell you. I loved their humor, their banter, their wit, their brains and heart and soul. Their passion. Their compassion. Their love. It was everything, them together. Their stolen moments, their rushed affections, their hidden longing. Goodness, my heart. It was so anguishingly hot. So yeah, i loved the males and I loved them together. Both of these characters had depths and deeper truths and it was displayed in such a beautiful way. It was so rich of understanding and self love and finding youself, finding who you are and who you want to be. And of course, love isnt love until it is tested against the harshest conditions. And wow...it was whirlwind. Okay, I dont think I spoiled anything. Im pretty you guys know from the descriptions that Alex and Henry ya know...maybe? Its kinda implied...anyway, maybe I should stop rambling. Alright, if you guys have any questions or comment,s drop em below. Till next time. bye."
"Alex Claremont-Diaz is the First Son of Madam President Claremont. His life is busy busy and by now he knows how to play the long game in politics. But there's always one thorn in his side and this is Prince Henry. Henry just rubs Alex the wrong way and he's not even quite sure why. So when Henry and Alex make headlines at a royal wedding there's some serious PR needing to be done! Henry and Alex have to pretend to fake a friendship so that the media doesn't hound them both.What starts as a fake friendship, slowly morphs into a sweet sweet romance. I absolutely LOVED the relationship between Henry and Alex. The funny quips, the banter and the romantic love letters that they write one another had me swooning!I really enjoyed all of the secondary characters in Red, White & Royal Blue as well! Each and every one of them added a different layer to this wonderful romance. From the Whitehouse Trio to the security guards - I feel like no character arc was wasted and they were all woven together so wonderfully.I feel like the topics of sexuality and grief were handled very well in Red, White & Royal Blue. There were some very serious undertones in the book that were broken apart with well placed humor that really rounded out the book!AudiobookStory: 4Narration: 5Overall: 4.5I really enjoyed listening to the audiobook of Red, White & Royal Blue. I feel that Ramon de Ocampo did such a wonderful job voicing the different characters. His narration of Henry was spot on and I loved it when he narrated his father or even Madam President! I look forward to listening to more books narrated by him!If you are looking for a romance with really witty and fun dialogue with a swoon worthy romance - pick up Red, White & Royal Blue! Can't wait to read more of what Casey McQuiston writes next."
"I usually wait a week or so on reviews - especially the good ones. Because, 𝒊𝒔 𝒂 𝒃𝒐𝒐𝒌 𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒍𝒍𝒚 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒈𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒕 𝒊𝒇 𝒚𝒐𝒖'𝒓𝒆 𝒏𝒐𝒕 𝒔𝒕𝒊𝒍𝒍 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒌𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒂𝒃𝒐𝒖𝒕 𝒊𝒕 𝒂 𝒘𝒆𝒆𝒌 𝒍𝒂𝒕𝒆𝒓???But here I am, tears barely dry on my cheeks, and I just have to yell this from the rooftops.I think sometimes we gravitate toward books that we can relate to. 𝗥𝗲𝗱, 𝗪𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗥𝗼𝘆𝗮𝗹 𝗕𝗹𝘂𝗲 was nothing of the sort for me - and I'm better for it.The book follows Alex, the son of the sitting U.S. president, and Henry, the crowned Prince of England. The two initially hate each other, but the fire turns to passion, and the implications of their love affair catch up to them.The book itself, regardless of the subject matter, was absolutely gorgeous. It was an epic love story... one that sticks its fingers into the cracks of your heart and pulls it open to make you 𝒇𝒆𝒆𝒍. Alex is funny, brilliantly written and Henry is deep, handsome and romantic as hell. Casey McQuiston navigates this story in 400 pages, and makes every single word matter. There's enemies-to-lovers, forbidden love, but more details outside of just your run-of-the-mill tropes. There's no insta-love here. It's methodical. The move from like to lust to love took me by the hand and had me running full speed alongside it.But, since it's Pride month, I'd be remiss if I didn't go into that aspect of the novel. I cant imagine what it's like to not be able to be yourself. I can't imagine what it's like to love someone and never be able to publicly show it. Sure - it's about a President's son and a Prince of England, but honestly, it's a reality so many face on a regular basis. In the end, we are all people. And I love books like this that remind me of that. It's not about reading a gay romance, straight, bi, trans, etc. It's about love... and everyone deserves love. So I hope you read Alex and Henry's love story.𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗥𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: 5/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐𝗦𝗽𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝗥𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: 3/5 🌶🌶🌶"
"""There were those who would have seen us stumble backward into hatred and vitriol and prejudice, who wanted to reignite old embers of division within our country's very soul. You looked them square in the eye and said, ""No. We won't."" ""~ Red, While, and Royal Blue.I moved to the USA from India on September 2015. For me, the USA was the place that held Pride Parades, whereas in India until that point, same-sex love was a crime by law.This is how I had imagined the USA. It turned out to be different. The last 4 years turned out to be different, but this book gives what is most needed at this moment.Hope.The hope for a better future that is more inclusive for people of all races, genders, and sexual orientations.Loved this book. So much.P.S. I read the following line and my eyes welled up with tears of joy and pride: That's because my great-great-great granddad stole this from India. I think we should give it back, but your gan says no."
"SOO MANY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS!You read it and think this is so dumb where are the security they both have - 100% fail here, who says what they do via emails and texts during a time of hacking, hello national security risk, - they wouldn't and why is the plot so predictable with politics thrown in.BUT you enjoy their banter, the fully rounded major and supporting characters with all their flaws, the sappy storybook romance and the warmth the book exudes from its pages. You love the siblings and their plain truth speak. You love the slow building of realization that Alex is bi.PLUS there is a female president (one day America!) who is trying to balance both being a mom and a highly scrutinized president. She is fiercely loyal to her family and her country but makes time for fun and makes jokes when necessary. One of the favorite quotes is when she says ""As your mother, I can appreciate that maybe this isn't your fault, but as the president, all I want is to have the CIA fake your death and ride the dead-kid sympathy into a second term."" LOL soo many quotable moments: funny ones and intensely relevant and relatable ones.This book is such a fun read about two individuals representing their countries finding our who they are, finding their soul mate and fighting for that love. I loved their texts and emails back and forth as this was where their real intimate romance shined. I could have read a whole book just made of those texts and emails!Highly recommend this book and cannot wait to see what else this author writes. She is definitely an author to watch our for....AND has a new book coming out next year!"
"I was in a bad slump recently, picking up book after book. Finally, I picked up a book that has been sitting on my shelf for a long time now. I ended up reading over half of RED, WHITE & ROYAL BLUE in one sitting and finished the rest later that day. Honestly, I want to formally apologize to all my friends in real life, on bookstagram, and Casey McQuiston for not reading this book sooner. It’s bloody brilliant. I haven’t felt such joy in a long time! I literally was laughing out loud - like large belly laughs - at 3am because of the antics of Alex and Henry and it felt so good. And I needed to feel good: my health needed it mentally and physically. Laughter is amazing medicine.Joy. Pure joy. That’s this book. I feel like writing a review is not even necessary at this point for this beloved novel, but I am. Also, this needs to be a movie, please!Highlights of what I loved:❤️McQuiston wrote an amazing opposite’s attract slow-burn relationship that I was totally here for 110% with America’s First son and the Prince of Wales💙Loved, loved, loved a female president who was also a kick-ass mom!!🤍The first text message conversation between Alex and Henry still is my favorite and makes me laugh just thinking about it 😂👑It was a story of love, acceptance, and finding yourself - just made my heart so happy.RED, WHITE & ROYAL BLUE is beautiful. It’s joyful. It’s happy. I just want to cuddle it! I can’t wait to return to it again and again.CW: death of parent, cancer, grief, depression, HP content, homophobia, drug addiction, public outing, sexual assaultFollow me on instagram: @niftyreads"
"Red, White and Royal Blue was a DELIGHT. Seeing all those 5 stars reviews made me a bit leery but I can happily report those are justified. I loved Alex and Henry, their relationship transforming from enemies to friends and then to lovers in such an achingly slow burn, romantic way, it left me swooning and rooting for them.In a parallel universe, in a time where Trump was never in office but a woman is the first female Commander in Chief, whose son is biracial and bisexual with aspirations to become a politician, a time when one of the oldest monarchies has a closeted gay prince, these two are impossible lovers. So I suppose it stands to reason why they have to sneak around. In a political atmosphere that isn't so unlike ours there is a lot of homophobia and bigotry and since Alex's mom is in full re-election campaign mode this secret love affair may kill her chances of winning the election for another term.I loved every single scene that was built around this storyline. There was so much humor, so much banter with smart, funny comebacks, the text messages between Alex and Henry were a highlight, the love that went in every character of this book was clear as day. Alex and Henry were the main protagonists but vying for the spotlight were all the other side characters, like the second daughter Nora or Alex's sister, June, as well as Zahra, the president's right hand. Every single person in this book had a place and a role to play.RED, WHITE AND ROYAL BLUE may be a debut but it feels like the author has a lot of experience under her belt. I thoroughly enjoyed myself while experiencing Alex and Henry's love story and I was charmed by their romance. There was a lot of sensual tension between them but I found it refreshing that the author didn't focus on the sex scenes.If you love a cute but poignant diverse MM story or want an entrance point into MM romance this is definitely one to highly recommend. I realize that there are also a couple reviews about this story that focus on this book's weaknesses and rightfully so, so please read them, too, and make sure this book may work for you. I for one can't find fault with it and I'll be reading more of this author in the future!I had the chance to listen to the audiobook and the narrator Ramon de Ocampo did an amazing job portraying all the characters and bringing their individuality into the spotlight. Loved his performance!"
"With so many reviews this is not needed so I'll keep this brief.  I see why this won awards and high accolades.  Unique setting,  likeable main and secondary characters, and overall intelligent writing with a nod to classics and history.  I fact checked some stated references to American history and they rang true.  And that  is why this was a 4 star instead of 5.  There was a lot of waxing poetic that  felt  a bit much and off kilter.  Do twenty year old men really talk that way? In emails? I also would have liked to see the next step....an epilogue of Henry and Alex truly together in NY (which wasn't even confirmed but inferred) making their mark on the world as a strong and committed power couple. Give me a bit more of the romance and a lot less political climate.  I do recommend this... it was all kinds of entertaining, sweet, smart, swoony, and a real class act."
"RED WHITE & ROYAL BLUEOverall: ★★★★★/5Spice:★★★⭑/5Contemporary RomanceStandaloneTrope: Enemies to Lovers, Forbidden Love, Secret RelationshipAlex is the first son of the United States and Henry is a prince of Wales who occasionally have to see each other at political and social functions. Through their bickering they cause a scene at one of these functions, which the media spins negatively and in order to prove alliances with Britain and the USA are strong Alex and Henry must play nice and pretend to be friends for public events, and use social media to prove their friendship. The more gatherings they attend together soon show Alex that Henry isn't as stuck up and stuffy as he assumed and a little run in, in the gardens, at a party soon changes the dynamic between the two and their relationship.I loved everything about this book! This was one that was hyped up and for good reason. Henry and Alex were so swoony and cute, but also knew how to get hot and heavy. Both of their lives in the spotlight tended to alienate them and make them lonely, and watching them both open up to each other about problems only the other would understand due to their public lives in the spotlight was so perfect in cementing a solid foundation for them. Due to the publicity of their lives their romantic relationship had to be kept hidden and all issues of hiding a LGBTQ relationship while in a position of political power ensued. The conflicts that cause strains on their relationship are easy enough to guess, but in no way took away from the book for me. This is a m/m LGBTQ read, with a Hispanic first family and a woman as president. It's told from Alex’s point of view. Can't recommend it enough."
"Wow this book....First off I want to say how sad I am that I couldn't give this book 5 stars.  I mean I could, but it didn't feel like a 5 star read for me. I'm sad because all the booktubers I watch, who have read this, has given it a 5 star.PROS:1) This book has a lot of pros for why I would recommend it.  The relationship development - and who doesn't love an enemies to lovers trope? - between Alex and Henry *chef's kiss*.  They are so cute and frustrating and wonderful together.2) I really enjoyed the interaction with the side characters.  Having a strong parental appearance throughout the book was refreshing- even if she was the president and very busy. June and Nora were a heavy part of the story and much needed.  Even Pez, Henry's best friend.3) And let's talk about the sex -- oh yes there is sex.  Very descriptive sex. I normally don't like this in my books, but let's say I wasn't mad about it in this book.  Wowza.CONS:1) The political stuff. Some may have thoughts about me if they read this review, but I guess I have to live with that. I am not a political person a lot of the things talked about in this book just went over my head. It pulled me out of the story and made me uninterested.2) The book was WAY too long for the material- in my opinion.There you have it.  My pros and cons of Red, White and Royal Blue - for whoever is interested."
"I really enjoyed reading ""Red, White & Royal Blue"".  I was interested in learning about the characters and tagging along on their journey of sexual discovery and love.  The dialogue was fun, especially the exchange of emails.  As one other reviewer wrote, it would be fun to read a whole book of just the emails between Alex and Henry.  If you're a social conservative, you probably won't like this book, but then again, why would you buy a book knowing it's about a same-sex relationship in the first place!  This book is an enjoyable fairy tale (no pun intended), and as with most fairy tales, some plot elements are not very believable.  But, that's part of the escapist fun of reading it too!  There were two things about this book that irked me: First, the lead character refers to himself (and is referred to by others) as ""bi-sexual"" when he is clearly gay, showing no sexual interest in members of the opposite sex.  Secondly, the relationship between Pez and Nora/June is never fully fleshed out.  Maybe there will be a sequel to answer some of these lingering questions.  Lastly, I've noticed that gay male stories written by women tend to have an increased focus on the romantic aspects of a relationship, such as kissing and longing, rather than the mechanics of raw sex.  Consequently, the sex scenes are written a bit vaguely and succinctly, almost as if the author were embarrassed to have to include them.  I realize it's not porn, but more graphic sex scenes would help the reader to better understand the passion between Alex and Henry, and why they long to be together."
"I enjoyed the plot and the basic premise behind it. But what age group was the author writing for? The story and the language (how many hundreds of times was the F bomb dropped) was definitely for mature readers. But the dialogue was so infantile! Do princes and college graduates really speak like this? Even the president spoke like a third grader. Well, much like we have today I guess! Good story. Too long. Bad writing."
"“‘I’ve always thought of myself as a problem that deserved to stay hidden. Never quite trusted myself, or what I wanted. Before you, I was all right letting everything happen to me. I honestly have never thought I deserved to choose.’ His hand moves, fingertips brushing a curl behind Alex’s ear. ‘But you treat me like I do.’”Red, White, and Royal Blue by Casey Mcquiston tells the story of Alex who is the son of the first female president of the United States, as he discovers he is falling for Henry a prince of England.  Their love would be a scandal for them both, and Alex is just coming to terms with his bi-sexuality.This book is a delight to read.  It had me go between laughing and near tears.  The banter was some of the best I have read.  The romance is just so lovely.  It’s also a hate to love story which I am always a sucker for. This is definitely an author I want to read more from.  This one lives up to the hype people.  I give it a zillion stars.“‘I don’t suppose you’ll be anywhere near Kensington anytime soon?’‘That shithole?’ he says with a wink. ‘Not if I can help it.’ ‘Oi,’ Henry says. He’s grinning now. ‘That’s disrespect of the crown, that is. Insubordination. I’ve thrown men in the dungeons for less.’Alex turns, walking backward toward the car, hands in the air. ‘Hey, don’t threaten me with a good time.’”"
"The whole premise is clickbait, of course: the son of America's first woman president falls in love with his nemesis, an honest-to-god English prince. But this book is saved from its own contrivance by the sheer sweetness of its romantic duo, Alex and Henry, who begin their clandestine relationship thinking it's all just sex and fun—and end up head over heels in love, trying to navigate the truth about their sexual identities and the intimacy of their love affair without sinking a presidential campaign or igniting an international scandal. Or both.Henry is adorable but it's the president's son, Alex Claremont-Diaz, who completely won me over in this book. In a genre chock full of angsty bad boys, Alex is just so sweet and joyful and GOOD, committing heart and soul to everything he cares about: his family, his mother's campaign, his causes, and of course his relationship with Henry. As the reader/onlooker,  you know he's recklessly courting scandal and disaster, but it's impossible not to root for him.Supporting characters also shine, especially the fierce and funny Madame President: ""As your mother, I can appreciate that maybe this isn't your fault, but as the president, all I want is to have the CIA fake your death and ride the dead-kid sympathy into a second term."" I also adored his besties, sister June and the VP's granddaughter Nora, who deserve their own books someday. It's a diverse cast, both in gender identity and race, which is refreshing.Bottom line: a contrived premise but a heartwarming, funny, sexy, lovable book from an author to watch."
"I only looked at the bool because booktok was obsessed. So many high points. First off I enjoyed the romance. The sassy greatness between the main characters and the real feel of the relationships. The mix media of showing emails and tweets made it feel more real.I could not put the book down until the political drama became too much. I definitely finished. But to not be a series, it left me wanting more in a bad way.Back to the political. I am from Texas and the political beat down I felt was a bit over pushed. I get it. We are seen as a red state full of jerks but we have a solid mix of people. Yes that was shown. But it was harsher than it needed to be for the story.And then there would be characters brought up and I had to question who they were and why we are talking about them like they had been there all long? Some of the end felt rushed.It was a good read if you over look the political talk and focus on the characters and their story.Why give it a 5 star if I found faults? I enjoyed reading it. I enjoyed the story and the drama. I enjoyed and that is enough for me. Just be prepared for some real world drama in this fiction. If you don't want politics then don't read a book about the royal or first family."
"I thought this book was certainly entertaining, a bit fluffy, definitely quite smutty, and overall pretty good. I enjoyed the representation of LGBTQ+ characters and I liked that it portrayed a lot of the struggles queer people face everyday - coming out, realizing you might be gay or bisexual and the internal debates and anxiety that come with that, self-denial, feeling afraid to tell the people you love most who you truly are, the fear of rejection from them. It was all executed very well in this book!SPOILER-FREE SUMMARYAfter photos of an altercation between Henry the Prince of Wales and Alex Claremont-Diaz, the First Son of the US surface in the press, Alex and Henry are forced to start a purely political, highly publicized friendship in a damage-control effort. What at first begins as a fake, Instragramable friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either of them could have imagined. Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the question: Can love save the world after all? Where do we find the courage, and the power, to be the people we are meant to be? And how can we learn to let our true colors shine through?The one thing I really fell in love with in this book was the characters! They were all so different, so quirky, so realistic and believable. I teared up a few times reading this. It really was like a gay fairytale romance where the moody, smart-mouthed American First Son and the posh and proper Prince of Wales fall in love. It was as funny and heartfelt as you would expect, and I would recommend it to fans of romance novels!ALSO - unrelated to the book and related only to Amazon, my copy had misprinted letters for the capital and author’s name. There was a glossy overlay that didn’t line up perfectly with those letters. It was odd. Is this normal?"
"Ah, the dilemma ... what rating to give this outrageously addictive novel? I feel helpless admiration for the gorgeous headlong exuberance of McQuiston’s writing, the sheer joy and brash self-confidence of her achievement, and its well-deserved commercial success. (The “It’s ridiculous” quotation in my review title is actually the author’s own self-sardonic comment, p. 136, in one of her fabulous love scenes.)The heart of any romance is the believability of the central characters and the author’s ability to get readers invested in their love story, and this one is off the charts on that score. It soars. OK, it’s an absurdly high-concept, escapist, romantic fantasy. But it would take a cold-hearted curmudgeon indeed not to swoon for presidential son Alex Claremont-Diaz, even though, as his British royal counterpart Prince Henry aptly observes, Alex really is a “preening arse” much of the time.I can only second New York Times reviewer Jaime Green’s praise for “the consuming vividness of Alex and Henry” as characters: especially, I think, the brooding and sometimes depressive Henry. Alex, like Mercutio in “Romeo & Juliet,” loves to hear himself talk. But Henry, when he wants to, gives as good as he gets with well-chosen whiplash sarcasm. Their texting banter is often hilarious, sometimes wickedly so (invited by Henry to Wimbledon, Alex snarks: “I’ve already been in the royal box”).As Green says, “the intensity of their infatuation ... is intoxicating.” No sooner did I finish the book than I wanted to read it again, wishing I could induce amnesia so as to enjoy the shock of surprise and discovery all over.While there’s obviously no accounting for taste when it comes to sex scenes (Amazon reviewers seem split between those who find them too much or too tame here), I think McQuiston strikes perfect pitch: deftly and almost entirely avoiding graphic description, while still conveying intensely erotic passion. It’s a fairy tale romance, after all. Her goal, I think, is to convey the excitement of sex as primarily centered in the brain, which after all it is. It’s about the feelings, not the bodily mechanics! As a gay man who’s all in favor of more frank and genuinely erotic sexual content in both novels and movies, I say we could use more of this kind of writing. McQuiston shows real innovation here.But ... yeah, there’s always a “but” ... as soon as I finished the book I also wanted to rewrite a lot of it. 4 stars seems about right.I know, it’s cheeky to tell an author how she might better have plotted and written her own novel, and maybe I’m just jealous I could never in a million years write fiction like this. But take it as a compliment, McQuiston: the very length of this review shows how obsessed I am with your book, how real your characters have become for me. It’s a rare writer of fiction who can achieve that.So, the problems ... once you get over the romantic rush, this novel is riddled with serious oversights of plotting, character set-up, and seemingly inadequate research. Hello? Where were her editors? I guess good editing really is a thing of the past. (Someone needs to look up the difference between “hoard” and “horde.”)In Shakespeare’s famous love story, Mercutio is actually more interesting than either Romeo or Juliet, and McQuiston offers us a sort-of Mercutio: Henry’s supposed platonic soul-mate, the flamboyant Percy “Pez” Okonjo. But despite a teasingly promising start, he’s almost totally undeveloped. We get little or no sense of his connection to Henry and how it originated. McQuiston absent-mindedly toys with a romantic attraction between Pez and Alex’s sister June, but never bothers to pursue it. So why bother inventing him in the first place?As many Amazon reader reviews have noted (more perceptively than the major media reviews), the excessive plethora of half-baked minor characters is a pervasive problem. It’s like the charisma of the two main guys hopelessly outshines all the rest. Maybe after creating them, the author just ran out of gas? June herself, and her and Alex’s best friend Nora, fill their roles OK (though one wishes for more), and the same with Henry’s sister Beatrice. But Alex’s mother (the president) and Henry’s grandmother (the queen) are cardboard cut-outs, as is the president’s hyper-aggressive chief of staff Zahra. The scenes where they react to the relationship are stilted, awkward, and neither credible nor interesting.My favorite side character is Alex’s dad, who exudes gritty charm in the scenes (too few!) when he takes a bow. McQuiston seems to be fond of Amy the transgender Chinese-American secret service agent, but aside from a few good wisecracks, she’s also a cipher, as is Henry’s “equerry” Shaan, a South Asian Brit who develops an implausible off-stage relationship of his own with one of the Americans (which we are merely told about, not shown).Overall, there are just TOO MANY minor characters! Why actually have two named secret service officers perennially assigned to Alex, with neither one developed in any meaningful way? Henry’s “PPOs” (personal protection officers), meanwhile, are completely faceless and unnamed, even though they must necessarily have played an important role in many scenes. Yet we are given totally useless characters that could have been omitted entirely, like Alex’s cubicle-mate on his mother’s campaign, or Henry’s elder brother for that matter.And does McQuiston really expect us to believe that Henry could be the Prince of Wales? Don’t get me started on his jarringly fake alternative title, “the Prince of England” (she toggles inconsistently between the two). “The” prince? There are LOTS of princes and princesses in the British royal family, and they’re not just “of England” but of the entire United Kingdom, which includes Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, not to mention several nations around the world, including Canada, Jamaica, Australia, and New Zealand, that recognize the British royal sovereign as head of state.This is not nerdish nitpicking. I myself don’t follow news on British royals, but 15 minutes of Wikipedia research would have helped McQuiston avoid undermining much of the credibility and dramatic tension of her story. And presumably a lot of her royal-watching readers DO follow this stuff and are well-versed in the fact that “Prince of Wales” is a unique title ONLY conferred on the heir apparent, which Henry (as she makes very clear) is NOT.Is McQuiston even aware that in 2015, British royal succession law was changed to be gender-neutral? It is mentioned once or twice that Henry is merely FOURTH in line for the throne, behind his mother, elder brother, and elder sister Bea. Yet in another scene, Henry comments inconsistently that his brother is the “heir” and he’s the “spare.” No, their mother is the heir (and by the way, would qualify to be “Princess of Wales”), and BOTH his siblings are “spares” ahead of him. Furthermore, his brother gets married at the very outset, meaning he and his wife will presumably soon start producing children, who would bump Bea and Henry still farther down the line of succession. Annoyingly unnecessary mistakes like this tend to take me out of the fantasy.The deeper question is WHY did McQuiston choose to set things up this way, so that Henry is merely (at best) fourth in line and virtually certain NEVER to become king? Why not actually make Henry a realistic Prince of Wales? Why not thus make him FIRST in line for the throne? Why make the queen his 80-something grandmother (too awkwardly similar to the real-life Elizabeth II, now 93)? Why not put the crown on his mother Catherine, who in the novel is yet another sadly undeveloped minor character? (One might easily posit some tragic terrorist attack a few years before the novel opens, to wipe out most of the current royal family well past 20th or lower in the line of succession.)We’re told Henry’s mother is drowning in grief for her late husband, and yes, fine, that’s a good plot device, helps explain Henry’s own captivating inner grief and loneliness. But why not really explore all that, make Catherine a fully rounded presence in the story, and make Henry more believably fearful of future royal duties? And perhaps Catherine might have some heartrending terminal condition of her own, so her days are numbered? Henry might then face still more grief and tension over the prospect of becoming king himself in the very near future, at a vulnerably young age, and with a brash American boyfriend to deal with.If you’re going to set up a high-concept fantasy like this, you need to gamely follow it through. McQuiston actually did some very nice historical research. She has Henry constantly going on about Britain’s two known historical gay kings (Edward II in the 14th century and James I during Shakespearean times). By the way, I just love the scene she stages with Alex and Henry in the Victoria & Albert Museum; it makes the entire book by itself.Did it never occur to her to link all that to Henry becoming a modern gay king? She has the boys quote lots of wonderful same-sex love letters to each other, but she overlooks the historical relevance of Edward VIII’s famous declaration, when abdicating the throne in 1936, that he “found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge [his] duties as king ... without the help and support of the woman [he] love[d].”What a perfect twist of history if Henry were to say the same thing while declining to abdicate! With just a few deft story adjustments, it would be entirely realistic, in gay-friendly 21st-century Britain, to imagine that by the end of the book, Henry could be on the verge of making Alex his Prince Consort!A problem with the whole premise of this novel is that it clearly would NOT be a big deal for American voters if the president’s son came out as gay or bisexual, and even had an affair with a male British royal. (VP Dick Cheney, of all people, had an openly lesbian daughter almost a generation ago, though granted, she did not cavort with a princess.) It might be a titillating media sensation for a few days, but the only way it would hurt the president would be if she appeared not to be a supportive parent. Likewise, would anyone really care, in hip and jaded modern Britain, what same-sex dalliances some prince way down in the line of succession got up to?This is a big reason why most of the last third of the book is a misguided misfire, distracting us from the romance with a wrong turn into American political melodrama and an overhyped outing crisis. I’m a Democrat and not the least bit sympathetic to Republican whiners, but even I find the partisan politics too heavy-handed here. And what’s with that utterly baffling and pointless subplot involving Rafael Luna? (Yet ANOTHER undeveloped side character!) I do understand why McQuiston wanted to reimagine the country as reelecting a progressive female president who even carries Texas. I spent many years when younger visiting my paternal grandmother at her house on Westover, the very same street in Austin where Alex’s childhood home is located: a cool coincidence that gave me a thrill when reading her conclusion.But seriously, when did the hook of this novel’s story become not the future of Henrex (get it? “Henry Rex”?), and their wildly inspiring love, but whether Alex’s mom gets reelected? Call for rewrite!It is, to be sure, more believable that a British heir to the throne (even today), with all the burdens and expectations that involves, especially if said heir was saddled with personal ghosts (as Henry believably is), might be more stressed about his sexual identity and coming out.As it is, the strongest parts of McQuiston’s novel focus on Henry’s (and Alex’s) internal conflicts and crises. Yet she undercuts her own story in this regard by inexplicably NOT making Henry the actual heir, by making him someone we know will almost certainly NEVER inherit the throne. I love this novel and cannot get it out of my mind. Alex and Henry are a couple for the ages. “History, huh?” Yet I can’t help hoping it’ll get revised for the movie version."
"As I was reading What If It's Us? Amazon recommended Red, White & Royal Blue. A quick glance at the back cover made me agree that this book would be right up my alley, so I went ahead and bought it. What If It's Us? absolutely wrecked me, so I took a few days before I jumped into another novel about a m/m relationship, especially since they always seem to end on a sad note. Just a little side note: I do read other things besides gay love stories, I swear.This novel, from debut author Casey McQuiston, takes place in a world where Hillary and Trump did not run for POTUS in 2016, instead. Texan Democrat, Ellen Claremont, won the election. Alex Claremont-Diaz,  the FSOTUS, is the main character, a jock with a passion for politics and a particular contempt for the stuck up Prince of Wales, Henry. At the Royal Wedding. Alex and Henry get into a scuffle and destroy the wedding cake; the press teams for both parties decide that in order to prevent a scandal, they'll fake a bromance between the two men. Both Alex and Henry are unhappy with the new arrangement, but nevertheless perform their duties as instructed. Alex starts to warm to a freindship with  the Prince, but at the White House Christmas party, Henry kisses Alex and awakens deeply buried bisexual feelings inside him.Amidst helping out with his mother's reelection campaign and finishing up college, Alex enters into a clandestine, risky affair with Henry that threatens to destroy everything. Before long, the young lovers must choose between duty and what could possibly be true love.I am not a political person by any means, but I do have a love for the Royal Family. This book is pre-Harry and Meghan, but does share some parallels with their love story. The first few chapters were kind of slow for me, but once Henry and Alex started to interact more and the tension grew, I found myself unable to put the book down. I liked that Alex and his sister June were mixed race, beng part caucasian and part Latino; I think a lot of authors forget to be inclusive. There are more love stories out there besides those between two white people. I'm also a huge fan of the fact that their race was never an issue or point of contention. It seems to me that a lot of stories involving minorites deal with the racism trope and to me, that's a disservice to them.I absolutely loved this book, not as much as Call Me By Your Name or What If It's Us?, but that isn't to say that that it wasn't amazing, because it was an addictive, emotional rollercoaster that I did not want to get off of.In April 2019, Amazon Studios procured the film rights to the novel; no release date or casting news has been announced yet."
"This book has been on my periphery for years and I kept begging off the hype. I'm a huge Anglophile and a sucker for star-crossed lovers. If course I was going to love this book. Oh yeah, and I'm a Texas Democrat.Alex was almost hard to love, but being inside his head I felt his intelligent conviction and verve for life and he charmed me too. Henry was simply a sweet, gentleman!y dirty-minded delight. I wanted so badly for him to get everything he wanted.Yes, there is foul language. Yes, there are sexual situations--though more focused on emotions than physical details. Yes, there are references to drug use. This is a prime example of a New Adult novel with heavy doses of politics and literature.I won't rehash more of the plot, plenty of early reviewers probably already did that. Just a few final notes.1. I loved the attention to personality details between email and texting2. All oblique references to the real Royal Family and the 2016 election were *chef's kiss* sublime3. I swooned over the historical love letter snippets. Yet more proof that love is love is love across time and place."
"Red White and Royal Blue is a delightful, mostly light, sometimes politically satirical adult queer romance. It is meant to imagine a brighter political present (2016-2020ish) where love and slightly workaholic tendencies can overcome the Atlantic ocean, the press, the British monarchy, and Republicans in equal measure. In this, it largely succeeds.It's cheesy, trope-y, and not spectacularly unique (but if that is what you desire, perhaps contemporary romantic comedy is not the genre for you). The characters are funny and equal parts relatable and larger-than-life. The politics are liberal and light, much more considered as dry jokes at the 2010s administrations than any real stance. It's a happy, beach-y read good for anyone who wants a frankly somewhat ridiculous romp.However, that said it is rather white liberal which some readers may find distasteful or infringing on their ability to lose themselves in this fun house mirror version of American/British politics. It is, perhaps, less effective as time goes on (as is often the case for comedy and political comedy especially) and especially so following the events of 2020."
"This is a fun read. If you're looking for something deeper than young millenials bumbling through love with the additional pressure of constantly being under the scrutiny of two powerhouse nations, then this isn't the book for you. It also contains rather heavy handed political thoughts, but given the fact that Alex, the son of the first female President of the United States and a college student studying political science, is planning a career in politics, that hardly seems to be a surprise. Also, the book is written during his mother's bid for re-election, so the political tone is perhaps even harsher than it may have been otherwise.However, the mainstory here is about two young men acting their age, making mistakes, but ultimately falling in love with the vast complication of the media, poll numbers, and possible international scandals. It's not perfect, but it perfectly fulfills its role. If you're looking for something deeper, more menaingful, this isn't the place for it. If you're looking for maturity and constant class, this isn't the place for that either. These guys are in their early twenties and act every inch their age. Having said all of that, I would read it again in a heartbeat."
"“That’s the choice. I love him, with all that, because of all that. On purpose. I love him on purpose.”*CRIES IN GAY* I honestly don’t think a book has made me laugh and cry harder in a continuous cycle than “Red, White & Royal Blue.” This is my second time reading this book, and it is still easily one of my favorite debut novels ever.This is an enemies to lovers romance (arguably the greatest trope of all time, fight me) between Alex, the son of the first female president of the United States and Henry, the prince of England. The hilariously witty banter. The angst. The politics. The sexual awakening. The Harry Potter references. I found it impossible to not fall in love with their story.Not only does this book deliver a beautiful romance on a silver platter, it brilliantly and successfully addresses issues around gender, sexuality, racism, and ethics. At the heart of this book is a joyful celebration of those who love regardless of social condemnation.I love it when a book lives up to its hype and “Red, White & Royal Blue” definitely did for me. My heart is full, I love this book, and I love love."
"Alex has had a life-long aversion to Henry, a British prince. He loathes the guy. And neither young men hide their dislike of each other. Until they have to, after a disastrous incident at the wedding of Prince Philip, Henry's brother. Alex and Henry embark on a public friendship tour to squash rumors and ease tensions between England and America, where Alex's mother sits behind the desk in the oval office as the President of the United States.Following an unexpected late-night kiss with the prince, Alex questions everything he believed about Henry and himself. Their relationship unfolds behind closed doors and last-minute event appearances just so they can see each other. But when someone leaks private e-mails between the two, it's a public relations nightmare for both countries and the President's run for a second term.Initially, I wasn't a fan of Alex, the main character. His sarcastic attitude often came across as rude and mean-spirited. After dozens of pages he softened up a bit and became more witty than crass. Then I warmed up to him and the story more.Once I bypassed my initial dislike of Alex's attitude, Red, White, and Royal Blue became a much more endearing and entertaining novel. Close to page 100 is when the novel really turned into a page-turner for me. So that left me with a little over 300 more pages to fall in love with the story. And I did. I really rooted for the two main characters and often found myself interested in some of the minor characters as well--of which there are many.I would have given this a 5-star rating had it not been for two annoyances. The final chapters wrap everything up a little too tidy and shiny and lovingly. (However, I did really enjoy the final scene and last sentence.) Secondly, **SPOILER**Alex frequently refers to himself as bisexual. He even addresses the nation and refers to himself as such. It struck me as odd and disrespectful to Henry and a cop-out by the author. Alex has no heterosexual relations other than past flings, etc. mentioned in moments of memory. But he clutched that bisexual title even after he admitted that he was in love with Henry. Alex spends a great deal of time making things right so that he can be with Henry, so Henry can truly be who he is, and so that the two can have a future together forever. Yes, he tells his mother and others that his relationship with Henry is FOREVER. But damn it, he's bisexual. --Okay, rant over. **END OF SPOILER**Side-note: Is this considered a young adult or new adult novel? The sex scenes were a bit graphic. Although, there were some moments of confusion. Sometimes I wasn't sure who was wrapped up around who and doing what. BUT still, I could follow the bulk of what was taking place, and it seemed a little too graphic for a teen audience.Leaning toward a 4.5 rating."
"Definitely recommend this book, it’s been a good read. I started Saturday and I finished it by Sunday night. The plot was good, even though there was a bit of politics in the book I felt it added to the story in terms of understanding the situation and pressure both Henry and Alex were feeling. All the characters are lovable, Henry and his friend, as well as his sister Bea. Alex and the White House trio, they all had their own personality. Zahra is by far one of my favorite characters. There is a lot of cursing so if that’s not your thing I would not recommend reading it. It wasn’t overbearing per se, but I know that it’s a dislike for many people. All in all a solid book, *Spoiler*Alex is Bisexual which is great considering a lot of LGBT geared books tend to focus on the LG and not so much of the BT or the “+” for that matter so it was nice to see another part of the community put into the front seat."
"I wish I had the words to describe just how much I loved this book. With every page I was laughing and I couldn’t stop smiling. I love a good hate to love story and this one was perfect. I love how both Henry and Alex were able to let go around each and just be them instead of their positions and their families. I love how Bea and Nora and Pez were the ultimate besties and wing-persons. I love how not everything was perfect and that each person had their troubles and doubts but that they came out stronger because of it. I love the side characters of Shaan and Zahar, they’re amazing and so supportive even if it’s not vocal. I loved how much Alex and Henry truly cared about each other and their people and the world as a whole. They’re such good hearted people, it’s wonderful. And their emails/ love letters to each other were so beautiful and romantic, I was jealous. I could feel their emotions coming off the page and I think that shows how incredible the writing is."
"As a thank you to Netgalley and the publisher (St Martins Press) for providing me with an advanced reader copy I shall give an honest review of Red White and Royal Blue. Overall I enjoyed this novel and plan on re-reading this soon. I recommend it to those looking for escapism and enjoy a love story. Written by debut author Casey Mc Quiston whose impeccable storytelling gave me some of the best hours I have enjoyed as a reader in some time. Mc Quiston’s dialogue was witty, engaging, and showed the plausibility to an impossible situation. Though filled with its the subject matter of politics and relationships were Mc Quiston able to show the diplomacy of these matters and find a middle ground. I emotionally connected with these characters as their personal history mirrored mine and felt seen. As a reader, we hope to be reflected in the material that we ingest whether that is books, art, films, or more. I give this book a strong five out of five stars on GoodReads."
"Alex and Henry are relationship goals. When the First Son of the United States falls in love with the prince of England you expect it to be all political drama, and while this does have politics, at it heart that’s not what it’s about, this is about the relationship at its heart. These two guys are dealing with their emotions, their love for each other, how what they feel for each other affects their families, and how it affects their countries, how it affects how they see themselves.The familial relationships were amazing! I really want to see more books about the rest of the Super Six, read the book and you’ll understand. All of the characters have their quirks and foibles, nobody is perfect - not even in the White House or Buckingham Palace - but isn’t that true to life? The fact that the characters had issues made them so much easier to fall in love with!Oh, and by the way, I love Return of the Jedi, too!"
"Alex Claremont-Diaz, First Son of the United States, and rising star in the Democratic Party is living the dream with his mom in the White House and his dad in the Senate. With his sister, June, and their best friend, Nora, almost nothing can get in the way of this power trio. But when Alex runs in to his rival, Henry, Prince of Wales, heir to the British throne, the two practically start an international incident that could affect both countries. They are suddenly shoved together in a damage-control campaign and they realize they have more in common then they thought. Soon a romance and friendship begins which could cause an even bigger scandal than either country wants.•I loved this book. It’s so sweet and so romantic. I thought it was a ton of fun and the perfect escape I needed over these past few months. This gay YA is giving me “Roman Holiday” vibes and “West Wing” feels mixed with a Freddie Prinze Jr. movie. I really thought the novel excelled in exploring themes of identity and disclosure. Taking two people who are highly visible in the world and having them deal with not only publicly scrutinized relationships but coming out was really interesting. The only way this could possibly be better was if it was a musical. (Dear Universe, please make this into a musical.) I loved the balance of American politics with British tradition. This is the antidote to anything in the news that makes me want to cry. If you’re looking for a really fun, sweet romance, check this out."
"I read somewhere that this was a top read. Don’t get me wrong it wasn’t terrible but it wasn’t more than just okay either. Yes the characters were nice. Everybody was so nice, so diverse so understanding of each other that something was lost and so the feel good dissipated long before the end of the book. It felt like the words and the actions were trying too hard to prove points. I can see the author was trying to offer hope and I commend that but we need the imperfect as well so we understand choices. I was disappointed in this but others may disagree."
"*I was provided a PDF of the novel through Net Galley in exchange for an honest review. I loved it so much that I bought a paperback copy*Alex Claremont-Diaz is the same as every other 20-something -trying to finish college, dealing with his family and friends, looking forward to what comes after college. Okay, there’s more than that. His mom Ellen is the first female President of the United States and up for re-election, he’s coming into his bisexuality, and oh- he just started falling for his biggest enemy, Henry, Prince Of Wales. And that’s just the start.This book was so so good. I loved following Alex on his journey of self-discovery and then his love story with Alex. The twists and turns kept coming, but it never felt cheap or obvious. It was fun and deep and unexpected. I don’t want to say much more about the story because I don’t want to ruin everyone’s experience! It really does need to be experienced without many spoilers.I do hope we might get further adventures, but if not, this book will stand as a classic of lgbt young adult."
"""So, do you feel forever about him?Yeah, I do.Then, f— it.""What else can be said about Casey McQuiston’s inimitable 'Red, White & Royal Blue' that hasn’t already been said? This has been sitting on my TBR pile for quite awhile, and I’m happy to report that this novel was everything I thought it would be and more.Alex is the oldest son of the current President of the United States. Prince Henry of Wales is, well, Prince Henry. Of Wales. They’ve endured countless comparisons, and a seemingly mutual disdain for one another. But when they’re forced to play nice for the press, they soon realize there’s a thin line between love and hate.This novel is one of the best written novels I’ve read this year. Its wit is razor sharp, its issues timely, its romance heartfelt and poignant. McQuiston presents us with a world that I want to live in, flaws and all. In many ways, I read this as an allegory of sorts, a wish for another reality than the one we were forced to accept after the 2016 election. It’s a more progressive, albeit imperfect, world, one that I hope can be actualized someday. Sign. Me. Right. On. Up.This is so much more than a compelling love story (though it is, most definitely that). This is a commentary on what we could have, what we could be, if we allow each other the ability to live an authentic life. If you’re late to the game like me, read this immediately!"
"Okay, so I know I might be late to this book but wow. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻Well done. I truly enjoyed this book. I wasn’t sure how it would go but a fellow book enthusiast encouraged me to do a read along with her for pride month and I’m so happy I did. Alex & Henry are end game, they’re OTP. I laughed with them, I teared up for them and I haven’t had a book do that in awhile. I want a royal highness for a best friend. The interactions between everyone is great. The fact that the story has a female president is so empowering to women everywhere. The diversity in the book was amazing. Thank goodness the author got hit with idea on I-10. I’m very happy I read this book. I will say I did see those twists coming at the end but I was still happy to read them and see it all play out in the end. I think many would enjoy this book and I encourage everyone to give it a shot."
"How to even describe this genuinely fantastic book? Let's start with what I expected vs what happened.So, I thought it was going to be a fun tingle book starring two hot guys, one the First Son and the other an actual Prince Charming. Which is was! Then some important threads surrounding that relationship wove into something bigger, bringing in family obligations, power, and progress into the fabric.Alex is the son of the first female President of the US. Henry is the spare heir to a throne overseas. They are their respective nation's #1 hot male single to watch, and haven't been able to stand one another since their first meeting years ago.Now they are in the middle of a PR move forcing them to act like longstanding BFFs, and the organic relationship that blooms during the charade becomes a beautiful thing. The timing is unfortunate, for there is genuine concern that being honest about what happened could put an upcoming re-election and a prince's position in the monarchy in jeopardy.This is the book for anyone who wished (and tried to make) the 2016 election went very differently because they want everyone to be able to live authentically and feel safe in all the ways while doing so. It's about four years of progress in that direction, and an upcoming election ripe with attempts by the other side to change who is in power because that progress isn't wanted by some.The author managed to make a laugh-out-loud, smart, sexy, and moving romance, 100%. That, itself, is plenty reason why you should read this. But then you get to know the friends and families of these men, watch them grow and change and become more of who they truly are, and that, too, is worth your reading time. Then, finally, the spotlit drama arises, and we watch as all of these people/characters we have come to care about, got invested in, make decisions in regards to what they will do--what they will risk--when it comes to love.I almost think I should delete this review and just yell OMG JUST READ THIS COME ON DO IT because it's so hard to describe and I don't think I'm doing it justice. I'm still thinking about this book, and all I can hope is that I get to play a part in getting even more people to read Alex and Henry's story. We need it right now."
"I loved this novel. It takes a situation that is patently absurd [First Son of the U.S. meets handsome Prince of England, and hilarity and love ensue], and makes you believe it and care about the characters at the same time. It's witty, laugh-out-loud funny, and occasionally heartbreaking. There are some beautiful passages [their emails alone are the most wonderful, modern-day love letters], my favorite being when Prince Henry gives First Son Alex a private tour of the Victoria and Albert Museum, looking at all the incredible art his family has pillaged from around the world, but giving us some of the deeper meaning of certain pieces and and their history. The two spend the entire novel flying back and forth between Europe and the U.S. trying to be together as much as possible, dodging reporters and nosy friends, family and assorted aides de camp. ""I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I love you......"" It doesn't get any more heartfelt than that.So....If you enjoy love stories, read it. If you enjoy good writing, read it. You really can't go wrong."
"I have a problem – when people tell me a book or a movie or a show is amazing it prompts an almost immediate need to not read or watch it. This is not a smart response – and I know that. But that was the response I had to this book. And I was wrong, and I admit it. I wish I wasn’t always late to the party but…if I wasn’t I wouldn’t be me. And that is a lot of what this book is all about.This was, undoubtedly, my favorite book of 2019.I won’t rehash the plot, because you really just need to read it. I will say, however, that I would like to be a part of a world where Ellen Claremont did become president after Obama. And where the first family was from such a richly, diverse background. Where hope and love are the legacy the president and her family leave behind. In a world of ugly politics, the Claremont-Diaz crew, clearly live what they show to the world. And Alex and Henry are the kind of people I want to see splashed on the covers of tabloids. People who want to make a difference, not just because it plays well with the press but because it will make a difference.Alex and Henry’s love story is engrossing and beautiful. We don’t need detailed sex scenes to get a sense of their passion for each other. Their texts and e-mails are the stuff of legend. Henry truly has a poetic soul and it adds so much to the story.I think, overall, that this book is about coming in to your own and finding your way. Understanding that the path you started out on, isn’t always the one you are going to end up on. Casey McQuiston created such beautiful fully developed characters in this story that you feel lost when the book is over and you don’t have them in your life anymore.For me, this book is one you should not miss.Read it for yourself and then get back to me so we can discuss it in horrifying detail.Henry + Alex 4 Ever!"
"I bought this book because I had seen it a lot of places and a lot of authors I follow on social media were suggesting it and saying it's one of the best books to come out this year thus far which had my expectations high but not too high. After the first couple of chapters I was immediately grabbed and sucked into the world of Henry and Alex. Both Alex and Henry are characters with a high status in their countries but they're so easy to relate to which gives the book a good narrative in how family/parental statuses can be overwhelming while trying to create your own path, but that's just one aspect of the book. Its characters, both the main and minor characters, are important and likable which creates for a good reading experience no matter who is in the current scene in the book. The book also delivers a perfect mix of fluffy relationship moments and serious or angsty business scenes like when it comes down to how they deal with the overseas, diplomatic relationship. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a lighthearted and feel good book about a sweet couple that care about the well being of each other (but don't expect it to start out that way). It's also a pretty quick read, only about 418 pages and I finished it in 4 days. Hopefully you'll give it a chance!"
"I was just looking for a sweet romance between the President's son and his Prince Charming. I didn't expect such a super charged story. One fueled by politics, a tight-knit family, a minor international incident and some major self-discovery all while falling in love in the public eye. I loved Alex and adored Henry. I loved the calls and the texts and especially those emails. They had such a unique relationship. I soaked up every minute of it. They were really sweet. I loved how their friends and family added so much to their story. Alex's mom was a rockstar. I loved her. She was the mom everyone wishes they had. There were a couple of people on Henry's side of the pond that I wanted to throat punch though. I really liked reading this book. With the way things are in the world right now, it gives me hope that there's something far better out there."
"I've never read romance novels until recently. Suddenly, I'm a fan. I've read a number of books in the last two months as a cotton candy escape from the depressing daily news. I've been a reader for year, so it's been a surprise to find enjoyment in the simple premise of the romance novel. They are all approximately the same length, the same story lines with minor changes to plot or character names... and lots of the same sex over and over.  What a lovely surprise to find this book. Much better writing, engaging character development, enough plot twists to keep you engaged and a sweet story of the ideal of m/m committed romance. The sex is not as explicit as most of the standard form romance, but to be honest I found that a pleasant diversion from the monotonous couplings that are common in most of the formulaic m/m romance novels I've been reading. I can only hope that the author writes a sequel so that we can see where life and love takes these characters next. I'm a fan."
"“The phrase “see attached bibliography” is the single sexiest thing you have ever written to me.”*Trigger Warning for Alcohol, Mental Health, AddictionRating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Genre: Romance, Fiction, LGBT Literature, 18+This book made me laugh, cry, and never want it to end. I adored these characters and the storyline. I think author, @casey.mcquiston was willing to discuss things that some authors are afraid of writing about and I’m all for that no matter what porticoI was nervous about this book because I have seen nothing but absolute love or absolute hate, no in between. For me personally, I absolutely adored this book and have already recommended it to some.This book really touched on some sensitive and not much spoken about issues, and the author really seemed to show to be an advocate for minorities. One review I read spoke about the author “hitting to much on political issues” and “forcing beliefs down their throat”, but frankly - if you are reading a promoted LGBTQ related book, that is discussing politics for “the first female president”, I think it’s safe to assume there will not be a lot of conservative politic views. I’m not here to speak politics, just pointing on obvious for anyone with a possible interest in reading."
"I really enjoyed this book. It's a fun romance that is well-written and engaging. I actually wanted to finish the story and know how it turned out, nor could I quite tell what would happen. There are certainly a lot of obstacles in the way of the main characters.I appreciate that she included Latin characters, being Latin myself. You just don't see that very often, and certainly not ones you can relate to, certainly not characters in the White House.It's not a perfect book. At times, it seems a bit silly, such as how the main character has no idea that he is gay. I'm sorry, it just doesn't work like that. Also, the prince comes off as a bit bland. But the writing was engaging and I actually wanted to finish the book, which I rarely do. I would say it's one of my favorite books in a long while, certainly the best 2020 has offered so far."
"This was such a ridiculously fun and wholesome read.Red, White, and Royal Blue is as much about self-love as it is about learning to love others in spite of whatever fears you may have. I did not have many expectations going in, but the premise made me expect something light-hearted that I would find on Wattpad. A hispanic first son to the current President falling in love with the white Prince of Wales? It sounds like a sweet fantasy. And somehow, while still managing that very engaging and exciting premise, it covers a lot of meaningful subjects and possesses a lot of heart.Alex is a guy who puts a lot of pressure on himself. He has an image to uphold as the First Son and a lot of ambitions that he mulls over every day. He wonders about how history will remember him and his perspective discusses surprisingly genuine commentary on trying to do good in politics when no one seems to be trying to. It is difficult to ignore the real life political parallels, although it is not trying to. But Alex experiences an incredible coming of age story that I rarely see be achieved as effectively as it is here. Henry is a prince, so needless to say he inherits a large and overwhelming history - a lot of which he does not condone, as he states that the legacy of his ancestors is one stained by bigotry, colonialism, and genocide. While Alex builds an image to present to the world, Henry has one built for him. He is the Prince of Wales, but who is he? Who is Henry outside of the royal family? Seeing Henry come out of his shell and develop his relationship with Alex was beautiful to behold, with all its struggles and nuances.Another impressive feat is that Alex and Henry are not the only phenomenal characters in this story. There is Alex’s mother, President Ellen Claremont, and his charming and charismatic father who is a congressman from California, Oscar. There is his sister June and his best friend Nora and then there are Pez, Bea, and Rafael Luna, among many others. There is such a rich tapestry of side characters; it has been a good while since I have left a book and actually found myself missing it because the relationship dynamics really are perfect. It has one of the most lively and endearing casts I have read in recent memory.Now not only are all the characters wonderful and not only do they experience phenomenal growth, but the overall plot develops into a wonderful climax that ties the story together in a cohesive, satisfying way. It impressed and astounded me how organically everything was slowly built and paid off.There are very few bad things I can say about this sweet, coming-of-age romance and McQuiston has gotten herself on the list of authors whose latest works I would pick up on release."
"This book was so awesome! I loved everything about it. So fantastic. I loved Henry and Alex’ relationship so much. I mean, how can you not love the son of POTUS hooking up with the Prince of England! I especially loved the letter/emails the sent each other, along with the quotes and tidbits of history. There’s a side story relating to the election that was also intriguing and I liked a lot. I have tons of highlights and quotes. I absolutely recommend this book!!!“Should I tell you that when we’re apart, your body comes back to me in dreams? That when I sleep, I see you, the dip of your waist, the freckle above your hip, and when I wake up in the morning, it feels like I’ve just been with you, the phantom touch of your hand on the back of my neck fresh and not imagined? That I can feel your skin against mine, and it makes every bone in my body ache? That, for a few moments, I can hold my breath and be back there with you, in a dream, in a thousand rooms, nowhere at all? “Easily one of my favorite books this year. I’m obsessed, OBSESSED! I have so many highlights I can’t even. This was beautiful, and perfect. This couple was goals and this story was amazing. Absolutely recommend!"
"I will admit that I started trying to read this book back in November and I only made it about 12 pages before I had to put it up. It wasn't the books fault at all, I spent the better part of a month getting snatches of sleep and that would not allow me to jump into something new. So when I was at a club meeting with my kid a recent Saturday night, I started it up again. That was 7pm. By 5am I was done and so wired that I couldn't sleep.This is one of the best books I've read in recent years, and yes part of that is the wishful world it's set in. But it's genuinely entertaining and has a healthy grasp on politics, as well as the inner workings of dealing with such things. The characters are very likeable, even when being abrasive or especially foolish. There's so much snark that I appreciate, and so much sweetness. The sexual identity crisis was nicely handled as well.It's hard to write a review without wanting to toss spoiler after spoiler to explain why I loved it so much. But I refuse to because I want more people to read the book and enjoy it for themselves. Please do, it's amazing.And please don't look at the low star reviews. They tend to be from people who either wouldn't enjoy the book on the first place, or think that somehow magically a book about a romance between the First Son of the US and a Prince of England somehow should have...less politics."
"I really enjoyed this book!Plot-wise, it didn't do anything particularly revolutionary, except that it was two queer characters who got a straightforward love story without having to be angsty or indie or do anything impressive, and it was a relief to be able to enjoy queer literature without it having to be arthouse.Spoilers: they both surviveIt read a lot like a very long, well-paced fanfiction: there was lots of representation (besides our bi PoC main character we also have many badass PoC side characters, a badass trans character in a healthy gay marriage, and general comfort with flexing on gender norms), unbashed left-wing political commentary, a female president, and a ""non-traditional"" family structure.  It also wasn't 350 pages of Will They-Won't They, the relationship progresses in a natural (and not horribly explicit) way with multiple phases and arcs, and at the end there is really nice closure.  Some of their issues are them being pigheaded, but there are actual outside influences preventing things from progressing smoothly too, so it's really nice not to see the same angsty plot drawn out ad nauseum Yet Again."
"I really wanted to like this book. Of course I did because $9.99 is a big hit on my reading budget! But unfortunately it was full of so many bad white men (Bitch McConnell??) and wonderful people of color trying to save the world that I couldn't even concentrate on the story. It felt uneven and so consciously ""woke"" that it was exhausting. In the end it was a self conscious, YA book by an author who seemed a little afraid to write sex scenes."
"I simply devoured this cute political romance in one sitting. It involves an enemies-to-lovers tale of the son of the female president of the United States falling for a young British prince. It's a recent alternate history novel of sorts, imaging a transition from the Obama administration to a Texas female president with adult children who are part Hispanic. It's hilariously funny and romantic, and I adored the characters. It should be noted that is not a YA novel, given the explicit language, alcohol and drug references, and fairly steamy sex scenes. Also, it focuses a lot on US politics. These were all strong selling points for me, but obviously not for everyone. Older teenagers certainly might enjoy the novel, but this is probably the best example of the ""New Adult"" category romance I've read. Highly recommended."
"I didn’t expect this book to fall into the category of “important,” I was thinking more “popcorn.” I love me some sweet YA m/m romance, “The Gentleman’s Guide to Vice and Virtue” as well as “Carry On” are two of my favorite comfort reads when I’m so sick I can’t move. “Red, White, & Royal Blue,” dare I say it, surpassed both.The premise itself is cutesy, a tabloid fantasy. But the way it plays out is so raw and real that it leaves a lump in your throat. I am fully ready to suspend disbelief that two such high-profile golden boys could find so many stolen moments, because with the state of the world, I very much NEED this alternate universe where their Happily Ever After is perhaps attainable, a world where people are mostly not sh*tty to each other.I will fight anyone who says it’s not realistic, because that’s not the point. The subversive nature of fiction itself is to present us the world as it could be, to posit hope and change as a real possibility, by showing us what it would actually look like.Aside from the geopolitical identity politics fantasy we all deserve, what I TRULY love about this book is that we get to see SO MUCH of their relationship, not just the buildup of sexual tension with a culminating first kiss. My pet peeve of romantic YA is when the couple spends the entire book just finding each other, and the last page only brings you up to the moment where they are about to start something. WTF??In RW&RB, the kiss is the inciting incident. The relationship is steamy AF, and grows so damn tender. At every milestone, I kept looking with disbelief at how much book was left, because most authors would use any one of these moments as an endcap. Nope, it keeps going and going. Thank you for letting me see so much of Alex and Henry, and why their love would be so important for the world and history itself.And it’s beautifully written, too. The End. A&H are now a forever kind of thing in my fandom.P.S. I love it when “Juniper” comes up in any book, it startles me every time - but I straight up guffawed when June irritably replied to her brother that it’s “not my name, not anyone’s name.”"
"I adored this book and it's quirky, three-dimensional characters.Alex and Henry have such a fun and interesting dynamic. Alex is the First Son of the United States and Henry is the Prince of Wales. They clash at first, but are forced to feign friendship in order to smooth over a rather embarrassing incident that became a PR nightmare for both their countries. The development of their relationship is so compelling and entertaining. Henry's struggles in particular broke my heart, and I had a lot of empathy for his situation.I loved the m/m romance, the diversity, the LGBTQ+ representation, the humor, the politics, and just about everything about this book. I'm also a sucker for one-liners and there were some great ones.(My actual rating is about a 4.5, but alas. No half stars here or on GR for my indecisive self!)"
I really enjoyed this book. I wasn’t sure what to expect or how I’d feel reading this romance book based on two male characters but I really enjoyed experiencing the growth of their relationship and their banter! I found it very humorous at times. The book had some steaminess to it which again I hadn’t expected but I think the overall story was good and different - first son of a female president and a future prince (anything royals related always gets me hooked). Would have enjoyed an epilogue though! Can’t wait to see what this author comes up with next.
"Stars: 5 StarsFormat: PrintSteam Level: SteamyI picked this up because so many of my friends read it, adored it, and sung its praises. I am beyond glad they did. LOVED THIS. I rated this Steamy because it doesn’t fade to black but it also is not explicit in details. Almost like The Wedding Date by Jasmine Guillory where it’s not that went there but you definitely know he went down on him.Quick Thoughts:- Really liked the two main characters. They were both adorable, annoying at times, relatable (even with one being the a prince and the other the son of POTUS), and funny- Side characters were AMAZING. I do love a book where I want books of the side characters- I laughed out loud in so many spots that I ended up putting it down late at night so I wouldn’t wake my wife with my laughing- Interesting mix of Real Life politics and made up. If it hadn’t been for my friends loving this I probably would have put it down though. What could have been if people hadn’t voted for a Russian backed hate loving racist was hard to read at times- Cried in two spots. First was after everything went down and Alex was in England (LOVED LOVED LOVED Catherine and Bea and “Never tell me the odds.”) Second was election night.  It brought back memories of sitting by myself at home because my wife was in Afghanistan two months into a continuous 8 months stint and being terrified for her, my friends, my family, and people I didn’t even know. (Oh look I was right to be scared.) This brought all of those feelings up. Thank god this was a romance and, again, friends I trusted loved this or I probably couldn’t have gotten through it- The romance between Alex and Henry was so sweet and was a joy to watch them work it out- A little slow in spots and I wasn’t over the moon for the last scene, but I loved the rest of the book so much I could overlook itOverall a wonderfully delightful book that you should definitely give a try. I see why it keeps getting recommended! Pick it up!"
"I really liked this book. The relationship between the prince and the first son was cute and clever. The support they received from their sisters, close friends, and even Madam President was touching. The peek into both the DC world of politics and the world of British royalty was intriguing. Lovely that there was genuine caring from both members of the couple. The descriptions of physical intimacy and fantasies were frequent and thorough, which might make some readers uncomfortable. I was okay with it but the book would have been just as good with less of the storyline devoted to passionate encounters. So just skip those scenes if they’re not your cup of tea (wink). The book is still charming without them. I believe this is a debut for this author and I hope that her next book will be as good as this. This is a modern-day fairy tale featuring an unconventional prince."
This book catches you up to changes in America changes that are largely embraced and shows you what life is like for people struggling in the lgbt community. It shows you very honestly I think what it is like to come out and embrace who you are. The storyline is great and I love the Prince Charming aspect of this story. I loved all the characters and how abnormal this book was!
"This review is basically just me gushing about Red, White, & Royal Blue. So, I absolutely loved this book; the characters, the setting, and plot, the pop culture references. It was perfect. There was nothing about this book that I did not love. The chemistry between Henry and Alex was electric. Just reading their emails made me smile. And oh my god they stressed me out with their sneaking around. I was in constant fear of them being caught. Also, Nora and June are the best friends I would love to have. Nora is unapologetically herself and says whatever it crosses her mind, and June is sweet and has a Jane Austin obsession. Oh, and Alex lives life with a reckless abandon that I appreciate. Another thing I appreciated was that their friend’s groups blended together and interacted with each other rather than staying isolated. TL;DR: You need to read this book. Everyone needs to read this book."
"When his mom was elected president three years ago, Alex found himself elevated to the status of American royalty. The only issue is that Alex has beef with actual royalty: the Prince of Wales, Henry. After a wedding cake debacle turned media frenzy, both families are eager for some damage control, which comes in the form of publicly staging a truce between Alex and Henry. Soon their fake friendship turns into a real friendship, then into something deeper, and before too long, Alex finds himself in a secret relationship with Henry. If they’re both outed and their relationship comes to light, it could cause upheaval in both countries, as well as costing Alex’s mom her re-election. Can love conquer all?I’m in love with this book and I don’t think I’ll ever shut up about it. I joked to my friends that it actually made me feel things again. A truly incredible cast of characters (including the minor characters! even they were amazing! I love them all so dearly!) and an adorable yet poignant storyline that had me legitimately laughing out loud. I like to highlight passages in books that make me laugh and/or stick out to me, and I swear that half of this book was highlighted by the time I was done."
"The first problem with this book is that it is set in 2019 and we all know it's about Prince Harry and some imaginable son of a President who is not Donald Trump. Right there it goes off the rails, but I stuck with it until it became too pretentious and too unbelievable. It might have worked if it was in 2023, but I just got fed up with how little thought was given to how unbelievable the fantasy was because it wasn't fantastic."
"I adored this book. So. Much.First and foremost, it's just so funny. Humor in romance books is often cringy, but I was genuinely cracking up at this book, worsened by the fact that I was reading the first half of it in Barnes & Noble. Alex's dialogue with his friends and family and even the author's technique in making a punchline through inner monologue is just so genuine and funny and modern and sarcastic. There was not a SINGLE instance of humor or dialogue in this book that I think was overdone or cheesy. This author is just masterful at crafting realistic, meaningful, but also lighthearted conversations.This is the type of book that makes you love every single character. From Henry and Alex to even the most minor cabinet members or White House staff, every character has a place carved out for them in this book. McQuiston made me care about them and their conflicts without having to sacrifice my attention from Alex's main storyline. I LOVED Nora and June and Pez and Zahra and Alex's mom, the actual president, who I did not expect to be so blunt and crass but I fell in love with instantly.Next, I loved how politics was folded into this book. Nothing was too abrupt, boring, or info dumpy. Specifically, there were so many nods to Texan politics, which struck close to home because I'm from Dallas (see: me crying at the end of this book). Beyond that, there's a lot of discussion about the first son and daughter being biracial (half Mexican), campaigning and the corruption of politicians, as well as the country's reaction to a woman being president for the first time. All of these commentaries were such a great addition to the story. It felt so good to be immersed in an alternate universe where this family and cabinet exists.Delving into this world is equal parts comforting and horrifying: comforting because it's the alternate universe outcome I wish we'd had in the 2016 election, so seeing how different the world could be and hearing Alex's triumph about being biracial and living in the White House made me teary. At the same time, it really confronts you with just how institutionalized homophobia is, and the portion of the book that began discussing that (~the last 100 pages) is when the tears started and didn't stop.Alex and Henry's separate journeys grappling with their sexualities and how to be transparent with their identities as world leaders were completely touching. This book follows Alex's perspective, and I really loved the discussion of discovering yourself as bisexual and questioning sexuality, and the eventual support system he was able to generate with his friends and family. However, this book also broke my heart in its discussion of Henry's sexuality and the acceptability of being in homosexual relationships while in a position of power, especially the leader of a country who fears how their people will react to that news. This book definitely has its cute royal romance moments, but my favorite part of it was at its heart, it's about two men growing more comfortable in their sexuality and being willing to face anybody who would question them.I basically used up an entire sleeve of sticky tabs because this book was so hilarious, important, and touching. If you haven't read this already, I highly recommend you do so."
"Author Casey McQuiston wrote this fictional gay romance novel sort of as a response to how 2016 turned out. Instead of the political and royal figureheads, we have here in the US and in the UK, we were given ones from a sort of parallel universe thereby allowing her to tell the tales of Alex and Henry. What makes this novel work so well is her character writing. The universe in which they live in is rich with details, especially the political machinations (there is some very interesting political intrigue regarding someone Alex knows) that Alex must deal with as well as the social implications that Henry, as a member of the Royal Family, must also contend with. But it is with these two characters that McQuiston pours her soul into thereby giving life to them. Even as they go on their own character arcs (especially Alex), there remains a consistency to who and what they are even as they evolve and grow as people. Even as Alex comes off as somewhat unlikeable at the beginning, by the time his feelings for Henry begin to awaken he is transformed into someone that we can at least not detest, and by we get into the last third of the book he’s someone that we’re not only rooting for, he becomes a character that we can genuinely care about. Henry is different in that he has that royal veneer about him. He’s totally pleasant as one might expect, but even as Alex starts to see his real self he immediately becomes a likable, if somewhat sad, character. McQuiston perfectly uses their growing relationship to see both of them actually begin to blossom as they discover feelings within themselves and for each other. As I read through all of this I could sense that something bad was going to happen, and lo it most certainly did. McQuiston captures the public backlash of these two getting together repeatedly for what is clearly more than just a friendly visit. First, the challenges are strictly of the heart as they each have to admit what it is they are feeling, then the challenges they face have international implications, but McQuiston continually keeps it focused on Alex and Henry in how this fallout is affecting them. It’s a masterful reminder that despite whatever position we come into, whether it is one we attain from hard work or one that we are born into, that at the end of the day we are still people and that must take precedence.This book completely caught me by surprise. I never imagined myself reading a romance novel that wasn’t in some sort of sci-fi or fantasy genre setting, but through an unusual twist of circumstances, I discovered this book. Before reading Red, White & Royal Blue there had been only a handful of authors to cross my path whose work I would fall madly in love with, three of those being Gini Koch of the “Alien – Katherine/Kitty-Katt” series, Jonathan Latt, author of ""The Geek,"" and more recently K.D. Edwards, author of “The Tarot Sequence” series of books, the first being ""The Last Sun"" (the follow-up novel ""The Hanged Man"" is slated to come out in December). I have read and re-read their books repeatedly because they each have created characters that I have also fallen in love with. Now I’m thrilled to say that I can add another author to that group as McQuiston has delivered a novel that I just could not put down. I never thought I would go for romance novels, even if they were of a gay nature, but her writing was so powerful that at the end of the day this book proved that what transcends genres is nothing more than just outstanding quality. Her depictions of Alex and Henry, especially as their feelings truly awoke within themselves for each other, was so beautifully written that for a time I no longer felt like an old gay man (I will soon be 58), but instead I actually felt young again and with that came the innocent feelings of hopefulness and optimism, not to mention a reminder of that emotional rush one feels when falling in love. Through Alex and Henry not only did I get to experience that all over again, but McQuiston also gave something that many hopeless romantics (yes, we gay men can also be hopeless romantics) fantasize over, and that is being swept up in love by a true Prince. It’s a theme that has existed in fairy tales for hundreds of years, and now she has given us one that we gay men can latch on to and, vicariously through Alex, experience being swept off our feet by a dashing Prince. If there is a downside to this book is that I was absolutely saddened when I got to the last page and there was no more story. Despite the fact that Alex and Henry are just fictional characters, they were so well-written and portrayed in this book that they truly became alive in my mind, and having the book come to an end felt like I had to say goodbye to them, which is something that I didn’t want to do. Just as they made each other’s lives better through their love and relationship, getting to know them in this book oddly enough made my life better. Reading their story actually made me happy, so for that, I say THANK YOU Casey McQuiston for writing a most remarkable tale. Your idea for this story that you imagined while on an I-10 off-ramp has been embraced by this old gay man who lives just off of I-10. Maybe if you should choose to write more about these two it could be told from Henry’s perspective. In the meantime, I think I will give Red, White & Royal Blue another joyous re-read!!!"
"Red, White & Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston is the kind of sweeping, endearing, sexy romance I've been craving. I hadn't expected to find all those things in this book if I'm being honest, but as soon as I started reading, I was hooked. The voice, characters, and banter are hilarious, smart, and sincere. I felt like I knew these people--and sadly, at the end of the book, I realized they weren't real and that I wasn't living in their world--and I fell in love with each of them for different reasons. They are whole and complex, flawed, but perfect. The romance is swoon-worthy, addicting, and it digs deep under the surface. At various parts, I wanted to cry from happiness and sadness, but in the end, I was practically cheering. I even really loved the politics involved! This is not a book to miss if you love love that defies the odds."
"Red, White and Royal Blue is the best book I’ve read this year. No contest.I wasn’t at all convinced by the blurb though. I mean, a clandestine love affair between the son of the American president and a prince of England? Really? But oh, how wrong I was. Red, white and Royal Blue is epic. I’ve never encountered quite this romance-wit-and-parallel universe-combination before. Hopefully McQuiston has started a brand new genre.This is such a fabulous story. It has everything you could possibly wish for.First off. It’s hilarious. I can’t remember the last book that had me laughing this hard.Then, it’s all the characters. It’s literally impossible not to fall in love with them. Not only Alex and Henry, but their friends, family, staff and colleagues. They’re complex, smart and flawed. Everything’s all so very relatable – even though the setting is a parallel reality that involves a prince.Also, the love story. It’s beautiful and unexpected. Against all odds. Which of course makes it even more swoon-worthy.One of the most impressive parts of Red, White and Royal Blue is how McQuiston weaves the story into this exceptional political backdrop. I’m Swedish. I don’t really get the twisted American voting system where the most votes doesn’t necessarily translates to a win. And I’m not at all familiar with the ways of American national political campaigns and the like. But the political intrigue and the likeness – and difference – to specific real-world politicians was captivating. Essentially, it’s just absolutely awesome world-building.To read Red, White and Royal Blue is an emotional roller coaster. I laughed, I cried and then I laughed some more. It’s amazing, heartwarming and brilliant. If you haven’t read it, you need to remedy that right now. I couldn’t put it down. I stayed up way longer than what’s healthy considering the time I need to get up in the morning. I read during breaks at work. I read while taking my son to the playground. And then, when I finished it, I was heartbroken that there weren’t any more chapters.When I realised that this is McQuiston’s first novel, that there aren’t anything else available by her, I almost cried a little.So, I have the worst book-hangover imaginable right now. I don’t know where I’ll find another story good enough to get me back to normal. Maybe I’ll just have to re-read Red, White and Royal Blue."
"I read a LOT of romance, but this was my first M/M romance! I know, I know, I definitely should have tried LGBTQ romance sooner! But I’m so happy this was my first dive into it. I have mixed feelings about new adult romance, I’ve loved some and some fell totally flat, but Red, White, and Royal Blue was everything. This is so much more than a cute rom-com, the story is part coming of age, part enemies to lovers romance, and 100% heartfelt delightful story with some fairytale vibes.Alex, Mexican-American First Son of the US, is pretty sure he hates Henry, the Prince of England. Yet when Alex is forced to stage a fake friendship with him following a royal wedding disaster, he slowly starts to realize Henry might not be as bad as he originally thought. Their sort of friendship turns into forbidden secret romance, all while President Claremont is about to start her re-election bid.Ugh, these characters! Every single character felt so real, it’s really hard to believe this is McQuiston’s debut. The banter between Alex and Henry was so damn enjoyable, and the tension when they started to fall for each other had me grinning like an idiot the whole time. I loved that we got to see Alex work through his bisexuality (I was dying during the scene between him and Nora discussing it) There is steam (yay!) and it’s very well written and seems to fit their characters perfectly.I just wanted to live in this world with Ellen Claremont as President! I think the only way this could have been better would be to have more interactions between Alex and his mom, she’s the sassy female President of my dreams. And I LOVED the White House Trio! Can June and Nora each get their own books?! Because I need stories from their points of view ASAP!This story was complete catnip for my little feminist heart! Everything about Red, White, and Royal Blue was absolute perfection, in my opinion. This was a 5 star read for me! If you are looking for a delightful, heartwarming, and hilarious romance I highly suggest grabbing a copy of Red, White, and Royal Blue immediately!"
"Damn, I finished it off in a couple of sittings!Its not often you find a modern romance novel that isn't over the top unrealistic or silly. The author did a superb job with the pacing and dialogue! The characters aren't overly complicated yet still have enough depth to feel tangible.I was a huge fan of the diversity of the overall cast in the novel - from a regular readers' perspective, it seems a little too diverse, but that's ultimately the honest demographics of America. I would love to see more novels written with as much optimism and open-heartedness as this.The author also takes to time to delve into the concepts of abuse and shame, in addition to how silence can kill. We also get to see that the problems plaguing the characters are spread across all ages and races, reminding us that people in the end are just people. One and the same.Not too much focus is put into any single element and the book is balanced perfectly. The political race of the mother in her quest for re-election coupled with the media's constant pursuit of the the two boys, who are deep in their own interpersonal struggles, makes for a killer, quick-paced novel."
At first I wasn't sure if I was going to like the Pres. son character. However it didn't take long to like him along with the prince. The author really did a lot of research in both English and American politics to make this story work. She did an excellent job of doing just that.  All of the characters are well thought out and the ending is perfect.  I only hope that somehow the author manages and sees it in her heart to write a sequel to this book.  It could have the twists and turns in it and some hardships of the relationship. We can only hope.  I would very quickly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a gay romance that is a little different from the norm.  Congrats to the author she wrote a winner. Thank you
"I started this book with reservations, but quickly fell in love with it. By the nail-biting finale, I was in tears and rooting with my whole being for Alex, June, Ellen, Nora and Henry. It is literate in a very contemporary youthful way. It is also smart and funny, confronting uncomfortable truths and unpleasant realities. Casey McQuiston’s transnational political romance is both discreet and sexy, but more importantly it is totally heart-felt and very much a novel of this moment in this strange political time in our world.The set-up is ripe with potential: Alex Claremont-Diaz is the First Son of America’s first woman president, Ellen Claremont. In the last year of his mother’s first term, Alex is deeply invested in finishing college and helping his mother’s reelection campaign. He is backed up by his older sister June, and his former girlfriend (and their best friend) Nora Halloran (granddaughter of the Vice President). In a really interesting piece of plotting, it is made clear that these White House children have decided to fully embrace the social media world and have created international presences for themselves as adjuncts to President Mom. There is a good deal of amusing plot development revolving around June’s obsessive hobby of tracking their visibility in the media and Nora’s crazy analytical skills.In another contemporary touch, Alex and June’s Mexican-American father, Senator Oscar Diaz, is divorced from the president, who has remarried to Leo, a tech tycoon who is both rich and well-liked by his stepchildren. Indeed, it is a very hip liberal-left White House. The fierce and foul-mouthed Zahra is the president’s media tiger (and will have to be played by Wanda Sykes in the film), while the kids’ personal secret service agents are Cash, who is black, and Amy, who is trans. (One can tell that this book was written in part as a healing response to the ugly results of the 2016 election).The plot twist suggested by the book’s title and cover design is Henry of Wales, royal highness and younger son of Catherine, the widowed Princess Royal. The royal family is not the family we all know today, but the author has created a plausible parallel group of Windsors, descended from Victoria and Albert by some kinship line that is never fully clarified. The reigning monarch of the UK is Queen Mary, who is not at all the admired Queen Elizabeth of our world but seems to be an echo of the real Elizabeth’s grandmother, Queen Mary, with her rigidly Teutonic conservatism. The importance of this is that this tougher, chillier queen has her family firmly under her old-guard pro-Brexit thumb. She plays a minor role “on screen” in this book, but her influence in the narrative runs deep.Henry Wales is as much a media darling as the Claremont-Diaz children, and Alex has known about him since he was thirteen, before his mother even ran for president. As First Son, Alex has encountered the prince several times, and hates him thoroughly for the snobbish, white, aristo cipher he thinks he is. Things shift sideways as the result of a hugely embarrassing social incident at the wedding of Prince Phillip, the heir to the throne and Henry’s older brother. Under threats from his mother’s press officer, Alex is forced to pretend to be Henry’s good friend in a series of staged press opportunities.The surprise is that, as is often the case in romantic comedies, Alex discovers that the Henry he comes to know out of the public eye is in fact a nice guy.And that’s all I’ll say. The rest should be discovered at your leisure in this lovely, sometimes hilarious novel that stole my heart with its rich cast of quirky, interesting characters.I was a little worried about this book, about which I’ve been hearing a lot of buzz since it was first announced (and when I pre-ordered it). Why? Because, St. Martin’s is a great mainstream press, and I always fret that books deemed worthy of mainstream publishers are palatable to presumed readers because they are somehow squeaky clean (i.e. less gay) than those books published by niche presses targeting LGBTQ readers and (he says grudgingly) their allies.Well, I was worried over nothing. After all, St. Martin’s published Consenting Adult by Laura Z. Hobson forty years ago, when such books were unheard of. This is, in my mind, something of a literary landmark, in spite of its light-hearted subject. Beneath the romance and the humor is a thoughtful inspection of American values and American freedoms. It is something we all need to keep our thought on these days."
"There are an incredible amount of things to love about this book. The young characters set against this presidential campaign gave the political elements a fresh snappiness that allowed them to fit nicely into the context of a coming-of-age story. The characterizations are exceedingly well-actualized, particularly with Alex and Henry, our two leading men. The romance between the two is smart and heart-wrenching, with quotes from love letters dating back to the the middle ages and hilarious text exchanges balancing out the heavier questions related to the political implications of a gay romance between family members of heads of state. I've never been much of a follower of the royal family, and this book is the first time I've actually found myself immersed in a story about royalty, probably because it tackled more modern and relevant issues of colonialism, the place of a monarchy in the twenty-first century, and the role of tradition in a young, gay man's life. I honestly can't recommend this book enough!"
"This book is a romance lovers dream! Alex and Henry not only filled my hopeless romantic heart but Ellen (Madame President) gave me hope as a Texan, Hispanic woman to one day see this kind of fight and resilience represented in our world. This book represents the fairy tale, warts and all. Alex is the son of the President of the United States, Henry is line for the throne, despite their backgrounds they form a most beautiful friendship. Side characters, Nora, June, Leo, Oscar, Rafael, Bea, and so many others also have so much impact and personality that you will fall in love with them too. Even if you don’t normally read M/M (it’s new for me too!) you will appreciate the beautiful way this book is written and the story that unfolds."
"Wow. Oh wow. Did I love this book. It had me laughing out loud so much that my coworkers gave me funny looks. It also had me close to tears and my heart was squeezed with both sadness and overwhelming happiness. A book about with female president, her biracial family, and bisexual son who falls in love with the Prince of England? Throw in a hate to love romance and I was ALL IN. And I can honestly say that this book blew my expectations out of the water. I already want (ie: NEED) to read it again.The character were so sassy and sarcastic and I absolutely loved it. The fact that both Henry and Alex had this amazing attitude and humor, but could also have such amazingly tender moments made them such loveable characters. I love how they used old letters in their emails to each other and this author did an amazing job of making these characters realistic, but also people to look up to.The romance was hot and I loved all their romancing scenes, especially when their relationship was secret and new. I cannot imagine having to hide a relationship like this from friends and family, but to be such public figures and worried about what the whole world things - it is unimaginable. I just wanted to be their advocates and give them such big hugs. There were moments of heartbreak that were so visceral and that just shows how amazing the writing and storytelling were.I could honestly gush about this book forever, but I just have to say GO READ IT. It will make your heart so very happy."
"On my first read-through, I was sort of luke warm, because there were a lot of characters right away whose relationships to each other were confusing enough that I was sort of so-so about the story and almost just put it down.  Very glad I didn't, because by the last third of the book (long book) I was enthralled with the characters and whole story concept and setting.  I began my second read-through in my pre-bed time slot, and sometimes reaad in the middle of the night if I can't get back to sleep quickly-- good book for that time of night,  because I know the story and won't get stuck in page-turner-syndrome!  I'm enjoying it all enormously now, and the  characters are really well written.  Wonderful, heart-warming story and very timely topic!"
"I chose this book to fulfill the debut novel category of the #mmdreadingchallenge for 2020, based on very favorable reviews. I’m really glad I did. Even though I usually don’t read many of them, I am a sucker for romantic love stories and happily-ever-after; it’s just that usually I watch them in movies instead of reading them. In this book, Alex, the son of the first female president of the United States begins an affair with Henry, the prince of England. They aren’t in a position to be open about their relationship, so they find ways to steal away and be with each other whenever they can, sending love letters through email when they can’t. Their story is set in the year Alex’s mom is campaigning for re-election, and there is a healthy dose of politics, which I liked. The dialogue is witty, the characters are likeable, the writing is really good, and the stolen moments between Henry and Alex are hot. It’s a really fun read.  If you shy away from racy sex scenes or left-leaning politics, this may not be the novel for you, but it’s likely you already gathered that."
"Not really a fan.Pros.Henry is very interesting. As is his sister. I just really like the royal siblings.Cons.Boring at points.A lot of the romance was forgettable.Alex and his sister seem like vapid entitled party kids.large parts of the book read like a tumblr irl fanfic. I kept expecting to see the line ""then everyone stood up and clapped"". Don't get me wrong I am gay myself but come on.It felt very performative. There were times people's race and/or sexuality were thrown in randomly in ways that felt extremely performative.All the ""bad guys"" were monsters. One character (the other royal brother) got to be complex. Everyone else was good or bad. I hate that."
"I loved this book. I read the last page and out-loud to no one said “that book was fabulous.”  I want this book to be real. I want this parallel universe to exist and Alex and Henry, and yes even stuffy Phillip to be real. And I want to be there too. I think I needed this book. It’s fun, while still hitting on the reality of the world we live in currently in a way that makes me want to believe everything will be okay.The storyline is fun and well, prior to 4 years ago, I would have thought a bit far fetched, but since elements of it actually happened, not so much now. The romance is sweet and both  The men are likable as are the supporting cast. I can see this as a movie. Easily see it. Can we have a movie?? Please???"
"What does one even say about “Red, White, & Royal Blue” by Casey McQuiston besides saying that it’s a joyful triumph. It’s a New Adult queer (m/m) romance set in a alternate-reality world that’s more optimistic & hopeful than our own. The First Son of the USA (biracial Hispanic & eventually realizes bi) falls in love with the (gay) Prince of Wales in a beautiful, touching, emotional, hilarious rollercoaster of a novel that I devoured in two days (or did it devour me…?). It’s so sweet & yet deep, with characters that are both beautiful & scarred. & the characters! To be honest, I did not love the main character, Alex Claremont-Diaz, initially due to his brashness & rudeness, but his budding friendship (& eventual relationship) & character development won me over. HRH Henry was of course the character I loved almost immediately. Added to this are a wonderful assortment of fleshed-out secondary characters (Nora, June, Bea, Pez, Zahra, etc) that are diverse & exist all over the gender & sexual spectrum. Truly, there are so many reasons to love this book! Just read it! I can’t wait to read it again, & it damn well deserves a wonderful film/TV adaptation. & a sequel! I want more of these characters. I want more hilarious, lewd, beautifully romantic emails. I want Henry’s perspective. I want more Nora/June (& Pez). & Bea. & Zahra & Shaan. & just more! I love this book! 💜💜💜"
"Well, I'm in my 40s and pretty certain that I am NOT  the target demographic here, but I absolutely loved this book! I wanted something to uplift my mood on a drive to Oregon during a really sad time. I  loved everything about this book --the sarcastic banter between the trio, the gay love story, Prince Henry, President Claremont-Diaz, actually all the characters, as well as the intermingled politics and royalty. I laughed out loud so many times. It just uplifted me while listening to it. I am actually listening to it again to uplift me after listening to part disturbing audiobook (Behind Closed Doors- do not recommend -  I needed to get it out of my mind and system) and remembered how much I enjoyed this book. I realize the biting humor might not be everyone's cup of tea, but it was definitely mine. If you want a feel-good and happy listen or read, then look no further!"
"I was so pleasantly surprised by Red, White and Royal Blue. The characters were so well drawn, witty, original and likable. I kept picturing a Netflix (or Amazon prime!) series - it would be fantastic, and so many of the set pieces would have such great drama. The romance took a cliche and made it so appealing that you didn't care if was unbelievable. Alex and Henry were both wonderful. I loved the epistolary portion - their emails absolutely bled with longing and love and were so well written. The characters from President to secret service agents to Senators were interesting. The political side was extremely well-written, and showed a keen understanding of US politics, both policies, party issues and the nuts and bolts of campaigns. I was so impressed by this book and couldn't put it down. It was my best read this summer by far."
"I loved both of the MCs.  They both were smart and smart-mouthed.  Alex could be serious, but Henry, of course, was serious a LOT.  It really did feel as though he had no say in his life.  (Until he did.)  Their email exchanges were precious and sweet and funny.  Alex's bisexual awakening seemed a bit lame, given how smart he is.  But then again, I'm not a bisexual person needing to figure that stuff out.....or am I?  nvmThere are some decent surprises in this one, which I delighted in.  There is also some political stuff, but not a lot.  I would love it if there is a sequel to this story!"
"I don't know if I can rave enough about this hot, sexy, beautiful book that is Romance Writing #Goals.Audio narration is excellent!! The sample clip does NOT do it justice. I was not sold after hearing the sample so I got it from the library and when I finished I immediately purchased the Kindle+audio because I felt like I needed to highlight everything. I'm especially impressed with the way the voice actor does the American and British accents, both very well.Let's just start with how fun it is to read a book in 2020 where the president is someone other than like who the president is. This is the alternate reality we needed right now!!!!There are so many things that make the romance in this book so compelling.Delicate passage of time. Tiny details that make you feel like you are there and it's so wonderful. There's quite a bit of male/male sex, and it's written in a way that's just...breathtaking. I've read a lot of MM scenes and these are just...the epitome, okay? Emotionally driven scenes that manage to tell you exactly what's happening without giving overly graphic details and just makes your heart pound.The boys are so precious. The snark is amazing. Masterful character arcs. Epic bisexual visibility! I had a bit of an intuition for it so I did kind of see the plot twists coming but it didn't bother me it was kind of like haha I knew it. I am not even going to wait a single breath I am reading this again. 5 gold stars. I am besotted."
"First time reading this author author's work and have to say it will not be my last! This story made me stop to think about all the things that I have taken for granted, like knowing who you are, what you stand for and against.  Knowing in your heart ❤ that love is just love, we have no say in who touches your inter would and heart, it just is! Kudos to this story, absolutely loved it from beginning to end!"
"I know there's still a bit over a week left in December and plenty of books left to read, but I'm just going to go ahead and say this now, this is for sure, 100%, my favorite book I read this month. I mean, nothing can compare with my beautiful sunshine, Alex Claremont-Diaz and the sweetheart prince that is actual Prince Henry.This book sparked so much joy in my life. It was hopeful and uplifting and I could not stop smiling while reading it, except when I was crying. There were definitely some tears involved. But, sometimes, even through the tears, I was crying.Red, White & Royal Blue might be the absolute most hyped book in the romance world this year and honestly, it deserves every single tiny bit of that hype and praise."
"“But the truth is, also, simply this: love is indomitable.”This is the book of 2019 that owns my heart and soul and my entire being. I have never felt so loved and represented in anything I’ve ever read and I cannot express how beautiful this book is.If you haven’t seen this pretty much everywhere then I’m guessing you do live under a rock. This has been taking the book community by storm and I haven’t seen one person dislike this masterpiece. I received an e-Arc of this novel a couple of months ago and read this at the beginning of February but just haven’t been able to feel like I could put my thoughts into words, or even a decent review. So really this is going to be different than my normal review format because I just want to gush and explain what this story is about.Red, White and Royal Blue revolves around a biracial/bisexual Mexican White Boy by the name of Alex. He is the First Son after his mother became President of the United States instead of … Trump. The love interest in this story is a gay man who is the Prince of Wales, sir Henry. I love both of these boys with my whole heart and they deserve the world.Alex Claremont-Diaz, the First Son, is amazingly hilarious. His life he’s never questioned his sexuality or who he is too much because he feels like he’s always had a duty to his mom and his family. But when he gets to know Prince Henry a little better, he starts to realize he needs to focus on himself a lot more. It’s tough on him as his parents are split up and a ton of responsibility is on his shoulders, being the First Son and all that. But his sister June and best friend Nora are always by his side and I love this family so freaking much.Now, there is a lot of politics in this book. I have never been one to be involved in politics until about maybe about a year ago, so reading a book that features heavily on the LGBTQ+ community as well as our countries issues, is phenomenal. Casey McQuiston created a masterpiece when it comes to writing and storytelling, and just getting across that things in our country need to change but at the same time giving us a fantastic love story.Alex and Henry’s love story is super cute and I loved every second of it. There wasn’t a time when they were together that I wasn’t dying inside cause I knew they were going to make me love them even more. This is uhm, a little more on the sexy side of reads as it is a New Adult novel but a lot of the scenes faded to black or just weren’t explicit at all. And overall their character growth and love growth is to die for.But now for the Gush.Reading this was just like being hugged tightly for hours on end while laughing and crying. As I’ve said already I’ve never felt more represented and that is because Alex is a Mexican Man who is half white and half gay. I didn’t know going into this that the main character is Mexican or bisexual so being able to read this and just find these things out made me feel so loved and accepted. Having someone who is exactly like me made me feel heard and loved and ya boi is CRYING right now, if you could see me, you’d probably laugh. Anyways though, as someone who has never felt good enough about myself and as I’ve always doubted myself, this is a breath of fresh air and a book that I will forever hold close to my heart.Growing up Mexican and White has always been an internal issue with myself, I’ve never identified with one side more than the other. It’s always funny because people don’t want to let you be both, you have to chose sides so for the longest time it was I’ve always been gay and I’ve always been Mexican. It didn’t become until recently when I’ve surrounded myself with better people that I’ve realized I don’t have to conform to one box, I’ve never been a full gay and I’ve never been a full Mexicano, HELL I can barely speak a couple words in Spanish. And being able to be inside of Alex’s head and see how he deals with his life really just made me feel secure in myself. I can’t really even think of anything else to say besides thank you Casey, this is the book I’ve been waiting for.I know this book touched a lot of souls, especially us Queer Biracials And I know it touched Texans and LGBTQ+ members and just pretty much everyone who has read it. But in good meme fashion, I’m just going to end this by saying that Casey McQuiston did THAT and created one of the best novels of all time. This does drop on May 14th so make sure to preorder your copies soon, this is definitely worth the read.Hope this wasn't too into Me but I really recommend this and I love you all!~ Sol"
"I've always been a bit of a sucker for those secret relationship with a prince romcoms, and making it queer just makes it so much better.  Alex and Henry's relationship is so genuine and their emails and texts really help show their developing feelings that can be so tricky to do with dialogue.To counter the ""too much politics"" criticism, you can't really avoid the political landscape when the two leads are the First Son and Prince of England.  But the details aren't really about the politics--it's about Alex deciding who he wants to be and how he can achieve his goals.  It has more of a coming-of-age feel than political thriller."
"Summary: What if the First Son of America and the Prince of Wales were involved in Enemies to Lovers AU?TWs/Inappropriates: There are a few 18+ scenes (nothing too raunchy and all of age), mentions of drug abuse, divorce, parent death, and constant cursing throughout the book.Positive Thoughts: I finished this book yesterday, and I absolutely don't know what to do now. I reviewed a book before with a very similar starting sentence, but this one I mean it so much more. It was definitely sad to finish reading that book, but finishing Red, White, and Royal Blue made me sit on the boat I was on for five minutes, asking myself, ""Oh, god, what do I read now?"" It made me feel so many emotions throughout the book: sadness, happiness, funny, wholesomeness, shock, anger, etc. Although I found it very difficult to read through the first few pages—that's mainly because I had just finished a book I really enjoyed and didn't have the energy to start a new one—, once Prince Henry was introduced, it got incredibly interesting, and the story just kept on getting more and more interesting and entertaining. I have rarely laughed from reading a YA book, but Red, White, and Royal Blue definitely had me chuckling at some scenes, which is very unusual. I also found this book to be relatable because one of the chapters (Chapter 5 to be exact) was about one of the characters discovering their sexuality. Also, throughout the books, some characters have personal traumas/issues, and the author does a wonderful job of solving them in the book. To me, it did not seem like she writes about the problems once or twice and solves it in a flash. Instead, she writes about them throughout the book, never forgetting that they exist and bringing them back, necessary or not.Negative Thoughts: Honestly, I cannot think of anything bad to say about this book on its own. The only issue I had with the book is how long each chapter was. If you buy the paperback on Amazon, each chapter is roughly 30-40 pages, give or take a few pages. When I read, I like to finish one chapter before deciding if I wanna stop for the meanwhile. Because I have the attention span of my pug plushy, it was a little difficult to read so much in one day. I also wanted to keep on reading more, so I roughly read one hundred pages per day, which is so much more than what I usually do, especially because I have school work and all. Despite me saying the chapter pages were a bit of a bother, don't let that stop you from reading this book because the chapters are rather fast reads; this issue was more of a personal problem than anything.Final Thoughts: Don't let my one, personal problem with the novel stop you from reading this book because this book was absolutely phenomenal and, honestly, a cultural rest. This book has so much praise in my heart, and this will be my comfort book anytime I feel sad and lonely, haha! I even bookmarked all my favorite moments, and I have ten bookmarks at least (as you may be able to see in the pictures). I also read the acknowledgments at the end of the book, which is something I do not do at all, and I almost cried at her words. This book was absolutely a pleasure from beginning to end, and the next book I will read has a high pedestal to reach. The author is also going to release another book in June 2021, and I cannot wait for when it comes out; it's a WLW book, for anyone who's curious! I highly recommend this to readers part of the LGBTQ+ community, readers figuring out their sexuality, readers who are BIG fans of Enemies to Lovers AU, and/or readers who absolutely love both wholesome loving and sexy loving!The Product and Delivery: The book is pretty sturdy, and the spine didn't have wrinkles/""break"" when reading all 432 pages! The cover has a nice velvet touch, which I really enjoyed. The pages are pretty strong too, and you can feel the printed words faintly when putting your fingers on it. For some odd reason, there were difficulties delivering my package. It was originally scheduled to arrive on Sunday but arrived on Monday instead due to ""problems finding address"", even though my address was perfectly fine. I wasn't too mad since it was late by one day, but I was disappointed to not see it come in on Sunday because I was really looking forward to reading this book."
"I loved this book so much that I read the whole thing in less than 24 hours, and when I wasn't reading it, I could not stop thinking about picking it back up again. It is the perfect concoction of all things that I love to read -- star-crossed love, secret relationship, snarky and hilarious queers, a beautifully developed cast of characters, enemies-to-friends-to-lovers -- but it was somehow put together 110% better than I could have ever imagined, in ways that surprised and delighted the hell out of me.This is straight-up one of the most romantic books I've ever read. It's entirely from Alex's point of view, and you can practically feel the tenderness in the narration coming off the page. There are excerpts of emails (of course there are emails) and text messages, and these are some of my favorite bits, since they show the all-consuming transatlantic longing that anyone who's ever been in a long-distance relationship can relate to.What surprised me about this book is how therapeutic it was for me to read. Reading books with queer characters (and queer romance especially) is always a little therapeutic to me to begin with, since good books with LGBTQ characters are so scarce. But in the world of this book, the 2016 election never happened. Trump is never even mentioned in this book. Instead what we get is an escapist-alternate-reality, almost, of a world so much like our own, but better, and in which bad people face consequences for their actions. I didn't know I needed this narrative, but I did.I laughed, I cried, and I enjoyed every word of this book. A history-maker for sure."
"gay romance novels I've ever read.  Those who have read it, too, know that the dialogue is hysterical, immensely clever, soft and touching, loving and lustful.  What a story!  The characters very believable, the complications and interferences to and in their relationship all too real, but the developing strength of their loving one another doed in fact win out in a myriad of ways.  My one criticism - and a minor one at that - is that the ending seems all too happy and perfect.  Because of all that they went through in this awesome book, I thought the ending could be a bit more of a ""complicated"" resolution, a compromise, to the obstacles they face.  No wonder this made it to be a New York Times Bestseller list.  I plan to re-read it in a few months."
"Red, White, & Royal Blue follows Alex Claremont-Diaz as he grapples with his future. As the son of the first female president of the United States, his personal life is high profile, and when an altercation with Henry, Prince of Wales, causes an international incident, Alex and Henry must convince the world that they are best friends. Little does Alex know that this will become harder and harder as their friendship turns from fake, to real, to a love story for the ages..In the acknowledgments of this book McQuiston explains that when she began writing this book in 2016 it was intended to be a “tongue and cheek parallel universe story”. But as we know all too well, November 2016 didn’t pan out that way. There are moments of this book that serve as a painful reminder of that fact. I appreciate that what could have been a very silly light-hearted contemporary, actually is so much more..Alex and Henry have a genuine connection and watching their love and passion unfold is heartwarming, heartbreaking, and also blush-worthy. I appreciated how deftly McQuiston handled the portrayal of a couple learning about each other and themselves as their relationship grows. The way Henry and Alex talk to each other felt so genuine. I laughed out loud so many times my husband stopped asking what was so funny, because the answer was inevitably always “THIS BOOK!”.I was also happy to see that the coming out aspect of this book was not handled in a cliche manner. McQuiston explores the many ways that telling your family you’re queer can go and I really appreciated how she put a lens to the layers of coming out..I’m really happy that all the bookstagram hype made me read this one. And I get why it is loved by many. I could absolutely see myself re-reading this one."
"I have never read a book of this kind before. I don't mean of the LGBTQ kind.  I read Autoboyography by Christina Lauren and Simon vs the Homosapian Agenda by Becky Albertalli, loved them both. No I mean a story this important to read because its content includes just how important voting is for the marginalized to make themselves heard. The relationships in this book were nothing short of beautiful. The prose and writing was so fantastic I couldn't put the book down. The characters were real and believable and Prince Henry is my crush. But this book has a powerful statement to make and that is simply to vote. Be the change you want to see in the world. Romance, witty dialogue, family, politics, change... All of it is found within these pages. Nothing is held back, and none of it was achieved with an easy resolution. I love an author than can write a book that can evoke emotional reactions, but even more so, that can create a new dialogue and change a mindset and perhaps give readers an alternative outlook on their view of the world. It is my opinion that this author achieved that and more."
"Aside from the fact that the pages are filled with sophomoric ""written on the bathroom"" dialog , the storyline takes forever to get off the ground. The characters appear superficial including the POTUS. This is one of very few books I could not finish. It just wasn't going anywhere!. Perhaps my expectations were too high. I was anticipating a story about two young men, due to their place in influential families, who were conflicted when they found themselves sexually attracted to each other. What I got was a very shallow, immature First Son, and a Prince whose character development never gets past a basic first stage. The novel was poorly constructed. To not be 100% negative (pun noted) The cover was well done."
"I saw a couple reviews of the book (I tend to look at the lowest reviews first) that said the book was more of a look into the campaign trail than a love story. But I must say, I love “The West Wing” and I love books with a lot of heart. And I absolutely enjoyed reading every minute of this book. It has a lot of campaigning information, but never at the expense of the narrative.I love how McQuiston provides vivid descriptions to aide the reader in imagining what is happening and it really pops off the page.I found a really engaging connection to the characters. So much so that I found myself reading this book on the kindle app on my phone so I could read it on my bus commute to work. Casey McQuiston delivered a fun, engaging read that I can only hope as an amateur screenwriter, becomes a movie or mini-series."
"I didn’t really know what to expect of this book.  I ended up really enjoying it and found it emotionally engaging.  You cannot help but root for Alex and feel like you’re right there with him as he struggles through his emotional and sexual growth.  My only hesitation was some of the sexual scenes were a bit graphic and detailed for me taste.  That’s just me, not a big fan of reading explicit details.  I skipped over much of it just as I do in a Stone Barrington book.  These did not detract from the story and did highlight the rawness of the relationship.  I’m glad I gave this book a go"
"This story is so beautiful I will read it again in the future.  It would be wonderful if that future carried the possibility of this story becoming true.  Love is love and there is so much in this story that speaks to that truth.  Just as mentioned in the story there are people in this world who compliment us, who make us whole.  It should not matter if that person is of the same gender as you or if their position in life is different than yours.  This story breaks through so many barriers and presents a true love story where the two people who compliment each other meet and create perfect love.  PS the story continued would be just fine. :-)"
"I enjoyed this book more than I thought I would. Gay romances aren't usually my preferred genre, but the reviews of this book made it seem like a must read. I'm not sure I'd call it a must read, but I'm glad I read it nonetheless. The plot was something you'd expect in a YA novel, but the language was very adult, definitely R rated. It was this imbalance that I just couldn't get past. Some parts of the book were overly cheesy and other parts tried to be more serious, but overall the tone fell somewhere in the middle. It was like reading a gay Hallmark made for TV movie, with f-bombs thrown in here and there. I would recommend this book for anyone who wants an easy read, and doesn't expect much more."
"“Alex sits, trying for a long moment to absorb it, and says, “I’ve never … I haven’t been through anything like that,” he says, voice rough. “But I’ve always felt it, in him. There’s this side of him that’s … unknowable.” He takes a breath. “But the thing is, jumping off cliffs is kinda my thing. That’s the choice. I love him, with all that, because of all that. On purpose. I love him on purpose.”This book was absolutely incredible! This book made me happy, sad, and angry (in a good way). This book made me blush during certain scenes 🥴This book made me feel INCLUDED.I will say that the beginning was kind of hard to get through until the first family was in England, and there were definitely some over the top cheesy moments, but it all worked together to form an amazing coming of age love story. I hope this book helps people that haven’t come out to their friends and family yet."
"Honesty ahead:This has a lot of politics in it. So if you’re not up and current affairs, you best buckle up. This is also a fun way to introduce younger readers to some political themes that sadly do NOT get properly addressed in most lit.If you are starved for MM novels, just stop reading and buy. This one is for you. In fact if you read MM fanfics, stop now and buy. This is for you too. If you love love stories and you love slow burns—this is for you too. Scroll back up, add to cart, and check out. Now.I wish I could write a novel about how needed a book like this is. It’s not just about a story about two boys falling, it’s about two boys dealing with their own sexuality, the political paths and what that means to a young person, what place government decisions have on an individual, international significance, communication, family accountability, anxiety and how that plays on our decision making and how others see us, it covers so much and it’s just very well rounded and full.This is not a debut novel. This doesn’t feel like a debut novel. This is an author with a voice. But this is also an author who gives voices to the characters. Honestly, I want to live in this author’s world. I set up notifications because I cannot wait for the next book Casey puts out!Plus lets be real, the smut is so sweet too!"
"This book is not one I would normally grab to read.  However so many in my book club loved it I thought I would give it a shot and boy I am glad I did.  The plot was unique and Alex and Henry, the main characters are perfect for each other!  The author did well in rounding out each character to give the book a diverse view!Their one will keep you involved and roll through the emotions!  I found myself pulling for each character, frustrated, and laughing!  A fun read that will keep you guessing.  In such a political time  this fun loving bit of politics was welcomed!"
"Doesn't matter if you're gay, straight, bi, etc. This is a great book! I started this book at 6 and never put it down. I was on an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish. I loved Alex and Henry right from the start. I wish the author would continue their story. The other characters were okay but Alex and Henry are the best ones in the whole book. I was upset when I ran out of pages to read. I really wish the author keeps going and gives us their wedding. An awesome book! Regardless of sexual orientation/preference, please give it a try. It became my new favorite book."
"I hesitated to read this book for a long time because of the hype. I mean come on. Oprah, Vogue, and other big name magazines reviewed this? I feel like most of those blogs haven’t read a m/m romance before, ‘cause none of the tropes in this novel are anything new. Thousands of authors write similar stories that are just as good if not better than this book.However, this story has the advantage of being highly relevant and well-written. It came out at just the right time, in times of political corruption and turbulence. It’s just the medicine myself and many others who are disenfranchised with the hatred and vitriol of 2016-2020 needed.Otherwise, it would be a story like any other. Packed with popular, fanfic tropes that I enjoy. Fake-relationship, enemies to lovers, friends with benefits, forbidden love. I can understand the vast appeal. I was underwhelmed by the enemies to lovers aspect, as I felt the relations between the lead characters progressed too quickly, with no real reason for them to be at odds in the first place. But I enjoyed the love letters and their passionate affair. As for the sex scenes I honestly feel like some of the reviewers calling this book “hot” haven’t read hardcore sex scenes before?? The sex scenes were well done but more seductive and hinted at than what I expected based on reviews. That’s not an issue for me at all, just thought it was funny.The characters of Henry and Alex were lovable and relatable, their relationship felt very real and I was rooting for them. The other characters aside from Alex’s mom, June, and Rafa felt a bit meh to me. I couldn’t distinguish them from one another.I enjoyed the story and the ending made me. Some parts of the story made me roll my eyes at the childish antics of the characters, at times cringe-inducing dialogue, and I had to remind myself this was a rom-com during the karaoke scene because it was such a silly, crack-fic moment.I really enjoyed this book. It gave me serious Call Me By Your Name vibes when it comes to prose. Though like that novel, I also felt like the author was trying to prove how sophisticated they were by referencing classic literature I’ve no interest in reading lol. And yet these super sophisticated well-educated characters are childish enough to use poop emojis and reference memes. Eehhhh. I would have loved the book so much more if it had a little more dignity.Even if I don’t understand why this book in particular is so popular when there are others that have told this story twice over and with more nuance. Still, It’s a heartfelt, comforting story with a sweet, uplifting message. I can’t wait to see the movie."
"This is one of those books that makes you feel good pretty much the entire time you're reading it. I literally threw this book across the room once because it was just that adorable. Even the ""bad"" stuff that happens is so cushioned by all the love and happiness infused in it, those parts won't hurt your heart. it's a super-romance. **While it reads like a YA novel, it does have a good bit of sex in it; the scenes are tastefully (and beautifully) written, but I've encountered a couple of younger readers who were surprised and disturbed by that aspect, so I think it's important to mention."
"I initially resisted buying this book because I balk at paying $10 to take a chance on an unknown author. But boredom and the lack of anything else jumping out at me had me saying 'why not?'Same sex romances don't bother me but I never really found one so well written (hello, fanfic!) This one was great. Really believable characters and situations. On paper, Alex and Henry shouldn't work but they just click here. The secondary characters were equally as engaging. I've gone back and re-read the ending several times and I cry every time Alex breaks down, so worried about Henry.Well worth the money!"
"This book just makes me happy. It made me feel hopeful. In the midst of the political mess we find ourselves in today, it’s a wonderful thing to read the opposite of a dystopian novel. A novel where good and right prevails and the trumpian Richards is defeated soundly, despite everything.I loved Alex and Henry’s relationship so much. I loved the relationship with their siblings (okay, not Philip, but maybe he’ll come around eventually). The close-knit staff were so great. And Rafael Luna was so good—I knew he was up to _something_.It’s a wonderful book about family, and what it really means to be a family. To be supported and loved regardless of who you are—to be loved because of who you are.Highly recommended."
"Honestly, the book overall isn’t that bad. It’s not great but it isn’t bad. I just... usually, I can get through books in a couple days to a week but this book in particular was really painful to read. It just felt so slow.The plot didn’t feel like it was developing very much, the characters were dumb and/or irritating, and it kind of felt like they [Casey McQuiston] was just shoving the (really, really biased) politics in my face. It was all really dumb and a lot of it felt like it was developed from media propaganda, in my opinion.The romance itself wasn’t too bad. The emails were very interesting — modern take on books that I definitely enjoyed — and I probably would’ve given this a better review if there had been more of that.Overall, the books really wasn’t that bad and it might be more to the tastes of others but I just can’t, for the life of me, bring myself to like the book. It was really slow, the characters felt two dimensional, and it was just difficult to keep reading."
"Just finally finished this book and wow...I'm fighting back tears. This was the romance I needed to read going into 2021 and everything going on. Seeing two people from completely different works fight against the odds for each other in a way like this was amazing start to finish. The light touches of political drama just helped bring everything together. It's a book about the FSOTUS and the Prince of England, you have to touch on politics to make it work. And the author did a damn good job with it. Thank you for this book. It really is a beacon of hope."
"I had no idea how much I needed this novel until I reader. Snarky, hilarious (seriously, don’t read it if you have a respiratory illness, it caused no fewer than 15 coughing fits!), heartwarming, hopeful, absolutely brimming with all the right kinds of love. Not just the beautiful love between Alex and Henry. The love between Alex and June and Nora. The love between Henry and Bea.  The love between Alex and Ellen. The love between Henry and Catherine. The love of a world ready to love each other a little more and a little better. Gods, I want to live in this 2020!!"
"This book was breathtaking. Not only was it a fun and interesting read, but it made an alternate universe to escape  to in these times when politics are at such a divide. The way that accurate lgbtq+ history was discussed in the book was so interesting and eye opening. Perhaps the greatest part of this book was to see a gay couple get a happy ending despite all of their obstacles. So many times while reading this book, I was scared that Henry and Alex were going to be torn apart by the world but instead, the world brought them together.  The moment when Texas turned blue is when I became emotional because it gave me hope, living in the south, that America is not lost, and that the country I used to love as a child is not gone.There are many people that are going to try to stay hateful and ignorant in this world, but this book helped me see that for those who are hateful, there are twice as many who want the best for the world. Tremendous applause to the author, and everyone who worked on this book. Red White and Royal Blue will be a part of me forever.❤️❤️"
"More thoughts, recs, and other reviews on my blog: www.thedanielhurst.wordpress.com/Please, just give me a copy of Red, White & Royal Blue, put me in a white room with padded walls, and leave me alone. I joke! Sort of. But I really did enjoy living in Casey McQuiston's version of reality. Red, White & Royal Blue is set in 2020, but the world looks slightly different than ours does. The First Family of the U.S. and other politicians are fictional, the Royal Family of England is fictional, and there's no coronavirus. But everything else is more or less the same as our world. Not to get too political, but I really, really wish the First Family were real.This book was a joy from start to finish. I loved how the love story is set against the backdrop of President Claremont's re-election campaign. The story has some nice themes, as well. Both of the leading characters' journeys have to do with the tension between sticking to the prescribed path and following their hearts' true desires. I don't want to go into more detail than that so as to avoid spoilers, but I thought the character arcs were believable and resonant.Though it looks like a typical romcom on the surface, this book has so much more depth. It's thoughtful and even educational. I thoroughly enjoyed all the historical references and getting a peek into the inner workings of government...at least according to the author's imagination. I didn't fact-check the accuracy! From start to finish, I was fully invested in these characters, their hilarity, their drama, and this fantasy version of 2020 with President Claremont in the Oval Office.A word on the content: I've seen this book marketed alongside YA novels. I think this would technically be classified as New Adult, as the main characters are in their early 20's. But I only mention it, because there are a few steamy scenes. If that's not your jam, you might want to skip this one. But honestly, I think it's worth whatever discomfort you might feel. Let me know if you want more details.I will also mention that if you identify as Conservative or Republican, you might not love the content of this story. But I think that's all the more reason to read it! You might not agree with the politics of the characters, but they're so human. You might identify with them more than you think. Just remember, even if you don't like Democratic/liberal politicians, this book is written by a citizen. It might be an idealized version of politicians, but it will give you a glimpse into the hearts of America's liberals."
"What an amazing read; it captures social issues around sexuality rather perfectly. The taboo love story between the First Son of the U.S. (another great statement that he’s biracial, Mexican of all) and the Prince of Wales, well, I don’t want to give too much away if you haven’t read it yet. But, the chemistry, the love e-mails, the hilarious dialogue (Zahra cracked me up a bunch), historical references, amidst modern day politics, everything that supports this novel — genius. Pure genius.P.S. I am not a fan of long chapters, and that’s what this book had, but I got over it after three chapters in."
"My 94 year old mother recommended this book to me.  So I was anticipating a fun, witty and heartwarming story.  But instead found this book to be tough to get through with little connection to any of the characters. The constant swearing and binge drinking is way overdone.  It just came off as how a pre-21 year old would fantasize about what they would do when they get ""older"".  Sorry Mom - you are usually right about books just not this one."
"I finished reading Red, White, and Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston approximately 10 seconds before deciding to write a quick review. I know I'll have to update this after I've had a chance to find all the words, but for now, I'll just say that no other book has touched me, captivated me, or made me smile so wide or audibly root for it's characters in a long, long time. If ever, really. Alex and Henry are written with such depth, care, honesty, and love. They charmed the pants off me, which I was completely unprepared for, and I am practically giddy for how much joy this book has brought me.This story is such a wonderful what if, an alternate reality that depicts a different outcome of the 2016 election. It isn't fantasy, really. It's optimism. It's hope. McQuiston's kind of optimism comes out through strength in the presence of hate and love overflowing from every page. It's realistic, honest, and a hopeful portrayal of how we aren't really that far off from change. And her writing! Gah! I think I highlighted more sentences in this one than I ever have before. Casey McQuiston, you are ridiculously good.Read this. Believe in a better future. Believe in a love story that has spread beyond the pages of this book. Claremont 2020 (and Claremont-Diaz in... 2044?)"
"I loved this book - it's easy to read, absolutely outrageous, and it feels like a really fresh take on the typical rom-com novel. My only hangup with it (and this is a weird one) is how out of place all of the profanity felt. For context, I have the mouth of a sailor - I LOVE profanity. But it felt like in some places the author went, ""hmmm how many times can I curse in this paragraph?"" and it felt super unrealistic, not how people talk at all. I know that's an odd critique but it took me out of the moment a few times with just how overkill it was."
"I enjoyed this book. It wasn't overly complicated or dramatic. There was an appropriate amount of tension/angst without too much tragedy or drama. The characters were likable, with several scenes that had me smiling and laughing. I enjoyed the romance development between the characters, and was genuinely interested in several of the peripheral friends/family as well. The best way I can describe it is fluffy and sweet, which is exactly what I look for in a book like this. I'm very impressed an am eager to see what this author has in store for their next book."
"This was adorable, feel-good, hilarious, and a great Pride month read! I loved it so much, and I really wish I lived in this alternate universe and we could just erase the real 2016 election. I loved all the characters so much. Alex was so real and fun and I loved his journey to self discovery. And I'm a sucker for bi representation in any book! Henry was so sweet and loveable. I want to be friends with Pez and Nora and Bea and June. I want to be part of this dysfunctional and wonderful little friend family. Also the romance was great. I was rooting for them so hard. If you want to laugh a lot while being completely drawn into the romance, check this book out. It's just the right amount of fluff to make you feel good, while still having the substance and story to make it a good read."
"So many things I loved about this book. The characters first and foremost. Real and flawed, but the kind of people that you want people to be. The lovely story line, and given all of the variables, you really don't know quite the direction it is going to go. The way author portrays the negatives about the world we live in and the positive ways it could go. Sometimes in life you think you know something and see something one way, and then you read a novel like this. And you see something in a whole new light and perspective. This book was a delight to read and quite thought provoking."
"Enemies to Lovers???? Or just really repressed crushes by two queer men?I could not have read this book at a better time in my life. It is June, Pride month and I was horrendously stressed out from life. This book was the happy ending and the most wholesome fluff that I needed to read. There were times where I caught myself grinning while reading, I even got a little teary-eyed when I finished it. Alex and Henry's love story was an amazing one to follow, their witty banter made me laugh and their romantic words made me swoon. I particular loved Henry's character growth, which I won't go in-depth due to spoilers, but he really decided what was important versus what the world was telling him.I consider this a light read, something that is easy and heart-warming to read. While I did enjoy it a lot there are some aspects of it that I didn't enjoy that much. I feel like this book was written to be read by 14 years old, which is fine... if your 14. Most of the book is emails or text messages, which was kind of cool at first, but that it started to feel like a cop-out. That being said, it is true to how modern romances work. A majority of them bond over messaging and online stuff; it was a little jarring to read the messages.Overall, this book was good and heart-warming. It really lifted my mood to read, but just be prepared it reads like a young teen book. I do wish there was a little more at the end of the book, it felt like it stopped suddenly and I was left wanting to know what happened and how the rest of the story with Alex and Henry was going to go."
"I have never written a book review. I read a book, but I don't expect my experience with it to shape another person's decisions to read it. That being said: please read this book.I laughed, I cried, I screamed... everything. This book is everything. At the outset it seems like your average romcom book. And it is. Trust me. It checks all the fanfic boxes: all the enemies-to-friends-to-lovers, prince-charming, fake-relationship-AU boxes that really get me going, ya know? But its also real. Like painfully, beautifully, wonderfully real.A lot of people seem to be talking about how important this is in our current politics (especially with 2020 practically here). And I concede: it does scratch that itch for me. The what-ifs and should-have-beens of the 2016 election and the years to follow. But I think what struck me the most about this book (besides the absolute beauty in which it was written) was how grounded it was. Yes, it was a form of escapism, but it never felt that way while I was reading it. Sure, my heart did strange things every time the two of them talked to each other, but it was never just about them. It never is. The story, in my personal (and probably biased) opinion, perfectly balanced the romance, the politics, the real life crap Zillennials go through, queer history, family, mental health, coming out, accepting your queer identity, AND just plain enjoying the life you have. Now that is a feat...This book made my poor queer heart want to jump out of my chest, do a little dance, and run off to find its own prince (or princess). It was not just the finding of a great LGBT+ novel that did it for me though. I felt McQuiston captured the queer narrative. All aspects of it. And instead of just shoving it all into one singular character (as I feel some novels, tv shows, and movies are wont to do), she spread the story. She never stretched a character so thin that they became a symbol of queer tragedy. They were real people. Every. Single. One. Of. Them. Some families are accepting and some are not. Some people have known their whole lives what it means to be queer, some require a momentous event, and other times, as Nora describes, ""I was in my junior year of high school, and I touched a boob. It wasn't very profound. Nobody's gonna write an Off-Broadway play about it.""The book took my breath away. I could not stop reading it. I started it today, I ended it today, and I will definitely be reading it again. I cannot wait to see what Casey McQuiston writes in the future. If it is even half as good as this book was, I'm sold."
"Alex is the first son-his Mom is the first female president and up for re-election. Alex has a heavy load of responsibility that comes with his life. Henry is second in line heir to the English throne and has tremendous pressure to live up to his legacy. An enemies to lovers romance with a lot of political stuff thrown in. This is a warm, low angst romance with fun secondary characters. President Mom is great.! I would have given it a complete 5 stars except the emphasis at the end is on the election rather than the romance. I would love to see another book about this couple."
"I batted around for awhile whether I would put 4 or 5 stars on this. I never get into romance driven books or LGBT stuff because even as a gay man, I don't always relate to the characters, or certain things feel tropey and over the top. I was pleasantly surprised by this book and its story.Positives: I really did enjoy this book. Alex and Henry's relationship build and emails left me wanting more.Some of the descriptions were very unique and different. Aka the guys that looked like he yelled at mice in his garden.Overall story was fun, and there were points I laughed (damn turkeys), some had me on the edge of my seat, and others feeling sad.Only 'gripes' I had: I think there were too many side characters to keep track off. The diversity was fun, and its never a bad thing, but at times it felt very forced. I think getting to know a few characters longer would have felt more genuine than a larger cast and trying to remember who was who (or what). Diversity is NOT a bad thing in a story, and I wish we had more in real life and in media. Again, I think getting to know fewer people better would have been nice, than the occasional this or that person that felt a bit forced.I would have loved to see more build of their friendship. Some of the scenes felt very rushed, and while the progression was expected, it was sudden. Again, I think some scenes could have been knocked out to focus on them.The politics in the book was fine from the White House side, but the moments with the Royal Family felt rushed and confusing, as did the end election results.I would have liked more focus on Henry's daily perspective too, and his life in the palace and the stuff with his mother to flesh out him as a man, and how his daily life looked with the hidden spurts of Alex.This sounds like a lot of criticism, but I mean it constructively. I knocked off the 5th star for these reasons and few other nitpicky ones. I did however, really enjoy the book. Ultimately that's what I want from a book.I'd recommend the book to people that want a fun, sappy, and emotional story that ends like a fairy tail.I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for more from this author."
"I picked this up…and then I finished it. McQuiston has a way with words that moves deftly from humor to pathos to romance throughout, without ever feeling formulaic. RWRB is sweet and charged at once, and raucously funny without ever feeling like a late 90s stand up routine.Everything in this book is so well cared-for and the relationship between Alex and Henry is, at parts, beautiful and MONUMENTALLY frustrating. The cast of supporting characters are amazingly diverse and refreshingly human. I can hardly pick a favorite of them all…everyone is incredibly delightful in one way or another.I wait, very impatiently, for McQuiston's next offer.(P.S. Certain characters in this book (Alex) are sometimes very stupid and you will love them for it.)"
"This book threw me at first, a sort of what might have been, likely should have been, but what was lost to greed, lies, and general hate. A strong intelligent women president, people not quite perfect but determined and caring, people in love with complex emotions and people with conviction, morals, and intellectual honesty live in this story. This story is essential in the trumptonian nightmare in which we currently reside. Read it with compassion and pleasure, and hope it reflects what might be reality soon."
"As a gay male, I wanted to throw this book full force out the window. Horrible fan fiction level stuff."
"So first let me say, I get the comment in another review that this is basically a liberal wet dream... it’s the story of the biracial son of the first female president falling in love with a British prince so... yeah. I don’t think that take should be a surprise. The politics in the story wasn’t too surprising either given the setting, though there was a lot of name dropping current political figures - Nate silver, Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, Anderson Cooper, etc. - that I found a little silly. The story is from Alex’s POV, but is told in an unusual third person present tense that was a little jarring for me and at times made it harder to connect with what was going on.Having said that, I really loved this book! I thought Alex and Henry and the supporting characters were both believable and adorable. The romance was absolutely fantastic, from the banter to the touching love letters to the plentiful intimate moments that were descriptive without quite crossing the line into X-rated. I loved every minute of Alex’s slow journey of self discovery.Yes, maybe the ending is predictable and the premise is unbelievable and the whole thing is a bit of a cathartic escape from our current Trumpian dystopia, but I honestly couldn’t care less because the beautiful love story gave me everything I was looking for and then some!"
"I talk about this book so much my predictive speech on my phone automatically suggests it. THAT’S HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS BOOK!This story is gushy and hilarious and heartwarming and thought provoking and ALL OF THE GOOD AND LIGHT THINGS AT ONCE!This was a book I needed to read. It restored some of the optimism and hope my soul had lost. This book made me laugh with my whole body, cry my eyes out, and my heart glow.If there’s any book you buy this year, THIS ONE! BUY THIS ONE!5 red, white, royal blue, and rainbow stars"
"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this book but after reading the first couple of chapters I had to know how it was going to end. I liked the unfolding of who Alex and Henry were and how they changed for the better not just for themselves but for the people who will have to deal with the same issues later. This is story about families traditional and non traditional and love. There is romantic love,  parental love friendship and a love for doing what is good and right for all. Narrow judgemental minds will balk and throw out  lame excuses to negatively judge this book but if you keep an open mind you might find something to cheer about Red, White and Royal Blue!"
"I apparently missed the hype about this book, and discovered it randomly through Amazon, I think. I downloaded a sample after seeing the reviews and was hooked! I love, love, LOVE this book!!! Laugh out loud funny at many points, and a completely sweet, earnest look at a young man discovering new and profound things about himself, surrounded by a cast of wonderful, diverse, interesting characters. Yes, there are a few unrealistic details here and there, but it didn’t diminish my enjoyment of the book in the slightest. I couldn’t put it down!"
"There's a valid reason why everyone is either #reading and/or raving about this book - it's fantastic! It's snarky, and sarcastic, and hilarious, and sweet, and adorable in so many ways. It's MCs are wonderfully opposites in so many ways but work so beautifully together.  I loved Alex, his struggles, the way he embraced his new reality and his determination to do things right. Henry is so incredibly steadfast and his first move was wonderfully inept but so heartfelt. The communication between the two starts out hilariously but then turns swoonworthy and the way the author winds historical love letters into this story is just lovely. 5/5 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"I so badly wanted to like this book. I love me a good queer romantic novel. But all this book is, is a fanfic that was way too long.As an aspiring author myself, you’re taught that “if you have two characters who are endgame, you have to prolong the relationship with ups and downs” But this book really has none of that. They kiss like a quarter of the way through and then next time they see each other they’re already having some uh- well seggsy time. There’s like maybe 100 pages and then they’re already kissing and falling in love. The other 300 pages are just them emailing, politics, and them having seggsy time. That’s it. There is the plot line of the campaign I guess? But I knew the outcome and really didn’t need to read to the end to see it.Also, is the main character capable of being serious, like at all? I understand the humor, and honestly I appreciate it, but this is too much. You can have a character who’s love language is humor, but this is just over the top.I feel like this book could’ve been helped DRASTICALLY if the chapters were cut in half. There is no reason to have chapters that are 30-40 pages long when literally NOTHING is happening. Just people talking and insulting each other. I couldn’t stop checking the page number to see if I was finally through this chapter or not.One upside, The writing is actually good. Very descriptive and appealing. The author knows how to build a scene, and make you feel what’s happening.So if you can over look unnecessarily long chapters, lack of plot, and over the top characters, then go for it."
"This book was such a surprise! A friend recommended it to me and I was not disappointed. The writing just drew me in and I ended up reading this in one marathon session. I loved every bit of this book. Alex and Henry were perfect. Their friendship and relationship with each other was so hot and sweet and then the relationships between them and June, Luna, Bea, Pez, and even their parents and security details really made this book extra special. I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading more by this author."
"Not to be dramatic but I whole-heartedly believe this is the best book I’ve ever read in my entire life. I loved it so much. I can’t remember what about it initially piqued my interest but the blurb on the back sold me when I first looked into it. A young half-Mexican son of the first female president of the United States falls in love with the Prince of Wales in a enemies-to-friends-to-lovers fashion straight out of a fanfiction. I was like… damn, Casey McQuiston has my number? And it delivered. It is beyond good, the characters are good, and oh my God, that plot.This book made me laugh out loud more times than I can count and even made me cry more than once. One of those times was me bawling in a Sam’s Club parking lot while waiting for my girlfriend to return with toilet paper. People saw.I’m aiming to keep this spoiler free and short but for the sake of total transparency, if you do want to read this book you have to be prepared for some heavily implied but not totally explicit R rated scenes.I am looking forward to Casey’s next book - which I hear is about lesbians - and to following the rest of her career because her relatable writing style and well put together story have sold me for life. What an amazing debut novel!"
"The story of Alex and Henry's unexpected romance takes place in an alternate universe where Alex's mom won the 2016 Presidential election and is headed for a tough 2020 race.  I was delighted to spend time in the world that author Casey McQuiston has created, with generally likeable characters and a leading couple you certainly root for.  The occasional insertion of a name from our real world, such as Mitch McConnell, was unnecessary and distracting.  And, as this presents itself specifically as a bi romance, there were times when the dynamic felt a bit more boy-meets-girl than it should have; I wanted Alex to climb down from his high horse and show a bit more true vulnerability than he did.  All that said, the book is thoroughly enjoyable, and kudos to the author for a fine, light read with some unexpected edge to it."
"This book brings hope that we can see queer love stories and representation in literature beyond fan fiction. It perfectly captures what it's like to fall in love, discover your identity and confront all of it. Sometimes the stakes are impossibly high for the characters and I was worried it would end horribly but through my tears and the final chapters, I grew relieved that it didn't end in ""bury your gays"". Please give this book a chance. Give this author a chance. Trust me, you won't regret it."
"5-Stars for this book!  I purchased this book because it was voted best romance of 2019 by goodreads.com readers...and I often find my self disappointed in books that receive this much hype...but I was so pleased and loved this book!  It was both funny and touching and I loved reading it.  I will say that I generally prefer a little more ""zing"" in bedroom scenes, but I found the way their physical relationship developed with their emotional relationship was well-balanced.This book isn't perfect, but it is a refreshing and surprising read and I loved spending time with these characters.  I also purchased the audiobook and highly recommend it as well!"
"This book should have gotten 5 stars, but I couldn't bring myself to exaggerate my enjoyment of this novel like so many others. I was told, ""You're going to be obsessed with this book, it's gonna keep you up at night thinking about Alex and Henry's fate."" This is an unfortunate lie born of enthusiam delivered with good intentions, but a lie nonetheless. I enjoyed this book, even loved it in places, but I remain firm on my position that at no point was I obsessed, and I lost no sleep to it. Alex is a charmer and so, so good in this. His kind, hopeful demeanor makes it easy to see how Henry would fall head over heels so quickly for him, and Henry himself I found myself quickly and sharply identifying with as his depressive episodes and inability to stand up for himself mirror my own struggles. The family and friendships are depicted in wonderfully and terribly realistic detail, and I enjoyed reading about the side characters as much as the primary ones. I wish this was five stars, but it isn't. It is a sweet, honest, heartfelt exploration of making history with love, something we so often forget to do. I reccomend this book to romantics, to dreamers, to lovers, to the lost, and the searching, and the found. I salute you, Casey McQuiston, and look forward to experiences more of your work."
"Truly a wonderful read. I'm so glad I decided to buy it and read it. It's such a cute story, and the characters are so charming. Each character has their own charm and wit, including the side ones. And the main characters Alex and Henry develop as men so well over the course of the book. You can't help but love these two men and root for them. A refreshing take on a tale that's been done so many times before. It was about time a story about a boy and a prince falling in love happened!"
"I had heard good buzz about this, but avoided it for a long time thinking it would be too fluffy, too wealth-porny, too superficial a portrayal of LGBT people. I ended up being pleasantly surprised and very impressed with how smart and nuanced this book is about a variety of subjects: contemporary British and American politics, the invisibility of bisexuality in our culture (sometimes even to ourselves), compelling and complicated family dynamics, LGBT history, and more."
"This book wasn’t at all what I was expecting. I thought it would be some cutesy rom-com that would pull me out of a slump. It was much more like an anthem. It not only had two gay male protagonists but they had depth, and dreams.  I feel like a lot of mainstream books fall into stereotypes of what it’s like to be a POC &a part of the LGBTQ community. This novel was cute but it was also riveting. It wasn’t something to read in my spare time and never think about again. I feel like it was something that’s going to stick with me because it felt so real.A women president and her blended family. That right there was amazing but throw in the first kids and a royal prince who understand the fluidity of sexuality is what makes it different. This was way more than I thought it would be and I’m so happy I read it."
"I won't lie, I hesitated on buying this for quite a while due to the price. I don't have a large book budget each month and the price for a debut novel scared me. I found it on sale and snagged it and wish I hadn't waited and had paid full price.It's a cute romance, one that takes time to develop and grow into a romance.  No instalove or proof sudden acceptance by everyone.  It's also not all romance, you have comedy, you've got drama, and the political story running along with the romance is just as engaging and enthralling.  I'm recommend this to all my reader friends."
"The dialogue, plot, humor and characters are overall a bit childish, and the story drags for the first three quarters. I honestly can’t tell if this book is too short or too long. Even though much of the story focused on the growing relationship between Alex and Henry, their love still seemed shallow and unrealistic. In my opinion, it was lazy to justify Alex’s inexplicable shift from inexplicable hatred to inexplicable love by simply saying his feelings were the product of a repressed crush. The feel-good, perfect ending would have benefited greatly from additional adversity throughout the book. Again, I can’t decided if the novel is too short or too long, but I suspect that even 1000 pages wouldn’t result in a deeper story. Not for me. I may have enjoyed the book more of it was funny."
"Entertaining read with very likable characters. Not sure it’s worthy of Goodreads’ romantic novel of the year, but I did enjoy the story of a young man, who happens to be the son of the US president, who realizes he is bisexual and ultimately falls for a British prince. The storyline involves all the drama associated with their very high profile lives, the emotional turmoil of sexual identity and falling in love, and the political chaos of an election year."
"I did not think I’d enjoy this book as much as I did. I’ve been on a romance book bender this summer, devouring a new one each night. So when I got this book as saw the page count, I thought to myself, ‘no way can I do this in a day.’ But I did and it was one of the best books I’ve ever read.McQuiston tells such a good story of two complicated public figures. Some reviews didn’t like the politics of it all, but as someone who works in politics, it felt like enough to to hold the story together without getting into nitty gritty details. This complicated love story is one I’ve never read before, there’s nothing out there close to it, and that’s another reason why I love it so much.I’ve read plenty of LGBTQ+ books in college, but this was my first one that wasn’t selected on a syllabus. Aside from the obvious, this book felt real and very personable.I’ve recommended it so many times, I hope you’ll read it too."
"So sweet and cute! I loved this one ❤️ it's definitely a quick read and I absolutely adore all the characters! I love how easy the story was to read. And Henry and Alex were just too cute for words. Even towards the end, when things got complicated for them both, they still stayed strong and worked through the issues. I couldn't imagine being in that position and just saying forget it and im going to love who I love! Such a sweet and even inspiring story."
"I am going to start this by saying that I am a late 20 something bisexual Hispanic woman who was born and raised in Fort Bend County Texas. I was rec'ed this book by a WOC on TikTok because I follow her for her BLM queer, and feminist content. She read it and loved it and I read it an loved it. Reading this book I felt like it was for me. As stated above, I have alot in common with Alex Clarmont-Diaz. I also live in a world, were we did not elect a female Democrat with a mix raced, blended, family as the president in 2016 or even the female Democrat that was actually on the ballot, but someone....else. I cried when it happened. That being said, I needed this and not just because younger me needed this too. And putting all that aside, there is alot to related to in this book, even if you arent a bisexual Hispanic person from Texas, this is a beautiful story of love between two people. I hope people read it and I hope it helps them like it helped me. Here's to at least 3 more rereads!"
"A quick and easy to swallow love store that is like a pretty and hopeful alternate reality of 2016 and 2020. If only those years were as good as this book. I only give four stars because the jaded version of myself can’t let go of what happened in the actual 2016 and 2020 And how this story is just the opposite and it is fictional. Especially considering what the Crown did to Meghan Markle… not to be all “it’s just not realistic” but that’s what stifled my enjoyment of the novel as a whole, despite that being the purpose of the novel."
"I was already thinking that RWRB would be a good read just from the synopsis. What I wasn't expecting was to be so deeply engrossed in the story, in love with the characters, and dreaming of a world (especially an America) like the one presented in this book. The love between Alex and Henry is palpable, and something anyone of any gender would dream of. I literally cannot recommends this book enough. I can't wait to see what comes next for Casey McQuiston, because this book was so friggin' good!"
"It's been a while since I have read anything about politics or wealthy people that didn't make me want to scream, or think about the damages being done to our world.This story created a first family that should have followed the Obamas. The right successors to the imperfect-but-wonderful legacy they left behind. I could envision them meeting and the smiles and hugs that would have been exchanged.It also gave me a glimmer of hope, even if tainted by the reality of just how opposite the world ended up.And for the child in me, the young me that wanted his prince, this was the perfect book. It was just fantastical enough to make me feel hope and anxiety, but also real enough to keep me from having to 'make due' with an unrealistic fantasy.Reading this is fun. I want this to be a movie. We have The Crown and other films, and this doesn't even use the real current family. Make it happen."
"This quickly made its way to my top favorite books. I listened to it on Audible and knew I had to have a physical copy for my ""favorites"" shelf before I was even finished with it. I try to save audiobooks for my commute but I couldn't stop listening to this!The characters are people you would think would be hard to connect with because they have such high profile lives. But Casey made them so real and heartfelt that you can't help but to root for them. I'm a sucker for gay romance and Henry and Alex do not dissappoint! I want to know more about their lives together and am really hoping for a sequel. It'd be a great romcom film too! Hopefully Amazon moves forward with it!"
"This book is a triumph, and I already added it to my favorites list less than half way through. The rest of the book did not disappoint. It hit all the ""politically correct"" check boxes, which made me raise an eyebrow, wondering if it was trying to be ""too"" inclusive, but honestly, it never really felt forced to me. The book is so sweet and loving and awkward that I will praise it to my dying day. I gush with abandon. I finished it and immediately went to rain my love upon the author's social media and buy a Tshirt saying, ""History, Huh?"" (Which supports RAICES! :D!) All in all, I can't say enough about this lovable book and I can't wait to read it again."
"This is an enemies to Lover's read that is actually quite sweet, funny, and endearing. I loved the history facts and love notes intermixed in this well-written book. The spicy scenes are sweet and naughty, though discreetly written and at times short if you are looking for heavily detailed naughty scenes. The end is a little abrupt, I was kind of expecting one more chapter, but it's perfectly fine. Definitely an awesome heart lifting read with a guaranteed HEA."
"I love the book. The plot seems odd but the Writing was so alive that make imposible to put down. I love Henry and Alex, Thrilled about Alex going Charming and all the things one should expect from a Prince.I think this book is a essential LGBTIQ one, and they are the new dreaming couple for new romantic classics.You have the exact quantity of romance and sex that every romantic  book needs. It was a little long in eleccions issues but really  necessaryIf You enjoy ""Carry On"" and  ""Everything leads to you""  this your book"
"I read a lot of reviews of this book, I was hesitant to read it. Boy I’m glad I did. What a wonderful book that at times brought tears to my eyes. Heartwarming because there are good people in this world. From all over the spectrum, and thank goodness there are. We need positive books giving us positive vibes where there is bad but not as bad as we thought. We will get through the worst of times and we can make it the best of times.Read it, you will not be disappointed."
"Yo estaba insegura acerca de si leer o no este libro, la reseña llamaba mi atención pero el libro está sólo en inglés y eso hizo que decidiera no leerlo hasta que tal vez saliera en español. Pero luego vi un fabricante y me dije: OMG tengo que leerlo!! Lo compré inmediatamente en mi kindle y la primera noche me llegaron las 2 am y yo no podía parar de leer, ya quería saber que iba a pasar con Alex y Henrry, me encantó la forma como se desarrolló su relación y ellos como pareja son lo más bonito del mundo.Lo único que no me gustó tanto, fue tanta Política, aunque era obviamente un tema casi que obligatorio dadas las circunstancias, aunque también pienso que se me hicieron más pesadas esas partes ya que mi inglés es medio y me tocaba en ocasiones releer párrafos completos para poder entender, pero de todas formas disfruté mucho de esta historia."
"The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because the present tense was hard. I can’t remember the last time I read a book in present tense. Anyway, aside from feeling like I was reading a screenplay from time to time, I couldn’t put this book down. I started it in the wee hours of a Saturday night & finished Monday morning. It reminded me of Madame Secretary a bit. I loved the characters so much. Every. Single. One!!! Such a great story!!"
"i just devoured this book and I have so many emotions about it that I hope to craft in a succinct review once i can collect myself from the insane amount of feels and joy rn (also because I have to board a plane in 6 hours)But very quickly, I AM LITERALLY IN LOVE WITH THIS BOOK.I could not recommend it more. The characters, the story, the writing, the plot, the PACING (omg the pacing), the VOICE... I just I could go on forever (and I will very soon with an update).I have a feeling I’m going to be updating this review a few times in my lifetime because the only thing I want to do now that I’ve read this book is to read it again.I received an e-ARC of this novel from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review, and also bought a kindle version and a paperback copy as well (yes, I love this book that much, worth it all, zero regrets!)Lovers of Star Wars, Harry Potter, witty banter, amazing representation, Hamilton lovers, book nerds, and epic love stories that span continents, will ADORE this book."
"This book features realistic characters that are totally lovable. I find it can be hard to give your main character an “enemy” that people still want to love, but Alex and Henry are two characters you’ll be obsessed with the entire reading and long after. You’ll find yourself wondering what happens after the last page in all the character’s lives. And if you’re a LGBTQ+ member who wants to belong, who needs a spark of joy to remember happiness is obtainable; read this book. You might not be the First Son or a Prince of England and you might not fall in love with either, but you can find your prince or princess charming and this book is a welcomed reminder of that. Love is like water and it might have to work to get where it’s going but it will flow over, under, and seep through anything in its path to reach its destination. Happy Reading!!"
"This was truly delightful to read.I've read my fair share of ""I fell in love with a prince"" and ""I fell in love with the President's son"" books, but the combination of the two, and the way in which this narrative was told with such a new perspective, caught me from the first chapter.  I devoured it in a day!It was sexy and romantic, and had such a beatiful image of love and friendship and support. Also, (minor spoiler...) the narrative around the inner confusion and realization of a bisexual character was fantastic, and a pov I don't often find.It was lovely and quick-witted and had a great blend of heartfelt and eloquent moments mixed in with sometimes acerbic and raw banter, which made the relationship more real."
"I was going to give this book four stars or maybe less because of one thing the author got horribly wrong: every single royal title. The British royal family is very hard to get right, but the author got it SO wrong that it drove me crazy. And yes, I realize this is an AU, but it's obviously supposed to be as close to our reality as possible, so she really should have gotten it right.But the book is otherwise SO perfect in every way, and what drove me crazy would probably not matter to the majority of readers, so after some thought, I gave it the five stars that the writing deserves. This book is a delight."
"So, I loved parts of this book so much and on the other hand there were parts I struggled with. The politics was very heavy and there felt like a serious agenda was being pushed into this book. That bothered me somewhat. I adored the characters and I cheered them on and hoped so much they would not feel all these emotions and just have their happiness. They did, but it was a fight. So while this book was okay for me I wanted less in some areas and more in others."
"Ahhh, this book was marvelous! And romantic! And funny! Alex and Henry were amazing, nuanced, and so perfect for each other. Their banter was everything. Their emails were swoony. I loved the side characters and the world they lived in, which was just a little bit better than ours- enough to feel hopeful that we can one day make it a reality. The President's son and the prince of England falling in love is a story I've definitely wanted, and Casey McQuiston delivered! I even got a little teary-eyed at one point, which almost never happens! I cannot recommend this book enough. It will set your heart aflutter and linger long after the final page is turned.An ARC was provided by the publisher via NetGalley."
"Every once in a while, a book will come along that just makes you smile, makes you laugh, gives you all the feels and is just overall a great read. This is that book. I enjoyed Casey McQuinton's debut novel from start to finish and was sad when it was over. All of the characters are lovable and realistic and really draw you into the story of Alex and Henry's star-crossed, international love story. I also like a book that included accurate historical facts (especially about the White House), witty pop culture references and realistic representations of the current political climate in America right now. This book has a big heart that you can't help but fall in love with and I highly recommend it."
"History, huh?I can't even with this book.Red, white and royal blue is an achingly beautiful, heartfelt masterpiece.This was one of those books that I literally couldn't put down, and every chapter I read made me both elated as the story unfold and devastated that I was a chapter closer to the end of the book.This is definitely my pick for best 2019 debut novel.50 stars and a union Jack❣"
"Wow!  Blown away by this book. The evolution of the relationship between Alex and Henry and the love letters blew me away. I thought it was going to be a silly little romance novel but instead was sucked into a smart, thoughtful and uplifting story about being able to show your true self to the world. Boy do I wish Ellen Claremont had been our president the last 4 years instead of the lunatic we ended up with. History, huh?"
"I am a Royalist living in Australia and know very little about the Political scene in the United States but to me, this storyline seems to be entirely possible, with a few minor exceptions.  I revelled in the lengths the Prince and the FSOUS went to, so that they may be together.  When there is true love, nothing can stand in the way.  The whole story was so realistic in so many ways, so adorable and it had a happy ending.  Yippee."
"I do not know what I was expecting from this book but, whatever IT was, it didn’t deliver. No way could the children of the first, female POTUS and the prince of England get away with obnoxious, drunken behavior. I found the whole story line too far fetched. Also, every character was, extremely, annoying."
You know a book is great when you are fist pumping and crying after certain scenes. This got to me more than I expected. I loved every character but I must make mention in particular Zahra and Nora....oh my word those two were glorious!
"It is more than a romance. The broad cast of characters are well-defined and very real. The writing - particularly the email and text exchanges between the two leads - is excellent and quite varied; good dialogue as well. The plot is much more than a romance - political intrigue, family issues, etc. But I must admit I really enjoyed the love story. It made me smile often and occasionally laugh. Nicely done!"
"Wow. This book was everything I wanted it to be and more. It was so hilarious, quick paced, steamy, adorable and downright important. There were so many great points of conversation about LGBTQ+ rights and what it would look like if we had a female American president (yes please!). Overall, this is one of my new all time favorite contemporary stories that I cannot wait to revisit in the future and fall back in love with the adorable relationship between Prince Henry and Alex <3"
"I became so invested in these character that they became real for me.  I haven't been caught up like that in quite a while.  This book is a lovely fairytale, bright shiney and hopeful.  It is very quotable, with some lovely bits of phrase.  It was wonderful seeing Alex and Henry some into thier own and find thier way.  Although, the romance is beautiful, the coming of age story is what makes this novel more than a fantasy of boy finds his prince.  Through their relationship, Alex find out who he is and what he will do with his life. Then there is the contrast and foil of Henry's discovery that maybe he doesn't have to be who he is told to be and that maybe he can choose his future."
"Kudoz to McQuiston! All the reviewers are doing a much better job singing the praises of this book than I ever could. But this is a truly impressive novel with quirky characters, political games and family issues. I can't wait for the movie. Here's hoping Hollywood doesn't screw it up! I reached the end of the book, got straight onto Amazon and ordered the paperback for a friend a couple states away. I'm doing my little part to make sure word gets out. Are there t-shirts?"
"I've never been a pleasure reader, the Hunger Games in middle school was the last major series I read and it took me from May to feb. to finish the prequil. I rarely find books I get into and between all the law, and other political readings I'm doing in college I don't seek it out. I saw this book on Tik Tok and knew I had to read it, the first night I stayed up till 1 and read 100 pages (I rarely get more than 10 in a textbook without checking twitter) then I woke up and read another 100, then another 100+ after class, then I finished it that evening. The characters are so well developed and so realistic I loved every page. If you like politics, specifically PR you'll relate heavily to the transactions of the President's staff with handling PR issues of the first family. If you're gay you'll be heart-warmed by the way the relationship develops between these young adults. I never thought a single book would ever-outflank hunger games to me, I was wrong. Best book ever."
"I love the writing style of Casey MccQuiston, who is a new to me author. The wording, and humor jumps off the pages. The texts between Alex and Henry are hysterical. The emails are poignant and dripping with romance.The characters are so well written, I feel like they are sitting right next to me, looking at the glossy magazines and sharing a laugh with me. I'm not sure if the author is going to write a continuation  of this story, but I would absolutely  love to see how the six of them end up ten years from now."
"This has been in my ""to-read"" pile for ages, and after the first chapter I was kicking myself for not starting it sooner. It is literally the funniest book I've ever read--actual laughing out loud, cracking up, tears, kind of laughing. The charmingly witty, sassy tone of McQuiston's writing style alone made this 5 stars for me. I'm also a complete sucker for hate-to-love romance and this is absolutely one of the best!"
"A tour-de-force of drama, rivalry, and love leavened by ridiculous events which seem natural at the time. This slow-burn romance doesn’t shirk from the pesky details and what-if in terms of a relationship such as the one portrayed here. Humor and exceptional depth sucked me into this book and didn’t let me go. This is not your ordinary MM romance, it’s fabulously better than that."
"To be clear:  this is escapist literature.  You have the escapism not just of romance, but the luxury of imagining a 2019 America that is very different from the one we're currently in, an America where Obama was followed in office by a female president.  It's charming, witty, fun, and often very romantic.  It's about as good as a book of pure wish fulfillment fantasy can be, like wrapping yourself in a cozy blanket with a cup of hot chocolate."
"Worth every penny and was a great read to boot!  So many M/M rom-coms aren't worth the paper they are printed on that when you come across a good one it's like finding a rare gem.  This book is definitely one of them.  Smart premise and well written his book will be a welcome addition to your summer reading list.  Fingers crossed that the adventure continues, and look forward to more books from this author!"
"Red, White and Royal Blue is probably one of the most hyped summer books, and for me it did not disappoint!This love story about the son of the (female!) President of the United States and the Prince of England was pure fun; the perfect summer read. And while it was a mostly a light, fun romance, it also didn’t shy away from the challenges that such a relationship would present.I really enjoyed the banter between Alex and Henry and rooted for them from the start, even if I found Alex a tad bit annoying in the beginning. (A little too much “woe is me, life is hard.”) It also was a little bit long, but was an easy read that kept me wanting to know what the future held for these star-crossed lovers.I definitely shed a few tears and also found myself chucking now and then at McQuiston’s witty writing.I highly recommend this one!"
"I enjoyed this book so much that I stayed up very, very late because I wanted to keep reading. The two main characters, Alex and Henry, really come to life through their interactions, and I felt very invested in their relationship as the story progressed. It's nice to see a fictional gay relationship develop in the way a straight one might in a rom-com - it's fun and positive and just leaves the reader feeling good. That's what I wanted from this story, and this novel really delivered in a big way. Also, Henry is exactly right about Return of the Jedi."
Awesome!  I truly enjoyed this book so much a read it twice.  It was a fun escape that portrays a world in Oct 2020 that we signed existed instead of the hate-filled speech and leadership our country has today.
"Wow, the first book in a long time to make me tear up! I was rooting the whole time for everything that happened, and, it wasn’t cheapened. It was done well, it was done right. The characters are unique and interesting, and the romance is subtle, yet strong, without overdoing it with excessive erotica. Worth a read for any fan of LGBT coming-of-age/coming out romance."
"I didn't expect to end up reading this in one evening but that's what happened.  I understand the author's choice to tell the story from Alex's perspective, so that the reader only knows what he knows.  It's not my personal preference but there is a larger context for Alex's and Henry's romance that needs space to be told.  I hope we see them again, perhaps as characters in a book about Nora or June.  I wish there had been at least a short epilogue set a few months later so that we could see them living the HEA they fought for, but I know that is also my personal preference."
"This was recommended to me for SO long, but I kept putting it off, and my expectations grew bigger the longer I waited and the more people recommended it. But wow! Why did I put it off for so long - this was so far my best read of 2021! (And I’ve read 30+ books this year already..)This book is brilliant, heart warming and heart breaking at the same time and just so well written. It really is just epic - the storyline and concept is like nothing I’ve read before! I loved it truly. It’s just one of those books, that leave a lasting impression, and I’m sure I’ll have a book hangover for a loooong time now that I’ve finished it!"
"I finally made it to the end of a romance novel!No, seriously, I've tried several and never made it more than two thirds of the way through. This, though, was so dense with zingy prose, and the characters, who could so easily have been obnoxious or cliche, were so well done, and the romance so cute, I just had to keep reading. And it was satisfying all the way to the end."
"The first half was okay, but somewhat prosaic, no better than a beach read. But when Alex and Henry start sending each other emails, the language is* gorgeous*! You will want to take notes and send them under your own name!  In fact, I thought the whole second half was much better than the first. So I gave it 5 stars, because if you stick with it, it's worth the read."
"So many salty reviewers in here seem surprised that this book is political. It is literally about members of the First Family. If you think the author should stay out of politics or that she shouldn't have her characters take a side, this isn't the book for you.That said, I thought it was a great beach read! The romance really is capital-R romantic, it's damn funny (a couple of laugh out loud moments), and just the right amount of smutty.  A couple other reviewers have made the most salient criticisms: we don't see enough ""behind-the-scenes"" Royal Family stuff, and it sucks that our main characters get outed at the end. You understand why as a plot device but you wish it didn't have to happen to them! I also would have been interested in hearing more about some of the side characters, particularly Nora and June. Hoping the author returns to them in another book."
"This book was a suggestion made in a Facebook group and I am so glad I bought it. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think the characters are likable and real. And since I am from Austin, it was fun knowing exactly where some of the scenes take place. It's probably not a book that everyone will enjoy (based on other reviews definitely true) but I liked it enough to write a review."
It is such a good book! I saw it all over TikTok and it lives up to the hype! It’s such a feel good stand alone book that I highly recommend!!! It gives me so much hope in the world and is so inspiring!
I had a hard time with this book because of a fact That the prince is really Harry in real life and he’s obviously not gay I think if she had maybe picked a different name or a different country I may have gotten into it more.
"RWARB : NO SPOILERS BTWS.RWARB put me through so many emotions because of how great it was. I normally don’t read books about royal people, but THIS book was amazing.I read this book online, and decided to buy the paper copy to support the artist, which I was going to do either way. I ended up finishing it online, and gave the copy away. But either way, this book will always have a special place in my heart.This book has from humor to romance to surprises.DEF worth the read if you want a refreshing book."
"I can’t even begin tor rhapsodize enough about how much I loved this book! I’m tempted to buy immediately start it over again from the beginning! This one will go down in my personal history, and the alternate reality I will wish for the most! The characters and warm and real and wonderful. The romance between Alex and Henry is sweet and beautiful and believable. I need to own this book in triplicate!"
"I loved this book! I don't think I can give a detailed review without spoilers, so I'll just say that it was even better than I was expecting from all the other positive reviews I've seen.Great LGBTQ rep, family and friends, wonderful relationship stuff, an encouraging political plotline...My heart needed this story. I highly recommend it for anyone."
"grabbed this when my best friend recommended it. read it over the course of three nights, staying up way too late to enjoy a wonderfully rich and funny tale.it’s very well written, unabashedly romantic and hopeful, and a true balm for those of us still lamenting the outcome of the 2016 elections.it’s contemporary pleasure reading that verges on “literature”. well worth the lost sleep!"
"This is a healing, fantasy else-world of what could-have-been if hope triumphed over fear in American politics.Alex and Henry very much have a way of thinking, speaking, and writing that shows that they know they will be a part of history. It was a pleasure to read about people who so deeply respect the burden of being world leaders."
"....and I mean the subject line of this review.  Not a crier.  But I did while reading this exquisite romance.  Several times.  I could hardly wait to get home from work so I could make Alexa begin reading it to me the moment I walked in the door, angry that I was unable to read in the car.  That’s how involved I got.  A little heavy on the political aspect of Alex’s life, but that’s a minor blip.  I was rooting for the main characters because I wanted it all to work out.  Multiple plots, lots of dimensional characters, well-researched details, all very impressive, made doubly so when I learned that this was a debut novel.  Enjoyable and engaging."
"Red, White and Royal Blue is one of the best books I've read this year (and I go through books like water)! Hilarious, sharp witted, dramatic and unerringly fun! The connection between these boys  Alex & Henry is poignant and deep and I'm more drawn in on my third read than even the first time I read it. The side characters are fun and complex as  well and add a lot the overall scope of the piece. Having been a History major and raised by poly sci majors, the backdrop of politics spoken of with hope rather than an unending abyss of despair of the future of America was also refreshing! I love this story and I'm dying for more!Also: *Spoiler ALERT*Also, if the next book she writes was the story of Shaan and Zahra, that would make my century!!!"
"This book was so perfect. It was the best book I read in 2019 and may be the best of 2020. While the tense that it is written in takes a little getting used to, it was worth persevering. About half-way through the book I had a hard time picking it back up because it has been so good, so spot on and perfect so far that I didn't know how the story could resolve itself without disappointing. But it did! The end completely fit and was just as good as the beginning. I don't want to give too much away, so just read and/or listen to this one."
"This book. Where do I start? It's a breath of fresh air. I laughed, I cried, I was so deeply emotionally invested. It's probably one of the best books I've read in over a year.In the acknowledgements the author says: "" What I hoped to do, and what I hope I have done with this book by the time you’ve finished it, my dear reader, is to be a spark of joy and hope you needed.""And I can genuinely, without a doubt, say she succeeded.It's one I will re-read again and again. ❤️"
"SPOILERS: Not the world we deserve, but the world we need. But seriously, NOT THE WORLD WE DESERVE. This book is the satisfying escapist fantasy of a couple of young queer 20somethings who solve the world's problems with pure hearts and, er, deep d**king. The only things missing were global warming and gun control. My suspension of disbelief was only broken by the idea that law school/civil rights practice could be the basis for a HEA. It's not honey, it's just really not. But I will totally read the sequel where you come to terms with that...."
"I echo a lot of reviews on here: this is a fun, humorous, sexy read but totally brainless; no different than a (funnier, modern, gay) classic Harlequin romance/bodice-ripper. If you’re looking for a book that exactly copies key events of the 2016 election and just changes the outcome because, well, dreams, then sure, indulge and enjoy! If you’re looking for anything more complex, insightful, or realistic — in politics or in sex or in love or in the intersection of those three — this book will disappoint.Note: Be sure to count the number of times Alex says during sex, “If this ever stops, I will just die.” Spoiler, it’s every time."
"This book is entertaining and is great escapist fantasy material.  If you know anything at all about security protocols for the first family and the royal family, it requires a great deal of suspension of disbelief.  Never the less, it is a breezy, easy read and provides an entertaining retreat from reality -- which many of us need from time to time."
"This book is FANTASTIC. It made me laugh, cry, bite my nails, facepalm, sometimes in the same scene. Especially if you're looking for New Adult, it strikes a good balance between a journey of self-discovery and the struggles that come from no longer being a teen.The leads, Alex and Henry, have vivid personalities that carry this book through wit, young foolishness, tension, and perseverance. The revolving cast is also great, but some of the minor characters feel flat at times (Zahra, Cash, Pez). The main crew (June, Nora, Bea, Ellen, Oscar, Rafael) were all standouts, with relationships that towed the line between realistic and satisfying to witness.Just, go read it."
Don’t read this. Plot is bad and it was painful.
"I loved this book so much that I finished it, and then decided to read it again almost immediately. It is a sweet love story, with interesting global politics and observations of family dynamics within politics. There are funny parts in it (like the texts and emails back and forth between the two men). There is sex, but it is not overt.  It includes multiple strong female characters too (like a woman president!) Highly recommend!"
"I absolutely loved this book. It was funny, snarky, heartfelt, saucy, steamy, and completely un-put-downable.  It was great to see a main character figure himself and his orientation out right before our eyes, and the fact that he's bi just made it all the better.  Yay for bi visibility!  I also appreciated that various characters had other orientations and genders, and it was treated as normal and every day. ('Cause it IS.)  Definitely an enjoyable romp, and one I won't forget for a very long time--it reads like extremely delicious fan fiction. Which is a good thing!"
Wow just wow. I loved this book from start to finish I simply couldn’t put it down. This book gives an insight to a parallel political world that you get lost in and it just feels so real. I loved the representation of Hispanics in Politics. The love story between Alex and Henry had me at the edge of my seat I just couldn’t get enough. I went through so many emotions throughout this book and I loved every moment.
"What an amazing book. This book reminded me of the tv show Political animals. There is a strong female lead (a mother who is President) with her Children and her son who is figuring out himself. Not only his he figuring out himself, but the prince of England is too. You will find every emotion in this book. I truly enjoyed this read."
"Let me start this review off my saying that this is the very first book I've ever read through and through. I'm freshmen in college and this book is the first book that I've completely read through and through. Not only that, I finished it in 2 days, I literally could not put the book down and when I had to stop to sleep, I kept thinking about reading it and finishing it. So I recommend this book to everyone and give it a sold 20/10."
- This book is so amazing I will not do it justice. 1. I want to live in this America. 2. I want everyone to love the way Alex and Henry love. 3. I want to be as smart as Henry and as brave as Alex and as eloquent as June and as clever as Nora. 4. I want to be in the Super Six. 5. I kinda want to read it all over again.
"This book was so enjoyable! It has tender moments, laugh out loud moments followed immediately by passages that brought tears to my eyes. Reading it reminded me of when I watched Steel Magnolias and going through multiple emotions in a short period of time.Given the current political climate, this escapism was exactly what I needed and I was thankful to imagine a world filled with love and not hate. It's an easy read, and I now long to know what happens ""after"" and crave more of these characters. Short of that, I would love to read more from this author."
This was my first book by this author and I am SO glad I took the chance! What a wonderfully written book! I felt like I was right in the middle of everything that was happening. I loved the fact that Eric got to find out who he was and come into his own. Loved i see how everything progressed. Absolutely blown away!!
"Why did I wait so long to read this? Oh my gosh, Casey McQuiston has created a wonderfully humorous, emotional, and fun romcom.Red, White & Royal Blue captures your attention right away and draws you in until the very end. Alex and Henry are absolutely hilarious! Their journey is one you don't want to miss out on.I can't wait to read McQuison's next book!"
"This book has all the feels! It perfectly captures the emotion of a first kiss, a first touch, an all consuming crush that comes to life- you can just feel all of it!Steaminess: It’s hot but there is a lot implied and a lot of fade to black… so it’s not completely clean but it isn’t for only 18+ either."
"Most same sex novels I find out there are unmistakably mediocre. Those books are rooted in a commercial lane of success which makes them frustratingly pedestrian. Red, White & Royal Blue is a beautiful, comedic and witty story of an intense romance between two well developed characters. The romance is written elegantly, which is something queer folks like me truly deserve. You will laugh, cry and feel the love between Henry and Alex just like I did.While the political background of the story brings brilliant comedic flavor to the story, it is overly optimistic and ultimately uninteresting. I found myself waiting for the less than stellar political drama part of the book to be over.Nevertheless, the primary story is worth the read. For the hopeless romantics out there, this book will be one you will never forget. Can't wait for the movie. PS: My casting choice -  Noah Centineo as Alex."
"Wow I loved this book. Just like the author said, it was the spark of joy and hope I needed right now. It was so nice to disappear into this alternate America where things aren't perfect but they sure are a lot better.I loved all the characters, they all had so much personality! And the book had such a great sense of humor. I don't know if it needs a sequel but I'd absolutely read one."
"I just gonna say it I absolutely loved this book. I am not the kind of reader who usually reads novels of any kind but this book really suprised me. It had me not wanting to put the book down. The romance, drama, and character development made the book so intriguing and enjoyable. The characters were lovable and diverse making the book different from novels. Overall the book was lovable, interesting, romantic, and unique I would reread this book a 100 and definitely recommend."
"I am only 25% through this book and cannot understand the ratings.  I don't even know if I can finish it and I rarely don't finish a book. I also paid $9.99 for it!  This is the biggest waste of money for a book I have ever spent. The story line is lame and the characters are pathetic. I could go for gay characters if they were realistic, these are not.  I am really going to be more careful with believing ratings after this.  Free sample first before buying."
"Sorry but the cute premise is ruined by some painfully unrealistic character development, sex scenes written by someone who only has a vague idea how gay sex works (travel size lube packets?!?!?) and a lame B story with no surprises. I've read lots of better mm fiction, this is a mainstream mediocre mess."
"I truly truly did not think this book could possibly live up to its hype. But it 100% did. It hurt, down into my bones, at some points (specifically the political intrigue parts—an America that elects strong women to presidency and in which predatory politicians get their comeuppance just feels so powerful) but the romance was just all the way wonderful. This was tender and funny and beautiful and difficult and perfect. I am so glad I overcame my contrarian nature and picked this book up."
"This is the 2016 election universe I want to live in? Can Casey adopt me and put me into the book, pretty please?What a stunning and fun novel! I laughed out loud multiple times from the tongue-in-cheek wit. Henry and Alex’s love story is epic and I’m so glad I got to be a part of their lives for the duration of the book."
"I absolutely loved this. It's witty and had me (happy) crying way more than I expected. I'm only adding to the chorus of praise here, but it really is an uplifting, fun, sexy read. The characters are well-developed and genuine. The story is believable, and the handling of identity, family, and politics left me hopeful. I would read it again."
"Reading Red, White & Royal Blue, I wasn't really sure what the plot would involve, but I thought it would be a fun and easy read for my winter break. Diving into this story, it is a fun, romantic, and developmentally focused story, but what really made this book stand out was the powerful meaning it puts behind politics and inclusion throughout the tale of two young men.Please note that there are some pretty descriptive love scenes and language throughout this book, so I would not recommend for young readers, but this author does a great job weaving these romantic scenes into the depth of this story to really focus on the social justice and political issues at hand."
"I LOVED this book so much!Some people say that they don't like this book because it is too focused on the romance (uhhh, its a literally romance books people come on), it's too vulgar, the characters are too forced, or there is too much politics. First off, this is a political romance book. It is made for older teens so if it is too vulgar for you or the characters don't make sense to you, then you are probably too young or too old.Do not try to ruin this amazing book just because you don't see yourself in it. Other people might and it is important that everyone be represented.If you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all. Do better."
"Thankful that I finally decided to pick up this book and give it a try. Have watched it appear on every book list, Instagram, TikTok friend I follow and knew it had to be good to just simply try. And oh man, it was fantastic and definitely pulled you right in. There was some royal talk and mythology that I didn’t understand but the back and forth and true passion is what kept me turning the pages. Definitely one of the favorites this year"
"I cried multiple times. I laughed multiple times. I'm not ashamed to admit either. Something in me needed this book, especially as a member of the LGBT community myself, who is having at least what I would call a rough time of coming out, and especially as an American citizen filled with apprehension about the coming 2020 election and the resulting four years. I rooted so hard for the characters and the story. Casey, you've done it. Thank you.History, huh?"
"I think the concept is good but it was hard to really get into it. I get that it’s going to be a bit unrealistic, but I feel like it goes a bit too far. Everyone is bi or gay, or their sexuality isn’t clearly defined (which is fine) but I had trouble following g who was involved with whom because scenes just appears with little to know explanation. And the romantic scenes between the two main characters was either very vague with a “fade to black” essence or it was laid bare for you; again, a bit disjointed. High marks for making a book that questions the status quo in terms of people’s sexuality but it just wasn’t completely smooth."
"I never give romantic books more then 3 stars, you know ...romantic...I started this book because I needed to relax. After 2 chapters I realized with surprise where is it going (supposedly not my standard preference) but I couldn’t stop. And so good I didn’t. Such a beautiful,heartwarming story. A story of sexual discovery, of amazing love, of truth of hope for the future to come. Loved it !!!!"
"Book finished. I have so many positive emotions about it that it's hard for me even to begin expressing them. The development of Alex and Henry relationship is exactly what my heart needed, their fight, perseverance, stubbornness and faith in each other, wow. Plus, that all being set in a very plausible situation - yes, I do believe that it's happening now to a million different young adults over the world - not being able to be who you are 'cause society/parents/title is dictating you. I say, frick* them all, there is nothing worth more than being true to yourself. (in my 40s, so I've been there) I'm glad the boys also did that."
"Words can’t describe how much I loved this book. It’s so much more than a love story. It’s about the struggle every human faces to be unique and authentic while also trying to fit in. It’s about fighting for what’s right. It’s a book that will make you laugh, tear up, and cheer. A book that will remind you to always have hope. Even in the tough times. A book the world very much needs. Now. And always."
"In these crazy times we live in, this is a breath of fresh air.  I thought it’d be cheesy escapism, but was gleefully surprised that there are real characters with depth and you’re really rooting for them.  The love letters - wow.  So touching.  I’ve already read this twice and I rarely do that."
"Everyone seems to love this book and I’m right alongside them.  Alex and Henry were an absolutely adorable couple and the incredibly diverse characters were all engaging and lovable.  RW&RB mixes two of my favorite tropes (enemies to lovers and royals) and this book has something for everybody.  I laughed out loud more than once and even cried during a certain scene.The only thing I didn’t love about this book was the lack of romance.  There was a lot of focus on the political aspects of the book (which other people may enjoy), but I found those parts boring after the first little bit and would have preferred more focus on the main couple and their relationship to be honest.  Overall, this book was a fantastic read and I definitely recommend."
This book was a lot better then I thought it was going to be. When I first started this book I thought it was going to be all political but once they figured things out it got romantic. I would definitely recommend this if you want a more adult/ real life romance with out the dirty sex that most adult romance books have.
"I'll admit it - I love romance. But as someone who (regularly) works herself up into a tizzy about the onslaught of terrifying international & domestic political news, most romance books seem disconnected. Not this one.McQuiston wrote a litany of smart, funny, and REAL characters who fall in love against the backdrop of modern politics. I fell in love with every character in this book, and laughed out loud constantly. This one will stick with me for a while, and I'm glad for it."
"I’ve bought this book in paperback, audiobook, and ebook because I love it so much! This book captured my attention immediately and kept me on the edge of my seat through to the end. The characters are endearing and you can’t help but fall in love with Alex and Henry. The Texan in me loved all the references to my home state while the romantic in me loved all the mentions of art and literature. I cried, I cried a lot while reading this; this queer representation is just what I needed in my life. I’d recommend this book to anyone that’ll listen to me."
"The son of the first female president has always hated Prince Henry of England, so he’s caught off-guard when he starts to like him.  Even more surprised when he falls in love with him.  This is an enjoyable read with wonderful characters and a fast-paced plot.  Lots of fun and lots of heart."
"A fun, sexy read, writing is tight and there's a good dose of LOL.  It's not an epic storyline by any means, but the author has a strong handle on political realities woven throughout the romantic escapades of the main characters.  Found myself wanting to know what happens to these guys in the future.  A sequel perhaps?"
"This novel was everything! The story was sweet, sensual, and exciting. I had butterflies and I absolutely fell in love with Alex and Henry. Their email address exchange melted my heart and real substance was built into their relationship. This was a beautiful, fun, and fast paced read"
"I must say, in the beginning I was hooked, then when I realized what it was about I wasn't sure she could pull it off, but boy was I wrong. Not only did she pull it off, she hit it out of the park. Brava!! You will fall in love with the characters and they will stay with you. Loved it!"
"Is this book perfect? No. Is it like reading a rom-com? Yes. If you're a fan of romantic comedies, all of the tropes, and male/male romance, this is a book for you.It's cute, it's funny, it's a little irreverent. It muddles along a little at times -- trying to explain the political system in-depth, leading to a lot of unnecessary details for the sake of telling the romantic story -- but it's still an easy read. This is my favorite sort of novel to read."
"I will start off by agreeing with many other reviewers before me by saying that this book reads like a GeoCities-era fanfic. Alex the main character is thoroughly unlikable throughout the entire story  and is not written as a believable “questioning” or recently-out 21 year old. All the secondary characters only exist to support Alex and are not interesting or unique. There are very few serious conversions in the book and most dialogue is sarcastic jabs between characters.  Happy to see some diversity in this story, but it does feel crammed in and awkwardly forced. Not enough research was done about the British Royal Family to make this fictitious portrayal believable."
"I’ve never really engaged much in the novel before. However, the story gives me hope for the world as it should be. Emotional engaging dialogues, hopeful and sensual if you read with your opened mind and heart. I’ve been waiting for this love fantasy story for such a long time and hopefully this world will happen one day in our society. Absolutely remarkably well expressed with fairly accurate historical sentiment and indeed sassy at the same time. My top favorite book so far!"
"Every character in this book was beautifully believable, every friendship enviable. The romance was sweet and honest and everything you could hope for in an enemies to friends to lovers story. But really, this story is all you could hope for in a book, period. Just the escape I needed."
"I really needed this type of fun summer read to lift my spirits in this time of our discontent. I found all the characters believably human. It's great to see that the author got the inspiration and went with it. ALL love stories have a place . Not just the straight, white ones. Good job."
"I bought this book for a fun quick read but found myself completely engrossed in the story and characters.I laughed, cried and everything in between. The story came alive and I could totally see this becoming a movie. Romantic comedy for sure, with non-stereotypical queer characters. A+"
"I loved the book. I laughed my ass off in the first part of the book when June was diagnosing Alex’s gayness.By the way, Alex is totally gay ....and not bisexual as alluded to/stated in the book. I’m not certain why the author couldn’t just admit that.A good read."
"My favorite kind of romance is one where instead of the main conflict being misunderstandings between partners who can't bring themselves to communicate, the conflict is ""us against the world"", and this novel delivers. Lovely, tear-jerking prose, interspersed with corny jokes and hot flashes of lust--this book captures the little moments that make loving another person the wonderful, complex choice that it is. And it does it against some of the most fun backdrops around: British royalty and American politics."
"The book is well done. The plot is straightforward. Some of the sequences based on e-mails are a bit confusing as is the premise of hacked WH servers after 2016. All in all, a great read and hillarious in the age of Trump. Maybe Boris and the Donald are on the QT."
"I absolutely loved this story!  Throughout the story, the author keeps building on the characters so you feel like you know them intimately. Chapter four kept me in stitches and I couldn’t put it down. Read the whole thing in one sitting!  Just a little but smutty with being graphic or pornographic. Perfect!!"
"I enjoyed this book from start to finish. It's hard to tell which character is my favorite but I can definitely say that I didnt like Richards at all. Alex, Henry, June Bug and Nora are very courageous. We need more people in this world like them. This is definitely an inspiring book. Beautifully written."
"A new favorite book of 2019! This is pure fan fiction of what everything after 2016 should have been with a male male romance thrown in for the sexy fun. Henry and Alex were wonder, I laughed a lot, cried some for the world we could have, and just loved this book. Now where’s Nora and June and Bea’s stories?!? I need them now!"
"Is it kind of predictable? I mean, yeah? But that's not a downside. This book is a fantastic slow burn that, as someone in the same age range as the characters, is unlawfully relatable, and I believe that added another layer to the book. The author did a great job of making royalty and politics seem normal, while still bringing the heavily of a global situation to light. And of course, the love between the main characters was beautiful and I loved every word I read."
"Getting lost in the story of Alex and Henry falling in love is such a treat. From their terse beginning to the hormone-filled makeout scenes to the emotional journey of them facing the harshness of living in the public eye while being queer, this whole book was such a beautiful escape. It's an absolute treat of a reality I hope one day can be the truth of anyone who feels they're unable to be who they are."
"If you are beyond adolescence you probably want to skip this unnecessarily long, gushy fairytale (no pun intended).  Unless you want to get an example of a female author totally out of her league writing about gay men (and sex, if you can call her depiction that)."
"I’d planned on taking my time to read this one but two sleepless nights proved me wrong. I fell in love with these characters and took them everywhere with me. Now that I’ve finished reading, I cannot stop thinking about Alex and Henry. Such bravery, such history. What a beautifully told piece of fiction. Definitely one of the best LGBTQ+ reads I’ve had the honor of losing myself into. Thank you Casey!"
"My highest accolade: this book was slippery. I fell into it and just kept going. I didn’t intend to surrender my day - and part of my night! - to a novel; but when I looked up, night had fallen.“Red, White, and Royal Blue” is an updated “enemies to lovers” trope, very well handled. The characters are flawed and likeable, the relationship is witty and tender and hot, and the world they live in (a “west Wing”-like paradise of politicians who understand that they’re public servants) is the best kind of fantasy. I give it two enthusiastic thumbs up!"
I think I smiled through 95% of this book! It was an epic story of growth and love! It’s so sad to knowThere is still so much prejudice in this world that people have to hide their true selves .. I hope for our future that we all learn to accept and love all humans and the sooner we do that the better our world will be !! 💜
"So, so, good. I didn’t realize it was a romance that centered LGBTQ issues, politics, and gay romance when I bought it - I started reading and found it totally refreshing to explore love, chemistry, and romance through a perspective that is different than my own! Highly recommend!!!"
"Red, White and Royal blue grabbed my attention from the first few pages and I could not put it down.  It is an amazing story of what America can be with  the help of open hearts, very smart people, and lots of love.  I recommend this book to anyone with a big heart and an open mind.  It could have been just another gay novel, but it is so much more.  Read it and laugh, feeling the pain and joy of growing up in this nation that we love."
"Okay. So this book. Is. Amazing. I haven’t read an actual book in months and this gorgeous story pulled me right in and I couldn’t put it down. 425 pages of absolute wonder. I read it in one day. The characters are so diverse and flushed out, the plot is literally everything you could ever want it to be, there are so many moving parts that work together so well..... just go read the damn book."
"I've read A LOT of books in the past year, and I can definitively say this is the best of them.I can't really do words right now. I'm reeling at how good it was. I don't know if there are plans for a sequel or not, but dear Satan, I hope so. This book solidified Casey as an instant-buy author for me."
"What a charming, funny and wonderfully sexy book. I disagree with the reviewers complaining about the politics--Mcquiston gets that part right and for people in that life, it rings very true. It  blessedly takes place in a universe where Trump was never elected. The sex scenes are A+ material and who doesn't love some well done 21st-century style epistolary? Get this book, put on your best caftan, and make a day of it."
"This book is a delightful, quick, easy read that is enjoyable from start to finish. The main characters are well rounded and have a fun relationship between them. They show the struggles all relationships face but spaced out with lightheartedness to make the book not feel too heavy."
"If I could, I would give this 6 stars. The characters were outstanding, the romance engaging, the premise original and the snark and wit was simply overflowing. I adored every minute of this book. Now I will be in a book hangover for awhile. Definitely a book I could re-read."
"Picture this: the president is a female divorce, her children are half Mexican and one is bi-sexual and happens to fall in love with the prince of England. This book was cute with interesting and funny characters and plot twists. I found it to be an enjoyable and fun read!"
"A truly beautiful story. This one hit close to home with the state out our country right now, god I wish this is the direction we would have gone in instead of the shit show of hate we are facing right now. I was drawn in completely by the engaging dynamic characters and wonderfully uplifting story I read the whole thing in one sitting. Everyone needs to read this book. Not only is it a truly beautiful love story, but is an eye opening look into where we could be as a country. I thank the author for her marvelous contribution to society. Bravo."
I FREAKING LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH! Alex and Henry’s are  EVERYTHING and I am Loving the LGBT representation. Prepare to shed some tears (mostly happy ones)  and laugh.Ps. Would love to see this made into a series or movie
"Good story with relatable characters. I love the themes of acceptance and courage. Not my particular favorite writing format though. It took about 100 pages to get past the ""script"" style voice of the story. It's worth the read if you can get past the screenplay feel."
"What a charming, sexy, romantic, and topical story. Imagine the 2016 election hadn’t gone terribly wrong and then throw in a sweet romance between the female president’s son and a British prince. This is just the story you need right now to make you smile again. Loved it."
"Very good book. Didn't want to put it down. Great and uniquely well done storyline. My only peeve with this book were the mischaracterisations about royalty. Small things like, Henry abdicating, Martha having product endorsements, royal suitor. As a royal enthusiast these things really tickled me . Kind of like with regency novels which follow none of the mores of that time.. but overall a wonderful book."
I was reminded that I owned this book after listening to an episode of Pop Culture Happy Hour (podcast) in which one of the hosts said it was a novel that was making her happy that week. I immediately went to my ‘shelf’ and dug in. Such a fun ride!
"This book was not at all what I expected and was exactly what I needed. Alex is impulsive and smart and quick witted and clueless. Henry is reserved and deep- so deep. Bea, June, Nora and Pez just make it that much better, and there are just too many nerd nuggets to list them all.So good. So, so good."
but happy YA romance about an unlikely love affair between a prince of England and POTUS’s son.  Contains some descriptive sex. Also mentions drug abuse (as a bad thing) and the casual use of another persons amphetamine prescription.
"This book... this is what I WISH we had gotten 4 years ago. Unfortunately, the American public chose the most racist, misogynistic, bigoted rapist they could instead. I adored following Alex and Henry's love story; sometimes the person you profess to hate the most is the one you yearn for. From one bi person to another, I thank Alex for his bravery and loyalty. And I know that Love Conquers All."
"I read. I read an awful lot, and I’ve read an awful lot of books in my life. This book made me feel good as no other book has before. And that for me is something, since I’ve read so many books before this one. This was funny, interesting, plotty as romance books usually are not. The characters are people you would like to know. The world they live in is a world I wish existed. So this is why this is my new favorite book, and I’m not even on the target audience! I will follow this author forever now."
"4½  starsOkay, so for the 1st 26% of this story was okay, 2½-3½ stars.After that the story started moving at a better pace and I started to enjoy it.I absolutely loved the last chapter & I definitely had tears in my eyes."
This is the first book by this author. This is a mm contemporary story set in the USA and uk. Alex is the first son of the president of the USA and Henry  is a Prince of England. Enemies to lovers. Lots of USA politics. Lots of hype for this book but not reliable in Australia.
"I’d heard so many good things about this book and I wasn’t disappointed. It dug in deep and touched all of my heartstrings. It also gave me hope, hope for the future of the USA... maybe, just maybe, love will always change the world."
"I don’t write book reviews, but this one takes the cake for my new favorite. I was apprehensive about it when I saw it was about two men falling in love, thinking it wouldn’t appeal to me. But BOY WAS I WRONG. I laughed out loud, I cried, I swooned, I got chills... This was the kind of book that I didn’t even look at the clock for. I read long into the night. Amazing writing. I felt like I was there with the characters. Hysterical sarcasm throughout. LOVE!"
"Absolutely Amazing!!Now after reading this story, I can't believe it took me so long to finally start it! It was so unexpected and eerily similar to real life situations lately.I can't wait to read more from this author."
"I just. I have no words. I stayed up all night reading and I am in LOVE -- with the writing, the sheer *hope* of the story, and of course Alex and Henry, whose relationship brought me to tears multiple times. This was absolutely gorgeous, and I'll be ordering it to keep on my rl bookshelf as well. ❤❤❤❤"
"So good, the only complaint.  It ended :(  I would love to see a sequel with the pair married and Alex and Henry living in England.It would make sense.  He should get a law degree there and run for a post in Parliament.  Bring American style politics to the English!"
"the story is good the characters are good but he execution is awful. It read more like a script, very stilted. one doesn't feel like the people are doing things but that some one is directing them very impersonally.  great idea just not well written"
"I had no idea what a delight this book would be. Alex is hilarious, Henry is vulnerable, and their emails are perfect. The chemistry was amazing and while I'm used to more sexually explicit books, the sexy scenes were hot enough with just right amount of adorable. Can't recommend it enough."
"I LOVED this book SO much! My eyes burn from all the crying I've been doing from 70% on, but it was super worth it. A wonderful cast of characters, populating a gorgeous, hopeful, inspirational story. If you love love, read this immediately!"
"This book is fantastic and so healing after the crap show reality has been lately in politics. This book gave me hope and filled my heart with joy. Since the moment I heard about this book, I was entranced by the idea and it lived up to the hype for me. Not only was it a romance, but so much more. I will DEFINITELY be reading any future work by this author."
The writing is first rate and at times rises to poetry. The characters of Alex and Prince Henry are fully realized and have great depth. Their romance is touching and heartfelt. At one point Henry's journey and words made me tear up. Great reading.
"What a lovely book! It was a nice fantasy to escape the current reality. Love the diversity of the characters and the storyline. It showed people breaking away from expectations, and living life on their terms but still respecting their roots. Good book for these times."
"Best book I’ve had the honor of reading and reviewing this year. I’m going to be completely honest, despite the hype, I didn’t think I was going to enjoy this. Boy was I wrong. This book has something in it for everyone and is so much more than a story about two young men falling in love. This is a modern forbidden love story that you will NOT be able to put down. Brb while I continue to cry about how happy this book made me and that I can finally get a good nights sleep. #history,huh?"
"OMFG that damned book! I'm finally done with Red, White and Royal Blue and the only reason I didn't finish faster was because I had to work. It's so absolutely ridiculous how much I love that book and how I'm looking forward to whatever fanwork is going to come out of it.I looked forward to it even when I preordered and it did not disappoint at all. I almost missed my bus stop twice in one day because I was so hooked.It has some politics so if you don't like it better skip it. I mean the story is bigger than that but just in case."
"I absolutely loved this book. So optimistic, well written and just a fun read. I kept saying to myself that this would make such a great movie... and now I see that they are smart enough to do so! Can’t wait for the movie and can’t wait for more books from this author. Well done!"
"What a sweet, romantic read! Throw in some political intrigue, royal splash, and tight friendships, you get a terrific first novel. I’m looking forward to reading more by this author. She has a bright future ahead of her!"
"I can't find anything that I don't like on this book. It is funny and witty, full of wonderful characters, and most beautiful love story.The first I laid my fingers on this book, a little less than a year ago, I read it 3 times. Just couldn't leave their world. Had to get back again and again. Now, I've read it 8 times. Doesn't get old. I pick up small quirks that I didn't see in the previous times. And I get that overall happy feeling afterwards.I read a lot, and usually romcoms are not my favorite things. But this book. This book is the best."
"I loved this book!! Extremely witty, funny, authentic, & hopeful.A book with a mixed race bisexual lead? From Texas? Sign me up! I connect with Alex in many ways, from his heritage to his home to his sexuality to his foul mouthed desire to do good. Words cannot describe how much his happiness & success means to me as a reader.The characters & their interactions feel very real & it’s so easy to love them all despite their flaws.I could go on forever about all the little details & major plot points I loved but I don’t have enough characters in this review box & really everyone should just read it themselves!"
"this was such a fun read! i'm probably a little biased being a gay millennial, but in an age of social media and social rights, the plot of this book doesn't sound so farfetched-- it could be ripped from headlines today for sure. wouldn't necessarily say the book is ""sexy"" but would highly recommend!"
"Want to gall in love with a male character? Why not two for the price of one!History, politics, queer-friendly, laugh out loud and romance all in one.Do yourself a favor buy read, listen and read again!xoxo-J"
"Unfortunately the author chose to destroy a good story by writing in the present tense.  I fought my way through thr first third snd finally couldn't take it any more.  Good story, decent characters, atrocious writing."
"I LOVE this book. It is hilarious, and I knew it was a five-star read not even a third of the way into it. It's adorable, witty, and so funny. The actual book I received, however, was not in ideal condition. I can tell that while the book was being bound, the glue was not checked thoroughly, as on the particular book I received, the pages are not glued all the way down the spine. Drives me crazy when binderies in charge of printing great books such as these don't bother to produce acceptable quality books to be shipped out."
"As a Texas girl who actually went to Lometa every year to participate in the rodeo, I really identified with the underlying spirit of a Texas family. This was really a heartwarming love story and I loved every page."
"This book is over 400 pages and I finished it in a day! This is exactly the kind of story we need right now in today's political and cultural climate. It is realistic while being uplifting, it is romantic without being a simplistic predictable YA plot, and it is a ""cheeky"" look into US / UK relations. There were beautifully placed cliffhangers, relatable dialogue, and tear jerking moments. This will go on to be a re-read for me no doubt. Do yourself a favor, buy this, pick a weekend, and settle in.History, huh?"
"Finally a story about a commoner and a prince! This enemies to friends to lovers tale has a twist of course. The commoner is the son of the first female president. I love how the characters text each other, email each other and quote literary and historical figures with urbane wit. This is a unique story and I hope it becomes a movie."
"I had to force myself not to read this book too quickly. I wanted to live in this alternate reality for as long as possible.  If you're looking for a FUN, EASY, SEXY read You've Found It!  As an added bonus, I loved the points of gay history she enfolded into the narrative...made me search out some icons along the way. Will definitely revisit this GEM!"
I liked this book I did. It was very different from books I typically read but it was good. It took me awhile to read because action and adventure is more my type of thing. But if you’re into these type of books definitely read it!
I finished this in 2 sittings and have spent a vast majority of the time afterward missing these characters. Everything in this book was so clearly and deliberately thoughtful and wonderful. It really did feel like an ever so slightly kinder and better version of our reality as McQuiston put in her acknowledgments. I was completely charmed.
It seemed interesting and a little different. Never read a book with a political theme before. Not big on political back grounds or themes but this one was sweet and cute and funny. It was a cant put down cause I gotta know what happens to Henry and Alex. If you want something simple and fun to red this is a good one.
"This is an incredible story. It’s such a unique book, and has such diverse characters. You literally love them all. Everything is so nicely tied together, you will cry (I did). It’s a perfect romantic, fun story for 2020."
I just read the last 216 pages in one sitting...WOW! I have never laughed and cried so much from one book.  Thank you Casey McQuiston for driving on and giving us this parallel and more optimistic universe we need so very bad right now.  It was definitely a spark of joy and hope that I needed.
"I was on a royals theme after The Heir Affair (and its predecessor The Royal We) and didn’t want to leave the cozy comfort of English splendor. And this definitely held the temp while introducing a totally new layer of Royal romance: boy loves boy! The banter alone is worth the read, but the love story is also so tender."
"While I won't say this lived up to the hype of being hilarious and the best book ever, i do believe it was a great book. Loved the emails back and forth. I got chills a few times throughout the book. A great story."
"Imagine a United States where Trump didn't win in 2016 - that instead elected a once -divorced woman whose twenty something year old children have a Mexican American father. This fun, entertaining book begins with that reality."
"I can not say enough good about this book. It blew me away. I laugh every time I read it, and I've read it 3 times in the past month. All the characters are intelligent and funny. The love between Henry and Alex feels real and powerful. Highly recommend!"
Really a pretty horrible book. Super unrealistic and not well put together. I had a hard time making it through. I didnt find that the characters were developed very well and it got old having the two main characters constantly see each other with a lustful demeanor. Basic dribble in my opinion.
"But boy am I glad I did. It is April 2020 and this shot of hope and love and smart people wanting to make things better is just what I needed. Well written and funny, snarky and honest - do your self a favor and read this. Now."
"I read this book in one sitting. It feels like such a quick read, when really it has 418 pages. It is such a cute, fast past, wild ride that you just can't help but turn the page and read more! The only ""complaint"" is that I wished it was longer! Alex and Henry's relationship and dynamic was so interesting, as well all the side characters; Pez, June, Luna, Nora, ZHARA, etc.. all of them! I love them and I love all the LGBTQ+ rep so much. Also... Nora and Pez are my idols! If you can't tell by now, I. Love. This. Book...read it now!"
"This book was nothing like I expected and was a gem of a story about young adults, politics, the unlikely mists of love and everything good.  I read it in one sitting, my heart plunging when Alex was hurt and my smile lighting up my dark bedroom when I read about Henry's triumph over his family.  10/10 would recommend forever"
This was such a great story. The main character Alex was lovable for being kind of an ass. He is exactly what you'd expect this 21 year old in the white house to be. I loved the family dynamic and the relationship with his friends. McQuiston created a wonderful universe that I want to live in. My one negative was I got lost in the voice at times. I had to go back and read a few lines multiple times to make sure I had it correct
"If you enjoy nerdy, snap-of-the-whip repartee romances steeped in a suspenseful US presidential campiagn, well then read on! I laughed out land too many times to count! This is a sweet millennial do-over for an alternate dimension of 2020."
"Boring!!  I was on page 100 and still no action. Very slow!!! I know many rated this book high. Not sure why. If a book take more than 50 pages to get good, its not for me and it was a 400 page book!!"
"Let me start by saying I hate reading. Always have, since grade school. I find it so hard to get into a piece of reading longer than a tweet or quick CNN article BUT I couldn't put this book down! There are so many things about the reading to love from the complex and tangible characters, the half-escapist-half-realistic approach to the storyline, and the plot is so captivating. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who loves a talented balance of heart, comedy, drama, politics, and family all disguised with a fairytale lens. Ten out of ten!"
"It was a great romance with some sexy scenes, but I was not ready for the writing style they choose. This book is written in 3rd person present tense the whole way. Meaning that you are reading as an outsider rather than the couple themselves. This threw me off because each chapter is from an ""individual"" pov, like most ya romances. So just a heads up for the next person.It's a good story in the end."
I have to say that I thought this was an absolutely spectacular read.It just swept right on without a hitch. I loved the language and dialogue. Loved the characters.Just really fantastic.
"This book is AMAZING. The characters are all HILARIOUS, the comedy is awesome, and  *the vaguest minor spoilers coming; you're probably fine; I mean come on, you're reading a romance, you know the tendency of these* you actually experience the characters IN the romantic relationship dealing with conflict and experiencing character growth BECAUSE of it; it's not one of those ""get together in the last five seconds"" types of books. BUY IT; YOU WON'T BE SORRY."
"It's got it all for a fun, gay, summer read -- love, romance, sex, political intrigue (US and UK).  While this book is obviously totally fictitious, and the situations are markedly different -- made me wonder how closely the royal family situation portrayed parallels problems faced by Harry and Meagan the House of Windsor."
"Absolutely loved this book and everything that it brings to the table. I always have loved Queer YA and am thankful that we are in an age where it is becoming more popular and mainstream, especially since these are the kinds of books I would have loved as a younger person. Definitely recommend this to fans of a good story and cute romance."
"I absolutely fell in love with this story! As a royal fan, I always thought about if a royal were gay, and this book brought it to life! I adored Henry and Alex more than words can convey, and just keep coming back to their story time and time again! This story stayed with me, and it will for you too! Best book I've bought this year, and likely the best book I've read in 2019! I can't wait for more from Casey!"
"This book is great, however I would suggest an index of explanation of these terminology such as : HRH, ASAP, FSOTUS, SNL. It would be appreciated. Since English is my fourth language.Thanks!"
"It is hilarious and cute and heart-warming and heart-breaking and sweet and spicy and JUST SO GOOD. It is an escapist fantasy from the reality of our current political predicament while also not shying away from some of the uglier side. I’ll be honest, it’s not hard-hitting gritty “realism” but why would you expect that? It is a fun romantic story and it made me really, really happy to read."
"I wanted to like this book, I really did. The writing style seemed juvenile (unless the author intended for it to read that way) and many of the plot points seemed very forced and predictable. Despite all that I disliked, I still very much love the premise."
"Through intriguing plot, ridiculously well-thought & developed characters, and hilarious dialogue (email and text chains included), Casey McQuiston combines the complex, devastating history of two empires and the future of two bright young men into a glorious novel that gives me hope for what the United States and the world can be someday (hopefully soon)."
"I really thought y’all over hyped this book. I really did. i stand corrected. THIS is the type of N(ew) A(dult) content I’ve been looking for and I loved it so much. A sexy, relevant, page turner with slight smut tendencies but an actual plot that hits you right in the feels. Just...someone come check on my later because I’m sure I’ll still be on the floor."
"This was a beautiful and intriguing story! I was invested from the first few pages and I could not put it down. If you're looking for a fun lgbtq romance, buy this book but make sure you have your day free to read it."
"An interesting book that had a good premise, but at times, it seemed like fanfiction being written, especially during the somewhat sexual scenes. Overall, it still had heart, amazing character arcs, and a satisfying conclusion."
"I was very glad for the refreshing change of pace that a light-hearted romantic comedy brought rather than the dark, serious, fantasy books I've been reading. It's the first time all year I've literally laughed out loud because of a book, and I couldn't stop reading, I loved it so much. I just wish it wasn't so political towards the second half, but the characters already won me over by then. (Quality was also perfect, no issue whatsoever)"
"This is the book we all needed. This book is fantastic, a borderline guilty pleasure. RWRB literally gave me life and something to look forward to in the last few days of quarantine. The cadence of the storyline is perfect, you fall in love with these characters, it's just everything you could need. I am so excited for Casey McQuiston's next novel(s)!"
"Absolutely delightful romance with hints of spiciness. I thought I would be overwhelmed with the politics, but is well written and kept the story going at steady pace.  I would love to see a sequel, or maybe another story involving the Super Six."
"It was so well written! I don't like politics, nor can I seems to understand them when they come up. Somehow this has made me understand more. Also the romance was adorable. I love the enemies to lovers trope. The full family support is always good to see."
"This is a cute, feel good book. Lots of romance, but it also has an interesting plot. It reminded me of a romcom movie I would watch if I had a night alone. I enjoyed the witty banter, fun storyline and the representation that this book has."
"This story was engaging, magical, and real. I found myself rooting for the characters, yet relating to their personal issues despite their political scenarios. I thought this novel exemplified bisexual discovery in a great way and had me hoping for that happily ever after in the end (you'll have to read to find out).This has become one of my favorite novels, I highly recommend."
"I heard about this book online and was very excited to read it, only to find out it EXCEEDED my expectations by a landslide. The romance in this book is pure and very ...dirty... The characters and their relationships are very hilarious and raunchy, and the plot lines are easy and exciting to follow. PLEASE read this book, you will not regret it"
It has been a while since I have inhaled a book as I did this one.  As I have literally laughed out loud a I did with this one.  As I have cried from being heartbroken for characters and from being so happy for them too.This book is a true gem .  One I will read again!!!!
"Delightfully amusing novel for our times. Starts from a different 2016 result and the families of PRES AND VP who have their own issues to deal with. Well written with sensitivity, yet humor, and awareness of these issues.  Highly recommended to all readers, straight, gay or whatever orientation."
"Just finished Red, White, and Royal Blue. It was soooo incredibly good. It was so different in the way of the authors voice, but it totally worked. It was funny, thought-provoking, intelligent, romantic, real and a little long-winded at times. But overall... AMAZING! I really loved it!"
"I adored this book. Inhaled it all at once, unable to stop reading, unable to put it down for the need to root on for these characters and for this hopeful, wonderful version of 2016/2020 and our general world. For the romance reader, it has everything you’d ever want or need plus wit, humor, and snarky spark. I CANNOT EXPRESS how happy this book made me. I’m so glad it’s in the world."
"There have been a few books that I've read that have had a profound impact on me and I can honestly say that Red, White & Royal Blue is one of those books. I have been spreading the gospel of RW&RB to all of my friends and fellow Book Club members & every single person who has read it has become just as obsessed with it as me. Mind you, this is my second copy - the first is still making its rounds amongst book club friends. Thank you Casey McQuiston!!! Sequel please!"
"i read this book all in one sitting this past sunday and i have to say, im completely here for how much it was hyped up. i havent been able to read much of my share of LGBTQ+ books due to the fact that theres not many that catch my eye, but i was recommended this and had to read it. its definitely a cliche somewhere in the definition, but i enjoyed it immensely and really connected to how alex was feeling a lot of the time.tl;dr - amazing book, good LGBTQ+ read"
This book is everything. It is so good.  It was so funny and sweet. I laughed so much and it has something that made me fall on love with the book.  I loved Alex.. I'm from Texas and Hispanic all I could really relate to him. I loved the book cause love is love.
"Early into the book, it becomes obvious what the plot is  The characters are well defined and interesting. However, the book sinks to a level of negative stereotyping that isn't necessary for the storyline  Overall, it's a love story, albeit, a very predictable one."
I want to live in the world of Alex and Henry and President Mom. This book is sweet and ridiculously sappy and I loved every minute of it. And having openly bi characters was so wonderful. It's nice to not be ignored/erased for a change.
I am so excited to start reading this since its been recommended by s many people but when I received this book it was damaged all along the sides (especially the bottom). That's the only issue I can see as of now but I'll update once I read it
"A delightful, big-hearted rom-com about two young men finding themselves - and each other.Humor, friendship, love.Political scheming and palace protocol.Loved every page!"
"This book is really sweet and delightful.  It's a classic enemies-to-lovers and it works because the characters (including supporting characters) are smart and funny.  Clearly implausible in various ways, but that is all part of the fun."
I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I loved everything about Alex and Henry. This book was hilarious in some places and sad in others. One thing I can say is that there is never a dull moment with this book. Highly recommend.
"The first third of the book was very funny, next third was harder to read but it was worth finishing and the author’s intent admirable - providing a fun romp in trying times."
"Wasn't sure if I would like this one, but it turned out to be an amazing book. I read it very quickly because of how much I enjoyed it. The humor in the book was great, as was the plot and the serious moments. Definitely a recommended read."
"This was an expensive e-book, but I splurged after seeing it recommended on several sites.  In short, it was worth it.  Completely indulgent and just the thing for a weekend fun read.  Well written and great characters."
"Alex and Henry, public figures, learn how to live their lives on their own terms amidst dirty politics and mainstream expectations. Enjoyable read and gives us hope for our next US election in 2020."
"Loved the story! I was thinking about where it was going while at work, worried they wouldn’t get it to work/how the author was going to get to the next step, etc. It was a great story and nice trip back to Texas."
"I thought it was an interesting idea. Then I grew to love the characters, flawed but good people. The story sure took me for a ride. The clash of the American and British cultures was done well. It had me laughing and cursing and I even put it down for a day, not because it was unreal, it was too real. Despite nearly impossible difficulties the story resolved in a feel good way. I was thoroughly entertained. Thank you."
This was a cute and often funny  if improbable story. If you are looking for really explicit pornographic  descriptions of gay sex you will be disappointed. It is soft porn at most and is more about the emotional development of a relationship. The text and email messages are particularly effective as is the inclusion of quotes from the communications of well known people in suspected same sex liaisons through history.
I got this book out of curiosity as everyone was comparing it to the Young Royals TV series which I thoroughly enjoyed. I must say it exceeded my expectations and kept me hooked through a single-sitting read! Family and Friendship ftw!
I had so much fun reading this book. Loved the love story. And the Palace (and White House) intrigue. And the clever writing and so many of the characters. Can't wait for the movie!!!!!!!
"When I saw the negative reviews for this book saying it was ""too political"", I just knew I had to read it. I love political dramas! Even so, I didn't find it overly political at all. I thought it was exactly as political as you'd expect a love story about the Prince of Wales and America's first son to be. It was beautifully written, and I fell in love with the characters and their story instantly.  I couldn't put it down. Definitely read this book if you love a well-written, forbidden love story."
"I’ve never written an Amazon review.... let alone a review anywhere.  However, this book is the most hilarious, witty, one-more-chapter-and-it’s-3 am piece of literature I have ever read.  I never imagined you could take West Wing, Love, Simon, and the Princess Diaries and just throw them together into literary genius.  The characters, although fantastical, are relatable and you will instantly fall in love with them!  BUY THIS BOOK, demand a sequel, and annoy them to make a movie series or movie!"
The book was entertaining but not for me. Too many detailed sex scenes and it was cringy at times. I like the idea of the story and what it stands for. I think if U like Romantic books this would be a great fit. For me I need more mystery or shock value.
"As a lover of romantic fiction, this novel has quickly become one of my favorite reads. The characters are so sweetly fleshed out, and as someone who identifies with the characters closely, it is a beautiful experience to see them grow and become human. The book is easy to read, and the plot is easy to follow along. If you have a few hours to spare, this book will most surely be worth your time."
"100% must read - I loved how much character development went into this book, and how it was written in a modern way to appeal to the ages without being cheesy. For someone who is barely an occasional reader, I would choose this book over any tv show or movie (though it desperately needs to be turned into a limited series of its own)."
"A heartbreaking story, but luckily it has a happy ending. Hopefully, one day, things can really be like this. Politics are a dirty game and royalty is not something anyone should want to be, but Alex and Henry somehow seem to make it happen."
"This story was absolutely beautiful. With so many characters to fall in love with. With Henry and Alex to fall in love with. Forbidden romance, tension, discovering yourself, all so beautifully written. I usually don’t read romance novels but this one had been catching my eye for some time and I’m so so happy I picked it up and finished it in the span of 36 hrs. This story will definitely stay in my heart ❤️"
"Red,White & Royal Blue || Book Review“Thinking about history makes me wonder how I’ll fit into it one day, I guess. And you too. I kinda wish people still wrote like that. History, huh? Bet we could make some.”- Casey McQuiston, Red, White & Royal Blue“Take anything you want and know you deserve it.”- Casey McQuiston, Red,White & Royal BlueFinished Red,White and Royal Blue over the weekend, guys you have to read it and experience it for yourself. This book had me crying and laughing out loud - A relationship between the first son of the president of the United States a 🇺🇸 and the Prince of Wales."
"Such a fun read, went so quick. I woke up one morning and read before work which I have never done before - I was just so enthralled in the story.  You won't regret reading it!"
"In the midst of a pandemic where I have felt particularly alone, this book reminded me of the joys of life that are yet to come. Reading this book I feel seen and heard as a gay man and I applauded Casey for encapsulating such an essential part of who I am in such a beautiful way. I cannot recommend this book enough. If you or a loved one just so happen to be gay and looking for a heartwarming story that is thoroughly and AUTHENTICALLY queer, give this book a shot, you won’t regret it."
"I loved this book and I am going to read it again right away.  It is truly a love story, a modern brave love story.  I even loved all of the characters!!!  I cannot wait to read her next novel"
"I'm a very picky reader, and I loved everything about this book! It's sweet and romantic, funny and sarcastic. The only quibble I have is that as the younger son, Henry couldn't be the Prince of Wales. But that's so minor I didn't even care. I know I'm going to re-read this book over and over."
"This book had me grinning like an idiot the entire time. Alex and Henry are so pure i love them. I loved seeing Alex's growth throughout the story, his relationship with his family and friends, and Henry's  journey to self acceptance and finding courage. This book deserves all the hype it gets."
I have never read a book that has made me so happy.The book has given me hope for the future of this country.Love is Love no matter who it is.Three cheers for this author.Read this book and be happy.
I LOVE THIS. This book is amazing and I cannot wait to read more by this author. I cannot put into words how much I loved this book. It was not a simple romance book because it dealt with many difficult topics in a fantastic way. UGH to say I kinda loved this book is an understatement. THANK YOU.
"It was one of the best books in this genre I have ever read. I absolutely enjoyed it, laughed a lot, cried even more and was very happy in the end. I recommend it to everybody. But if want to be absolutely honest, it bothered me a bit that the references to the british monarchy was inaccurate. The titles, the protocols, the way of successon, etc.  I think if these thing would be realistic, this book could be the best, not just one of the bests to me."
This was such a fun read.  It’s a great boy-meets-boy love story except they are both very famous.  ;-) It is a cute read that also entertains and keeps you engaged in light antics. I cant wait to read more from this author.
"Despite having its moments, which are too few and far between, it was like reading incredibly horrible fan fiction set in an AU where bad boy Prince Harry whose father is not Prince Charles, has never partied, had a royal scandal, or been photographed doing anything inappropriate. It’s so bad it’s laughable, literally."
seriously get this book right now. it’s witty and interesting and their love story is so cute. such a great lgbtq book and really shines light on the difficulty of coming out and facing who you are. definitely would recommend it.
"I read this book because my best friend nagged me for months that I should. I put it off, offering up excuse after excuse. But then I read it on a transatlantic flight from (of all places) the US to the UK. I was so overwhelming surprised by how hopeful, sincere, and heartfelt this book was. It was as if I could hold Henry and Alex's trembling dreams in my palms. Truly, a wondrous and poetic adventure into love and its consequences. Now, I will nag all of you: READ THIS!"
I loved Alex and Henry. I needed more from them and less about the other staff. This book is overhyped in my opinion but then reading is subjective. I enjoyed parts of it especially the Alex and Henry parts. I wished I could've heard from Henry's POV. It was also a difficult read.
Great relationship build up! I'm not a fan of the political aspect of the story but it was mild and the main characters won my heart and completely overshadowed anything else.
"As usual, I just wish it didn't end.  I am hoping maybe for a sequel.  But I really enjoyed the book, story line, and just, everything.!  Thank you!"
"I loved the plot and it was delivered fairly well. I don’t think I’ll ever take the time to read it in its entirety again, but I enjoyed the story and I really liked Alex and Henry and the rest of the crew."
I really enjoyed this book.I loved everything about it .the love story was so beautiful .I loved how it was very modern and pretty much included today's technology and social media influence.I loved everything !the drama the love the funny sarcastic scenes  would definitely love it if there was a second book made.
I wasn't sure what to say about this book.  I got through it but it was not an easy read.
"Loved this twist on an enemy-to-lover story. Entwining politics, international relations, solid friends, and an adorable couple. Just precious and lovely."
So this isn’t about the story but the actual quality of the physical book. My book has pages coming out. I’m only 100 pages in and like 15 pages are not bound in correctly. This is so disappointing and kind of enraging. Do they not perform quality checks in their products?
"This book was funny, witty, and full of romance. You got to watch the love story unfold slowly and beautifully. Despite everything happening in the book, there wasn’t a moment I was angry at the characters or upset with the author for the way the story was headed. It was sweet, loving, and hilarious. 12/10 👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻"
"I. Loved. This. Book! It was fantastic and witty and charming and romantic. It was just what my soul needed right now. I loved all of the characters and her writing style! I would love, love, love if this became a movie!!! I could also read an entire book of their emails back and forth to each other. Well done indeed!"
"Overall, I liked the tone of the book, the hope generated throughout the story.I wasn't really fond of some of the text message chapters as they would throw me out of the story for a bit.Still, a good solid read, and a pleasant way to spend  a few hours."
"This book came highly recommended. Those recommending it didn't mention its about gay sex. When I figured that out I put it down. Sorry, but I don't swing that way and am not interested in it. For those who do, it seems they find it a pleasant romance."
"Just no, style if writing is very immature and the protagonist is shallow, both in written style and character. Could not bare any more torture and called it quits a few chapters in, after reading other reviews in search of motivation to carry on."
This was an impressive achievement and a freaking awesome book. A delight on every page. I am incredibly impressed and I’m a very picky reader!
"Nice easy contemporary read. Nothing groundbreaking, but the premise was well executed, the characters likable, and the alternate universe politcs were a lovely escape from current reality."
"I enjoyed reading this book. At first, I thought it was going to be a superficial read, but the second half of the book carries more momentum and maintains the interest of the reader. There are a few very moving moments."
"I was exhausted the next day at work after staying up half the night reading this book. Snappy characters, lots of great chemistry, and stellar pacing. Highly recommended."
I loved this. The plot. The characters. The banter. The absolutly adorable personalities of the main characters. The structure and detail that contributed to crafting this story. It was just a pleasing story to read and I'll definitely read it again.
"This is a great story with wonderful characters, who won’t be forgotten. I so wish it was true and I can’t help wondering what they are all doing now."
This novel was such a lovely story about finding yourself and falling in love. I laughed and felt the tender moments. I enjoyed all of it!
"Great book. Kept my interest. Alex, Henry and company are well formed and interesting. I want to read more from this author. Well done."
"Best romance novel I've ever read, and best new novel I've read this year. Couldn't put it down. The characters were believable and compelling; the dialogue felt totally natural. Yes, there are a couple tropes, but c'mon, this is romance! They were actually done well and enhanced the whole story for me. Definitely going to be looking for more from this author! Loved it!"
I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was such a fun and light read full of heart and hope during a trying time with our current political climate. I laughed and cried and escaped for every moment that I sat down to read a few pages. I’d highly recommend to anyone looking for a break and wanting to smile.
This is such a feel good book. I can’t put into words all the feelings I’m having at this moment. The story between Alex and Henry gives me hopes that being honest and true to ourselves at the end everything works out for the best. And I wish one day I get to see the fish female president of the United States
"I loved watching Alex and Henry fight, be friends, and fall in love. It's a great enemies to lovers romance. Both characters were a believable mix of smart about some things and dumb about others. Their emails and texts were by turns sweet and hilarious. Well worth reading."
The story itself is cliche and predictable but in a heartwarming comfort movie kind of way. Very well written with beautiful descriptions from an author I can’t wait to read more from.
This is such a cute romance about the FSOTUS and the Prince of Wales. I loved their romance and how their relationship develops over time. May not be for everyone but this is a quick read in-between novels or if you just want something fun to read about a political romance. Hoping this will get a sequel at some point to find out what happens to this couple and what more adventures they will have!
This story was read and suggested by one of my favorite authors so I decided to give it a try. It was awesome and exceeded my expectations! Alex and Henry’s story was truly moving and a must read!
"A delightful romance.  This story is funny, sweet, and joyful.  I really enjoyed the characters and watching them navigate the perils on politics."
"I really enjoyed this one!I didn’t expect the Texas connection, which really made it special, being my home state. So much insight there. A very entertaining book that was so successful that I see there is a movie being planned now as well.  Looking forward to that."
"But I did. A funny fantasy about how the U S  of A could be, we wish. Lots of gay sex. Very twenty-something in a way I never was, but with  some underlying serous notions. Read this while distancing from COVID 19. A much needed upper."
"As a fiery 23-year-old who almost went to law school but doubted herself, Alex Claremont-Diaz and his family and friends reminded me how important it is to be me, loudly, and to be authentic. To embrace my queerness. To love who I love unapologetically. If you’re like me, teetering between Gen Z and millennial and feeling behind in this world, please read this book. If you’re anyone, please read this book. I’m feeling immeasurable joy."
This is a beautiful story of love of two people in different countries. It makes if feel if y ou dream it just may come true.
"Once you accept the premise of the Love/Hate/Romance between the son of the first U.S. woman President and a prince of England, this book is interesting, well-written and fun.  The several well crafted and complex characters, and the trajectory of their lives, made it hard to put down and robbed me of sleep two nights in a row.  As the gay romance genre goes, this is a winner!"
This book is everything they said it would be and more. It lives up to the hype. Excellent in every way. Highly recommend.
"I don’t think I fully prepared myself for how much I was really going to love this book. When I preordered Red, White & Royal Blue all I knew was that it was gay and had politics. That’s like my two favorite things. That’s ALL you need to know. This is book has queer politics"
"This story started off slow, but as I read on it gained speed. I loved Alex, and Henry, they were wonderful. As all the other characters were. This story was well - written. Also it had a great storyline."
"I took a chance on an unknown author (to me) and I’m so glad I did! This book is the perfect antidote to the daily news. The main characters are wonderful, the story and plot are the perfect balance of angst and romance.  And I love the political story, a kind of MM West Wing. I wholeheartedly recommend this book."
"And a little bit hopeful. I totally appreciated the DC and nerdy politics parts and the character growth. I hope she writes more books, because I really enjoyed her style!"
I want to live in the world where this book is real. The characters are endearing and people I can see as friends. I love the positivity and hope that resounds with it as well.Loved this book!
"I love, love, love this book. It's so funny, and so hot, and it filled me with hope in a time where that can be hard to come by. It's an amazing read, I didn't want to put it down. The characters are so well drawn. I loved it."
"this is a stunning debut. it's not as it's flawless - some of the plot seemed to resolve so quickly, and some of the plot devices felt a little too rushed or simplistic, but overall it's a great read. looking forward to other, maybe more muture staff from the other, although for once it felt good to have an non tragic LGBT story. happy ending are sometimes so important."
"I was mesmerized with the story from page one, being gay I could relate to both Alex and Henry's struggles to be who they are, the character development is great, I couldn't help but fall in love with both and many of the side characters, I would love to see a squeal to this story, I hated to see it end. Thanks for the story, a definite book to reread!"
"A great read. I enjoyed the book very much. This was well written, full of emotion, and great characters. Recommend."
"It deserves all the stars. I waited a long time to read this story. It sat patiently in my Kindle library. Then, today I started it, finished it and felt new, hopeful and totally in love with Alex and Henry. And Casey too."
"Loved this wonderful love story between the President’s son and the Prince of England...The characters are lovely, and the love so touching....highly recommend."
"I've been recommending this delightful, thoughtful, fun and sharp read to everyone I know. I heartily endorse this book and the story it has to tell. It feels very relevant and very genuine. Get lost in Alex and Henry's story. You won't be sorry!"
"But it was easy better than just fun. A terrific group of characters in every way, each unique, but together what a crew! Love it with a smile on your face and years in your eyes."
This is a dream if mine as well for my home state texas:Going blue.The books length is long and good.
"I can't.  In a year as crazy and anxiety ridden as this one, where I'm on the verge of hiding or crying at any moment, this book had me smiling from ear to ear - genuinely in love with the characters.  What an amazing escape from reality this was."
"Loved this book, I hope they end up making it into a movie or even a series. I am also excited to read more from this author."
Absolutely beautiful novel and such a fun read! Wish I had stuff like this growing up but I’m glad it’s out!
"this story has everything - angst, fluff, smut, serious/important topics, humor, you name it it’s got it - it’s branded as a love story but it’s so much more!! if you’re in the mood for a roaring good time as well as all the gay look no further friends!"
it was good an funny what I read of it but I'm not a big fan of reading texting in books. and half of the book had that in it.
"This book was so cute and adorable, and also sexiiii af. It's not like high prose or anything, but it's an amazing romantic fluffy read for a die-hard democrat. Love"
"I like the book. It was awesome but the amazon copy I received had a few unevenly cut pages which does bother me a little but not too much. Other than that, it's a great read."
"Sweet romantic comedy set in an America I wished we lived in. The writer did a lot of telling, not showing, which pulled me out of it a bit. But overall very enjoyable."
"I have quite enjoyed the book. Read it in less than 12 hours and would definitely recommend it. Halfway through it I was so positively impressed by the author, I went and checked out her biography. I have been dumping novels half way through lately, because boring and unsubstantial. Well this novel convinced me. Good story, fluid prose, believable characters, nice settings.Worth it."
Just suspend reality and enjoy the snappy dialogue.  Very tame sex scenes.  Great summer read with a happy ending.
"Compelling, likable characters -- both main and minor -- along with a genuinely interesting romance and background plot? Instantly loved it. It only helps that the author clearly knows how to write and doesn't depend on the romance to be the main selling point -- even though it could be, with how good it is.Rated this five stars with zero doubts. I'm looking forward to more from this author. :)"
"I really enjoyed this book.  The characters are all fleshed out and well written.  The story is very close to our reality while also existing within its own.  I love the emotional growth that Alex goes through, not just with his relationships but also as a process of growing older.Highly recommend this book!"
"Despite all the hype surrounding this novel, it took me a long time to pick it up because I was very skeptical about the plot. I was very pleasantly surprised. This story is rewarding in every sense. Highly recommended!"
"it’s literally so good!! the writing is beautiful and the story is even better!! seriously, you should read it <3"
"So much fun! Devoured in one sitting! completely unbelievable of course, but that's part of the charm."
Such a cute book! Great for light read with a little romance/heat. There were times where I laughed out loud to myself while reading it as well. Finished it in two days!
"Red, White, & Royal Blue was such a refreshing book to read! The bisexual representation honestly brought me to happy tears a few times throughout the book. I finished reading it a few days ago and am already itching to read it again! Buy this book for simply wonderful escapist fiction!"
"Witty and creative, this novel takes on romcoms, and brings a new take to the traditional romance."
"A sophomoric piece with two dimensional characters, peppered with buzzwords to erect a facade of credibility, and a storyline that suffers from including too many thematic elements that are only tenuously connected in a plot."
"Even though you know how this is going to turn out in the end, the author has done a great job of investing in her characters and bringing them to life. The first third of the book is more about character development and this sets the stage for the remaining two thirds of the book. You end up rooting for the characters and their situations. The sex between the two main characters is downplayed vis-a-vis a lot of other M-M romances, but it works well for this setting."
Well I loved this book so much. Love the banter. Enemies to friends to lovers. I would love a novella for this couple.
I’ll admit when I read the concept for this book I thought it was going to be a cheesy read. I was very pleasantly surprised at how well the book was written. The characters are multidimensional and you fall in love when them quickly. I found myself highlighting so many quotes from the book as I feel they could apply to almost anyone. I hope this isn’t the last we see of Alex and Henry!
I was not a fan of this book. A lot of political biases and I found it even offensive at times. The characters are obnoxious. Way overhyped!
"I adored this book. Hilarious, hot, sweet, encouraging. Just a GOOD happy-ending romantic comedy. I'll definitely be reading it again!"
Great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great really great yup it is truly great.
"So this book is definitely straight in the romantic comedy genre but I’m so happy that for once, it showed the good side of being LGBTQI+ rather than the negative. Would love to see a hallmark movie based on this. And I only say hallmark because I think it would do better financially at that level than on a big screen."
"This book was exactly what I needed to read this year. An alternative 2020, a female president win in 2016, overcoming against all odds to be your true self and the beauty of a true love! Enjoyed the descriptive writing and quirky passionate intelligence characters immensely. Thank you!!"
"I couldn’t stop smiling through this entire novel. Except, I guess, during the parts I was crying at my desk at work because I couldn’t put this down long enough to not sneak chapters furtively under my desk. Truly a happy, hopeful, romantic, funny novel, and one I won’t soon forget."
I read this book rather quickly and I absolutely loved it!! I love Alex and Henry together and all of their supporters throughout the book!
"I have no buts with this book. It went straight up to my top three favorite books, that's the only straight thing I can say about this book. Henry is a national treasure and must be protected (and loved) at all costs. Don't hesitate and but and read it now! Been seating on my bookshelf for almost 7 months, worst mistake of my life. My serotonin levels went UP like they hadn't in months."
"I really loved this book, the characters were so lovable, but with depth. As Mexican I really liked the inclusiveness, Alex being part Mexican and proud of it, but not at all a stereotype,.This book made me sad, made me mad, but over all made happy and left me with a smile on my face."
I really enjoyed this book. It was heartfelt and earnest. The characters were all wonderful and sincere and the ending made me cry.
"This book truly captivates the essence of a “page turner” for someone who wants to invest themselves in a romance novel. It’s got romance, humor, and political drama all in one. I could not put this book down and find myself eager to encourage others to read it. Would highly recommend to anyone who wishes to enjoy"
That's how good this book is.You will want to see the White House Trio and Prince Henry in real life❤
Good book but probably would be appreciated more by high school kids. Must b open minded
"This book paint such a hopeful world that I really just want to live in it a little more, and I really want to see a sequel of power couple Henry and Alex, how their love grow/struggle/solidify etc, I want more of Luna! I want more of the gang! I just fell in love with them so hard I really want more of them. This book hangover is going to be a bitch to get over"
I am absolutely in love with this book!!! The characters are so well written adore it can't wait to finish but don't want it to end!!!
"Spoilers & Thoughts Below!!•Payback’s a Witch was an interesting sapphic romance book about three witches teaming up together for revenge.•This was a good read as there were moments I did enjoy however, the overall story was very slow-paced.•The small town feel and witchy element in this book was really nice. However, I would have liked just a bit more background and history on the town.•The plot itself while entertaining was a bit dull at times and the writing just didn’t really seem to flow.•I will say that I did enjoy the beginning as it felt somewhat like the movie “John Tucker Must Die” with the revenge plan. Though it doesn’t really continue in that direction, the revenge was still very satisfying.•Unfortunately, the witchy tournament in this book wasn’t that big of a storyline, which was disappointing because it seemed so interesting.•The main characters, Emmy and Talia were great. While they didn’t really have much character development their storylines were entertaining.•The romance between Emmy and Talia was well developed. They had great tension, chemistry, and banter. There was also some very light spicy scenes.•The ending did wrap up pretty quickly and I would have liked a short epilogue but it was still a nice conclusion.•Overall, an enjoyable read filled with magic, witches, and revenge."
"All the autumnal vibes, all the witchy flair, the perfect dose of queer love and heat, and amazing bi-rep. I was sucked straight into the magical town of Thistle Grove and never wanted to leave."
I haven’t actually read this book yet however the cover is stunning I’ve seen great reviews the book arrived in perfect condition and I can’t wait to read this book and support this author!
"A delightful October read. An adventure, love-story and tale of family and deep friendship. Loved it."
This book was simply enchanting.  Harper’s great talent is evident  in this wonderful blend of romance and fantasy.  Highly recommend!
"1 part PG-13 Harry Potter, 1 Part Hocus Pocus, 1 part The Other Woman *chefs kiss*"
Absolutely spellbinding. This story of coming home and finding your place in the world and learning how to accept yourself set in a spooky and thrilling Halloween town is a perfect fall read.
"Entertaining and fun fantasy/romance.  Emmy Harlow returns to her hometown of Thistle Grove for the Gauntlet of the Grove tournament held every fifty years.  Three of the four founding families scions get to compete and the Harlow house scion is the Arbiter.  (Think Tri Warzard Tournament from Harry Potter.)Emmy has left home and magic behind for nine years going to college and working in Chicago.  She left after a broken romance leaves her doubting herself and her place in Thistle Grove.  She returns home to honor tradition without plans of staying.  Emmy reunites with her best friend Linden Thorn and Natalia Avramov witches from two of the houses.  They find that all three have been dumped by Gareth Blackmore of the fourth house and decide to work together to beat him if they can.Fantasy is not my genre but I was captivated by the story.  I love the existence of the town and all its Halloweenie charms.  The story includes heartbreak, coming home, importance of family and finding love.  Lana Harper creates a magical world where I was rooting in the challenges and for the romance.  For anyone who enjoys fantasy, witches, and sapphic romance.  (4.5 stars)"
"It is an LBTQ romance about three scorned witches who aim to break down the warlock that broke their hearts at different times but instead find love together and the true meaning of roots. The tagline for this book is a comparison to the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina and a romance. I could not watch all of that show as it eventually went far off the rails from what I enjoyed in that show and much prefer the other milder version of Sabrina. This book took the best part of that show and wove a story about family competitions, magic roots calling you home, and friendship, and of course, a very well thought out sweet romance. I appreciated that I knew ahead of time that this would have a romantic vibe, but it did not feel overwhelming or took away from the story's point. The competition between the four ruling families was well thought out and, for once, not predictable in the twist. Lana Harper has a good start with this series, and the sequel coming up in 2022, I am sure, will not disappoint."
"Emmy Harlow is back in Thistle Grove after nine long magicless years. Thistle Grove witches draw their power from the town so the further away they are, the weaker they become. It probably doesn’t help that the Harlow’s are considered the weakest witches in the town. Which is in part why Emmy left and never came back. The other part was Gareth Blackmoore stomping on her heart because he was part of the most powerful magical family in town and could never be with a Harlow.A magical tournament brings Emmy back to town and to make matters worse Gareth doesn’t recognize her. Emmy finds out that her best friend Linden Thorn was also scorned by Gareth as was the beautiful and scary Talia Avramov. Together they team up to get revenge on Gareth, along the way Emmy finds herself enchanted by Talia. But will Emmy’s past still threaten to keep her from embracing Thistle Grove and Talia?Payback’s a Witch was the perfect witchy blend of humor, steam, and serious moments. Emmy’s journey of self-discovery and growth as she returned to her beloved hometown was relatable.I loved the witchcraft elements. I appreciated how real it felt that Emmy was torn between her obligation to her family and her past. The moments when Emmy realized what she really wanted and what she had let define her felt vulnerable in the best way. I thought that Emmy and Talia both complimented each other well and was rooting for them from the beginning. I love that their sexualities were never questioned and their relationship was accepted.I do wish that there had been a little more detail when it comes to world-building because I really wanted to see more of this spooky and witchy town!The best part is that this is just book one in Lana Harper’s new series The Witches of Thistle Grove! The sneak peek of From Bad to Cursed has me wishing it was out already!"
"This was a fun contemporary fantasy romance about witches in a small Illinois town vying to win a spellcasting tournament among the town's founder families.Emmy Harlow is a witch with very little powers who left her small witchy town of Thistle Grove, Illinois to make her way in Chicago. Although she's been gone for 9 years, she relents to her parent's wishes and returns to town to fulfill her family's duty to be the arbiter of the spellcasting tournament. Once in town, she's confronted with Gareth, the boy that broke her heart and caused her to leave town, but also meets Talia, a powerful bad-ass witch who is fresh off a break-up with Gareth as well.Three founder families vie for the spellcaster crown. Emmy's best friend Linden belongs to one family, Talia belongs to the second family, and Gareth belongs to the third family. Talia and Linden's family decide to band together to defeat Gareth. Emmy must remain neutral in the tournament, despite the growing attraction between her and Talia.This was a fun book about Emmy's journey to make peace with herself and her hometown. The author does a pretty good job of depicting Emmy's struggle, especially when she has to confront harsh truths about her role in deciding to run away from her problems. The supporting characters weren't fleshed out too much and were there mainly to react to Emmy. The story was pretty typical scorned girls get revenge on mean boy, but it was fun to see how the author got there.I received a complimentary copy of this book. All opinions are my own."
"Chilling Adventures of Sabrina meets The L Word in this fresh, sizzling rom-com by Lana Harper.Thank you to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing Group for the opportunity to read and review an advanced readers copy of this book. This in no way affects my review, all opinions are my own.I'm feeling a little conflicted about this book. To start, I thought the premise and setting of this story was incredible. It was giving me all of the spooky, witchy, fall vibes that I crave this time of year. The descriptions of Thistle Grove were enchanting and really made me feel like I was in a Salem-esque magical town. I was so excited for the magical tournament and thought the trials were creative and interesting.Sadly this book just felt so slow to me. At about the halfway mark I wasn't really excited to pick it up anymore. Luckily it picked back up again towards the end, but the focus on small details outside of the competition left me feeling uninterested in the story and the characters' relationships. I wish the romance aspect was a little stronger so that I at least felt invested in Emmy and Talia, but even their romance fell a little flat.I still feel like others might enjoy this one, but unfortunately it wasn't really for me. I did appreciate the spookiness of it overall and think that future books in this series could have potential with the strong setting of Thistle Grove."
"I admit that when I decided to read this book, it wasn’t the paranormal mystery I thought it would be. That is OK, because this was a very good book. Emmy is coming back home after being away from years, and she is still a little bit broken from the reason she left. This book explores the journey Emmy takes to get her life back on track and maybe find love in the meantime. I really liked the scenes where they were in the magical contest, and I thought that Emmy and Talia make such a great couple. Well-written and fun, I would be happy to visit this world again to see what happens in the great little town of Thistle Grove. Recommend. I was provided a complimentary copy which I voluntarily reviewed."
"Payback’s a Witch is a magical, sapphic, friends-to-lovers romantic comedy with revenge seekers and discovering where you belong.Emmy Harlow left Thistle Grove years ago to try to discover herself after a breakup that devastated her. Now she’s come back to participate in The Gauntlet, that occurs every year and is won every year by Gareth, the ex, and his family.Emmy, her best friend, Linden, and Talia discover that they all have something in common, Gareth. They all devise a plan to get their revenge on Gareth and The Gauntlet is the perfect opportunity.The tournament is where the slow burn begins between Talia and Emmy. I loved the development of Emmy and Talia relationship. The relationship isn’t rushed and feels natural. And the angst. I love a good slow burn with angst.While the romance (which is amazing) and revenge (also amazing) is a key storyline in Payback is Witch, the real treat is Harper’s descriptive writing. Her world building and descriptions of Thistle Grove create an enchanting town with histories and secrets that I already want to read more about.Payback’s a Witch is a sexy, magical romance. With amazingly relatable characters, enchanting writing, and witty dialogue, I read this is one sitting. A perfect, magical and witchy read for October."
"It's all in the title -- PAYBACK'S A WITCH is a wild romp of a book and one of my favorite parts was the setting of Thistle Grove, which felt like the epitome of everything I adore about Halloween season: magic, cozy (and spicy!) apple cider vibes, and characters who have to let down their metaphorical ""masks"" to find love. Bonus is the voice: Lana Harper is a confident, clever writer and it completely shines through."
"I'm thoroughly enjoying the current trend for ""witchy"" romance, and Payback's a Witch was a thoroughly enjoyable ride. The chemistry between Emmy and Talia was hot and it was a treat watching the trio (Emmy, Talia, and Linden, with the help of her brother) attempt to take down a common enemy. But I think my favorite part was watching Emmy rediscover her love for Thistle Grove and its traditions and her family's magic. The writing was beautiful and filled with lush descriptions of the town and the spells. I felt like I was right there with them. Looking forward to the next book in this series.Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for my complimentary ARC. All opinions are my own."
"The romance in this was hot, the magical town was really interesting, and I really liked the treasure hunt/magical competition. I wish the relationships between characters had been better developed and given more depth, particularly the best friendship and the main romance, but in general every relationship, like Emmy's relationships with her family, could have used more detail. We get a lot about what she feels about magic, but what about all these human beings? I also wish the town, the witch society, and magic system had more development (but that could just be because I'm a huge nerd). I'd read the sequel to see if there's more detail to things there."
"The setting in this book is so vivid and beautiful--when I finished reading, I wanted to start it over again so I could stay in Thistle Grove a little longer. The romance between Emmy and Talia is engaging, and I especially appreciate how their developing relationship is interwoven with Emmy's self-discovery and the spellcasting tournament. Really well done and the dialogue offers many laugh-out-loud lines."
"Three strikes, and I’m out. I REALLY struggled to connect to this book, but it’s such a highly anticipated read that I initially figured that it was just me. I set it down twice, and when I still wasn’t connecting on my third attempt, I started skimming. Things did not improve.From the start, I struggled with the writing style. I don't usually have trouble with third person perspective, but there are so many characters that it adds another layer of disconnect. I felt like an outsider looking in, and I frequently struggled to understand who was supposed to be talking. And all of those characters? Make the story feel scattered - and SUPER LONG. I was bored. So, so bored. It takes a long time before the romance even starts developing, and by that point I had already disconnected. Add in a storyline that's pretty complex, kinda preachy, and not necessarily reality-based... and I was done.I'm sure many readers will love this. I did like how unique it felt, and the representation is definitely there. The writing is technically good in a lot of ways, and there will certainly be an audience for this. Younger readers and those who like found families, coming of age stories, and fantasy/time travel elements will probably connect to it the most. I so appreciated receiving an early copy (and am voluntarily leaving a review), but this just didn't live up to the hype for me."
"The history of Jane and her life is fascinating, with insights into historic queer happenings across the US during the 70's, but also to do with race and politics. The cultural differences between Jane and her 70's punk activist vibe, and August's own millennial existential anxiety is amusing yet believable.The writing is beautifully done, it's so emotional and evocative and I highlighted so many lines of dialogue that just touched me deeply. I'm truly in awe that the author was able to make what could have been seedy sex in the subway, something sensual. I never thought I'd say that.I would highly recommend it to all WLW / LESFIC lovers! Even if you're not necessarily into mysteries, scifi, historic, or even young adult/new adult - I think this story overall just works so incredibly well no matter what genre you want to prescribe to it, because ultimately it's just about PEOPLE and their connections and longing to find a place and community in the world with some direction and meaning. Plus a beautiful love story."
"August Landry has come to New York to either lose herself or find herself.  She hasn’t decided which one yet.  She only knows that the city somehow makes her feel less alone.Thanks to her brash and lovable new roommates, she quickly lands a job at Pancake Billy’s so she can avoid becoming the poster child for starving students everywhere.  She’s even getting the hang of the NYC subway system.On her first day of class, everything that can go wrong does so in spades.  She’s injured, tired and drowning in spilled coffee The last place that she expects someone to show her compassion is on the Q.  But a girl names Jane gives her a scarf and a smile that upends her entire universe.Every day that she finds out more about her Subway Girl, the more mysterious she becomes.  August discovers that the universe is far more vast that she ever thought – and that love can truly hold it all together.I began this book thinking that there was little chance of Casey McQuiston topping her amazing 2019 debut – Red, White & Royal Blue. Oh how fabulously wrong I was!With One Last Stop, she strikes that rare balance of heartbreaking and hopeful with real precision. It’s a story that you just don’t read, you immerse yourself in it.  From the unconditional warmth and acceptance of August’s newfound friends to the soul shattering longing and love that she shares with Jane – the words become feelings.  And this book feels a lot like finally coming home…"
"How can this come from the author of the dazzling Red, White and Royal Blue, which immediately drew me in and was so sharp, witty and ALIVE, while this story is so flat, drawn out and frankly boring? I never connected with the characters. (Crucial!) August was plain boring and Jane, well, she might have been interesting if her whole identity had not been such a mystery and slowly evolved. I had to force myself to read this and ended up skimming because I just couldn't connect or care."
"One Last Stop was captivating and delightful; it was everything I hoped it would be. I felt so lucky to receive an ARC! As soon as August met Jane on the subway, I literally couldn’t put the book down and read it in two sittings. I found myself deeply curious about the mystery of why Jane cannot leave the subway, the lives of August’s many roommates, and of course the magical love story at the heart of it all.I don’t know how McQuiston has managed to pen experiences and emotions that feel so specific yet relatable. The witty banter and references were scarily accurate! They perfectly capture the sense of being young in a big city and finding a chosen family, while reaching for impossible love. The supporting cast creates a fantastic sense of community and acceptance. Readers will find themselves drawn into a wonderful LGBTQ+ family along with August.One Last Stop is the type of book that will constantly occupy your thoughts when you aren’t reading it. This book steams with the warmth of summer, fragrant sweet pancakes, and hungry kisses in the dark. I highlighted so many quotes! All the truths and jokes combine into a beautiful and compelling prose. Against a sunset-drenched skyline, McQuiston brings the heat and longing of an unlikely love to a scorching crescendo.August and Jane quickly stole my heart and I can’t emphasize enough how much you won’t want to miss out on this love story! I highly recommend this book to everyone- especially anyone who’s ever wondered about a cute stranger on public transportation.  Thank you so much to Casey McQuiston, St. Martin’s Griffin, and Netgalley for a free ARC in exchange for an honest review."
"I went in on this book because I wanted to give McQuiston another chance - I don't love modern royalty or enemies to lovers for RWRB really didn't land for me. But I am also not a natural romcom reader and don't love single POV books... But this book is beyond brilliant. I emoted pretty much constantly: laughing out loud, reading multiple parts to my permanent roommate, and sobbing - in many places including while drinking coffee and riding in the car.There are so many layers to this book. August learning who she is, finding herself, and this journey to being someone she loves is a delight to read and really hit me in the chest. (Everyone went through this stage, right?) There is the queer history of what it was like to be gay in the 1970s - the good, the bad, and the utterly heartbreaking parts of it. Then there is Jane - a swooning, punk rock riot girlfriend that I didn't know I needed. Not to mention the representative, loving and beautiful found family that August - and by default Jane - finds in New York.Stars: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Steam: 🔥🔥.5Tropes: found family, self-discovery, opposites attract, metaphysical love, solve a mysteryFor Fans Of: Sliding Doors, NYC coming of age storiesSubgenre: Contemporary Romance - LGBTQ+ romanceCW/ TW: mentions of homophobia, mentions of racism, mentions of drug and alcohol use and abuse, mentions of financial insecurity"
"I love the cast of characters and all of their relationships, and I laughed a lot as I read.What I appreciate so much about McQuiston's work so far is how rooted in time they are. And that feels like a weird thing to say when it's all been in alternate 2020s, and it's especially weird here, with Jane displaced in time. But I think mostly I mean that our collective and individual histories matter, and sometimes the reluctance to place a contemporary book in time, in an attempt to avoid it dating itself, removes some of the possibility of those histories, or at least their concreteness.And here, histories matter -- the late 1960s and 1970s in San Francisco, New Orleans, and New York; the 2000s in and around New Orleans; the 2010s into pre-pandemic-like 2020 in New York. I have this tagged as tropical-cyclones because August would not be the character she is here without Katrina, and that is shown repeatedly. New York would also not be the New York August and Jane share without Sandy, and that's much more subtle, but it's in the text too. The threads of queer history here are more central and more important, but all of it matters for making this feel so real."
"This is Ms. Casey McQuiston’s sophomore novel and she’s now officially an auto buy author for me.I loved this book, especially the characters! This found family, Groupon of ragtag misfits. The main character, August, was so closed off and cute. I loved seeing her get comfortable and be herself around people. Seeing her finding herself and coming out of her shell and being open was so gratifying to read. Jane was a sweet badass. The romance between the two was sweet and progressed nicely. It was so relatable.The side characters were just as amazing and super entertaining. Myla was my favorite. She made me LOL so much in this book. She was a reflection of myself with her personality. There were so many funny and magical moments. I had a big, goofy smile on my face reading this. It made me want to go back in time to my 20’s and live in NY so I could be like these characters. Also, I really started to crave pancakes. I need a place like Billy’s.There were some plot twists and connections I didn’t see coming. This is a cute, feel good story about finding yourself, learning to open up, hope, and believe in love.HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Read this story about cute girls falling in love with each other on a train that transcends time."
"Casey McQuiston has done it again, taking a pretty wild concept for a romance and making the story between the characters feel extremely grounded and genuine. A sapphic romance between a woman displaced from the 1970s who is stuck on the subway and a new arrival to New York City who is trying to figure out what to do with her life? Sign me up!One of my favorite tropes is when a character from the past is somehow transported to present day. It provides a fun and interesting way to comment on how society has progressed and what things unfortunately still need to be changed. I loved all the moments in the book that brought up queer history and what life was like for Jane in the 70s compared with August’s life in the present day. Seeing the past and present queer communities represented in the book was lovely.Something that I think Casey does really well is create an amazing cast of supporting characters outside of the main couple. I end up caring just as much about all the friendships and side romances as I do with the main one. I was instantly swept away by everything in this story. The romance, the mystery, the friendships, and the personal journey that August goes on. There are funny moments, heartfelt moments, and super steamy moments. Definitely check this one out!Thank you to the publisher for providing an advance copy via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."
"""Truth is, when you spend your whole life alone, it's incredibly appealing to move somewhere big enough to get lost in, where being alone looks like a choice.""This book is a contemporary time travel sapphic romance, except only one person has been caught in time. The romance in this book was absolutely beautiful. I love Jane and August. I love the slow burn chemistry of their interactions and the slowly falling into love.There was also a found family. August moves into an appartment with three other people when she first comes to New York, right at the beginning of the book. Niko (a trans psychic) is my absolute favorite, and so is his girlfriend, Myla. They both are so supportive to August. Then we have the other roommate, Wes. Wes has a crush on the drag queen that lives across the hall, who also becomes apart of this found family. I loved these characters so much.What I didn't enjoy was the big reveal towards the end. August's mother has been trying to solve a mystery that had to do with her brother and the big reveal felt extremely convenient. I didn't like how it was staged. Almost like it was fit into the plot just to sew up a loose end.I would have loved to have seen this story go further at the end. I would have loved to have seen more of Jane and how everything worked out. To me the ending wasn't as developed as I would have liked.Overall, I really enjoyed this. But to me, it didn't quite live up to the hype. I loved message that love can transcend time, but I didn't love that the relationship didn't get expounded upon outside the train."
"I absolutely hate it when I read one of my most anticipated new releases and I don't love it. It makes me feel broken inside. Let me start off by saying that I loved every character in this book with everything in me. I mean the found family is chefs kiss amazing. I loved the glimpses of Jane's past, and I loved August's notebooks. I was a little skeptical about the premise of the book from the beginning, and for me it was okay. I wouldn't say that I will run out and read another book with this premise. I feel like there were a lot of random twist and plots thrown in, just to keep the story going. I mean obviously Jane is stuck on a train, so the whole book couldn't take place just on the train but I found myself getting bored, and it felt like the book was too long.  As far as the relationship/chemistry I enjoyed it. Jane and August were definitely in to each other ( I was only slightly horrified that Jane should have been old enough to be August's grandmother), I loved their banter, and their nicknames. It is not overly steamy, but definitely packed some heat (I was only slightly grossed out that most of that steam took place on a train). I wish that we could have seen more of Jane off of the train. I wish we could have seen Jane go to see her family. Ultimately while I did enjoy this book, it will not go down as my favorite, but I will  still 100% pick up anything that Casey McQuiston writes."
"When I started reading OLS, I thought oddball time travel rom-com. August, a newcomer to NYC, meets a tall drink of water, Jane, who saves her from a bad case of embarrassment. It doesn’t take long for August to realize that her new crush is from the past and stuck on the New York subway, seemingly forever. If nothing else, August is a problem solver and rescuing Jane becomes her focus, then her purpose. Untethered to family or career, August has been wandering from place to place trying to find something that’s always beyond reach. She’s 23 years old.And then suddenly the book becomes something else. A love letter to love, an homage to New York City, something so special in a very specific way. The kind of book that people see themselves in and take what they need from it. A book that people will say is a classic already.The writing itself is crackerjack sharp and all of the characters, main and secondary, are singularly unique and will live long in my mind. There are times too when the author just flat out spins some gorgeous phrases that made me stop. Just stop. The storylines invoke past, present, and future. They’re intricate and are brought together perfectly. Be prepared for a little heart sting but in the end, one of the best books that I’ve read in a very long time."
"I literally joined NetGalley for the chance to get to read this book early... and it did not disappoint. After I finished Casey's Red, White & Royal Blue I was all in to make sure and grab any other books she released... and when I heard about OLS, I knew I couldn't wait for it!OLS is a love letter to NY told through one of the most NY things ever- the subway.  It is not glamorous or maybe what you think of first when you think of NY... but it is absolutely the most perfect setting for this story.I don't know how to explain this story much without giving it away- but I think the ""Missed Connections"" references is kind of the best way.  Who hasn't gotten on the subway before and looked up to someone who you wished you knew.  One part romance, one part love letter to NY and one part magic... this story captivated me from the start.  I loved August and Jane. I loved their merry band of misfit friends. There are some stories there that I am hoping will get told!OLS is the perfect romance, with a side of magic thrown in. I am in love.  Can't wait to see what she writes next.Thank you to NetGalley for the ARC."
"Have you ever read a book and immediately known that it will be one you’re going to be obsessed with? Just like with Red, White and Royal Blue, I knew within a couple chapters of One Last Stop that I was reading a new favorite book. To be honest, I heard the phrases ""time traveling lesbians"" and ""stuck on the subway"" and knew that I was going to love this story.And this book was perfection! Absolute perfection! The characters! The setting! The romance! The found family aspect of it! The time travel element! It was everything my little queer bisexual heart wanted and needed it to be plus so much more! This review could be pages and pages of me raving about how much I loved this book but I will limit myself and just urge you to go pick it up immediately and read it.I can't wait to see what Casey McQuiston writes next because I need more of their queer romcoms in my life!"
"I've been waiting for this book since the moment I finished Casey's first book, Red, White, and Royal Blue (my very first read for 2020!) I just want to make sure every single person read RWRB knows that One Last Stop was totally worth the wait! 🎉 OLS follows the story of two women who meet on the NYC subway, thanks to literal time travel, and fall in love. It's hilarious, well-written, and totally captivating. Even though I preordered the e-book, I waited until after my last day at my job to dig in because I KNEW I wouldn't be able to put this story down and I was right! 💕 What I Liked About It: Everything The chosen family, the peculiar plot, the queer love story that you can FEEL is written by a queer writer...all of it was great.  🚇 What I Didn't Like: That it ended. Seriously, I could read about these characters forever.🌈 If you're even kind of interested, go pick up this book: you won't be dissappointed. Content Warning: This book is New Adult, which means it contains graphic sex scenes and some lighter discussion of violence and death."
"While not as strong as Red, White, and Royal Blue , this second outing in the romance genre has made McQuiston an auto-purchase author. The stories are filled with such an energy and wit that it is beyond pleasurable and easy to be lost in the narrative, with some of the most quickly endearing and well-realized characters. She also does representation for the LGBT community wonderfully and is maybe the first queer author who I have read and can now say loved.August is a twenty-three year old college student with a load of existential dread and identity crisis, like everyone in their 20s is, who moves to New York. When she gets on her commute to Brooklyn College, she meets Jane, a charming and mysterious leather-jacket wearing time traveler displaced from the 1970s. August makes it her second job to use everything she knows and has been taught to help her.Nonetheless, the coming-of-age story and cast of quirky characters make this a good read. While the premise might appear whimsical, it is grounded in a very intimate and personal romance that gives it a lot of heart. Time travel is a personal weakness of mine and this helped to demonstrate why."
"**4.5 Stars**Oh my heart.  One Last Stop is truly magical.  I love it more than Red White and Royal Blue.  Yes, I said it.  I LOVE IT MORE!Coffee girl and subway girl have my heart.  Casey McQuistion's amazing side characters have it as well.  They all have this deep ""us against the world"" mentality that leads to their very own found family.  They each have these amazing personalities that suck you right in, too.When I was done, I just wanted to hug the book.Oh and Casey, can we get a book about Wes and Isaiah's relationship?  Please and thank you.  They were my favorites.I don't know what you are waiting for.  Read this book now!"
"It’s about Jane, a Chinese lesbian stuck in time and August a bi woman that does detective work like Veronica Mars/Nancy Drew and is also a professional college student. They meet and fall in love as August tries to help Jane become unstuck.What a beautifully written book with a host of diverse LGBTQIA+ characters. The gay history was seamlessly woven in and the way she captured NYC in foods, people and buildings was fabulous.Loved getting to see the relationship build between August and Jane as they tried to get her unstuck from time. First in memories, the as friends then as more all while riding the subway."
"Sweet and funny, heartwarming and heart wrenching, found families and family struggles. So many stories and histories, mysteries and discoveries. And at the heart of it all, surrounded by characters you’ll ADORE, are August and Jane. The determination, passion, trust, and honesty that builds through this story is so endearing and you can’t help but root for and try to figure out all of the pieces to get to the whole story! Plus, pancakes, drag queens, psychics, and more just round out this perfectly imperfect story laid out across the Q train, Brooklyn, and beyond. You’ll fall in love with this story stop after stop!"
"Second novels can be dicey, especially after the first one hits it out of the park. There must be a ton of pressure on an author to try to recreate that same experience for a reader with an entirely different set of characters and plot. But Casey McQuiston did it with One Last Stop. It has romance, light mystery, and fantasy. And ALL of the characters are simply fantastic, real and complex. I loved every minute of this book and completely got lost in the story. I wish the story had continued beyond the end. Just fabulous! 5 stars."
"McQuiston continues to find success writing Romance with a genre twist. Like Red White and Royal Blues flavors of political satire, One Last Stop's ode to Sci-Fi time travel stories provides a fun and fresh premise without getting bogged down in pseudoscience or technobabble. The true heart of this novel shines most in the community that August finds in New York and the way that Jane's connection to the past draws a clear line between to the communities responsible for Stonewall and Pride, and those inhabiting their streets today. The perfect June read."
"I truly cannot express enough how much I loved this book. I enjoyed Red, White, and Royal Blue, and when I saw that Casey McQuiston had a new book coming out, I was excited, but One Last Stop far surpassed my already high expectations. This book is an absolute delight with an entire cast of characters to fall in love with, and a unique and creative plot that keeps you hooked.While the story and the romance are both wonderful and most certainly worth reading the book for, the thing that I found most enticing is the story it tells about queerness over the last fifty years. Jane, a 70s lesbian who lived and loved in a time where being gay was illegal, has been transplanted into the modern age by being stuck on a subway train. August is a Louisiana bisexual who moves to New York to reinvent herself away from her mother, whose obsession with finding her brother who's been missing since the 70s has stifled August and her own identity formation. August moves into an apartment shared by an electrical engineer-turned-artist, a real life psychic, and a former trust fund kid whose parents cut him off for not conforming to his family's expectations. Their neighbor across the hall is an accountant by day, drag queen by night. August's found family lives and breathes queer culture in a Brooklyn nearly - but not completely - foreign to Jane's experience in the 70s. McQuiston does a magnificent job showing just how far LGBTQ acceptance has come in the last half-century, but never forgets to weave in that there is still so much further to go as well. There's even nods to events in queer history that many of us today don't know about, like the arson of the Upstairs Lounge. This is a story deeply steeped in queer culture and is characterized by resilience, love, spirit, and determination - perfectly fitting to kick off pride month this year.Overall, this book was just so lovely. McQuiston poured their heart into this beautiful queer story that explores all kinds of love - family, friends, and romantic - and it shows on every single page. There are plot twists that you don't see coming, moments that make you laugh out loud, and moments that break your heart. Again, I loved Red, White, and Royal Blue, but I loved One Last Stop even more. I hate to compare them because they're very different types of queer story, but since McQuiston wrote both, the comparison is inevitable. You will not be disappointed - One Last Stop is whatever the opposite of a sophomore slump is. I cannot wait to see what stories McQuiston tells next!"
"At first, I wasn't certain. It was fun and funny and sweet; it was not the hilarious romp RW&RB was. I guffawed through that. I knew I enjoyed OLS, but I wasn't committed to how much I would like it. And then, when I was 93% finished, my digital library loan ended. I was devastated.And then I knew, as I was left hanging in literary limbo with a big case of the feels--I loved this book. It's a romance, but it's another book of precious, precious found family for which it is so important to have representation. Sophomore book--I love it. Now I gotta buy it."
"Probably the most joyfully, unapologetically queer book I've ever had the pleasure to read. ONE LAST STOP has all the humor, fun, and romance of a rom-com, while also grounding itself in a wonderful cast of characters and powerful emotions. A must read. An absolute delight in every way.I loved everything about this story, but the characters are absolutely the heart of it. Casey McQuiston needs to teach a masterclass on character creation. Every single one of them is so lovable and unique and hilarious. I found myself desperately wanting to be in the room with them, plotting and joking. They love each other fiercely, and it bleeds from the page with every interaction.Very few authors can manage to write dialogue that sounds so modern and real without sounding like pandering. McQuiston made me laugh out loud regularly, penning exchanges that I could imagine my own friends saying over drinks at a party. It's a true gift and I'm incredibly pleased at how deftly she applies it to her novels.TL;DR: If you love romcoms (especially Red, White & Royal Blue) read this book. Great LGBTQ+ representation, wonderful found family of characters, and laugh out loud funny."
In a book club and was recommended but I don’t care for this book.  First book I’ve ever started and will not finish.  I’m not a fan of the language at all
"This has just tied Cemetery Boys for my favorite book of the year so far. Absolutely loved it!!! You know, I loved RWARB- gave it 5 stars, but I think I actually loved One last Stopeven more! No spoilers, but this is what you are in for:- Queer history- Diverse cast- LGBTQ side characters- Funny- Emotional- Swoon-worthy romance- Mysteries!- Found family- Drag queens!- Pancakes!"
"This is become tied for my favorite book in the queer romance genre. I may be biased because I lived in NYC for my 20s (2006-2015) and can relate strongly to the the way that the MC, August, found herself, found her family, and found the love of her life in such a brutal, beautiful mess of a place. This book made me laugh and cry hard. I think it’s the best time-travel romance since The Time Traveler’s Wife, even though they are otherwise very different (this book is way funnier and the time travel component is less of a complexity in the plot). Finally, the author’s writing style is fascinating. She achieved a great balance of witty, quick dialogue with internal musings, all sprinkled with pop culture references and out-of-left-field insights."
"I could've finished this book faster, but I didn't want it to end! This is hands down one of the best romances I've ever read. Everything in this book is infused with life including the setting. I've never been to New York, but this book makes me want to brave a subway ride. The prose is beautiful and the layout choices are epic. This needs to be a movie, but if it never is Casey has written a novel so immersive that its imagery will live in my mind forever. Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
This was such a fun book for me having grown up in the seventies and eighties and created a bit of nostalgia for my childhood. I loved both of the main characters and their sweet romance with quite a bit of 🔥. The secondary characters were delightfully witty and the magical element was handled well. I loved the concept of this story and the result is well worth the read!
"I liked that I could skim-read it without losing anything. That said, I found the writing to be probably more appealing to a younger audience. It was too elementary for me as I prefer more sophisticated language and writers."
"OMG, I loved the last book I read by Casey so I automatically wanted to read this one when it came out. I didn't read the description first and, wow, what a wild, amazing story this was! Words fail me at how great and unexpected this book is. If you like love stories with a paranormal twist, this is the book for you! I will read anything Casey writes from now on!"
"This book did not disappoint. I preordered One Last Stop quite a while before it's release date so I've been patiently (sometimes impatiently) waiting for it's release. I read Red, White, and Royal Blue (McQuiston's last book) and absolutely loved the story and characters she created and have been excited about her second book since it was announced. This is a beautiful sapphic romance that transcends time; it will give you goose bumps, make you smile, laugh, and cry. McQuiston writes characters that quickly come to life on the page and pull you into their world. I loved every moment of this book and would definitely recommend to those who like romance, found family, and anyone who reads this review. Also if you have the chance make the Su Special for yourself it's very good."
"This was a great read! The chractera were well done and I would gladly read entire novels following each of the wide characters. The romance moved at a realistic pace despite the obstacles in their way. The plot itself was well thought out and had fun twists. Overall, it flowed well but dragged a bit through the middle."
"Here's the thing about Casey McQuiston. Each word she writes is this deliciously heavy piece of lead that submerges a writer deeper into a story the more you read. Whether it's a Trumpless world in Red, White & Royal Blue or one devoid of COVID in One Last Stop, McQuiston knows escapism. She more than knows it. She cultivated her own version of it that brings you back to the safe pages of her books with fantastic worlds and comforting characters. Her stories are like warm hugs that you didn't realize you really needed. They're a piece of driftwood keeping you afloat when you're stranded at sea. A glass of water quenching your thirst. A gift from god herself."
"A different type of romance that resonates long after you’re done. The quirky characters feel real despite the fantastic circumstances and you can’t help rooting for the main love story (and the secondary one, too!) even though it really feels like a long shot. Definitely worth the purchase."
"Very enjoyable story. Something completely different and entertaining. Slow start, hard to get used to Augusts angst. This kind of big city story is opposite of my small rural life. I do remember the homophobia of 1960-2000s. I lived it, and wish I could be as brave and unafraid as Jane.Give this story a chance, keep reading, it is worth it. Thanks for the ride!"
"I was a BIG fan of Red, White & Royal Blue…and maybe I came into this book with too high of expectations. I think the plot was maybe a little hard for me to follow along with or be interested in? Don’t get me wrong, I really did like the characters, especially the minor characters but I just left the book feeling very unsatisfied. It was good but I felt myself really struggling to keep reading it at times."
"I thought this book was a lot of fun. It's fast-paced, captivating, funny, and thoughtful – queer and sexy, too. While Red, White & Royal Blue felt a lot like fan fiction, this feels fuller with a deeper plot. It's a little like early Michelle Tea (Valencia) meets Aimee Bender. Urban, gritty queer magical realism."
"Unpopular opinion, I couldn’t even finish this book. I loved her previous book and was hoping for the same fun superficial ride but unfortunately, this just dragged out for so long that it made it really hard for me to care about any of the characters."
"I like the story, but it was crazy weird. The characters are all great. I wanna go hang out with these people. The time travel part was crazy even for a time travel book. Not as good as her first book, but I will continue to read this author."
"Casey never fails to make me feel ALL OF THE THINGS, and wow, this didn’t pull any punches. I related heavily to August’s loneliness, and I hope someday, I find a family of friends as wonderful as hers. And maybe a Jane."
"It doesn’t matter how steamy a romance novel is if we don’t care about the characters. In August Landry, McQuiston has created a central character who feels so alive and relatable that I was rooting for her newly-formed friendships every bit as much as her fledgling romance. I want to be part of the world that was built in this book."
August had never fit in until she found 3 roommates that became family.  Her friends at her job at the pancake house gave her more family.  Then she met Jane.  Jane was her person.  But they had to figure out a way to really be together.
"I literally lovedddd this book! I been waiting months to read it. Finally got my hands on it! Read it on kindle but I’m buying the book to have! Definitely recommend it. 5/5, 10/10. Love love love!"
Why do I love Casey's writing? She is smart and modern and unique and writes about people I want to know for real. This book was NOTHING like I expected (didn't read the synopsis!) and I loved every breathless minute of it. Thank you for writing for the rest of us.
This was a romance story that takes place on a subway. There are lots of interesting characters. There is also a pancake house where a lot of the story takes place.
"This was such a great book. I enjoyed August, her found family and Jane. It’s a very unique premise and I was fascinated by it. August and Jane are just fireworks!"
"I loved everything about this book, from the quirky MC to the vaguely supernatural twists. A joyful celebration of queer history and queer love that I couldn't put down."
This is an exceptional book with an entrancing plot the just sort of sucks you in and makes you a part of it. A truly beautiful work of art.
"What a sweet journey. ( pun intended) Who knew the subway could be anything other than loud, crowded and smelly, let alone romantic?! This book may be set in New York but it feels like a whimsical and magical place. As if you’re reading this story in a dream. At the same time it grounds you in place by remembering the history people tend to ignore. I cried and I laughed out loud with this story and I highly recommend it."
oh my goodness!! this book is INCREDIBLE! the sapphic love story I’ve always dreamed of! I started it this morning and could not put it down so I read the whole thing in one day! Casey Mcquiston is officially the best!
"I loved every second of it. If you’re unsure about the sci-fi aspect of it, don’t let that stop you from picking this one up! I wish I could go back and read it again for the first time."
"I had high hopes for this book, and maybe that’s why I am so disappointed. I’m all for a good story with some mysticism but this was just too much. It all wrapped up a little too neatly for my taste."
"Just like it's two main characters. This is a story that spans the country, time, and quite a few subway stops. Reading this isn't just entertainment, but an exercise in how to write and convey fully developed characters who you'll think of long after you finish the last page."
"Can a book be perfect? If it can then this one does it, oh my god. I’ll be thinking about this a while."
"I really enjoyed this read. At times it felt a little long or slow,  but then I kept getting sucked back in to the story. I love August and Jane.  Such a great read!"
A beautiful story of love and finding oneself. I love the twist of adding in a time travel element to the story and the climax keeps you guessing right up till the end. If you love sapphic love you’ll enjoy this story.
"I loved her last book and enjoyed this one even more. Great story of life, love and what really matters in the end. A magical journey from beginning to end."
Suspend reality a bit and enjoy August’s growth and development as she builds a new family and finds fleeting (?) love.
It really loved this book. For some reason I expected it to be cheesy but I was so wrong. The characters came to life for me and I got so invested in the story. I loved the way queer culture and community care are represented. The lightness of the love stories is balanced by the challenges the characters find themselves faced with. I’ll be reading more by this author!
"I read this book in six hours. I read Casey McQuiston's last book in six hours. I loved this. I loved it as much as Red, White, and Royal Blue. She is Queen of the Feels in the Land of Making Me Cry. Just buy the book."
I have to say this might be the best book I’ve read this year. It is so heartfelt and well-written I just know I’ll be rereading it in the future. I can’t wait to see what more this author has to show.
We didn't know we do but we do. This book is a roller coaster on a subway and its so good.
"this book was such a lovely heartwarming sapphic love story filled with magic, new york, queer community, queer history, and a lil bit of time travel. as a wlw, this read warmed me to my core and gave me everything i’ve ever wanted and more."
Loved this book! It was a little slow at the beginning but as you read more and more it gets even better. I read this because I loved Red White and Royal Blue and I was throughly impressed once again.
"This book is everything I've ever hoped to find in a novel. I laughed, I cried and everything in between. The author is incredibly talented and weaves a wonderful story. READ IT!!!!"
"I have yet to read it, but it was far cheaper to purchase on Amazon than at my local bookstore, and I adore Casey!! It did come with a slight tear at the top, though."
Great book that doesn’t lean on stereotypes. I loved how many queer characters there were. The books mystery really does keep you hooked!
It was pretty good! It was more mystery and scifi than I originally thought. I really liked the side characters!
This is such a good book. Casey does it again by making me think I’m not going to like something then turns it’s around to something I love.  I want more from Jane and August and Casey ❤️
"Great romantic novel, I got lost in it."
"So cute, definitely recommend!"
I love everything about this book I highly recommend it
"Every character, every plot line, every plot twist, everything was beautifully executed. This is one of those books I wish I could read again for the first time. I couldn’t put it down, and finished it in small increments over the course of 2 days."
Started reading without searching the plot on google (as I do sometimes before purchasing a book)...unexpected storyline and characters which I could completely visualize 😊
"I could not put this book down. I loved absolutely everything about this amazing story, it made me laugh out loud, it brought me to tears, it broke my heart and gave me hope all in 400 pages."
"From the second I started reading, I couldn’t wait to find out if these two would have their happily ever after. Finished this book the same day I bought it!"
I couldn't stop. I wish this could go on forever. Thank you for giving me an idea of what love looks like. This lesbian can't wait to find get Jane.
everything in this book is perfect
I love this book. I like reading and this was another book to my collection. Im happy with it.
"Amazing book it's everything to me, easily a new favorite"
beautifully written. i felt like i could close my eyes and see and feel exactly what August did. this book made me laugh out loud and nearly cry. highly recommend
This book absolutely wrecked me. It is everything I have ever wanted to get lost in. My new favorite book.
Possibly the worst book I’ve ever (tried to) read. I kept trying to push through but I guess zombie lesbians just aren’t my genre.
I love a good queer romance. Casey has become one of my favorite authors!!
By far my new favourite book!! It’s amazing and a must read. I laughed and cried and got so attached to these amazing and diverse characters
Juvenile writing style. Predictable plot lines. Stopped reading halfway through. Don't waste your time if you're 18+
To read while traveling
I fell in love with this book with each page. I cant wait to read more by this amazing author.

Wow. This was incredible. August was a little meh but literally every other character made up for that. What a journey.
Hands down one of the best books I’ve read. 100% would recommend
"I loved this book. So complex, funny, interesting!"
my favorite read of 2021! so good.

"I'm not sure what I was expecting with the 2nd book by Casey McQuiston, but this was not it. I will start out by saying I loved reading Red White & Royal Blue and was eagerly awaiting this book. I loved that it was going to be a Female/Female romantic pairing and was very excited. I think that was where this book started to worry me. It came with a lot of hype, probably too much hype and it was nothing like I expected. First off it was oddly paranormal, but in a way that was difficult for me to fathom and trust. The book took place in our current world, so throwing in a paranormal, wibbly wobbly timey wimey Doctor Who-esq plotline totally threw me. The story seemed very drawn out and too long in many parts I kept wanting to speed it up, color me surprised when the final chapter went through several years in only a few pages. I just felt the overall pacing was wrong for me. Now, I read romance for the HEA, the love and the heat, spice ""bedroom"" scenes whatever you want to call them. This had so much potential, they weren't fade to black scenes, they were more like... fade to vague. I found myself rereading sentences because I wasn't sure what was going on. I really wish the author had gone for it and written something a little more adult and explicit, this felt like a YA love scene.The story had some good mystery a twisty storyline and a lot of fun characters. I loved the roommates and Issac/Annie Depressant, the gang at Billy's. I think this book will go over well with romance readers who are new to the genre, like more PG romance and are prepared for the paranormal (I wasn't). For me this book was too much and not enough all a the same time.I received an ARC from Netgalley and voluntarily give my review."
"When August moved to New York City, she just wanted somewhere to be left alone. She found housing with three other people who were, well, let’s just say a bit quirky. On her first subway ride to get to the college she transferred to, she sees a woman who immediately intrigues her. For days, she doesn’t speak to her just admires her from afar. Then the woman, Jane, gives her a scarf to hide the coffee stains on her shirt and they begin talking every morning and every afternoon as August goes between the college and her apartment in Flatbush. Later, she realizes Jane wears the same clothing day after day and begins to notice other oddities about her. Finally, she begins asking herself if Jane, who she thinks she could fall in love with, isn’t a zombie. What?This is an outstanding second book with none of the second-book problems so many have. McQuiston’s writing is superb, her characters fully fleshed out, and a story that grabs readers from page one and doesn’t let go until the last page. There are several laugh-out-loud moments throughout the book and many others that you’ll smile at and want to highlight.If you read only one book this summer, make it this one. For those of you who enjoy reading books more than once, this is one of those. This book deserves to be at the top of every reader’s to-be-read list for the sheer joy of reading a book by a very talented new writer.Many, many thanks to St. Martin’s Books and Edelweiss for an eARC."
"New York.A place where someone can go to disappear into the sea of humanity. A place that is gritty and real and about as far away as August Landry can get from her mother. Growing up in the shadow of her missing uncle's memory, August longs to find a place where she can simply be August. She isn't looking for love. She isn't looking for home. She's simply looking for a way to survive while attending Brooklyn College.  She finds an apartment (filled with roommates but hey, that's New York). A job (waiting tables, but it pays the bills and keeps her fed). And the best subway route to and from school.What sensible, practical August certainly doesn't expect to find is a woman who makes her pulse race and breath catch while riding the subway.But that's exactly what she finds in the mysterious, seductive, kind, and generous Asian girl on the train. Jane. Jane who is always there whenever August gets on the train. Jane who avoids questions about herself. Jane, who's there with a laugh, or a band-aid, or a laugh after a tough time. Day after day. Train ride after train ride, August finds herself falling for Jane.But when August sees a picture from 1976 with Jane in it. She's suddently catapulted into a mystery. Is Jane a ghost? A memory? Time displaced? And what's more... how can August help her. And will helping Jane mean breaking August's heart.---I did not know how much I needed this book until I read it. It was everything my lgbtqia+ self needed. One Last Stop features some of my favorite tropes: found family, love in the big city, quantum physics. You know... the fun stuff!  The book is like a love letter to New York and in particular lgbtqia+ New York. From Drag Queens to transgender bad bartenders (who also happens to be psychic) to adorably gruff gays to pansexual teddy bears. This book is filled with so much lgbtqia+ representation that it just made my heart sing... and also feels true to the NYC and the lgbtqia+  community that I know.But this book isn't a book about coming out. It's a book about love. And about the power of love. Not just romantic love, but also the love of friends, and community. The love of a place and the love of a time. The romance drives and informs the plot, but it's not the only thing going on. There's a lot of journey of self-discovery in this... but this isn't a coming out story. It's a story of finding oneself when one is lost... and all the different ways that means.August is such a complex character. Not always likeable, but she's still filled with redeeming qualities. She's guarded... closed off... but with good reason. She's skeptical of people... also with good reasons. But at the same time she's kind, she cares, and she's resourceful. Watching her open herself up is a lovely journey.Jane is an enigma... which is the point. Asian, punk, lesbian. She's got a lot of experience, but there's also something naive about her too. She's a puzzle. But she's also solidly there. She affects so many people with her presence -- as seen in little articles/posts/etc that often begin chapters.And this isn't just a lesbian romance. It's a lgbtqia+ romance. A bisexual romance. What's more, August's bisexuality doesn't go away when she enters a relationship. She's still as bi as she was before she started dating -- which speaking as a bisexual myself this is true to life. Bisexual erasure is a thing. Bisexual people often aren't accepted in either the gay or straight community. Seeing it here meant a lot to me. I felt seen.Honestly, this book is lovely and everyone needs to read it.Five StarsI received an ARC of this book via NetGalley"
"""One Last Stop"" is a great book to read for Pride Month, with lots of representation of the LGBTQIA community. In that aspect, the roommates and other side characters were great (and were among the bright spots of the book) and I loved seeing that representation. The book talks a bit about the UpStairs Lounge fire and the Pulse nightclub shooting, the Lounge fire not being something I'd heard of before which I appreciated. But....For me, there was just something missing about this book. For the first half, I struggled to pick it up - there wasn't anything compelling about it. The premise is totally crazy, with the magical realism and time travel. While I've enjoyed magical realism in other books (Nothing to See Here by Kevin Wilson for instance), I don't think it worked here. The second half got a bit better, but the roommates became stronger characters in this part of the book which made a difference in my enjoyment. The author tried to write the connection between main characters Jane and August into the second half as this stronger thing, beyond just an attraction but it didn't quite work for me. I am still going to encourage you to pick it up and give it a try, since I know lots of others do love it. Thank you to St. Martins Press and Netgalley for an advanced copy of the book, all opinions are my own."
"It took me a while to get into this. The story is written in third person limited point of view, revealing lost and lonely 23-year-old August’s thoughts and feelings in narration that often feels like a stream of consciousness. But as I adjusted, I fell in love with these quirky characters.The plot is fun, with multiple overlapping mysteries to solve, multiple couples navigating love, and a beloved community gathering place to save. But what I love most about this book is the emotional tone. If magical realism and romantic comedy had a queer lovechild, it might feel like this.One of the themes of the book is finding the place and the community in which you belong, and my favorite scenes are sweet, funny depictions of August and her friends forming a family. For me, this was the literary equivalent of comfort food.Thanks to St. Martin's Griffin for providing me with an ARC through NetGalley, which I volunteered to review."
"August Landry has recently moved to New York City to attend Brooklyn College for her last few terms. She begins to get into a rhythm in her new city life, with her motley crew of roommates and her new diner waitressing job. That rhythm is thrown askew from the moment she sees, Jane, a mysterious and sexy woman on the subway. Day after day, she runs into Jane on the train and eventually their conversations turn from a comment here and there to full on get-to-know-you conversations. August finally works up the nerve to ask Jane out and Jane has to decline. Their relationship will be impossible - Jane is displaced from the 1970s. But August is determined to help her figure out what's going on.I LOVED THIS BOOK SO MUCH! It had some major Outlander and Time Traveler's Wife vibes and those are two of my all-time favorite books. I love the idea of a love story that is up against an impossible hurdle of time constructs. The concepts of Jane's displacement in this book is outlandish, mind blowing, and it totally works!Casey McQuiston does a fantastic job of writing a book with a diverse set of characters. They are all colors of the ethnic rainbow and the LGBTQ rainbow and they were a beautiful melting pot. The big group scenes in this book were hilarious! They are all quirky, a little crazy, and wildly inappropriate and I loved every single one of them.Jane is such an enigmatic character. She is mysterious, smart, charming, sexy, and she had great energy. It's no wonder that a lot of people were falling in love with her as she traveled on the train every day. Only someone as cool and collected as Jane could endure the time displacement with the grace and humor that she did. The chemistry between August and Jane was intense and I loved every moment of them together.Bravo to McQuiston for writing an original and imaginative story with so much heart and humor!Steam level: 🔥🔥🔥⚠️: homophobia, death of a relative"
"Gosh this book was fun. I love romances where it is all about the people. McQuiston's first book was a male/male romance. This one is a female/female romance - but I don't think of them that way. Red White and Royal Blue is the Powerpoint/West Wing one and One Last Stop is the subway/diner one. If you haven't read RWRB yet, go do so.Again, like her last book, this one is all about the wonderful characters- the main characters and everyone around them. She built up a fascinating universe of multicultural, multi racial, queer vibrant people - kind of like the real world really. I just want to go and hang out with August and Jane, the MCs.Even if you are not a romance reader, it is worth reading this one just for the splendid people and story. The characters are nuanced, and McQuiston shows effortlessly throughout the story, why they are like they are. She makes it look so easy!Like the better romances, the story is all about finding oneself, belonging, found and/or real family, and connection. In addition, this story is also steeped in community. The community stuff is so good, I want more books about it!I'm guessing that if you live in New York this story will have massive extra resonance. This is very much a novel of place.Thank you to netgalley for a free copy in exchange for an honest review."
"I loved the author's previous book so I jumped at the chance to read this one without bothering to check out the synopsis first. So I was caught off guard with the big twist and to be honest I didn't like the story going in that direction. I'll freely admit I was in the middle of a reading slump and in a grumpy mood when I stared reading this book. Perhaps if the timing was different my opinions would be overwhelmingly positive instead of thinking it was just an okay read.August is a 23 year old college student and she has recently moved to New York City. To make ends meet she works at a diner. While commuting she meets June on the subway. They always seem to be on the same train car at the same exact time. Sparks fly between them but June has a bit of a problem. You see, she's actually from the 1970s and she's been stuck on the same train car for the last 40 years. She also doesn't remember much of her life prior to this whole ordeal. Sounds weird, right? Well, it makes much more sense if you read the book.There just wasn't enough development between the two lead characters before the jarring twist. I didn't feel invested in June at that point. They had good chemistry but it would have been great to get a few more interactions before the dropping of the bombshell.As always take my opinions with a grain of salt because judging by other early reviews, most readers loved this book.Thank you to the publisher and Netgalley for providing me with an advance digital copy! All thoughts expressed are my honest opinion."
"One Last Stop was a captivating novel in a truly unexpected way. The book took a turn that I did not see coming and that addition of magic/supernatural was fascinating. I also really enjoyed the mystery of unraveling Jane's past as well as Augie's disappearance. The book started off a bit slow for me and the overall pacing seemed to drag at times, but the writing was superb and I loved how Casey McQuiston tied everything together. The secondary characters really made this book though and they added both comic relief and unwavering support. The found family of Niko, Myla, Wes, and August was absolutely beautiful. Though I'm not exactly sure of the science that was attempted in the book, I thought the premise was wonderfully imaginative and unique. As much as I was rooting for Jane and August though, I personally would have preferred the ending to take a different route.I was lucky to both read and listen to this book and it was a really enjoyable audiobook experience. Natalie Naudus's performance was so heartfelt and emotional. I appreciated the distinct and unique voices each character was given and had no issues determining what character was speaking. Natalie Naudus is a new to me narrator, but I look forward to listening to more of their performances in the future.Audiobook ReviewOverall 4 starsPerformance 5 starsStory 3 starsCW: homophobia, parental abandonment, death of family member, mentions of hate crimes, arson, electricity*I voluntarily listened and read an advance review copy of this book*"
"Wow. My love for One Last Stop far exceeds that of Red, White & Royal Blue and that is saying a lot! This book was utter perfection. It was so soft and romantic, funny and sexy. Sweet and spicy. The entire array of characters had my heart and I could have continued reading this book for several more hundred pages. I love books with a speculative spin and this one was so well done and kept me riveted and unsure where it would lead. This author is not only a masterful storyteller but a phenomenal writer as well. I can't wait for book 3.Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for my complimentary ARC. All opinions are my own."
"One Last Stop isn't your typical romance or contemporary. It's a story about two women who are lost and up against time, what with Jane being from the 1970s and seemingly trapped on the metro. Which feels like it would be too fantastical, but it works wonderfully in this setting.CW: death (mentioned), anxiety, homophobia, racism, hate crimesThis is a wonderful story about friends becoming family and support systems. I loved all of the characters that were wild, quirky, and welcoming. One Last Stop gets real about queer history and the pain that many queer people had to live through. It is a book like no other in the best way possible.I was hooked from the beginning and loved this warm, heartbreaking, whimsical, queer book. I could not put this one down and I cannot recommend this one enough."
"After reading Red, White and Royal Blue, I fell in love with this author.  That story was sweet, funny, cute and with some angst.  This story seemed heavier, a bit darker and is just so much more than I expected!  I’m an older, straight, white female and yet this book resonated with me whether it was about friends, falling in love, finding your place in the world and more.August moved to New York City for school and found the most perfect roommates and I fell in love with all of the side characters.  They had such unique personalities and talents and gave August a family and the acceptance she needed after being lonely most of her life.  I was just so immersed in this story and invested in the compelling characters.As the story begins, August is rushing to the Q train and meets Jane on the train. She is immediately captivated by her and as they manage to be on the same train over and over, August just thinks its timing or luck.  When August realizes that Jane is around her same age but she last remembers the 1970s, that begins numerous conversations to help Jane remember where she was, what she was doing, how to find her family and more.  August and Jane have such chemistry that just a kiss is enough for Jane to start remembering bits and pieces. August uses her extensive experience helping her mom with research while growing up and becomes almost obsessed with finding out more and more about Jane.I could just feel the longing August felt for Jane and yet she tried to keep that to herself to focus on what Jane needed.  The sheer intensity of the love and caring was just incandescent, and I felt every emotion.There is so much going on in this book, I don’t know how the author kept everything together with all of the intricate details.  It kept me flipping the pages on my Kindle, reading faster and faster.  At times, I was so afraid what might happen, whether in the present or the past, and how it would affect the future.The history of the 1970s and how the gays were treated wasn’t glossed over and from Jane’s experiences, it was brutal with riots, being cut off from family along with sacrifices, lost lives and fighting for rights.It was somewhat difficult to believe the paranormal aspects, but it was unique and has such a beautiful ending. The author has written a lengthy novel, but I still wanted more. An epilogue or even two!It’s a brilliant and magical story and one I won’t forget. I don’t recall the last time I gave five stars for a book, but this has definitely earned as many stars as possible!Thanks to the author, publisher and Netgalley for providing me the opportunity to read this beautiful story."
"I really enjoyed Red, White & Royal Blue so I had high expectations for One Last Stop! It didn't disappoint, and the chemistry between Jane and August was electric (iykyk). Although, I do think it was a little longer than it needed to be (small potatoes). A few times I found myself zoning out while listening to the audiobook, and it was usually when August started going into excessive detail about this or that. It wasn't necessarily bad, but it did make the book drag in some places.Speaking of drag... I absolutely loved all of the QUEENS that made an appearance in this book. McQuiston made me want to go to a show! I thought the author did a really good job of writing wonderful LGBTQ+ characters and liked all of the representation in One Last Stop. Everyone was unique and amazing, so obviously I wish we could all be best friends forever.There was Niko and his calm demeanor; how he just knew things and addressed them in very respectful and unobtrusive ways. He let his friends know he was there and put information (or made general statements) out there to be acknowledged or ignored. Myla was incredibly sweet and welcoming. She was also a brilliant badass that you definitely want on your side. I loved her and Niko's relationship and really want them to have their own story eventually! Wes was super awkward and a little weird, but I adored his quirky qualities. He kept getting in his own way, and I was happy to see him finally accept his feelings for someone and verbalize them. I really hope he gets his own story in the future, too!August was a little annoying at first, but she also needed to get out of her own head. She's lived her whole life afraid to let people in, so it was nice to see her accept love and affection from others. The friendships she developed with her roommates and coworkers, the relationship she had with Jane, and even the unconventional dynamic she had with her mother were all something she had to work at. I liked that she was confronted with hard choices and unbelievable circumstances, because we get to see how those shaped her as the story progressed.Jane was hot. She made my toes curl and gooseflesh prickle along my arms. If I hadn't already known I was into girls, this book definitely would have made that very clear, haha. She was also a really interesting character that I loved learning about. Her entire existence was a conundrum; a problem I didn't mind solving. Like August, I wanted Jane to remember who she was, but I also didn't want her to disappear. It's a good thing I wholeheartedly believe in HEA's, and that RW&RB had one.I love books with amazing characters, and One Last Stop had plenty! The secondary characters were fleshed out, and the main characters weren't overly obnoxious. They didn't fight (much) or keep secrets (though August does occasionally withhold information when she thinks people aren't ready for the truth), and their main conflict was believable and easily resolved. I was okay with how it was handled, but wish August had been a little more straightforward and honest with people from the start. I also wanted her to talk to her mother way sooner than she actually did, but I can see how that would have been problematic. Overall, it was a fantastic book that I thoroughly enjoyed.Audiobook review: Natalie Naudus was an amazing narrator and one I will definitely be looking for in the future! Everyone had a very distinct voice, and I was never confused about who was talking (even after zoning out). Her voice flowed and had a very soothing quality to it that I enjoyed. (★★★★☆)"
"Back in 2019, I was driving from Texas to California and needed an audiobook to help pass the hours on the road. I had just returned from a vacation in London, so I was instantly drawn to Casey McQuiston's Red, White, and Royal Blue. That slow building romance between the President's son and the future King of England instantly drew me in and had me longing to read more from McQuiston. It has been three years, but she's finally released a new work. Fortunately for me,  her publisher was kind enough to send me a copy of it.Like most young people her age, August has moved to New York City intending to pave her own path in the world. At home in New Orleans, her life was mostly tied to her mother's obsessive search for her long-lost uncle. While August gained an abnormal proficiency in the art of investigation, that is by no means her own passion. She's got a degree of her own to finish, and New York seems like the perfect place to start anew. Her apartment, a small place that towers above a Popeye's Chicken of all things, comes with a band of quirky roommates who instantly accept August as their own. She lands a job bussing tables at a local diner. Life isn't glamourous by any means, but August feels good about the place she's in.Each day, August rides the Q to work and school. If you've ever ridden on a New York subway, you'll know about the interesting cast of characters that you usually find riding with you. August tries to mind her own business during her daily commute, but she can't help but notice the gorgeous girl who is always on the train. Jane is everything that August isn't. She's effortlessly cool with a vintage style that is all her own. She's confident and kind, not afraid to step in and help out a complete stranger. As August continues her daily ride on the Q, her crush on Jane grows and grows. The pair strike up a friendship that begins to veer toward romance, but a relationship isn't exactly in the cards for them. You see, Jane has ridden these rails since the 1970s, frozen in time as the world has moved on around her. She is bound to this train, unable to leave or travel anywhere else. August might be the only person who can help her escape this phenomenon, but she risks threatening their relationship in the process.Casey McQuiston follows up her hit debut novel with One Last Stop, another captivating romance that will instantly draw you in. McQuiston excels in building chemistry between two characters, and I found her writing of the brimming relationship between her two main characters to be the highlight of this novel. You can't help but root for the two women and dream of them being able to come together. McQuiston fills the story with a supporting cast that represents the diversity of the city she's writing about, a move that I'd love to see more fiction authors follow. Having characters of different nationalities, ages, genders, and sexual orientations added a richness to this story that others in the genre usually lack.Strong characters aside, I just couldn't fall in love with this book. I really wanted to love it, but the plotting surrounding the story's central mystery just fell flat for me. I think it came down to a lack of balance between the ""frozen in time"" hook and the actual relationship between the characters. So many pages were devoted to a plot point that just didn't pay off for me. As the ending approached, I was enthralled by the relationship, but frustrated with a twist that was all too convenient. Even the ending seemed unsure of which way to conclude the story. As the novel concluded, I was left feeling that the individual elements of the novel were more satisfying than the story as a whole. There's much to love about One Last Stop, and I seem to be in the minority of reviewers on it. While I didn't love the book, I still think it is a worthy addition from an obviously gifted author. I'll still be the first in line to read whatever Casey McQuiston comes up with next."
"5 starsThis novel is packed with fantastic surprises!August, the m.c., comes to New York to continue her lifelong goal of living attachment-free, but for readers and every character, it's clear from the start that August's life is taking a turn for the...different. Between August's quirky but loveable roommates, her memorable coworkers, and her general lack of luck and panache, there are many opportunities for August to grow and a whole lot of folks around to watch and facilitate this development. The most essential of these characters, however, is Jane, whom August nicknames ""Subway Girl"" and meets on a particularly terrible and fortuitous day. August's relationship with her mother, who has been on a lifelong (at least for August's lifespan) quest to find her missing brother, is also essential to understanding some of the idiosyncrasies of August's viewpoints, baggage, and unusual skillsets.I was a fan of McQuiston coming into this, so I got to request this arc under my most favorite circumstances: by knowing NOTHING about it other than who wrote it. Readers, if you are able to avoid specific plot points, I recommend this. While I normally struggle a bit with genre-related aspects of how this story unfolds, I could not get enough of it here.This is a thoughtful, charming, and magical romance, and the LGBTQ+ rep is on point. But there are many more layers here than I expected. The messaging around family relationships, not playing it safe in love, and finding yourself - in so many ways - all make this one truly unforgettable. If I had to have a last stop, I wouldn't at all mind arriving at it with these characters."
"I am normally not a fan of anything having to do with fantasy or books that include elements of magic, so I was conflicted about how much I would enjoy a book that involved time travel. After listening to One Last Stop, I can now safely say I am a fan. This book was so well done and made me a believer in love that can transcend time.August is lost in life. After moving to NYC to finish up college, she meanders through her days, seeking direction and purpose. August really doesn't feel like she fits in, but her new roommates take her under their wings immediately. On one cold January morning, August falls on the subway and is jolted by the appearance of a gorgeous girl that helps her up. When the two keep meeting on the train day after day, August forms a crush on Jane. The only problem? Jane is literally displaced from the 1970s, stuck on the Q line. With the track closing soon, August and her friends are in a race against time to figure out how to get Jane back to where she truly belongs.One Last Stop is more than a LBGTQ romance. It is a book about acceptance, self discovery, family, and celebrates inclusion and diversity. Both August and Jane are struggling to find out who they are - one figuratively and the other literally. But together, the pair help each other trust the process and push themselves outside of their comfort zones to figure out what to do with their lives.I am obsessed with August's group of friends. They are fun, quirky, welcoming and hilarious. Seeming like misfits, the group just fits together and would literally do anything for each other. I loved the amazing LBGTQ representation of the group and how they led with their hearts in anything they did.August is such an amazing heroine. I loved how she could so easily read people and could pinpoint just who they might be and what their motivations in life are. I loved her detective work, both to help Jane, but also to help her mom find her long lost uncle. I also found her struggle to fully grow up extremely relatable and endearing. She didn't want to grow up and plummet into adulthood after college, because she feared not being good at anything.One Last Stop was absolutely phenomenal, especially as an audiobook. I could not stop listening and I wanted to know what would happen next. I became quickly entangled in the mystery of Jane's identity, August's family and how everything would fit together in the end. Natalie Naudus was a fantastic narrator. I am already pre-ordering my copy of this amazing book, that is out June 1."
"WOW. This book is INCREDIBlE! I honestly didn't want it to end but I also wanted to know what happens. Word of advice, go into this book knowing as little as possible. I didn't know anything about it except it was by Casey McQuiston and I adored Red, White and Royal Blue. Going into this story knowing nothing made for the most magical reading experience! I was genuinely shocked and awed with this adorable book. The characters are quirky and charming. The setting was perfect. Honestly might be my new favorite book! Sorry in advance for how much I'm going to be talking about this book for the next few months! Read it! You'll love it!"
"One Last Stop was an interesting concept and one that I have definitely not read before. I devoured McQuiston's Red, White and Royal Blue when it released and while this one didn't draw me in quite the way that one did, it was well written.August has just moved to New York City to attend college. As she's getting settled in, she finds a home with a random group of people, Myla, Wes and Niko, who become her found family. She's got a Nancy Drew like streak in her that she learned from her Mom throughout her life. She meets Jane on the Q train during her commute to school and she realizes that Jane is literally displaced in time from the 1970's. It becomes the focus of August and her friends to free Jane from the train, whatever that means either going back in time or staying in the present.While I didn't love the time travel part of the story, I loved the variety of characters, their varying backgrounds and all of the different quirks. While this wasn't exactly what I was expecting, I'll definitely look for whatever Casey McQuiston releases next."
"With thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for an audio arc of this book, all opinions expressed here are my own.One Last Stop by Casey McQuiston was among my most anticipated reads for this year, after Red White and Royal Blue was such a surprising five star read for me. I am not the targeted demographic. I’m a straight, late 30s, married mother of three teenagers. But I read everything because there’s always surprises waiting around the corner when you open a book.Unfortunately something about One Last Stop just didn’t do it for me. I loved the concept of finding love out of time. I loved the settings of the diner, the share house and New York now vs in the 70s. I loved the characters, but I actually felt more connections from the side characters than I did between August and Jane. I enjoyed the narration.Overall it was just an okay read for me this time. Three and a half stars."
"Wow! Casey McQuiston's second novel is nothing like I expected but was delightful and wonderful. Two 20-something girls meet on the NYC subway, and sparks fly. As protagonist August navigates being an adult on her own, she realizes she actually has a lot of people who love her. This is a delightful story of people choosing their own family and making their way in the world, and has a surprising space-time element. Like McQuiston's first book, One Last Stop will leave you feeling warm and fuzzy and in your feelings in the best way."
"One Last Stop is a contemporary fiction rom/com with a sapphic love story at its core.  It also delves rather deeply into magical realism, so if you don't like woo-woo in your fiction, then you may not like this one.  In fact, one of the characters is a psychic.  For me, I thought the magical realism aspect worked swimmingly.The story follows a 23-year-old bi woman named August Landry, who has transferred from her university to one in New York and has a somewhat pessimistic view on life.  For her entire life, August has been enlisted by her mother to help in the missing person case of her uncle and, in the process, has developed quite an impressive set of investigative skills.  But she's finally decided that enough is enough and wants to strike out on her own.So on the very first day of August's commute to the university, she spills coffee all over her shirt before she steps onto the Q Subway Line.  Once on the train, she's immediately smitten by a gorgeous young punk rock gal named Jane Su, who gives August a red scarf to hide the stain.After she disembarks the subway, August can't get the mysterious and swoon-worthy young woman out of her mind and hopes she somehow sees her again.  As it just so happens, she sees Jane again the next time she takes the train and happens to be in the same car as August.  Then it happens again...and again....and again.By the way, Jane, who is an Asian lesbian, seems happy to see Jane each time they meet, and a sort of relationship begins to develop between them.  When August invites Jane out to coffee, Jane responds simply by saying, ""I can't.""August is heartbroken but soon discovers that Jane really can't....literally.  That is to say, she has been on the subway for 45 years and is unable to leave it.  The kicker is that Jane remembers almost nothing about her life before the subway and has no idea how she ended up stuck on the train.One thing we learn about August is that she simply cannot resist a mystery, so she decides to put her ""girl detective"" investigative talents to use and, along with her roommates, try to help August and save her from the subway.  As the mysteries surrounding Jane's past slowly unravel, the two women grow even closer, especially once the kissing starts.What really made this novel shine for me were the diverse and highly well-fleshed authentic out secondary characters who I ended up loving as much as our two main protagonists.  I found myself quickly invested in each and every one of them.  Through them, we really get a strong feeling of ""found family,"" which worked incredibly well in the novel. It's truly magical when you're able to find ""your people"" — you know, the place where you feel you truly belong —  and that feeling really came through strongly during the narrative.I really loved the representation of diverse cultures and sexualities we find with our quirky and eccentric characters.  For instance, we have:- Niko – who is a trans Latino psychic- Myla – queer Black electrical engineer and artist who has an adoptive Chinese mom- Wes – a depressed and somewhat mysterious queer Jewish tattoo artist- Isaiah - the next-door neighbor who is an accountant by day and the flamboyant drag Queen Annie Depressant by night — and  who is head over heels in love with Wes- and Jane, who is a Chinese-American LesbianI think many queer people will be able to see themselves in these characters.There was plenty of fun banter and shenanigans among the roommates, which made me nostalgic for my own college days.  The unconventional employees at Billy's diner also played an essential part in the story.  So if you love the found family trope, this one is sure to win your heart.What was also fun about this story was how much it was a tribute and celebration of queer identity. Once Jane begins remembering her past, we learn about her life in the 70s — the protests and riots she was involved in, how she fought — sometimes with her fists — for the queer community along with her own found family.  I thought that the story really brought to light the fights lead by people of color and the LGBTQIA+ community during the 70s and how we still have a long way to go.As for the romance, well, let me say that it's probably the best that I've read in a while.  The sex scenes were tender, erotic, heartwarming without being graphic as August and Jane each learned what each other likes, wants, and needs.  You could feel the deep and intense emotion between the two of them, and overall, the sex-positive love scenes felt super realistic.There's no doubt in my mind that this is a five-star read for me, especially given that I connected with pretty much every character in the book, and I adored the unique and clever premise of the story.  Besides, how could I not fall in love with an extraordinary novel about a magical girl tethered to a New York subway?A huge thank you to NetGalley and St. Martin's Press for providing a digital reviewer copy of this book."
"All 5 StarsWow. This book. My favorite books are books that make me feel all the feels and this one definitely did.“One Last Stop” is the story of August. August has just moved to New York City and at the ripe old age of 23, has decided her best course of action is to remain alone and independent. She’s always been a loner and is trying to figure out what to do with her life.  While looking for a place to live she meets Niko, his girlfriend Myla, and their roommate Wes. On the train she meets gorgeous and mysterious Jane. Jane, it turns out, has been displaced by time. She’s stuck in the 70’s and has been on the Q train for over 40 years.While there was a lot I loved about this, my absolute favorite thing about “One Last Stop” are the characters. All of them, even the side characters. They’re diverse and eccentric and so well written that I felt like they were people I wish I knew in real life. The way they love and support each other in their own unique was a delight to read. I’m a sucker for the found family trope and it just made my heart so happy to see August go from being alone and isolated to being surrounded by a group of people who loved her as she was.The book does start off a little slowly. It didn’t bother me though because with this being over 400 pages, I felt like we got to know all of the characters a little bit better than the more normal 200-page book. This is written in August’s third person point of view and while I usually prefer dual viewpoints, I felt that McQuiston did an amazing job on making me feel like I know Jane and all the others just as well as August.I thought the romance was off the charts. August and Jane have undeniable chemistry and a love that beats all the odds, even space and time. They start off as friends and while they each have a crush on the other, they’re both pretty oblivious to the other’s feelings which I found to be entertaining at times. There’s also a mystery surrounding Jane. Is she a ghost or something else? What happened to her and how can they help her get off the train in whatever way that may be. There was so much going on that I found it painful to have to put the book down for sleep and work. I just wanted to know what was going to happen!I loved how we get some of the past issues with race and homophobia and through Jane’s eye get to witness how much things have gotten better. There were certain scenes that really touched me when she learns of all the changes in society concerning LGBTQ+ people in the 45 years she’s been in stasis.I recommend this book for anyone lover of sapphic books, even if new adult isn’t your thing, I think you’ll enjoy this. I honestly believe that this crosses all different kinds of genres from romance to mystery to some light paranormal/sci-fi and anyone can find something to love in it. I also want to give a shout out to McQuiston for writing something that doesn’t feel formulaic with a plot I’ve read 100 times before. This was original and interesting and held my attention through every step of the book and I can’t wait to read more from her.I received and ARC from NetGalley and St. Martin’s Griffin in exchange for an honest review."
"What is your favorite book or movie that contains time travel elements?I have loved time travel since I was a kid watching Star Trek, Back to the Future, and Somewhere in Time.  I love to read any books with time travel elements involved.  One Last Stop is the June selection for the Brenda Novak Book Group, and I was excited to read it.August has moved to New York City and has found a new job at a diner, and an apartment full of eclectic characters.  As she gets to know them, they become a family.  August meets a mysterious and attractive woman named Jane on the subway.  Soon she starts to wonder why she only sees Jane on the subway and never anywhere else.  She determines that Jane is stuck in a time loop.  How can she get to know Jane and break her out of the time loop?Characters are one of the most important elements to me in a novel, and McQuiston writes excellent characters in One Last Stop.  Jane and August were fully fleshed three dimensional characters, and the supporting cast was wonderful as well.  I loved that McQuiston was able to give a voice to LGBTQIA+ characters and show their struggles and joys.  I really loved Jane.  She was part of so much in the 1970s as a queer Asian woman.  I feel like she could have a spin off novel of her own.My one negative with this novel is that it got bogged down in the middle.  A lot of it had to do with the paranormal and time travel elements not making much sense.  After listening to Brenda Novak’s interview with Casey McQuiston, it’s starting to make sure more sense to me.  She’s going for more the Kate & Leopold vibe where love prevails, but you don’t really know why it does with the paranormal / time travel element.Favorite Quotes:“Truth is, when you spend your whole life alone, it’s incredibly appealing to move somewhere big enough to get lost in, where being alone looks like a choice. . . ““But engineering as a career kind of murders your soul, and my job pays me enough.”  Hey – I like being an engineer!“Nobody tells you how those nights that stand out in your memory – levee sunset nights, hurricane nights, first kiss nights, homesick sleepover nights, nights when you stood at your bedroom window and looked at the lilies one porch over and thought it would stand out, singular and crystallized, in your memory forever – they aren’t really anything.  They’re everything, and they’re nothing.  They make you who you are, and they happen at the same time a twenty-three -year0old a million miles away is warming up some leftovers, turning in early, switching off the lamp.  They’re so easy to lose.”“Sometimes I wonder if I fell out of time because I never really belonged where I started, and the universe is trying to tell me something.”“Those are the worse reasons to break the laws of space and time.”Overall, One Last Stop is a unique novel with great characters that does get a big bogged down with the time loop details.Book Source:  Review Copy from Net Galley and St. Martin’s Publishing Company.  Thank-you!"
"As excited as I was for this book, I didn't actually think Casey McQuiston could top Red, White and Royal Blue. Their debut is one of my favorite books of all time, one that I consistently reread both in part and in entirety for comfort and amusement. I have more Firstprince fan art on my phone than I do of any other couple.But here I am, proven wrong. One Last Stop was just as brilliant, and has a place as close to my heart as RWARB. Don’t ask me which crew I love more, or which couple I ship more, or which book I prefer. I don’t know the answer to any of those questions.August and Jane have my heart. I love them and Myla and Niko and Wes and Isaiah and the Billy’s crew. I love how delightfully queer this book is. Every character is an icon. The banter is brilliant. The friendships are brilliant. The found family is brilliant. Are you sensing a theme here? ‘Cause there is one: everything is just freaking brilliant. And I do mean everything.The only thing that could’ve made this book better—and this is wishful thinking, not actual criticism—is some sort of RWARB cameo. As far as I know, McQuiston never actually confirmed whether or not this is set in the same universe as their first book, but I’m imagining that it is. That Ellen Claremont is president and August and Jane’s story is happening alongside Alex and Henry’s. Anyway, my point here is that I would’ve loved to see a little reference to my boys, since they have a brownstone together in NYC by the end of 2020. I can absolutely imagine the OLS crew seeing Firstprince at Billy’s or somewhere around town. Or maybe the whole RWARB crew was at one of the drag shows. Nora or Pez would totally convince everyone else to go, and they’d get drunk and have a blast. I don’t know. Something that involved my 12 fave queer disasters having fun together. Anything, really.So, yeah. I loved this book. I may or may not have a major crush on Jane. I’ll almost definitely reread soon, maybe even before 2021 is over. ❤️Representation-bisexual protagonist-Chinese-American lesbian love interest-sapphic romance (f/f)-side characters of color (includes Ghanaian, Puerto Rican, Jamaican, and Black rep)-queer side characters (includes trans, bisexual, and pansexual rep)Content Warning: sexual content, drug use, mentions of racism and homophobia, death of a grandparent, past mentions of police brutality, hate crimes, arson, a car accident, and death"
"ONE LAST STOP is a charming and unique time-traveling rom-com. August has moved to NYC, completely cynical and happily alone, when she responds to an odd ad for an apartment in her price range. She soon finds herself with friends she never expected to have, who also help her to get a job at a pancake diner that feels too much like magic for August to have ever imagined that she would work there.Then, she meets a girl on the subway, and their meeting is literally electric, August getting a shock when their hands brush. Soon, August is arranging her commute around this other woman's schedule and wanting to know more. As she slowly talks with her, she begins to realize that her eclectic historic taste is because she was actually displaced from time from the 1970s and is only on the Q train. With the help of her roommates, including the psychic, they try to figure out how to help her.This was a magical book filled with charming characters who stole my heart. That apartment is goals, with fantastic roommates and great neighbors, and I loved them all. Her psychic roommate, Niko, seems to be completely legit and with his wild girlfriend, Myla, they are a force of nature. Then there is August's quite roommate, Wes, who almost seems like a ghost, but is really afraid of emotional connection with the drag queen across the hall, Isaiah / Annie Depressant. I also adored their stories, and I will genuinely miss these characters that made NYC feel magic.Jane and August are something beautiful, and I love the way they come together with themes of love and time. This is a really fantastic romance, and I was cheering for them throughout. The added historical context and information about the time Jane grew up (as she slowly gets her memories back) was really a great touch, and I appreciated that it was factual, even if Jane was not. For instance, the discussion around the UpStairs Lounge arson put the dangers of the time for LGBT identifying individuals in sharp relief. The book does say that the hate is not all gone in modern times (as faced by some of the characters in the book), but it is different now.The romance was beautiful, the characters compelling, and the setting well-constructed. This is a fantastic read that I highly recommend - I loved it. Perfect for fans of time-traveling stories (Outlander, Kate & Leopold, About Time, etc.) and rom-coms. Please note that I received a review copy from the publisher. All opinions are my own."
"Love may be too mild a word to describe how I feel about this book. I'm not sure if Casey McQuiston has made some type of Faustian bargain for her incredible writing prowess, but since this is only her second book, I could be persuaded to believe it. I saw a picture of her dog Pepper, a poodle mix, but that could be a clever disguise for the subway troll who's simply waiting for their side of the bargain to be fulfilled. Okay, okay, I'll admit it's an unlikely scenario. It's just incredible that McQuiston burst onto the scene fully formed, with a book as polished as Red, White, & Royal Blue. Now she's shattered the dreadful sophomore novel curse, and blessed us with the beauty that is One Last Stop. This book is the story of August Landry, a girl unmoored. August has never felt at home anywhere, never felt wanted, or comfortable, even in her own skin. New York City is just her latest stop. But then it seems like pieces are falling into place so fast. A place to live, a job, friends, and a really cute girl on the subway start to give August some roots. Just as her crush turns into something more, August discovers that the object of her affections is trapped, both in time and place. Somehow this subway dream girl slipped forward from the 70s and she's tethered to the Q. August will need to rely on her new friends, and utilize the parts of herself she hates the most, in order to set things right.Y'all. This book. It's really something special. I am a sucker for found family, and the one in this book is amazing. They are wonderfully weird, warm and welcoming. I loved all the music, the art, the fashion, the food, the fabulousness. It was punchy, funny, achingly real, and still so ethereal. I cried until my contacts were all dried out. I snorted and giggled, A LOT. This would have been an easy 5 stars, but I wanted a different direction at the end. It was still awesome. There is so much diversity and representation in this book. I can only imagine the impact to, and the importance of, these characters on queer youth. McQuiston takes on heavy topics here, but never veers into preachy territory. There are depictions of homophobia, violence, racism, and bigotry. It's an unfortunate fact of our world that there is ugliness and hatred. This book so eloquently reminds us that there's also love and light. With kinetic prose, velvet dialogue, and buoyant humor, One Last Stop is a knockout second novel for McQuiston. Thank you to St. Martin's Griffin and Netgalley for the chance to review this advance copy."
"Casey McQuiston did it again.  I fell in love with Red, White and Royal Blue when I read it and was thrilled to receive an ARC of One Last Stop..  McQuiston has the ability to tell a story, create characters you can't help but invest in and weave it all together with the perfect amount of humor.What I wasn't expecting with this book was the sci-fi time travel aspect.  That said, I didn't mind it.  I actually found it to be quite clever.  August, our main character, has been subjected to her mother's obsessionsher entire life.  Her mother's obsession -- finding her long lost brother - - or at least finding out what happened to him. Trying to solve this mystery has literally been her mother's main focus for all of August's life.  In attempt to free herself from her mother's ongoing drama, August moves to New York..  She moves into an apartment with several other people - - which are total strangers to her - - and ends up finding her ""family.""  Then the day arrives when August meets Jane on the subway.  Their chemistry is almost instant.  Yet, their relationship slowing develops over time with small encounters here and there.  All the while, emotions and attraction are building as anticipation ramps up.  Not only did I really enjoy seeing the Jane and August's relationship develop, I was also really attached to August's friends as well.  The bond they all shared and the way they supported one another was incredibly special and just what August needed.McQuiston blends the various character's storylines together in a way that shows how their lives are all interconnected  Some stories will overlap in ways the reader doesn't expect which only makes the reading experience even richer.  When August realizes there's a mystery surrounding Jane and her presence on the Q, the story really takes off.  In addition, McQuiston does a great job of bringing the reader's attention to how difficult and dangerous it was  for the LGBTQ community in the 1970's.  Obviously, these accounts are difficult and painful to read.  But they are critical to this storyline in order for the reader to fully appreciate the sacrifices made in the past that lead up to the present day events.Thank you to NetGalley for this ARC.  I voluntarily chose to review it and the opinions contained within are my own."
"Thank you @netgalley and @stmartinspress for the review copy of this book. All opinions are my own. One Last Stop releases 6/1/21 🚇 “ It was never just research.”From the author of Red, White & Royal Blue, this story is full of mystery, fantastic characters, F/F romance and a very intriguing touch of magical realism. Each aspect ended up containing a lot of depth that completely surprised me already making this a great book to discuss with a few other early readers.I was incredibly captivated by this storyline. There’s the mystery of Jane, a girl who appears to be stuck on the subway and from a different decade. I loved watching August figure out this dilemma and  slowly help Jane remember tiny facts about herself so they could vaguely pieces together her past. This part successfully balanced a lot of emotions, while also providing some humor as the two educated one another of their own pop culture references. They have an opposites attract, slow burn romance that was sweet to watch unfold. Their relationship was full of longing and some really great sigh worthy lines. Don’t worry, they definitely provide some steam as well!! There’s an extra side story about a missing uncle that contains some shocking twists and also connects both girls. The author provides several discussions and historical LGBTQ events including the UpStairs Lounge arson that showcases the differences between the two decades as well as show how far our society has changed yet continues to still need to grow.What made this book for me, was the incredibly diverse supporting cast. Each character was fantastic and helped move the storyline along. They provided humor and plenty of emotional support. They tied together this wonderful underlining theme of centering yourself around people that make you feel comfortable to just be your true self. Many have to seek this approval from a patchwork of friends vs family, but it shows how your mental health is positively affected once you find that place where you truly belong.Overall, this was a hopeful story that highlighted queer identity and found joy. It will make a fantastic selection for many book clubs. You’ll smile and remember these characters when you smell pancakes, see the Manhattan Bridge, spot candy hearts and hear certain songs."
"Thanks to the publisher & Netgalley for the complimentary ARC. All opinions provided are my own.Casey McQuiston’s One Last Stop surprised me—it went in a direction that I was *not* expecting—& it makes me so excited to see what exactly McQuiston might write next.August Landry moved from New Orleans to Brooklyn w/ a couple of pit stops along the way because she hasn’t found *her* place yet. She’s left behind her mom & the decades-old mystery that her mom’s obsessed with: the disappearance of August’s uncle.On the subway August is instantly struck by the sight of Subway Girl; Subway Girl gives her her scarf when August—teasingly christened Coffee Girl by the stranger—spills on her shirt.Later, August can’t stop thinking about Subway Girl, Jane, for many reasons. Over time, as they continue talking, & gazing, & flirting, August realizes that (1) Jane is *always* on the subway when she is; (2) Jane doesn’t actually know who she is & most of her memories are gone, only slowly revealing themselves when prompted by something August says or does; & (3) Jane’s last real memories before being on the subway are from the 70s, when Jane appeared exactly the same age.Wow, what a concept. & despite the fact that I knew there could be no “perfect” ending whereby Jane ends up unscathed, McQuiston pulls it off in a way that ultimately feels hopeful.That hopefulness also comes across in Jane’s consideration of the setting itself, since, as Jane reminisces, it’s a pretty different world for LGBTQIA people in modern Brooklyn as opposed to the 1970s (though not entirely without its challenges or difficulties, obviously).The relationship between August & Jane is lovely to watch unfold, as is that between August & her winsome & quirky roommates. I love how this is a story about friendship & found family too, in addition to offering lots of laughs & a couple of moving mysteries that August wants to solve.There are a couple of moments when I personally got a little bogged down by the technical details of time travel, etc., but I think that was more of a mood thing.Either way, this is a fantastic romance that I’m feeling nostalgic about even now.5 ⭐️. Release date: 06/01"
"My first book by Casey McQuiston, but it will certainly not be my last!I had no idea what to expect when I first heard about this book but I knew it was an F/F adult romance that took place in NYC and honestly, that's all I needed to know that I needed this book desperately. I've never read a book that had a time-slip quite like this and I think that the author did such a great job keeping me guessing and engaged as to what would happen to the very end. There were legit moments where I really didn't know how or if they'd be able to get their happy ending and I was *nervous*.In this book we follow a young woman named August who is kind of mysterious and has just moved to New York. She doesn't know what she she wants to do when she graduates college, and she doesn't have much figured out but she hopes that New York can help her figure it out. One of the best things about this book was the found family that August obtains throughout the book. The cast was sooo diverse and I loved every single one of the characters and how they all loved each other even though they were all so very different.I also really enjoyed Jane's character, our love interest. She's this huge flirt and was at first glance you think you have her all figured out. But the truth is, Jane doesn't even have herself figured out so as you keep reading you get to learn about her along with the other characters. I did find myself a little irritated by a few things concerning Jane and her romance with August, but to avoid spoilers I won't go into details. As I kept reading I was able to overcome these small things but it's probably part of the reason I can't give this five stars.Also a times this book did drag a little bit. I can't say why exactly but there were just times where it felt like the book was boggled down by too many words, too many characters and I would find myself wanting to skim to get back to August and Jane. There's never a dull moment but there were times where it just felt like too much was happening on the page and I just needed the story to recenter itself to what I was really there for: August and Jane being cute and in love.Overall this was a really great read and I can't wait to read more from this author!"
"One Last Stop, the new romantic comedy by Casey McQuiston (author of Red, White, and Royal Blue), is a writing revelation. I’ve seen a lot of writing styles—lyrical, straightforward, philosophical, inspirational. McQuiston incorporates all of these in this book but she doesn’t do it in the usual way. Here’s an example from the first paragraph of the story about a couch. Rather than describing the couch’s pattern, length, the feel of the material (the usual things writers do), she says: “[The couch is] the type you crash on, bury under textbooks, or sit on while sipping flat Coke and speaking to no one at a party.” On top of those unique descriptions, the narrator speaks in third person present.It took me a bit to wrap my head around the writing style and presentation of the story. But once I did, it reeled me in like the smell of fresh pancakes dripping with maple syrup. August, the narrator, is a loner in New York City with a complicated past that makes for complicated relationships. Her apartment roommates are wild and fascinating characters, as are the ones in the pancake diner where she works. Even so, she’s not hoping for much in life until she meets a gorgeous girl on the subway who seems to be from another time. Jane.McQuiston weaves the story with continuing mystery and intrigue, along with tantalizing sprinkles from the past. I barely remember being 23 and the angst that went with it, but I can definitely relate to the search for oneself, for purpose, for meaning. The emotional hardships of trying to be you and not you, wanting to fit in, trying to understand your parents. Searching for love, being thrilled to find it, and being scared to death that it’s more than you can handle.The story line with the girl out of time on the subway reminds me of the beautiful book Time After Time by Lisa Grunwald about the trains in Grand Central Station. While that story was set in the 1920s, this one is in current time with all the wonders and headaches of modern technology. There are loveable characters, drama, major obstacles, and hope. And so much love. Sizzling love. Love that grabs you and love that’s tender. I think you’ll enjoy this book. You certainly won’t forget it."
"Oh, this book was fun! I loved Red, White & Royal Blue and knew that I just had to read Casey McQuiston’s new book. I went into this book rather blindly and am so glad that I did because it was a wonderful surprise. I had such a good time listening to this audiobook that I found excuses to keep my headphones on just a little bit longer until I had reached the end.August has just moved to New York. She has a new job at a diner and a new place to live with a fantastic group of roommates. When she meets a gorgeous stranger on the subway, she knows that she has met someone special. Jane and August seem to click from the very start but they cannot figure out how to make things work since Jane is kind of stuck on the train.The characters in this book were phenomenal. I fell in love with August and her roommates, along with the other people in their social circle. This group of people were so supportive of each other that I was a joy to just to spend a little bit of time with them. I loved the way that they all rallied around each other and worked together to solve the problems that they faced. I liked Jane but she didn’t get quite as much page time as I would have expected but that made sense since she was stuck on the train. I feel like the romance really started progressing in the second half of the book and then Jane plays a bigger role. I did think that August and Jane made a great pair and I loved the chemistry between them.Natalie Naudus did a fantastic job with the narrations of this story. I thought that she did a great job with all of the character voices and she added a lot of emotion and excitement to the story. She was able to bring this story to life through her narration and I believe that her narration added to my overall enjoyment of the story.I would recommend this book to others. I thought that this was a wonderful story filled with characters that I couldn’t help but love and a romance that pulled at my heartstrings. I will definitely plan to read more of Casey McQuiston’s work in the future.I received a review copy of this audiobook from Macmillan Audio and a digital review copy from St. Martin’s Press."
"5 Electric StarsOMG ! Did this book surprise the living heck out of me. Once I picked it up, stopping was agonizing. What I thought was a simple love - story morphed into so much more. The characters are plentiful, but don't worry, Ms. McQuiston flushed out each one, with their amazing, eclectic personalities, and they were unforgettable.August first struck me as a plain, boring young woman that resents her childhood. The further into the book I got, I realized how much this shy and unassuming individual has evolved. Transferring schools to Brooklyn, is the latest quest for August. Her goal is to be a permanent college student, which is easier than adulting. She needs to share an apartment, because, well, it's New York, and expensive. She comes across an advertisement for a renter, and is thrown into the bizarre, and amazing world of a very unique group of friends. I can't write about the whole crew in detail as my review would be too long, But suffice it to say Myla, Nico and Wes just captured my heart, and with patience and love, they snag August's heart too! I loved how inclusive the story was. Everyone had a place and no one cared who you were or what your journey was to get there.Drag queens, lesbians, gays, trans, straight, and even psychic individuals meld together and no one is judged!.Now we come to the more bizarre aspect of the story. August meets a stunning and strong woman on the Q train on her daily commute. They always end up in the same train, no matter what time of day or which car she chooses. Jane is a mystery that August must solve, which is a roll back from her childhood. However, something is wrong. I really, really don't want to get all spoilery, but Jane can't leave the Q, literally and physically.The story was absolutely brilliant with amazing characters that gives a person hope for our future. A perfect blend of past, present, along with an encouraging outlook for tomorrow. I can't stress how much I recommend this divine story that pulls you in, and makes the impossible seem so real. Please treat yourself to this enchanting story and happy reading!"
"Casey McQuiston’s ‘One Last Stop’ is ethereal, wonderful, magic encased in humor, heart, and all of the other feelings. It’s the kind of novel that will have you laughing out loud one moment, shaking an angry fist the next, and maybe shedding a tear (or ten) by the time you’re finished.August has always felt a sense of impermanence. Leaving her mercurial mother behind, August decides to come to New York, and somehow stumbles upon an unlikely set of roommates who take her under their wing. And there’s Jane, the mysteriously beautiful woman on the subway that makes August feel literal sparks when they touch. But Jane isn’t just any woman, she’s a woman stuck in time, somehow tied to the subway line she’s always riding, not remembering exactly who she is or where she came from. Or when. Luckily, August is great at investigating. As they delve into Jane’s life, August realizes that she’s not just enamored with Jane, she’s in love with her. And that they might be more connected to each other than either could have guessed.Honestly, this book sort of rocked my world… in the best of ways. It was nothing that I expected, but everything I needed, if that makes sense. Narratively, it’s quite a departure from McQuiston’s last book, but all of the brilliant and witty writing, the beautiful nuance of emotions, and the broad scope of love in all its forms is still very much present in this story. Oh, how I loved it, and all of the characters, all of whom are artfully crafted and delightful to read.There were moments I laughed out loud and others that I cried. And all of it was beautiful. This is a love story in all the ways… romantic, platonic, and familial, and it makes you appreciate how far we’ve come in accepting all of these beautiful forms of love, and how far we still need to go. I loved the bit of magic that’s infused into the story as well; it takes you to an alternate 2020 that I would love to visit.This is, hands down, one of the best books I’ve read this year, and probably ever. Trust me, you’re going to love it!"
"“But, you know, that feeling? When you wake up in the morning and you have somebody to think about? Somewhere for hope to go? It's good. Even when it's bad, it's good.”Such an enchantingly romantic story! With plenty of spice thrown in as well. I am amazed that Casey McQuiston can take a very ordinary occurrence - riding the NYC subway - and turn it into a magical experience filled with endless possibility.I also loved that this story features an unapologetically queer group of characters living life on their own terms. Although the beginning was a slow build and took its time to get off the ground, the narration by the wonderful Natalie Naudus was enchanting and perfect for this charming rom com. August is a twenty something college student from Louisiana (like the author!) trying to navigate her way in New York City. She becomes enamored with a sexy girl named Jane who seems to be on August’s commute. Every single day. Who is this self-confident girl who seems to be perpetually trapped in the ‘70s?“I don't know! It's ripped jeans and a leather jacket! Every lesbian I've ever met has that outfit!""The book really picks up the pace in the second half. August’s background in solving true crime comes in handy as she dives into the mysterious Jane’s past. I appreciated that this book explored the history of racial and homophobic issues that existed in the ‘70s and what Jane had to deal with. But the romance between the main characters here is the central focus of this book, and although the overall tone of the story is somewhat melancholic, the characters get the beautiful happy ending they deserve.Highly recommend the audiobook version for Natalie Naudus’s sparkling narration!“Maybe I don’t know what fills it in yet, but I can look at the space around where I sit in the world, what creates that shape, and I can care about what it’s made of, if it’s good, if it hurts anyone, it makes people happy, if it makes me happy. And that can be enough for now.”"
"Casey McQuiston releases her second novel with One Last Stop. This book has a different feel from her previous work and focuses on August’s life. August is new to NY and, at first, she doesn’t think the people that she meets will become friends, much less her family, but that is what happens. The secondary cast here offers great support to August and are as important to her story as Jane is.The plot of this story has to be taken with a credible amount of suspension of disbelief. It really didn’t give off magical vibes to me or specific paranormal vibes and Jane’s situation is one you have to be willing to go along with and maybe not fully understand it by the end.The story has a depth to it as we understand where August came from and what she’s trying to distance herself from. Jane doesn’t remember much about her life at first, but August is the catalyst to everything that comes next for Jane. When August realizes that Jane can’t leave the train, her reaction seemed sort of subdued to be confronted with that situation and everyone else goes along with it as well. The book is current with August’s roommates, but it didn’t all hit the marks for me and the story gave me a vibe of moving where it thought it was supposed to go to fit in. I found myself waiting to be entertained more than I was. The side characters were interesting and sometimes I thought their stories were more interesting than August’s.The book is long and while there was the mystery to find out Jane’s story, it wasn’t a book that I was racing through to finish. I knew at some point it would all come out, but I wasn’t as invested as I wanted to be to see the how and why of Jane’s story come together. And, due to the nature of Jane’s story, there were things left unexplained along with a few plot holes to deal with and I didn’t find the magic I was promised.One Last Stop is certainly a different story to what’s currently out there and may be worth a look for some mystery, music, found family, and two girls stepping out of time."
"One Last StopCasey McQuistonJune 1, 2021August  Landry arrived at the apartment of Parkside and Flatbush Avenues hoping the ad for the apartment on top of the Louisiana Kitchen was still available.  She starts at Brooklyn College the next week before classes begin and housing is filled to the brim.  The ad requested the prospective room-mate be single, OK with living in a 3 bedroom on the 6th floor.  They must be fine with dogs and fire - no Libras - $700 per month.  Call NikoWhen she arrives, she meets Niko, a man full of tattoos.  The house was full of antique furniture, antique being yard sale period pieces.  After meeting 2 of the 3 room-mates, she concedes that it will do, piles her 5 boxes into the empty room available and settles in.She begins work at a pancake house despite never having waited tables before.  Her roomies convinced the manager that she was best for the job.  Who knew?While riding the metro to school on the first day she eyes the most beautiful woman dressed in holey jeans and a black leather jacket.  Each morning she finds ‘Subway Girl’ riding in a different car.  She in turn is called ‘Coffee Girl’ after spilling her morning latte down her shirt the day before.  This vlog is filled with August’s confusing life with her strange roommates,  Landry gives us a diary run of her work at Pancake Billy’s as well as conversations with Myla, Niko and Wes.It took awhile but I did discover interesting facts about Jane Su, aka ‘Subway Girl’.  It is funny at times as well as somewhat confusing listening to the dialogues of the principal characters.One Last Stop by Casey McQuiston is published by St. Martin’s Publishing Group and will be released on June 1, 2021.  I appreciate St. Martin’s allowing me to read and review One Last Stop via Netgalley.  Most will find this a joy to read, howling at the collegiate humor.  Could be my age, but I found this a tough one to follow.  That’s on me readers, you could really find it a gem, laughing out loud.  Do enjoy"
"""You gotta make your own place to belong""These words are the heart of the delightful  queer romcom audiobook One Last Stop by Casey Mcquiston.August is a 23 year old professional college student. She has transferred to Brooklyn College in NY hoping a change will get her focused on a career and a life. She has no idea how the people and places in New York are about to completely change her forever.On a rainy day rushing for the Q train August spots sexy mysterious Jane in her perfectly fitting black vintage leather jacket. She is stunned by the instant connection she feels with her. The doors close before they meet but that is okay because Jane will be on the train the next day and the day after and so on. Jane has not left the train since 1977.This touch of magical realism works perfectly with the quirky and often whimsical characters that become August's choice of family. I fell in love with her roommates Myla, Niko, Wes and the loving drag queen Annie. Each has teaching moments for August about love, acceptance and true friendship.The narrator @natalienaudus, gives us perfect comedic timing, sexy teases and emotional honesty. One of the most heartfelt moments comes when Jane is shocked by the public display of affection among the gay couples she meets. In 1977 she could have been beaten and even killed for a loving display of emotion. Through the humor and love there are moments of thought provoking reality.I really enjoyed listening to this story. I grew up near Brooklyn College and I remember the streets and train stations and just the feel of Flatbush. It is truly a melting pot of people. This is a love story about finding where you belong and Jane just had to travel a few decades on the express to find her place in this world.I received a free copy of this audiobook from the publishers via NetGalley for a fair and honest review. All opinions are my own."
"August doesn’t need to believe in magic.  Facts are enough for her, and the supernatural doesn’t have a place in her life.  But, when she moves to New York, she is in for a huge perspective shift.  Psychic roommates, drag queen neighbors, and a homey diner all welcome her into the chaotic world of the city.  After a chance encounter with an enchanting, old-soul girl on the subway, August finds herself wondering if there might be something to the magic of New York.  As August gets closer to the mysterious subway girl, though, she realizes that she might not just be an “old-soul.”  Instead, her subway girl is displaced in time and space, trapped on the tracks in the 1970s with no way on or off.  Together, the pair must work to unravel the secrets and magic of the New York Subway, and the connection that lies between them.When I started listening to One Last Stop, I thought to myself, “I don’t know how Casey McQuiston could possibly top Red, White, and Royal Blue.”  After less than an hour of listening, I knew that she had somehow written a book that I liked even more.  I fell in love with the characters and atmosphere of One Last Stop, and the story ended all too quickly!  I want to read about Jane and August endlessly, but I am glad to have known them even briefly.  Beyond the perfectly written and paced romance arc, I cannot seem to get over how well crafted the plot is.  The New York Subway system was woven beautifully into the story, and the slight elements of magic were the perfect match for the story’s emotional stakes.  One Last Stop is easily one of the best books I’ve listened to this year, and I cannot wait to see what Casey McQuiston will write next!My Recommendation-One Last Stop is an absolute must-read for any fans of sapphic romance stories!  I would especially recommend this book to folks looking for a steamy, heartfelt story with just a touch of magic."
"August is a 23 year old cynic who doesn’t believe in much. Her troubled upbringing leads to an adult life of not many friends or belongings or beliefs. But when she moves from New Orleans to New York City for school her new roommates bring her into the fold and get her a job at the beloved neighborhood diner. Then one day on the subway...there’s Jane. Beautiful, impossible Jane. The instant connection between them is impossible to deny. And impossible to accept, since Jane is displaced in time from the 1970s. Can August find a way to keep her?I’ve been reading romance novels for almost 30 years, and this is a very different kind of romance. There are a lot of layers to this book so even if you aren’t a typical romance reader I still think there’s enough here to keep you interested. The diversity representation is fantastic (Asian, Black, Latino, bi, queer, trans, pan - there’s maybe 1 white cishet person in the whole book). I love August’s roommates for how supportive and accepting they are. I particularly love Myla, she is so witty and funny. And she introduces August to Joy Division, one of my all-time favorite bands, and this wonderful passage “... and it starts to make sense. The music, and why it might mean so much to someone.” The chemistry between August and Jane is through the roof! One of the few things I wasn’t a fan of in this book is actually the sex scenes. Don’t get me wrong, these are some of the best f/f sex scenes I’ve read in a book. But they focus much more on how August is feeling emotionally during the encounters, as opposed to how she’s feeling physically. They are written in a very poetic lyrical manner, and sometimes it was hard to tell what was even happening during the scene because it lacked descriptions of the physical acts. Other than this small complaint this is a really special book, and I would highly recommend it."
"In One Last Stop, 23-year-old August works hard at keeping others at arms’ length. Our cynical heroine had just moved to New York City for college when a random ad for a roommate led to a motley crew of new friends and found family. Add in a subway meet-cute with the enigmatic Jane, with whom August is immediately smitten, and you have the makings for a sweet and sexy romance with a splash of mystery and magical realism.PROS:• The secondary characters - The quirky roommates and friend group almost stole the show. Niko, Myla and Wes; Isaiah, the drag queen across the hall; the co-workers at Pancake Billy’s House of Pancakes – I loved them all and they gave the story so much life outside of the subway.• Jane – The leather jacket-wearing, punk rocker from the 70’s had filled her short years with a whole lot of life! I loved the tales of her exploits and experiences.• The banter – I’m a sucker for great banter and I could have OD’d on all the snappy dialogue and quippy one-liners here. Big thumbs up.• The ending – I’m a sucker for a good ending/epilogue and McQuiston delivered just that. Getting a glimpse of after (no spoilers here!) did my heart good and left me with a smile on my face.CONS:• The denouement – It relied heavily on coincidences and connections that didn’t fully work for me. I got the intended message of the cynical August opening herself up and believing in something that could not be seen or explained, but level of serendipity was a bit much for me.• The length – At 400+ pages, it felt overly long. There were times when I was certain I must be at least three-quarters through, and I’d find I was at the 35% mark.Overall, One Last Stop was an absolutely charming story, filled with diverse and dynamic characters – and if you can just go with the flow, you’re in for a treat."
"Let's begin with the author's own description of this novel (lifted from the novel's Acknowledgments: ""a lesbian, time-travel, subway rom com."" It's an excellent summary and describes a book that is unlike any other you've read. I gave it four stars on Goodreads, which is probably a bit of a gift.23-year old August Landry has just transferred colleges, moved away from her smothering single mom, and moved to New York City to find her own life. A self-identified bisexual, she lands an apartment in Brooklyn with a supportive group of roommates, and a job waiting tables at a neighborhood pancake house. Then, one day, while riding the subway, spilled coffee leads August to meet a mid-twenties Asian woman, who is destined to transform August's life.This novel offers readers many things. It's a novel about accepting love, even when it requires sacrifice. A chance to get to know a variety of gender non-conforming people, all of whom provide each other with family, love and acceptance. And it's about August trusting others to help her solve a strange puzzle about time and space.Like Casey McQuiston's previous book, RED, WHITE & ROYAL BLUE, nearly all the characters in ONE LAST STOP speak with the voices of smart Millennials, while displaying a tolerance and loyalty those of us in other generations might well envy. There's plenty of banter and humor. So much so that, for me, it prevented the characters from developing any distinct personalities. They all sound the same.Also, I admit stories about time travelers are not my favorites -- so that aspect of this book was a bit over-the top for me. I suspect others will react much more favorably and playfully to it than I did. Still, I recommend the book overall. It turns out to be quite a lively snapshot of contemporary New York City."
"I fell in love with ONE LAST STOP by Casey McQuiston. Ohmigoodness, was this book ever wonderful! I was excited for it and not so patiently waiting for my BotM box to arrive. As soon as it did, I started the book one night and by the next, I was done! The hype around it and that I created for myself did not let me down - it was wonderful! 🥳Casey McQuiston writes in this whimsy way that just brings me so much joy. I love her characters and way she tells stories. I felt like August, Jane, Nico, Myla, and Wes were my friends as I reading. I laughed so much. I even cried and I didn’t expect to! I loved this queer found family so incredibly much and they make me so happy that I got to be part of them for a little bit.I connected to a different aspect of the book with the concept of “being dead, but you are still alive and you don’t know why.” It’s something I struggle with daily since surviving spinal meningitis and encephalitis and also a serious anaphylactic episode when I wasn’t supposed to. McQuiston wrote about the issue of not knowing why you survived with honest sincerity. I truly felt seen in a fiction novel and it was a wonderful feeling especially when it’s difficult situation to live with whether you are that person or that person’s loved ones…  It’s not talked about in a public forum often. I appreciated it.McQuiston will forever be an auto-buy author for me. RED, WHITE, & ROYAL BLUE was a fantastic novel for me and ONE LAST STOP is wonderful sophomore follow-up. I can’t wait to see what she does next. Until then, I have two books to keep rereading and bring me joy! 🥰Content Warnings: (per the author, more on her website) On-page: exploration of depression & anxiety, memory loss & cognitive issues, familial death, grief; Off-page/past/alluded to: homophobic violence & hate speech, racism, arsonFollow me on instagram: @niftyreads"
"I really liked the last book I read by this author, Red, White, and Royal Blue. It was a very entertaining and enjoyable read.  This current book was even more entertaining.I loved the NYC setting. Parts of the story took place on a subway and others part in a crowded Brooklyn apartment with four diverse and interesting roommates. There was August who recently moved to NYC to finish her college degree. She was overly cautious and never felt like she belonged anywhere. Niko was a psychic and also trans whose Catholic family supported him being trans but not being a psychic, and in their view,  a devil worshiper. His girlfriend Myla was brilliantly creative and an intellectual. Wes came from money but was cut off and disowned when he went against his parents’ career choice to take over the family’s architecture firm. Wes was also in love with their neighbor, Isaiah, an accountant by day and drag queen Annie Depressant by night. Then there was Jane. She was the love interest of August. However, there was one major problem with Jane. She was stuck on the Q train, and has been for about 45 years.I love how the connections were made between the past and present and how it  came together so smoothly.  The dialogue was witty and humorous but nicely balanced by their serious realistic conversations such as not fitting in, being disowned by family, money problems, and finding someone to love and then being brave enough to say the words.I also loved how these characters evolved throughout the story from strangers to a tight knit group of very supportive friends who formed their own family and a place where they all belonged. This well written rom-com was thoroughly engaging from start to finish."
"Please don’t hate me! I know everyone LOVED Red, White, & Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston and there has been so much hype about One Last Stop, but it was definitely not the book for me! Full transparency: I have not read Red, White, & Royal Blue, but I requested this book through NetGalley because of all the excitement around it and because, you guessed it, the cover drew me in. Unfortunately this book fell far short of my expectations.First off, if you don’t already know, One Last Stop is not simply a romance novel, but also incorporates magical realism. Almost without fail… I absolutely abhor magical realism. Yes, okay, I know it was totally on me to see what the genre of the book was before I picked it up, but what can I say? I am a sucker for a pretty cover! Anyway, as with many magical realism books, this novel felt unrealistic, cheesy, and annoying. Essentially, the main idea driving the plot in the novel is that the protagonist, August, falls in love with a girl, who is literally trapped on the subway… literally.While the romance was cute at times, it felt weird because the two characters obviously held different levels of power over one another, which made it awkward. I also felt like these issues were never really fully addressed, which again, felt uncomfortable.Furthermore, I don’t mean to exaggerate, but this book was mind-numbingly slow and felt like it took forever to read. Similarly, a lot of the events throughout the book were a little random and didn’t contribute to the overall stories at times. For instance, August spends the majority of the novel trying to find a way for Jane to get off the subway, but a little more than halfway through the book she seemingly decides that planning a party to save the restaurant that she works at is more important than saving the love of her life!?! A lot of events felt like this throughout the book: unnecessary and confusing.The one aspect of the novel that I did enjoy was the sense of family that August found in her friends and the diverse representation seen in many of the characters in the book. Many of the side characters were extremely lovable. In fact, I probably would have preferred reading Nikos’ and Myla’s love story as opposed to August’s and Jane’s. Wes was cynical in an endearing way and Isaiah and Annie Depressant gave off a vibe that makes you feel like you want to be their friend.Overall, I simply think One Last Stop just wasn’t the right book for me. As someone who rarely enjoys magical realism and since the novel was slow, I felt like I had to force myself to read it. That being said, the book was written technically well and I certainly think others will likely enjoy it."
"This novel hasn't quite grabbed my heart as fiercely as author Casey McQuiston's earlier Red, White & Royal Blue, but it's still a pretty great story with incredible levels of queer representation. That includes not only the bi protagonist's F/F romance, but also her found family of LGBT friends and multiple scenes at drag balls and brunches. Like a lot of fiction set in New York City, it reads as a bit of a love letter to the area and particularly the diverse community that can thrive in that sort of urban environment. You do have to kind of ignore the many coincidences of how certain people all know and keep running into one another in a city that big, though.The book is a little slow in laying out its high-concept premise, but it's ultimately revealed that the butch lesbian from our heroine's subway meet-cute has somehow come unstuck in time and stuck in place, now able to exist solely within the limits of the Q-line train, where she hasn't aged since the 1970s. The two women fall for each other hard, and then must navigate a very strange relationship while simultaneously trying to figure out what happened and how to undo it -- which may cause Jane to vanish back into the past for good.It's a charming and endearingly original tale, full of characters who are easy to adore and frank conversations about lifestyles that aren't always well-represented in popular media. The narrative occasionally takes shortcuts that undercut the stakes and leave a few side threads underdeveloped, but overall, it's another delight from this #ownvoices writer.[Content warning for mention of homophobia, transphobia, racism, and antisemitism.]"
"This is the book where I fell in love with the note to reader and was already laughing in the first paragraph.  Casey McQuiston has written a gem of a novel that will have you falling in love with her characters as well as NYC.  August transfers to a college in Brooklyn in the hopes that the bigger environment will help her to find herself and who she is meant to be.  She moves in with three of the most lovable characters I have ever read.  I am obsessed with Wes, Niko, and Myla and want to move right in with them.  They are quirky and funny and supportive and sweet and all the things you want in a friendship.While there, she also meets Jane during her commute on the subway.  It's an instant attraction for August which makes her notice Jane every day.  She soon comes to realize that she doesn't just see Jane a lot but that she always sees Jane on her commute.  Every single time.  August realizes this has to be more than a coincidence and things spiral from there.This book grabs you from page one.  There is the vulnerability of finding oneself separate from the environment we grow up in as well as how we relate to others in the world.  There is deep, true friendship.  There is mystery and time travel.  There is not just acceptance but a fight for that acceptance.  There is love.  The found family is fantastic.  While this book couldn't be more different from McQuiston's debut of Red, White and Royal Blue, it solidifies her talent as an incredible writer.  The words are almost lyrical and it flows well.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a coming of age novel and think that fans of Honey Girl would really like this one."
"Hi, my name is Carlene and I have a big, fat crush on Jane and I think, though I hesitate to say it, that I liked (loved) this book more than Red, White, and Royal Blue. Casey McQuiston saw the sophomore novel challenge and said, let me just show you what I can do. She delivered a perfect coming-of-age, time travel, queer romance novel that was absolutely impossible to put down. I mean, I literally woke up and picked up my phone to keep reading. This is just one of the books of 2021 that I will never stop recommending. It's perfect. Forgive me now for saying perfect so much.August and her band of merry friends are quintessential New Yorkers, from different places and perspectives with their bonds formed through the unique-to-New-York struggle to survive. The world building in this novel is perfection, taking us into modern day subway tunnels and the diners that never seem to change. Then there's Jane, the gorgeous punk girl who gives off 70's vibes, only she really is from the 70's and stuck in time. This would have usually turned me off from the read, but my word I could not put this book down if I tried. August's affections for Jane literally made me the cute watery eye emoji. Their journey to discover just what happened to Jane and what can be done to help is what turns August from a secondary character in her own life into the heroine.With the novel's unofficial playlist on and my brain on pause from it's usual ""I would never read this type of novel"" turned off, I sat down to read One Last Stop and just did not stop. August is awkward, relatable, and totally stumped on answering the question ""who are you and who do you want to be when you grow up?"". She is just learning, trying to find her place, and New York seems like the place to do that, it's just big enough to get lost in. Except, her roommates become her chosen family and Jane, the Q train, and everyone at Billy's become essential parts of her world. She may not know her career path, but she knows the feeling of magic now. I just loved August, my word she was so relatable. She's a pessimist full of witty batter and I just could not stop highlighting her thoughts. My word can Casey McQuiston write a heroine. Plus, her bisexual, introverted, self-defined friendless, communication failure self is just...honest. She isn't this perfect character who has a perfect move and a perfect love story, but my word does that make this story...that's right, perfect. Jane is, on the other hand, not truly a full main character, but the story ebbs and flows around her, dependent upon her being on the train, on her finding her memories. She's this 70's punk feminist beauty and her desire to give is just gah.I could probably go on forever, honestly. One Last Step is a longer novel, with a slow start, but the world building had to be there to make this novel work. August, Jane, Myla, Niko, Wes, Isiah, and the entire staff at Billy's are unforgettable. This is the sort of book that you can reread, the romance combined with the unique time travel storyline making it feel like a special sort of home. If you're looking for a romance read, specifically a witty, brilliant queer one, One Last Stop is the book to pick up.ARC provided."
"Thank you to Macmillan Audio and NetGalley for the opportunity to listen to this audiobook ARC.First off, I'm giving props to Natalie Naudus who narrated One Last Stop. I could listen to her all day and all night long. She is amazing and truly brings the book alive! So, while I'm not into LGBTQ+ reads, I gave this book a chance purely based on the narrator as I just love listening to Natalie Naudus. I enjoyed the build up and magical realism we got with meeting Jane.I found it engaging and enjoyable. I'm giving it 5 stars!Description:From the New York Times bestselling author of Red, White & Royal Blue comes a new romantic comedy that will stop listeners in their tracks...""Dreamy, other worldly, smart, swoony, thoughtful, hilarious - all in all, exactly what you'd expect from Casey McQuiston!"" - Jasmine Guillory, New York Times bestselling author of The Proposal and Party for TwoFor cynical twenty-three-year-old August, moving to New York City is supposed to prove her right: that things like magic and cinematic love stories don’t exist, and the only smart way to go through life is alone. She can’t imagine how waiting tables at a 24-hour pancake diner and moving in with too many weird roommates could possibly change that. And there’s certainly no chance of her subway commute being anything more than a daily trudge through boredom and electrical failures.But then, there’s this gorgeous girl on the train.Jane. Dazzling, charming, mysterious, impossible Jane. Jane with her rough edges and swoopy hair and soft smile, showing up in a leather jacket to save August’s day when she needed it most. August’s subway crush becomes the best part of her day, but pretty soon, she discovers there’s one big problem: Jane doesn’t just look like an old school punk rocker. She’s literally displaced in time from the 1970s, and August is going to have to use everything she tried to leave in her own past to help her. Maybe it’s time to start believing in some things, after all.Casey McQuiston’s One Last Stop is a magical, sexy, big-hearted romance where the impossible becomes possible as August does everything in her power to save the girl lost in time.A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Griffin""A dazzling romance, filled with plenty of humor and heart."" - Time Magazine, ""The 21 Most Anticipated Books of 2021"""
"The first time August met Jane was on the subway. Specifically, the Q train in Brooklyn. She was in a hurry to get to class and had just spilled coffee all over herself. Jane saw her and gave her a scarf to wear to cover the stain.August had just recently moved to Brooklyn. She had found yet another college, to see if this one would help her feel more at home in the world. She found a room to rent, with quirky but interesting roommates. One of her roommates, Myla, helped her get a job waitressing at their favorite restaurant (really, a favorite of most of Brooklyn), Billy’s House of Pancakes, despite her having no experience serving. And then she met Jane.After seeing Jane (“Subway Girl”), a Chinese-American punk rock loving lesbian who is a sort of subway angel, sharing kindness and happiness on the Q line whenever she can, August can’t believe her luck in seeing her again. And again. And again. At first August (known to Jane as “Coffee Girl”) thinks they must have the same schedule, since they show up on the same train every day. But then she realizes that not only are they on the same train every day, they’re always in the same car. And August is smart enough to figure out that there is something not quite right about that.She’s not one to believe in psychics, but her roommate Niko is a psychic, so August decides to ask his opinion. Has she spent her subway rides flirting with a ghost? Nope, he says. Jane is definitely not a ghost, but they’re not entirely sure what she is.August decides to investigate, to find out as much as she can about Jane, to see what’s really going on with her. And she’s not doing it because she has feelings for Jane. Because she definitely doesn’t have feelings for Jane. She can’t have feelings for Jane. (Except she does have feelings for Jane, no matter what she tells herself or does to try to make the feelings go away.)The weeks melt by, August balancing her classes and shifts at Billy’s, her time on the train with Jane and her time with her new friends. There are her roommates Myla, Niko, and Wes. The gang who work at Billy’s. And the drag queen Annie Depressant, who comes by for pancakes after her show. And there is Jane. There is always Jane.As August digs deeper into Jane’s past, and Jane opens up about her secrets, they become closer. And as they become closer, Jane remembers more of her past. Eventually, August figures out that Jane is stuck on the Q line of the subway. She’s not dead, but she’s not fully alive either. It’s like she got stuck in time, stuck in place, and it’s August’s unique energy that helps her figure out when it happened and how. But is there a way to break Jane loose from the subway? Or will August spend her life being in love with a woman stuck on the Q line?One Last Stop is a beautiful, strange, lovely, magical, astounding love story that transcends time and makes you believe in soulmates. From author Casey McQuiston, who brought us Red, White, and Royal Blue, this story is electric. The characters sparkle, the conversations feel entirely real, and the place is as magnetic as the language that draws you closer and closer not only to the heart of the New York City but to your own heart, filling in the cracks with gold paint like Kintsugi, the Japanese art of repairing broken ceramics with gold or silver dust mixed in lacquer.I got to listen to One Last Stop on audio, narrated by Natalie Naudus, and I thought it was the perfect marriage of story and narrator. Naudus brought this beautiful story to life, each character with a personality that shone through with her tone, pitch, and inflection. There are some pretty steamy scenes in there, so I recommend you not listen while driving your car during those scenes, but the rest of the book can be enjoyed in your car, at work, at home, while cleaning or crafting or whatever you do while listening to audiobooks.I was blown away by this book. The writing is beautiful, the characters are people I would love to hang out with in real life, and the depth that McQuiston is able to accomplish with this love story is admirable. I especially enjoyed how much history she was able to imbue this story with, from the struggles that the gay community faced in the 1970s to the punk rock scene in New York’s CBGB. The riots, the insults, the violence and on through the devastation of AIDS, the history of the LGBTQ+ community is filled with painful realities and individuals who faced all the indignities and tried to find healing for themselves and those they loved, and somehow, McQuiston was able to share a surprising amount of that history through Jane’s lifetime. Basically, One Last Stop is just a heck of a ride, and we are all the better for having bought a token.A copy of the audio book for One Last Stop was provided by Macmillan Audio through NetGalley, with many thanks."
"This started as a sweet ""meet cute"" story involving a coffee mishap and borrowed scarf, and turned into something I never saw coming.August Landry first meets Jane Su on the Q train, on a disaster of a day.  But the short moments they share, leaves an impression.  While this could have ended up being just another missed connection, August is lucky to see Jane again on the same train.  And again, and again, and again.  Like August, I had to wonder, were these two just on the same schedules?  That would be the obvious answer to their repeated reunions, but when August runs into Jane on the same train at a completely different time, she begins to think something was amiss.I think it is best to suspend disbelief and just enjoy the ride the author takes you on.  It is something I would never put together and that August is able to figure it out, connecting dots over several decades was more impressive, and showed how much Jane truly meant to her.  I adored these two together and how August tries to help Jane in her unusual journey.This story also has a great group of secondary characters.  Myla, Niko, Wes, Isaiah, I loved each of them in equal measure.  Not only did they trust August and her strange subway adventures, but worked together to help both of the girls fix this endless ride.Although some parts of the story were slow for me, overall, I was enchanted by this story of the Coffee Girl and Subway Girl whose one chance meeting changed the course of their lives forever.  Bonus that this story featured a F/F story, which seem few and far between in the romance world.  A real gem!"
"If you loved RED, WHITE AND ROYAL BLUE, you've probably been waiting for Casey McQuiston's next book. Well, here it is, and it is a beauty.McQuiston takes on a time travel trope with August and Jane, two young women who meet on the Q train. August feels a spark, but when she works up the nerve to ask Jane out, she gets rejected. It turns out that Jane is stuck--literally--on the Q. She should be in the 1970s, but she's here, with August, in some sort of time slip. So in addition to being Chinese and gay, Jane also has to battle being unable to leave the Q.This book is beautifully full of characters you don't find in many romances. August's roommates are Niko, a Latinx trans psychic and bartender, his girlfriend Myla, a Black queer engineer, and Wes, a gay tattoo artist in love with an accountant/drag queen. Their stories are poignant, funny, sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes hopeful, always real.If all authors treated their characters with the respect McQuiston does, teenagers who don't understand how they're feeling or what their feelings mean could have a touchstone. They could find bravery.I didn't love everything about this book the way I loved everything about RED, WHITE and ROYAL BLUE. Sometimes the pacing felt a little off, and some characters could have been more fully developed. But even at its weakest, this book is still beautiful and a must-read. I listened to the audiobook, and Natalie Naudus's narration is soooooo good. She embodies each character, bringing them to life and differentiating their voices.Let me know what you thought of ONE LAST STOP."
"One Last Stop by Casey McQuiston is the feel good romance you need in your life right now.  August is a college student working her way through school, sworn off love, until she meets Jane in the New York City Subway. There’s just something so magnetic, different, and undeniably sexy about her retro dress, music and low tech vibe. This begins a crush, which leads to a mystery, which leads to a wonderfully romantic story. We follow August as she and Jane dance (and sing) their way through a budding romance, as August and friends unravel the mystery, as she and Jane face difficult conversations, and August decides what she’s willing to sacrifice for the possibility of love and Jane’s happiness. Casey McQuiston really does an excellent job weaving in nostalgic time references to music, culture, location, that helps us understand Jane and draws us in. I loved the focus on love, friendship, found family, lgbtq romance, and an excellent supporting cast of characters.  I’d love a sequel focusing on the friends!  I highly recommend the audiobook narrated by Natalie Naudus.  She was a excellent pick to bring these characters to life, singing lines of music, adding inflection and emotion.  The listening experience added that extra element I look for as a frequent audiobook listener.  I recommend for those who love feel good stories and romance, who perhaps may not have read an lgbtq romance before, and I highly recommend the audiobook!Many thanks to Netgalley and Macmillan Audio for the advanced listening copy and the opportunity to review One Last Stop by Casey McQuiston. All opinions are my own."
"I loved Red, White, and Royal Blue so much, it's a favorite, so I couldn't wait to read Casey McQuiston's newest novel and had really high expectations going into it...once again she delivered. One Last Stop is such a charming, remarkable, yet offbeat novel that I couldn't help but enjoy it although it's quite a bit different from her first novel. This one is a lot more quirky and a lot of suspension of disbelief is needed with this one to follow the plot but the payoff is worth it.August and Jane are the main characters in the book, and they were great. I loved watching their romance unfold because it was sweet, sexy, and just amazing! Yet, I didn't feel the same connection with them that I did with the secondary characters Niko, Myla, Wes, Isaiah, whom I really just fell for! I loved how they were written, how they were just so human, so authentic, and so emotionally intelligent. I would love another book just about those characters, to be honest! And that's not to say that I didn't love August and Jane and their love story because I did, but I think the whole plot with the time slip (as I said, you REALLY have to suspend your disbelief here, and I'm a huge fan of time travel romances) and how Jane was stuck on the subway took away from all of that because it made the story drag in places. None of this is meant to take away from the book in any way at all because I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it.What I really loved about this book though was the amazing cast of diverse characters that McQuiston has given life to with characters who are gay, queer, bi, trans, lesbian, drag queens, of various cultures and religions, and more. It's so inclusive, and I just loved that. I also love how the book as a whole had a family vibe with all the characters--they were friends who became family and created their own community, and it was just amazing to read!This is a sweet romance, full of love, youth, the importance of finding yourself, finding your place in the world, and is the perfect read for Pride Month or any month!Thank you NetGalley for the DRC. All opinions are my own."
"I was not prepared to actually sob as much as I did while reading One Last Stop. In some ways, I'm happy I never actually got approved for an arc because I got experience it for the first time by audiobook via earphones. Which I feel Jane and August would appreciate. And Natalie Naudus brought it to life so beautifully. She gave everyone their own voice and you could legit feel the character's personalities. It also helps that Casey McQuiston can write a Character™. At times, I was so immersed in the story, I felt like I was in New York City. I used to live Upstate New York on Lake George in the Adirondacks (a fellow Southern transplant), but I never made it to the City. I feel like I've finally had a little bit of that experience. And not the touristy version. I absolutely was/am still obsessed with Red, White, and Royal Blue. But that story always felt seperate. Like I was only an observer. One Last Stop was a whole different vibe. I love that Casey let's their characters feel and care and be messy. Their stories are very much character driven. I also love the inclusion to real-life Queer and Diverse issues. That's what makes them so powerful and relatable. And, phew, August was relatable. I'm not sure if I've ever seen myself represented quite that well in any media. August and her story will stick with for a long time. As a side note, I would not be opposed to a Wes novella. 👀I feel like this review is more of me rambling than reviewing but it made me feel and cry and laugh. So there's that. 💜"
"Review of One Last Stop by Casey McQuiston:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️August moves to NYC to try and start fresh; get away from the life of private investigation that her mother raised her in as she tirelessly searched for her brother, Augie. August rents a room with three others and she soon meets Jane on the Q train. And oddly enough, somehow Jane always happens to be on the Q train when she is. While August is at work one day, she comes across a photo from the 1970’s and in the corner is a girl who looks eerily similar to Jane. Tattoos and all. It’s then that August and her friends realize that Jane is stuck on the Q train. But what is keeping her there and how can they get her back to her time? Or better yet.. to stay in their time with August.This is certainly an unconventional book that was oddly refreshing and fun. The drag scenes were so vivid I could feel the energy and those sex scenes 🔥! McQuiston covered all their bases with such a diverse cast representing all walks of life; I just adored every quirky character! The plot was a nice balance of romance, comedy and heartache. It had a lot of depth and layers and didn’t sugarcoat any of the horrors that the LGBTQ+ community endured in the 1970’s. I had a hard time with the “paranormally” time travel part but I did appreciate how Jane easily connected both worlds. One Last Stop reminds us that you can pick your family; and to surround yourself with those who will lift your voice up, support you, and love you unapologetically."
"August is a 23-year-old, bisexual woman who has just moved to New York City. She’s super cynical and likes to go through life alone.  She doesn’t see how her eccentric roommates and job at a 24-hour pancake diner could change that. Then she meets Jane on her subway commute.Jane is beautiful and mysterious and has this edgy punk rocker vibe. August is drawn to her and looks forward to her daily commute so she can see her. Then August realizes that Jane isn’t from this time. She’s literally displaced from the 1970’s and can’t get off the train. Maybe it’s time August starts believing in something so she can help Jane.I really enjoyed this story. It’s a fun LGBTQ+ romance with some magical realism thrown in. Being from NY originally, I really loved the setting. August was written so realistically, and I enjoyed her relationship with Jane.The best part of the book was all the secondary characters. The roommates and the diner employees were all fantastically written. I loved the scenes that included them.  The character development was great for all of the characters.The one negative I had was that I found the premise a little far fetched and was surprised this book wasn’t classified as magical realism.  You really need to have an open mind when going into this one.I listened to the audiobook and thought the the narrator, Natalie Naudus did an incredible job. You could feel her emotions while listening."
"“Hey, Coffee Girl.""""Hey, Subway Girl.”August is a twenty three year old student who moves to NYC to finish her degree. Living with a quirky and fun group of roommates and working in a diner are her normal everyday, until she meets the mysterious Jane on the subway. August develops a crush on Jane almost immediately and the two bump into each other while in transit quite frequently. Until August begins to suspect something magical at play and suspects Jane is a woman displaced in time.“Sometimes the point is to be sad, August. Sometimes you just have to feel it because it deserves to be felt.”I really really enjoyed this book. I’m one of the very few people who didn’t love this author’s first book, Red, White & Royal Blue, so I went into this book with zero expectations and an open mind. And it really paid off. I loved the premise of this book, it’s so odd and unique, I’ve never read anything like it before. I found myself rooting for August and Jane and hoping they could overcome overwhelming odds stacked against them. The side characters were also a lot of fun and I loved their storylines.This book goes to show that Casey McQuiston isn’t a one hit wonder and I look forward to reading more books by her in the future.“But, you know, that feeling? When you wake up in the morning and you have somebody to think about? Somewhere for hope to go? It's good. Even when it's bad, it's good.”"
"One Last Stop is being called a romantic comedy, but I didn't get that at all. Don't get me wrong, it's beautiful and romantic, but I'm not so sure on the comedy.It's a magical subway sapphic time slip romance. With pancakes. And a knife.August has moved to New York to continue college and get further away from her mother's obsessive investigation into the disappearance of August's uncle in 1973. She finds a room with three quirky, queer, sweet people (one of whom is slightly psychic), across the hall from a drag queen. The found family in this book is So Very Good. Plus there's Pancake Billy's House of Pancakes, which is another part of the found family.More importantly, there's Subway Girl/aka Jane, who share August's commute and is totally fascinating to August. Jane is a woman out of time. Literally.A lot of the early portions of this book have an almost meditative quality. Then there are slightly more wacky bits, usually to do with pancakes or roommates or wild parties. And there is so much here that's just.... really heavy. August's family, her search for her uncle, her drive to find out more about Jane. And toward the end it gets really bleak. I was genuinely concerned that there wouldn't be an HEA.It's a beautiful and moving story.I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book. All thoughts and opinions are my own."
"The Age of Adaline mixed in with quirky roommates, LGBTQ+ representation, pancakes, and a cynical girl. The story follows 23 year old August Landry who has just moved to NYC and moved into an apartment with strangers: a psychic, an artist, and a tattooist. August is trying to find herself, after moving from place to place, and on a subway train ride, while having the worst day ever she meets Jane. Jane, a gorgeous and mysterious girl who helps everyone, is funny, and sweet, and just happens to always run into August on the train ride. August starts to notice that Jane only ever stays on the train, and to her surprise Jane is actually displaced from the 1970s and stuck on the train. Now its up to August and her roommates to find a way to help Jane, even if it means saying goodbye to the girl that August is starting to fall in love with, sometimes you just have to believe things will work out. A super sweet and romantic story filled with quirky and adorable characters. I loved getting to know each of August’s roommates and all their relationships. I adored Wes and Isiah/Anne (seriously they were AMAZING). Niko and Myla are just relationship goals and so funny. August and Jane’s story was a wonderful and delightful read, it really builds the yearning and the romance, and the question of what do you do when you find yourself falling in love with someone who has to go. It was PERFECTION."
"Casey McQuiston’s One Last Stop is a magical, sexy, big-hearted romance where the impossible becomes possible as August does everything in her power to save the girl lost in time.4.5 stars rounded up! I actually think I loved this one more than RW&RB? I'm in awe right now.My Thoughts:- August and Jane were the most loveable, complicated, and beautiful characters. I loved getting to experience their relationship and see how their emotional growth translated to other situations in their lives. This was so wholesome and heartwarming to read!- I wasn't expecting the science fiction-y aspect to this one (I don't usually read the synopsis before I start a book) and loved how different this one was compared to RW&RB. I honestly really enjoyed the time travel plot and thought it made the whole book a little unpredictable, which is hard to find in cute and cheesy romance novels!- The side characters in McQuiston's books are always incredibly written and I get so attached to them. I loved seeing how August's relationships with them played into her romantic relationship with Jane, and just thought the found-family aspect was so well done. My only issue with this book is that I don't love the miscommunication trope because I find it too frustrating. Otherwise, a really cute and charming sapphic romance that I think everyone should read!"
"One Last Stop is one of the best books I have read in a long time.When August relocates to NYC from Louisiana to attend college, her life changes drastically. She moves in with three roommates that could not be more unlike her, gets a job at a beloved greasy spoon, and falls in love on and with the Q train. August is taken with Jane the first time they meet - August covered in coffee and Jane looking like a punk rocker right out of the 70s.Like August was taken with Jane, I was taken with this book from the first page. I loved August in all her closed-off, anxious glory. I loved the way she described New York City and the Q train. How much she was in love with all of the eccentricities that made them what they were. I've never wanted to visit a city more or ride a train through its entire line. One Last Stop will make you fall in love with the city, with trains, with drag queens and queer psychics, tall, beautiful punk rock girls on the subway. With everything that August falls in love with. You are in it with her from start to finish. There is so much feeling in every word, every page, so much emotion.I absolutely loved nearly every single thing about this book and will highly recommend it to every single person  that I know. It's a beautiful, heart-wrenching romance with perfect light science-fiction moments and, most of all, a love story to the queer community."
"A quirky and upbeat story about one girl's journey to belong--to a city, to a found family, to a loving relationship, to a vocation. Though the tone of the book has a lot of similarities with RWARB (dry humour, a celebration of liberal ideals, a diverse cast, a big, transcends-the-odds romantic pairing, moments of pure, exuberant joy) this one is more a weaving of several subplots rather than a focused romantic build between two characters. We follow the fight to save a diner that's facing gentrification, the romantic relationships of the heroine's roommates and coworkers, conflicts keeping up with schoolwork, a heist to organize, an estrangement with the heroine's mother, a search for a missing uncle, snippets of history about LGBTQ rights in America, and most of all, a mystery to solve about a break in the time-space continuum. The first moment of clear mutual attraction happens about halfway through the book and while the unfolding relationship that follows adds urgency to the space-time problem, the many other plot threads continue to take equal weight. Those looking for a focused romance like McQuiston's debut may wish some of the subplots took up less space. Those looking for a joyful, multi-threaded celebration of a diverse LGBTQ community, filled with humour and heart will likely devour this."
"""It's all about loving someone so much you can't stand the idea of losing them, even if it hurts, that all the hard stuff is worth it if you can get though together.""A heartwarming read about self discovery with a paranormal twist.  August moves to New York to finish school.  She's 24 and unsure of what she wants in life.  She has no friends or family, except for her mom who is obsessed with finding her brother who went missing in the late 70's.  She finds some new roommates and a job at a 24 hour restaurant waiting tables. Then meets Jane on the subway. Jane is charming and mysterious.  There's one problem.  Jane is displaced, she's actually from the past and stuck on the subway. August wants to help Jane and in the process, she ends up finding herself.This book was a breath of fresh air.  It made me feel uplifted and happy. I loved every single character so much.  I just wanted to climb into the book and hang out with them. There is so much queer diversity in this book which is so refreshing. The plot was creative, delightful and unique.  I want to be upfront and say that this book is very different than Casey McQuiston's other novel; Red, White and Royal Blue but it was also so good.  I love how both the main characters, Jane and August, both found themselves in different ways. There is just the perfect amount of steamy scenes (although that was weird because they were mostly in public places). I realize parts were a little far-fetched and there were a lot of side stories but I feel like everything connected well enough.  This was such an enjoyable read."
"4.5 stars.This was my first read from Casey McQuiston. Her name was all over the place last year with Red, White, and Royal Blue, but I wasn't super into the idea of the royalty trope, so I never grabbed that one. However...I now see the hype about her writing. This book was fantastic and so much fun.The premise was intriguing by itself (because I'm a sucker for a time travel kind of trope), but the execution was just so well done. The plot moved seamlessly and just kept me turning page after page, slowly falling in love with McQuiston's fabulous cast of characters. They are all so unique, quirky, and enjoyable. I love the diversity in her writing and how it comes so smoothly, no inclusion feels forced and none of her diversity feels like it's just there for the checkmark. Her characters blend, feel realistic, and interact with one another in ways that just make sense.I had so much fun with this book. I loved the friend group, I loved the romantic aspect (and I'm not that much of a romance reader), and I loved the fun of the plot. The hype was right...Casey McQuiston has got it going on. She's a must read from here on out.* Disclaimer: I received a copy of this novel from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. *"
"This story is just absolute magic. August is a bit of a cynic looking to belong somewhere. She finds a place in an apartment building in New York that is peopled with an odd mix of characters that somehow make misfit seem more like we-fit.“The older she’s gotten, the more she prefers thinking of love as a hobby for other people, like rock climbing or knitting. Fine, enviable even, but she doesn’t feel like investing in the equipment.”Jane has touched so many people on that Q train, but it takes August to touch her and that is the real magic.“...every time the doors open and she spots Jane at the far end of the car, listening to music that shouldn’t even be playing, she knows it doesn’t make a difference. Every possible version of August is completely stupid for this girl, no matter the deadline. She’ll take what she can get and figure out the rest.”The story is peppered with music and references from the 70’s that was all kinds of nostalgic for me. There are drag shows and quirky characters that all came to life to entertain me right through to the last page.I loved everything about this sweet, entertaining, swoony and quirky time warp of a romance.#NetGalley-5 Stars-"
"August Landry just arrived in New York, in her search for apartment she found the more quirky and entertaining roomies. Soon, she will find something else. One day traveling on the subway she meets Jane, who seems cool, mysterious and interesting; they meet every day at the same time and in the same car. Coincidence? It is not. Jane has been trapped in the wagon since 1970.Such a fun and good story.  The characters, were amazing, I want a group of friends just like this. They are fun, eccentric, kind and very important, they listen to and support each other. This is not only about romance, it's about friendship and finding your place.The romance was great, August and clicked instantly, the more time August spends with Jane, the more she likes her and wants to know her, also to understand why she is trapped and how to help her get out of the loop.Jane doesn't remember why she's on the train and what happened to her, August and friends will investigate until they find answers.I loved how music is integrated in this book and how LGBT society is represented in two time period, society has advanced since the 70s (although there is still a way ahead). We see it through Jane’s eyes and experiences. She is not shy, she screams, protests, validates her own opinions and fight for her rights.Overall, this is fantastic, it has a great balance between different types of love, friendship and acceptance, the cast was so diverse, not only about their sexual preferences or identity, but also racial. The plot is very different from Red, White, & Royal Blue, but with the same type of charismatic characters, very real and unique."
"This is one of those books that I couldn't wait to review, as it was just so much fun to read and think about long after I had finished. It has so many elements that I love seeing in books and everything was orchestrated perfectly.While I enjoyed Red, White & Royal Blue, I loved this one twice as much. It is full of quirky characters, drag shows, pancakes, private investigations, psychics, time travel, pop culture, etc. I liked the setting, as well. It really captured the essence of Brooklyn.This was such a great romantic story and I loved the connection between August and Jane throughout. There were some steamy scenes that took my breath away. The detailed use of description brought the story to life in all it's vividness. The dialogue was witty and moved the story along at a nice pace. I could tell that Casey McQuiston put so much love into this novel as it beams out from the pages. I still can't stop thinking about it.Movie casting ideas:August: Nadia AlexanderJane: Cora Tran (I saw them in The Prom and immediately thought of Jane)Niko: Ehren KassamMyla: Midori FrancisWes: Miles HeizerLucie: Galadriel StinemanIsaiah: Todrick Hall"
"Okay wow. Do you ever read a book and know you're enjoying it, but cannot decide how much until all of a sudden you're reading and crying and your partner asks if you are okay? Just me?This is exactly what happened to me. It wasn't even something I would normally cry about, but it just hit me how attached I was to these characters and how much I wanted to jump into the story and be a part of their found family. Every single character in this book is the perfect amount of interesting, quirky, flawed and real. I loved all the couples as both individuals and couples. I love all the angst and longing throughout the book - and now just with Jane and August. I loved the romance, the realistic, in your head obsessed but trying to hide it longing.  It made me laugh and cry. Though it did move a bit slowly, I didn't even care because I would spend as much time with these characters as I could. I love that both Jane and August had such interesting backstories that were slowly pieced together. I even guessed the twists, but still absolutely loved the reveal.  The romance was steamy and amazing. I love how different this book is from RWRB.Have I gushed enough? I loved it. You should read it. That is all."
"Indisputably, Casey McQuiston is an extremely talented writer. The way One Last Stop flows, from beginning to end, just took my breath away. Ms. McQuiston goes deep inside the main character, and the way she grows over the course of the novel is beautifully done.What astonished me most, and kept me coming back for more, is the clever way everyone’s stories are tied together. Without giving too much away, there’s something tying Jane to August, a reason why they connect in the first place. As the entire tale unfolds, amazing nuggets in time are uncovered, and it just gets better and better.As a time travel romance: spectacularAs a hurt/comfort romance: perfectionAs a humorous look at a slice of life in modern day Brooklyn: fantasticDo I need to go on? One Last Stop is a gem and I loved every minute of it!I also had the pleasure of listening to the audio version of One Last Stop. Beautifully performed by Natalie Naudus, she adds so much to the personality of each of these characters. This is an extremely vast and varied cast, and Ms. Naudus finds something unique to bring out of each of them. Absolutely wonderful!"
"(Disclaimer: I received this book from the publisher. This has not impacted my review which is unbiased and honest.)One Last Stop is everything I love wrapped up in one book. It's a love letter to NYC, to the magical ways we run into people, the glitter in the grime, and the sparkling street lights shimmering glow. McQuiston is a master at character detail, development, and relatability. August was almost immediately granted a place in my heart, with her love of fried chicken and her minimalism - which I would not be good at. But then I fell in love, with August, with Jane and the ways she seems out of time and place. The way that it speaks to this almost universal feeling of not belonging.The characters in One Last Stop wear their hearts and heartbeats on their sleeves. All the stories an encounter on the train could inspire. The magic of the subways and those connections that just happen against all odds. The pieces of sorcery in uneven sidewalks, commutes that serve as dressing rooms, and the thrumming you feel late at night like the pulse of the city. That feeling of being anonymous in one of the most infamous cities in the world."
"Thank you MacMillan audio, libro.fm and netgalley for the complimentary audiobook of One Last Stop by Casey McQuistonI had thoroughly enjoyed Casey’s Red, White and Royal Blue and was super thrilled to receive the complimentary audiobook of One Last Stop!August is a 23 year old ambitious girl who wants to be independent in life. She moves to NewYork, starts waiting tables at a pancake diner and shares room with quirky roommates. Only had she imagined to meet a mysterious Jane on a subway and fall head over heels in love with her. August looks forward to meet her crush everyday on the subway only to realize that there is something weird about Jane, like she is always in the same clothes and never leaves the train! Only later August figures out Jane is transported from 1970, time traveling without much memory of her past.This book has everything, masterfully written characters who were very lovable, hot sizzling chemistry between August and Jane and the time travel element!!Natalie Naudus was an amazing narrator who did complete justice to this beautiful book. Her narration was very crisp, with good pace and pitch of tone. She did a marvelous job of narrating the story and bringing the characters to life.This book releases on June 1st. I highly recommend it to every fan of Casey McQuiston to get a copy to find out if Jane falls in love with August or if she can break the time barrier and be transported back to 1970’s  for good!!"
"What even was this? I love the LGBTQIA+ representation. I will list that as my positive.Having sex with a ghost/time traveler on the NYC subway? What? The story was boring and obviously extremely unbelievable. I wanted to love this so badly because it’s all the rage right now. I can understand why people rate it so highly, but it was not for me."

I felt the first half of the book was a bit slow, which was surprising because I’ve seen so many good reviews already! It definitely picked up towards the middle and was full steam ahead all the way to the last page! The ending was so soft and tender and happy!I loved reading about adults (or 20 somethings) and I loved the cast of side characters! Seeing August move in with such a great gang was awesome rep!!"
"OLS is a story of 23 year old August who lives in NYC and has the most wonderfully diverse and beautiful roommates.  She gets a job as a waitress at a 24 hour diner and to get to work every day she takes the Q train where she meets Jane.  Jane is mysterious.  Rough, yet charming and August can't help but get swept up in wanting to know more about her.  She quickly realizes though that Jane never leaves the train.  And she is always wearing the same clothes.  Things start to click into place and August pieces together that it's not that Jane doesn't want to leave the Q, it's that she can't.  Jane is from the 1970's and cannot leave the train.  August tries to help Jane figure out what happened to get her to this place and how to help get her where she needs (or wants to be).This story is a beautiful exploration of  so much history of what is meant to be a lesbian at various points in time.  This is also a stunning love story that will capture you and won't let you go.  The whole cast of characters in this book was dazzling and captivating.  I am not a fan usually of time travel stories so that is the one thing that took me so getting used to in this book but overall the characters and story were so good it was a small thing that didn't make a big difference.I listened to the audio book and the narrator was excellent!  I would highly recommend anything this narrator does.  Her use of voices for the various characters was so perfect and not overwhelming and her pauses were so well timed.  This is one I am so glad I listened to rather than read because it added so much to the overall experience.  I would highly recommended the audio book of OLS!  It is an experience you do not want to miss!Overall this is a beautiful book and the audio book is one to make sure you check out!  I received a complimentary copy of this audio book in exchange for an honest review.  All opinions are my own."
"One Last Stop is such a wonderful read! I love romance and when I read the novel had elements of time travel...I was sold.One Last Stop has an interesting plot line but the characters are what make the book shine. Each character is so expertly and intimately written, it’s impossible to not feel the connection. The story focuses mostly on August and her journey with Jane. Set in New York City, August takes the subway (her home, the Q train) and meets Jane. Jane, August learns, is displaced in time from the 70’s. Jane is full of self-doubt and struggles with finding her place as a young, bisexual newly living in New York City. Jane is mysterious, warm, funny and just what August wants and needs. August’s roommates bring so much to the story, they are the type of characters that are more than secondary.One Last Stop is a rom-com, time travel, found family book that everyone needs to read. One last stop has an extremely diverse cast that makes this found family trope so significant. I highly recommend. Even if you don’t like romance. Just read it because I’m not sure how this book could not be loved."
"Headlines:From odd to quirkyMCs to invest inNever getting a subway ride againOne Last Stop was very different to my expectations, so much so, this non-blurber went back to look at the blurb and that helped to be honest. This story is LGBTQ+/speculative fiction with a slice of time slip. All this is in the blurb, so no spoilers here.Things I liked about this book were the two main characters, August and Jane. They stole the show and they were meant to, I'm sure. Both these characters were not immediately lovable but I did grow to like them more and more as the story evolved. Jane in particular was a character slowly revealed.The story was...odd, it took me ages to get on board with the whole premise for what was going on and even then, it was a bit wacky for my taste. The side characters were just okay for me when I think readers are supposed to love this crew of flatmates and co-workers; I just didn't. I did enjoy the finale of the story but it felt like a long story to get there. However, I was cheering for this couple."
"So much buzz about The Last Stop, and it was worth the hype. I found it to be intriguing, with multiple story lines running concurrently. The primary one, August and Jane’s relationship, is expertly woven as a tale leading up to a big climax. Along the way, we meet other characters who have their own obstacles to hurdle, and whose situations are integrated into August and Jane’s love story.A tale about loss, love, and redemption, The Last Stop checks all the boxes: angst, lust, first love, and trust, with a little time travel and physics thrown in the mix. August is trying to find herself at the beginning of the book and by the end, she has found so much more. Some of the plot points do need to reader to step out of reality but McQuiston writes so well, it doesn’t feel like we are in fact doing that. If you are looking for a feel good romance that is well written, has depth and has plot twists and turns, that will also make you laugh and cry with exasperation, this is the book for you.I received a copy of this book through NetGalley and have written"
"Casey McQuiston has written another fun and fearless LGBTQ+ romance. If you liked Red, White, and Royal Blue (which I did), then you will feel right at home with One Last Stop.August has moved to New York for the same reason so many others have before-- searching for something more in her life. So far, she has been drifting along from college to college, not finding a home or anyone to mesh with. Then she moves in with her new roommates in Brooklyn and starts working at a diner nearby. The cast of friends and coworkers that August meets are all compelling and nuanced. There's a psychic, a couple drag queens, and a whole motley crew that take her in as their own. But the most notable new person in August's life is the striking stranger she meets on the Q. There is a wonderful twist I did not see coming, but suffice it to say that August has met her match in the alluring woman with the leather jacket who happens to be on the same train everyday.Recommend for romance lovers, fans of Rainbow Rowell, and those looking for books about LGBTQ+ where coming out is not the main plot line."
"Casey McQuiston has delivered yet another brilliant, 5-star book with a fun and relatable LGBTQIA+ cast.I love that most characters, if not all, are part of the LGBTQIA+ community, and that differences are celebrated.  August discovers a truly amazing “found family” in her 3 roommates.Though there was no time travel involved, August’s love interest, Jane, is displaced from the 1970’s and has been riding the subway every day since that displacement.  Jane’s collection of ‘stuff’ stored in her backpack brings a touch of history to this book.  Also, Jane is absolutely adorable when trying to figure out how to use a cell phone.There’s a lot to love here; the found family, the mystery of who Jane is, everyone pitching in to save a beloved neighborhood diner.  I can feel the sense of community and belonging just jumping off the pages, it’s quite comforting.Highly recommended LGBTQIA New Adult Contemporary read.  #NetGalley - I voluntarily read a Review Copy of this book. All opinions stated are solely my own and no one else’s."
"What is better than perfection?  This, this book!August is new in NYC and it starting over once again, something she’s done her whole adult life.  Jane is the perfectly imperfect stranger August meets on the Q train and ends up falling in love with while also finally finding her place in the world.There is literally nothing I don’t love about this book. From the meet cute, to the chemistry, to the mystery, to the representation, to the discussion of sex and virginity, to the emotion, to the social commentary every thing is as perfect as August’s and Jane’s moments on the train.Normally I would say I can’t wait to read Casey McQuiston’s next book but if only getting one book every other year means they are as beyond perfect as Red, White and Royal Blue and One Last Stop then I can’t absolutely wait.I listened to the audio of this one and the narration was as divine as the story.I received a complimentary review copy of the book and audiobook but all opinions are my own."
"This was a great RomCom. I loved the characters and the secondary characters honestly made the story for me. August moves to New York for college, one of many different cities and colleges she has tried. She ends up finding a wonderful apartment filled with delightful roommates. While on the subway going to school, she meets a beautiful Jane. Jane looks like she walked right out of the '70's! I loved August and Jane together and I truly loved all the characters in this book. It has it all, a little mystery, love, and incredible friendships. I received an advanced readers copy and all opinions are my own."
"In the beginning, it was slow listening for me. I did the audio version of this book. So slow that I was almost done with listening and this was only after a third of the way into the book. Yet, I decided to stick with the book a bit longer. So glad that I did as my feelings with towards this book did an upward tick of excitement.To be honest, if it was not for Jane and August's other friends, I probably would have forgotten about August. She was not the most interesting person but she did open up and start to blossom as the story progressed. Jane is so cool that she is too cool for me. I was a nerd back in the day and would have had reservations like August. It may have started out as ""just research"" but it ended in love.If you are a reader who has wanted to try a LGBTQIA book, than here is your chance. This one is not in your face but sweet and charming. The case of characters are a bit quirky and people that I would want to hang out with.I listened to the audio version via NetGalley."
"One Last Stop was an engaging and entertaining read. I wasn't quite sure was I was getting into when I started, but I have to say I really enjoyed the supernatural time travel aspect of the story. I read this book in one sitting, not wanting to put it down until I knew what was going to happen with Jane.August and Jane were both compelling characters. August moves to NYC, trying to find a home for herself away from her mother and the baggage that entailed. She's not expecting to find Jane, the girl lost in time. Not fully realizing what's happened to her until August comes along, Jane's been stuck for years, on an endless loop on the ""Q"". I really liked how things kind of came full circle, as they worked to send Jane back to when she first got stuck. I thought the two of them together were so charming, I liked how August opened herself up to Jane.I also really loved the secondary/side characters, the little found family they created and how welcoming they were to August. That's something she really needed in her life.I was of two minds with how I wanted this story to end, and would have been happy with either one, but I am glad things worked out the way they did."
"I absolutely ADORED this book. Yes, the sapphic romance was wonderful, but also the characters! They're all so well-rounded and interesting and exactly the sort of people you meet and live with in college. It reminded me of my college days. I wasn't in New York, but it was all so, so familiar. I love them all and I didn't want the story to end. I didn't think Casey McQuiston could top her previous book but I think I might even love this one more.It was so unapologetically queer, and seeing Jane react to the differences in 1977 New York and 2020 New York in how queer people could be and were reacted to - it was beautiful and heartbreaking.I loved the mystery of Jane and her past and how all of it tied into August's past. Just. So well-crafted.I had the opportunity to listen to an advance copy of the audiobook and it was so well done. The narrator's voice was perfect for the story, and she brought so much emotion to the characters and just brought it to life. I wanted to live inside the audiobook.If you, like me, enjoy the found family trope then I highly recommend this book.I received a review copy of this book."
"After devouring Red, White & Royal Blue last year, I was excited to dive into McQuiston’s next queer romance. In One Last Stop, new-to-NYC August falls for Jane on the subway. Which is all well and good—until she discovers that Jane is time traveler from the 1970s, doomed to spend eternity on the same subway train. Or can August help her escape? This novel felt more sentimental than Red, White & Royal  Blue—still had plenty of great sex scenes, though. (But don’t expect them right away! It’s hard to find the right time and place to have sex on the subway!) All the characters were wonderful. My only issue is that I was never concerned that things wouldn’t work out perfectly. At least in Red, White & Royal Blue, there were overarching geopolitical issues standing in the way of their romance; in One Last Stop, even time travel doesn’t strike me as a huge issue. I never worried for them. Still, I wholeheartedly enjoyed the book.Note: this review was originally published on my blog"
"⭐⭐⭐⭐ Where do I start? This book had me hooked within the first five seconds of reading. I loved it so much, aside from purchasing the ebook, I purchased the audiobook so I could listen to the novel when I was not available to read it. Yes, it was that serious! “One Last Stop” is about 23 years old August, who moved to NYC hoping for purpose and change. She finds it in the form of Jane. Jane is the perfect mate for August, minus the fact that she is literally displaced in time. She is from the 1970s and, for reasons we discover later, is stuck on this train at this time.  August and her roommates dig deep and work hard to reveal the secrets of Jane’s displacement in time. Casey McQuiston’s writing made me fall in love with the story and characters. I could not put this book down without knowing what happened next. The vivid descriptions in this novel helped me paint a live picture of each scene as if I was there.  Overall, a great summer read about a lesbian romance that defies logic and gives hope to destiny."
"A girl takes the Q in NewYork and her life is never the same. August, newly arrived in NY meets a girl on the Q and their connection is immediate but there is a problem the girl she met, name is Jane, but that’s all she knows, literally. Jane doesn’t know who she really is or where she came from or where she could be going. She only knows she just rides the subway Q.. Janes effect on August is deep and magnetic almost. When August arrived in NY she found a room with three others, they forged a friendship as if family. Together they band to solve the mystery of Jane on the train who August has decidedly developed a girl crush on.Interesting and fun in parts. A lifestyle not all get to glimpse of fun, heart full, loving friends that walk a different path than some. They love strong and fight for one another. It took awhile for me to finish it moved slow but the ground work was necessary. Now it would be interesting if August, in her new career moves on to be a book series.Thank you NetGalley, St. Martin”s Publishing Group and Casey McQuiston for allowing me to read this eARC."
"This book completely and utterly enthralled me. I fell head over heels for August, Jane and their spectacularly fabulous band of friends.  I developed such a deep connection with these two young women who should have never met in the way they did. But they did meet and the journey they go through and the mysteries they solve just stole me away to a place where friends have each other's backs. Where who you are to them is not determined by the color of your skin or your sexuality. It's based on connections and the goodness within everyone.August and Jane each come from different times but what if even time cannot keep them from finding their one true love. What if fate and destiny is determined to push them together even when it seems impossible. To say I loved this book is a vast understatement.  I absolutely adored every single moment spent between the pages.*Received ARC through NetGalley.  Voluntarily reviewed *"
"From now on, whenever I pick up a Casey McQuiston book I'll just plan on blocking the day so I can finish it in one sitting. One Last Stop has one of the best sounding premises of the year and it shockingly holds up its the end of the bargain and more.When August moves to New York she takes the Q Train where she meets Jane, a super cool, red converse & leather jacket-wearing woman who...always seems to be on the Q train. When August finally puts it together that things might be a little different than they appear, Jane, August, and her fabulous roommates embark on a quest to free Jane from where she's stuck. And yes, the love story at the center of this is soft and tender in all the right places.I was pleasantly surprised to find small, but poignant, mentions of what it might be like to be gay in 1970's New York. There is Queer representation in this gem for DAYS and I'm here for every last bit of it.Perfect for PRIDE month, One Last Stop will be one you think about for weeks to come and you won't be able to stop the smile that forms on your face when you do."
"I picked this up for a book club read, though I was a little late to it.  Super popular book riding on the back of the author's splash with her prior release, ""Red, White & Royal Blue"".  I'm probably one of the 5 people left who didn't pick that one up yet.This was a sweet, quick-moving, lesbian romance with some unexpected aspects to it.  One of our romantic leads, Jane, is lost in time and solving the mystery of what's going on with her is a big aspect of the book.  An equally important aspect, to me, was August's found-family situation with her new roommates on moving to New York.  They are a fun group of friends.It's a super inclusive book without feeling forced about it.  I don't think this is going to make my top list of favorites, probably a 3.5 star read for me, but I enjoyed it and it was fun to breeze through.  Perfect for a summer or vacay read."
"Wow! This will be a hard rom-com to beat for 2021 and qualifies as one of those rare books you immediately fall in love with and go on to instantly want to re-read the moment you put it down. It has cemented its place on our shelves, in our hearts, and in our recommendations going forward!One Last Stop by Casey McQuiston follows August, a girl in her early twenties moving to New York City, which sounds completely basic - except it is not. August is not your typical wide-eyed, enamored tourist, turned wannabe New York. She is already jaded. She is already cynical. And what better way to go through life alone than being an anonymous New Yorker - one of almost 8.5 million nameless faces going about their day in solitude. Alas, her plans go out the door when she interviews to be a roommate of three friends - Niko, Myla, and Wes.Instantly August is pushed to her social interaction limit as Niko and Myla in particular will not take August’s standoffish personality as a final answer. They push her not only to become part of their found family, to become a waitress at a Brooklyn institution and their favorite diner - Pancake Billy’s House of Pancakes.And there is another person who pushes August out of her cynical, self-preservation shell - Jane. On one of August’s early commutes to school and Billy’s, a woman catches her eye on the “Q”. August is instantly drawn to Jane’s punk rock energy, her mysteriousness, and of course her good looks. Through their interactions one thing becomes increasingly clear - Jane is always there. No really. She’s ALWAYS there. Together they come to the conclusion that Jane is somehow trapped on the Q from the 1970s and it’s up to August and her friends to save Jane from her bound fate. But time is running out and as August and Jane grow closer, how will August ever let go? For fans of Red, White & Royal Blue, One Last Stop does not disappoint and is a solid sophomore book! McQuiston does a wonderful job at nailing that odd feeling you have as your early twenties start to transform into your mid-twenties and you stare out into the unknown of actual adulthood as college comes to a close. What do you want to do? Who will you be? Where will your relationships go? What will you take from your past and what will you leave behind? There are equal parts excitement and equal parts dread for the future and which one is prevailing can even change by the minute. It is a delicate balance that is hard to put in words, and it is very clearly and beautifully captured in August’s story.One Last Stop is full of McQuiston’s signature character banter - starting on page one. The fast-paced conversation style their characters’ have is extremely reminiscent of Gilmore Girls - which is a plus in our book. McQuiston’s writing style lends itself to feeling completely organic like a string of thoughts running through your head. It makes you feel as if you are experiencing the book in place of the character and really part of the story and very few authors achieve such flawless immersion as they do. While the pacing of Red, White, and Royal Blue felt too quick in some areas and a little too drawn out in others - One Last Stop is perfectly paced. They do a fantastic job balancing Q scenes with external scenes so the reader does not feel trapped in one spot. And when August is away from the Q (and Jane) Mcquiston is great at adding in tidbits to make the reader miss Jane just as August does. A huge theme of this book is” found family”. McQuiston really makes the reader wish they could move in with August and company and play rolly bangs. One Last Stop has a wide range of relationships in all shapes and sizes and full of fleshed-out and complex characters. Most (if not all) of the characters in this book (even minor ones) are LGBTQ+ giving it a beautiful amount of natural rep that feels anything but forced or contrived. Finally, Jane and August’s relationship is incredibly sweet and steamy. It captures that new relationship energy beautifully where you can’t get enough of the person, but your lives are not fully entwined yet so you spend your time apart daydreaming of them (and doing entirely too much texting). One of the ways they communicate when apart is through song requests on the radio which gives this relationship a nostalgic feel that turns the readers inside to warm mush. If you are looking for a read that’s the equivalent of a warm hug or are in need of a serotonin boost please pick up One Last Stop. You will not be disappointed!"
"August has recently moved into a Brooklyn apartment filled with quirky roommates. On the subway, she meets a mysterious butch woman. But this is more than just a passing connection. No matter when she gets on the subway, the woman, Jane, is there. When she figures out Jane is from the 1970s and frozen in time in the subway while the world progresses, August and her roommates work to free Jane, all while August starts to fall in love.Wow! What a wonderful novel that really captures queer culture. While set in the modern day, through Jane there is so much homage to early queer activism. When it talks about Jane’s leftist activism I got so excited because this is such a fascinating period in queer history that we need to restore. Drag culture is also heavily featured.Everything in this book is a delight. August just graduated from college and doesn’t know what to do with her life, which is so relatable to so many people. I got attached to every character. The roommates are such a wonderful cast of characters. You can really feel the bond people share in the story.Jane was amazing, I loved her. August and her’s romance is so wholesome and I got really invested in their relationship. The ending of the book was so intense I teared up.There’s many different subplots but they all tie together in the coolest ways. The reflection on toxic families and how people can do wonderful and terrible things at the same time was so interesting, as August’s grandparents and her mother hurt other people while also being loving of their family.I’m so happy I got a physical copy through Book of the Month. It’s a cute, quirky rom com but also so much more. A wonderful sapphic read."
"All the ingredients of this book were wildly appealing to me: New York City setting, especially Brooklyn (even a part of Brooklyn I’m quite familiar with!), romance, a paranormal twist, an author whose first book I loved. Unfortunately it just didn’t thrill me. I loved the focus on “found family” but I never wound up really caring about the main characters. Some of the side characters were more interesting than August and Jane.I loved McQuiston’s first book, Red, White and Royal Blue, but this one fell flat for me.Natalie Naudus did a great job with all the voices on the audiobook. I switched between the ebook and the audiobook, which was very handy.Thank you to NetGalley, MacMillan Audio and St. Martin's Griffin for the opportunity to listen to/read an advance readers copy of this book. All opinions are my own."
"In all fairness, I went into this book blind. I prefer it that way, but in this case I probably would've skipped it had I read the description first.  I saw an add on Facebook that I swear mentioned that Oprah loved this book so I had to read it.This is touted as a must read for summer and I just don't get it. However, I think this will live up to the hype for many people.What I Liked:August - likeable enough even though I did feel sorry for her too.Roommates & Neighbors - I loved them!Co-workers - I liked how they became an integral part of the story.The understanding that we all get lost at times in our life and how we find our way.JaneWhat I Didn't Like:While I liked Jane's character the whole premise of Jane was too unrealistic. I love a good dystopian or fantasy book, but this book isn't that so it just felt out of place."
"One Last StopCasey McQuistonI have to say, I went into this book so nervous about keeping my expectations in check as I have loved Red White and Royal Blue so much I wanted to have another winner in my hands as McQuiston is now an auto-buy author for me.I want to report that I loved every bit of this unique time slip sapphic romance tale that was beautifully weaved together into a fantastic story I could not resist. I loved the Asian rep in this story as well all the important themes played well into the story line.The writing was incredible - I enjoyed the found family trope and the character development was incredible. The romance was perfect and so incredibly queer. I really enjoyed this one a lot.I would also like to comment that the audio narration is so well done I highly recommend it."
"This delightful new-adult story will always have a special place in my heart because Casey McQuiston made me fall in love with her entertaining writing style and her vivid descriptions of New York City in all of its quirky and messy glory. I’m a huge fan of stories that feature a variety of characters from the LGBTQIA community and I must say that I was living my best life when I tagged along with August, Niko, Myla, Wes and Annie while they were throwing awesome parties and doing everything in their power to help Jane. Without a doubt, this novel is definitely a literary treat because this author has skillfully blended a budding romance, witty banter and an unbelievable time-slip with a dash of magic thrown in for good measure. Plus, I think this book cover is super cute and I can’t stop smiling every time I look at it!"
"All I know of New York City, I learned from Rent. If you love books with a diverse cast of lovably kooky characters - this is the romance for you. If you like found families, this is the book for you. And if you like a little magical realism to spice up your story, THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU.If you know Casey McQuiston because you loved “Red, White, and Royal Blue,” but are wondering, “Is this going to be as good? I’ve heard mixed reviews.” I will tell you that this book, both plot-wise and character-wise, are very different from RWaRB. The entirety of this book feels like that trip Alex and Henry and their friends snuck off on in the middle of RWaRB.I absolutely fell in love with all of these characters. The romance was *chef’s kiss*. I binge listened to the audiobook in about two days - I’m not sure how healthy that is but it was very fun. The narrator is FANTASTIC! Thank you @netgalley and @macmillan.audio for my Advanced Listener Copy - you made my day!"
"“But, you know, that feeling? When you wake up in the morning and you have somebody to think about? Somewhere for hope to go? It's good. Even when it's bad, it's good.”•Read for the inclusive, queer, sitcom in New York vibes!•One Last Stop had many good qualities. The variety of characters and the representation was great, the New York feels were on point, and Jane was a dreamy leading lady. It reads like one of those shows where there’s a big group of friends finding themselves in the big city and everyone is beautiful and lives these idealistic hipster lifestyles that somehow have coincidental mysteries and problems thrown in that get solved in unbelievable fashion. Unfortunately, it was still a real boring show for me. The magical element and Jane were literally the only interesting parts of the story and even with that the explanation was lackluster and the resolution was unsatisfying.I really wanted to love this book so I’m bummed that I didn’t. I am pretty sure I am in the minority though, so if it sounds up your alley then don’t skip it!"
"August has just moved to New York, she’s a little lost and looking for her place. As she’s finding her way she stumbles upon her new found family as well as a cute girl she met on the train. August’s subway crush becomes the best part of her day, until she discovers a large flaw: Jane is literally displaced in time from the 1970s. August tries her best to juggle solving the how and why all while falling in love at the same time.I don’t think I could ever forget this book. It’s quirky, it’s sweet and its magical. What else could you ask for? I really loved August, Jane and their found and real families. I could definitely see this translating really well to the screen. You’ve probably already read this one because it’s been everywhere, but just in case you haven’t, GO READ IT!"
"Cute meet on the train? COUNT ME IN! As I just moved to NYC, I love reading books set in NY and imagining that this all could happen to me. I went into this one without knowing the premise, I just knew I liked Casey McQuiston and wanted to read her new book. It took me some time to get into the science fiction of it all, just because I wasn’t expecting it, but other than that the book read smoothly. I do have a lot of questions after reading the ending, but I can’t write them here because *spoilers* so Casey if you see this, ya girl needs some answers.I loved the amazing cast of characters, their personalities, and the way they made you feel like they were your family. I enjoyed getting to see August grow as a person and open up to other people, finding her chosen family, and figuring out what she wanted in life. This book has an incredible LGBTQ+ representation that I wish I could se more in books."
"There's so much to love about Casey McQuiston's writing - but what's most admirable by far is this author's absolute RANGE. Where RWRB is a confetti-filled debut, ONE LAST STOP is a tenderly wrought and wonderful slow burn. It has all the trademarks of McQuiston's style: queer found families, high concept premise, delightful pop culture refs and a razor-sharp sense of humor. What struck me here was how very different it was from Red White and Royal Blue, in the most effortless and natural way. McQuiston is an author that understands how queerness can be both joy and heartbreak all at once. The love letter to queer communities of old and of new, the sense of place and love for New York City, these flawed and wonderfully human characters, they all hammer home one solid point: we're very lucky to have Casey writing queer love stories. This story made me laugh just as hard as I cried.....not to mention the sex scenes were steamy and exactly what we deserve! Cannot wait to see what direction this author will go in next....they have the RANGE!!!"
"This was a really fun and diverse f/f romance with some slight sci-fi elements. I listened to the audiobook and I enjoyed the narrator immensely. She did a great job at using different voices for each of the characters in order to distinguish between them.In the beginning I wasn’t really feeling connected to the story, but once Jane showed up everything turned around for me and I became invested. August was a bit dry for me on her own but I really enjoyed Jane and August together and especially loved all the side characters.There were a few minor things that bothered me about Augusts work ethic, the main one was how does she ever have any money? I know how expensive everything is in NYC and I don’t think in the real world August would have had enough money to survive, let alone do all the things she’s been doing. There were some other small unbelievable moments along the same vain that took me out of the magic of the book.Overall this was a great read full of found family, romance, and lots of inclusivity that I would definitely recommend to friends.All thoughts and opinions are mine."
"What a lovely book to start off  Pride month!  Living in NYC, it’s strange to say I have not ridden the subway in a year since working remotely. However, by reading this book, I am reminded by my love/hate relationship with it and all the interesting characters you witness on your train. 23 year old August moves to NYC, not quite feeling at home wherever she goes and not feeling rooted to the places/people around her. She gets thrown into a job at Billy’s Pancakes, a fast friendship with her Brooklyn roommates, and then her life is changed forever on the Q train when she meets Jane. She is the epitome of what August isn’t : confident, 70s/80’s punk rock, and very mysterious. After seeing each other for weeks on the same exact train, she notices Jane wears the same outfit and is ALWAYS on the Q train no matter when August gets on the subway - it seems that Jane is stuck there from the 1970s and doesn’t remember how she got there or where she came from.Their relationship/friendship was adorable to read and watch grow. Definitely a NYC love story - but then the fantasy elements pop in from the time travel aspect which makes it very intriguing. I was really hoping Jane wasn’t a ghost or something like that - I really cannot stand the ghost lover trope! Some parts were a bit slow and seemed redundant, but overall a very cute story.Thank you to St. Martin’s Griffin  and NetGalley for the advanced copy in exchange for my honest review."
"Thank you @netgalley & @librofm for the #gifted copy of this book.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 4/5 Stars🔥🔥🔥🔥 4/5 Steam RatingIf you’re looking a sweet sapphic romance with a bit of magic, this might be the one for you.Here’s what I enjoyed:🚇 The setting is unique, much of it takes place on the subway🚇 Although this is a sapphic romance, there is also a lot of other representation from the LGTBQIA community. 🏳️‍🌈🚇 I enjoyed the touch of magic within the story🚇 Bring on the steam!! 🔥𝙰𝚞𝚍𝚒𝚘𝚋𝚘𝚘𝚔 𝚃𝚑𝚘𝚞𝚐𝚑𝚝𝚜: I LOVE listening to Natalie Naudus narrate books, so I was excited to see her on this one. Her voice brings the characters to life and she’s just so easy to listen to (even sped up)."
"This was a really interesting, sweet and complex story of coming of age in NYC and discovering yourself someplace where you can be your authentic self.August feels lonely, but her roommates are doing the best to make sure she knows she's not alone. And her job has her navigating the NYC Subway system, where she meets Jane after a series of mishaps leaves her shaken up and covered in coffee. Their relationship develops on the subway, and through Jane, August starts to experience more and open her eyes and mind to a world of possibilities.One Last Stop is a wonderful listen about August's personal road to discovery. The narration by Natalie Naudus is great. She really takes us into August's mind, her emotions, her heart, through all of this."
"This was fantastic. I couldn't put it down, and read the entire thing throughout two reading sessions in one day, because sleep was not an option until I had answers. It's like the romantic comedy version of The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue. August has just moved to New York to try and get lost in the city. She's been alone almost her entire life, as her uncle went missing before she was born and her mother has been dedicated to finding out what happened to him ever since. August learned to speak so she could ask questions, and learned to read so she could help sort through files. She was practically raised to be a detective, but she's done with that now. Now, she's going to finish college and figure out what she wants to do with the rest of her life.At least, that was the plan, before she a wreck of a first day that is ultimately salvaged by meeting a girl named Jane on the subway. Jane is quickly all encompassing - she has a way of being able to charm anyone - and before August knows what's happening she's meeting up with Jane on her commute every day.But no matter how many times August asks Jane to meet up with her outside of the subway, it just doesn't seem to happen. Because Jane can't ever leave the subway. Originally from the 70s, Jane has been stuck riding the same line for fifty years, with no idea what's going on. August makes it her new mission to find a way to free Jane - even if that means they can't be together anymore.I loved discovering what happened to Jane, and the highly supportive atmosphere August has found herself in. This is such a cute, up-lifting book."
"I loved so much about this book, beginning with Casey McQuiston’s prose. The way they write just works for me. Additionally, Natalie Naudu’s narration of the audiobook feels spot-on as a match for the writing style.The world-building is masterful. Brooklyn and the different settings all felt so vivid. The way McQuiston develops Augusts’ roommates and acquaintances makes them jump off the page. They’re such a fun and engaging group of characters. I would genuinely love to hang out with them.Another thing I really liked was the mixture of genres. Yes, it’s a romance, but it’s also a mystery with time-travel woven in. The love story remains at the heart of the novel even as August works through the threads of several different mysteries.While I loved many things about this book, I had two major issues with it. One of them is August herself. Some of the things she does just don’t make sense, for example completely dropping her work and school duties in order to figure out what’s going on with Jane when they barely know each other. I find it really difficult to believe that so early on in her job at Pancake Billy’s she’d be allowed to come back after practically falling off the face of the earth.The other problem was the pacing. It started off fine, and I fell in love with the book immediately. The middle third of the book really dragged for me because it felt repetitive. I found my attention wandering and almost dreaded hitting play. I realize that it takes time to develop a deep and meaningful relationship, but since August and Jane were so limited, many of their encounters were quite similar.I received a copy of this book through #NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review."
"This is a queer romcom that was so well done on audiobook. The narrator, Natalie Naudus, was excellent. I really enjoyed Casey McQuiston's first book ""Red White and Royal Blue"", so I can honestly say I will be definitely be reading her future books. This was a really fun twist on a time travel, coming of age romance between the main Characters August and Jane. I thought it was brilliant and unique. I loved August's ""family"" that she makes in her room area and the banter between them is entertaining. I loved the mystery of what keeps Jane on this train forever, and August's insistence on trying to figure it out. I definitely thought this one was really well written, and although you will have to suspend some disbelief, I don't usually have issues with that."
"When I saw that Casey McQuiston was coming out with a new book, I KNEW I needed to read it, and I didn't actually expect to get this arc. I was kind of scared that it would not meet my expectations as RWRB is one of my all time favorite books, but I'm sooooo glad it did not disappoint. I cried twice and broke out laughing a few times, and overall, I just found this to be such a beautiful, heartwarming book.Full disclaimer, I did not read the book blurb carefully enough before diving straight into this book, so when it jumped into sci-fi territory I was SOOOO confused and I definitely did not see that coming at all. But I think it's super amazing that Casey McQuiston is kind of expanding genres, while still staying true to herself and writing the most beautiful LGBTQ+ books ever.I love August, I love the way she's written, and the way she thinks and acts. But I ABSOLUTELY STANNNNN Jane. She's written so beautifully, and every aspect of her soul makes me believe in love and sunshine and strawberry milkshakes on a summer day. I also really love seeing an asian character so upfront in a novel, especially in a LGBTQ dynamic. And the way her character and background is developed is so intricate and detailed, and I just absolutely l o v e the representation.In terms of writing, I found that like RWRB, this book also has a semi-epistolary format? But unlike the letters in RWRB, each chapter starts off with a little snippet from different mediums, and I just found it a super enchanting way to ground the reader and kind of give little pieces of Jane's personality and life, especially since this book has no head-hopping. I also found the use of present tense to be really interesting, but like RWRB, Casey McQuiston can pull it off! It really just pulls you in and makes you feel like you're living the book with them.I really loved this book, and 10/10 would recommend. As always the dialogue was witty and quippy and fun, and I loved how One Last Stop brought in that element of sci-fi to a beautifully written LGBTQ love story :D."
"Waitress August is working her way through college, living in a tiny apartment with three roommates. During her morning commute to school, she meets a captivating young woman on the subway. They strike up a friendship, and August soon realizes Jane isn't what she appears to be. Can Jane escape the time slip she seems to be caught in—and can August bear to let go of the woman who's won her heart?This book is about as different from RED, WHITE, AND ROYAL BLUE as it can be. It's an emotional and intricately woven story with unique and interesting characters. If you like magical realism and a joyous celebration of diversity, this book is for you.Thanks, NetGalley, for the ARC I received. This is my honest and voluntary review."
"As it gets warmer and life returns to a slightly more familiar series of events, I have been struggling to focus on my to-be-read pile (which is more out of hand than usual). So I was thrilled that the author of my beloved Red, White & Royal Blue had written a new love story.I really enjoyed reading  about August and her found family and watching her open her heart in New York to life and love and Jane. This is the perfect Pride Month romance, because we as a reader get just enough queer history through Jane’s stories to make us go search for even more articles online.  There’s so much romance/heartache I can’t wait for Casey’s next book. One Last Stop is a must read this summer, for sure!"
"I have read multiple LGBTQ books so far in 2021, and I have come to realize they have amazing friend groups.  They are all supportive, accepting, quirky and enjoyable groups of people.  I wish I had a friend group like that.  I struggled early on with this book, and I'm not even entirely sure I can put my finger one why.  I had a hard time with the concept of the book, but it was unique and clever.  I'm not even entirely sure I was ok with how it ended.  I didn't hate it, quite the opposite, but I didn't absolutely love it.  I do understand this is not the first time two people from different time periods have successfully had a romantic relationship, I just found it far-fetched.  Regardless, it's a decent read."
"It took me two days to finish just the first twenty percent of this book. It was quite the slow read in the beginning and once you hit twenty percent it’s like “wham”. The author hits you with this curve ball that is this huge twist in the story and gosh, it got so darn interesting. I had so many questions and just loved it from then on. August and Jane are brilliant, beautiful and just utterly lovable. I adored August’s entire adopted family and wish I could read each of their stories. This story is for the ages, quite literally too. I absolutely adored it and would highly recommend this book.I received this ARC from NetGalley and the publisher for an honest review*"
"From an author I will always love, we get a brilliant sapphic story about love that travels through time. This is chock-full of incredible rep, the absolute BEST side characters and a public transportation system that almost feels like it’s own character.August moves to NYC to branch out and live her own life away from her zany investigative mother. Finding a group of people who become like family to her and a job in a place that kind of feels magical, she happens upon a stunning girl on her commute to school... the only problem is that she may not be from the here and now.I really loved this sweet and romantic story about love and found family. This solidifies that McQuiston is one I will be a forever fan of!"
"When I found out Casey McQuiston, author of my favorite gay-boys-in-love reimagining of the 2016 election, was writing a sci fi-adjacent romance about queer women, I was...very excited. I expected to love this book, and I did, and frankly I don't want to say too much else about it because I think you will also love this book and I don't want to spoil it for you.Instead, a brief series of analogies:-Like Veronica Mars, if our intrepid detective traded the horrible frat boys for a hot, dimpled girl in a leather jacket-Like Scooby Doo, if the Scooby gang was much less white, way more queer, and spent their time unmasking the mystery of the space-time continuum instead of bad guys in clown masks-Like ""Happiest Season"" if Kristen Stewart stayed in the bar singing carols with drag queens instead of leaving to watch Mackenzie Davis flirt with her ex-boyfriendHonestly, this book about love and finding yourself in your twenties and queer community and navigating changing relationships with family felt like it was written with me in mind, and I think that will likely be the case for a lot of its millennial readers. One thing I admire about McQuiston is the fact that she doesn't seem too worried about how her speech patterns or references will age; there were moments in One Last Stop where I laughed out loud and simultaneously thought, ""Will anyone understand this in two years?"" The result is a romance that celebrates life as it is now and feels new and nostalgic at the same time. Everything I wanted it to be."
"August is just like most of us, especially after all the heartbreak and disappointment life has sometimes. She has totally given up on love and doesn’t believe in it or happiness really for that matter. But her roommates and Jane start to challenge that. When we get hurt we want to hide all the soft parts of ourselves away. Just like August. August is awkward, hurt, sensitive, and loving. She loves with so much of her soul, it hurts. Jane is mysterious, flirty, fun. All the things that will easily grab your attention and make you fall in love with her. She challenges August, and August challenges her. Forcing one another to not give up and to believe in the impossible. August’s roommates, absolutely love them. They are so ride-or-die for August, it’s great. Plus, they’re so unique and their individual personalities/skills help August throughout the book. They mysteries of the story are interesting and make you wonder. I was constantly asking questions, and wasn’t sure how this book would end. Plus the little insights to the history of the LGBTQ+ just made me love this book more. Warmed my heart and definitely made me cry."
"I don't even know where to start with this book. It has taken the coveted spot of my favorite book. If I could, I'd give it 10 stars. It's everything this world needs right now. I liked Red, White, and Royal Blue, but this.... this was just a whole new level. The F/F romance was a breath of fresh air in the YA world. And I loved the magical elements. It wasn't a ""magical"" book but it had just enough in it to make the book something super special.The one thing that got me the most was the characters, they are absolutely amazing. I want to be friends with each and every one of them. Each and every character was diverse in their own way and brought together made the storyline that much more awesome. I think the characters tied the perfect bow on top of the theme of staying true to yourself and surrounding yourself with people who make you feel special.I can't wait to buy this book for all of my friends!"
"This was not my normal type of book, but I am so glad I gave it a try. Normally if I see a description that involved something with time travel, I’d skip the book. But, it was done in a way that was believable and interesting. I loved Jane and August, and felt for their characters and the challenges they faced. I also had a soft spot for Wes, and his struggles.  As I read the book, I wasn’t sure how it would end, and struggled to think about what ending I was rooting for. I was really pleased with how the book ended. This was a really unique and interesting book.  I received an ARC from netgalley, and this is my honest review."
"Y’all ready for my jumbled thoughts?WHERE DO I BEGIN?! I had high expectations for this novel and it somehow exceeded them?!Our main focus is August and of course Jane, but we have quite the ensemble of characters and I adored every single one. The romance? Incredible. The plot? Intriguing. The pop culture references? Obsessed!I am so excited I understood everything that was referenced. There is a Lost reference about being a constant and wow way to make my heart ache years later 😭The first half of the book drops us into August’s new life in New York. Soon she meets Jane on the subway and her life changes. The first half really set up the second half without being too in your face. We learn everything the same time as August. The second half is just a rollercoaster of emotions. I would be sad then happy then crying then freaking out! This book is definitely a new all time favourite and it has been so long since I wanted to scream about a book 😩I am still processing to be honest. I am just gonna have some pancakes or a chocolate bagel and watch Say Anything. Maybe listen to an oldies radio station. Read the book to understand and feel what I’m feeling. Please!Also, August is bisexual and wow we are just WINNING aren’t we?"
I enjoyed the story even though it was a little far-fetched. The whole thing was a little long for me but there was always something going on. I loved all the different characters and everyone was interesting. They all had lots of things going on and led different lifestyles.I loved that Jane was stuck on the train and they all had to figure out how to get her off. I also loved how August complained about her life and the things her mother drug her into but ended up loving those things in the end.I gave it four hearts because I thought it was a little long but would recommend it. It's a fun read.
"August has come to New York City to find herself and to not feel alone. Thanks to her wonderful roommates she finds a job and finally learns the subway system. When August is at her worst the kindness of a stranger upends her entire world. As she finds out more and more about her mystery girl she learns that love can truly hold us all together.This was my first book by this author and it won't be my last. It was such a good book that balanced hope and heartbreak, love and friendship and wrapped around you like a warm blanket.Thank you to Netgalley and publishers for letting me read this advanced copy."
"I’m crying the happiest of tears, what a book. This is the sapphic romcom time slip story I never knew I needed this much.ONE LAST STOP is a book I want to live in, that I want to wrap myself up in. The queer found family is everything and authentic. The bi rep is spot on, the song references have prompted me to make a Spotify playlist in between reading sessions so I can listen and dream even more about this book. I can’t wait for this book to be out in the world, and I’m especially excited for the world to fall in love with August & Jane as much as I have."
"A group of misfit friends/roommates that turn into their own little family. One Last Stop takes you on an unexpected adventure. It dragged at some places for me, other times it moved right along. Full of interesting and quirky characters. The unravelling of the mystery surrounding Jane is interwoven with the development of their relationship and growth of all the characters. What I loved the most about the book is how New York was portrayed – it’s a character in itself. Not my favorite read but not a bad book overall. The writing is good, characters quirky and fun."
"This story kept me reading, kept me (sorta) invested, but I just didn’t love it as much as the author’s first book.  I wanted to know how it ended, but I found myself skimming through parts in the middle. I was not that invested in the main characters, and the time travel aspect of the story  was kind of strange and jarring in a rom com.  A fresh spin on the genre, but not my personal taste."
"What do I say about this book? I’ve slowly been reading it over a couple months. Overall, I enjoyed it. There were moments it dragged. That’s when I would put it down and come back to it later. It didn’t take very long for me to realize this is a book that you just don’t know what is going to happen next. I did like that it was different. This book is full of interesting characters that I would love to meet and be friends with. It’s definitely an unexpected adventure that I’m glad I went on.I voluntarily read an early copy."
READ UPDATE BELOW!Original: I wanted to love it SO BADLY. I can usually finish a book in days but ive tried and tried and tried and tried again and just cant get hooked on it! I'm 20% through the book and if it hadnt read stuff about it before i would genuinely have no idea where it was going. The story is just way too disconnected. It doesnt leave me with a desire to know whats happeneing next.UPDATE: once you get to the part where they know sometime is up Jane it gets better and better and AMAZING! All the build ip pays off and makes sense as it is weaved into the story it all comes together. It's like listening to a dissonant chord that comes together and resolved itself inti something beautiful and harmonious. I definitely recommend reading this book! The end was so spectacularly wrotten and emotional it is so worth it!!
"One Last Stop by Casey McQuinston is a fantastic and endearing summer read. Main character August Landry is lovable, sarcastic, and relatable throughout her move to New York City and subsequent quest to help the mysterious girl on the Q train and to help her mother find a long lost relative. This novel has excellent pacing without a dull moment, coupled with tasteful pop culture references and the use of magazine clippings and craigslist listings to keep the reader interested in the identity of the girl on the Q train."
"I do not have the words for how incredible this story was! I didn’t know what to expect when it started but I was instantly captivated. All of the characters had such depth and personality. They weren’t just in the background, they all played a part in the plot and the storyline. I loved how August tried hard to be tortured and was afraid to love and be loved. I thought it was amazing how everything tied together in the end and that everyone found their place, their home, their belonging"
"McQuiston has a way with making me fall in love with her characters. Red, White & Royal Blue was one of my favorite reads of last year and One Last Stop was just as good. This was definitely one of my favorite reads this year!Pros:- Sapphic romance with tons of diversity. The protagonist is bi and lives with a psychic trans guy and his girlfriend, plus their gay roommate who is in love with the drag queen across the hall— and I am obsessed with every single one of them. It’s a nice change of pace from the typical cis white characters in the genre.- Love a good found family trope.- August’s anxiety made her so relatable- “I convinced myself that, because the statistical likelihood of something happening in real life exactly the way I imagined it was so low, if I imagined the worst possible things in vivid detail, I could mathematically reduce the odds of them happening.”Cons:- There are a few glaring plot holes which I won't state hear because of spoilers but found it frustrating.- The time slip was a little weird and the whole wrap up of it just seemed unexplained and unresolved to me.- The portrayal of life in New York is a little too sunshine and rainbows for my taste."
"One Last Stop was a great read by Casey McQuiston. August is a twenty three year old cynic who just moved to New York City. She believes that this move will prove magic and cinematic love stories doesn't exist. She then meets a gorgeous girl, Jane, on the train. After spending time together, August realizes there's a big problem. Jane has been displaced in time from the 1970s and stuck on the train. I really enjoyed reading this book and cant wait to read more by the author."
"Red, White and Royal is one of my all time favorite books, so of course I have been eagerly awaiting what would come next from this author. One Last Stop did not disappoint! While this isn't going to make my all time favorite list, I can already tell this will be one if my favorites of the year. The storyline was gripping, the characters engaging, and the narration was fantastic. I felt all the emotions in this book. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ I recommend for fans of Oona Out of Order."
"I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about this book once I realized it has some sci-fi elements to it (ones that I rarely enjoy) but I really loved this book. It made me laugh out loud; it made me cry, and it warmed my heart in a big way. The found family in this novel is beyond compare and the fully queer and fantastic cast of characters gave me such cozy warm accepting vibes. I adored each character, the way they had one another's backs, and the raw realness of being young and queer and also the sheer audacity of loving yourself just as you are. It's a fantastic letter to the queer community of the past and the appreciation and respect given to them for all their hard work to pave a path for queer kids today.In true Casey form the sex scenes are fire, the friendships and banter are top-notch, and the message is clear and threaded throughout the entire novel. It's a masterpiece and if you loved their other work, you're going to adore this one. I can't wait for everyone to get their hands on this book."
"This was a sweet and entertaining romance that takes place in my favorite city which made it even more of a delight to read. I loved the setting, all the side characters, and the quick-witted banter between them. You can find family, unconditional love, and acceptance in the most unlikely places. There were many heartwarming instances in this book. The thing that fell flat for me was the romance between Jane and August and the time travel aspect of it."
"Started off reading this with high expectations and I was really confused at first about what was going on. But I very quickly fell in love with the story and the characters. I don’t want to leave any spoilers, but I loved how the author brought so many things together and tied them up in such an emotional way. The writing was beautiful and the themes of love, friendship and family were interwoven into a book I couldn’t stop reading."
"I am getting way too old to be up till 1:30am reading a book with my phone down to 2% and my body aching from being huddled on one side of the bed to prevent my sleeping husband from seeing my phone’s light, and get here we are. And you know what? I’d do it again in a HEARTBEAT. This book was beautifully written, it was funny and endearing and sexy and mysterious and frustrating and wonderful and I freaking loved everything about it."
"So, this book definitely wasn't what I expected in ways both good and bad. It's wonderfully, lovingly queer, full of a weird and delightful found family. The supporting cast was honestly my favorite part of the book. August is prickly, flawed, and stubborn, but I couldn't help rooting for her. While I didn't love the supernatural/supernatural adjacent elements to the story, they didn't pull me out like has happened in other romances."
"I just—I hope this makes sense.You know how in epic fantasy movies, there’s a scene where the camera pans out over impossible, beautiful scenery and the music swells and so does your heart? Somehow Casey does this to my brain, but with words. Just, words about romance.This book was poetry. It was the taste of late-night radio and cheesy 90s romance movies and glitter; the smell of gritty public transportation and 2 am pancakes and falling in love; everything familiar and everything new. It was beautifully impossible, and it was epic.And my heart swelled."
"A book about the people and places that make you believe that love (and magic) is possible, and a sort of coming-of-age story for 'new adults' who are still figuring life out and feeling cynical about student loans. It's funny and sexy and wears its heart on its sleeve, and I adored every page.As in Red, White, and Royal Blue, McQuiston never shies away from in-the-moment cultural references, and that's part of what makes the setting of this book shine through so well (I remember laughing at a description of someone's Pickle Rick pin). Impossibly witty side characters form a delightful found family, and snippets of queer history are interlaced throughout. The mystery/ science-fiction parts don't take themselves too seriously, but they hold up well and build toward a satisfying emotional conclusion.I look forward to revisiting Jane and August's story often.Thank you NetGalley, St. Martin”s Publishing Group and Casey McQuiston for allowing me to read this eARC. All opinions are my own, and I bought my physical copy as soon as it was available!"
This book is a bit of FF romance with some magic on the New York subway thrown in. I really enjoyed this book. The characters were fabulously developed and the pace was good. It has lots of interesting LGBQT character in it. What a great story.
"It was just ok for me, not bad, but just not as good as I had hoped. I was really expecting more. I don't know if it was just me and the things I had going on, but I felt myself getting distracted by other things and it was taking me longer to get through it than usual. Like I said it could just be because I had a lot going on but it just didn't keep my attention like I would of liked it too. It was still OK though."
"Tried to like this book, listened to it for 12 hours but it just ended lamely. The story was ridiculous to begin with. Yes there are lesbians from the 70’s stuck on subways all over New York. The ending was very much a pat ending and I was extremely disappointed by it. There were several ways the writer could have gone with at the end and it seems she picked the easiest one to get to, not the best one. I don’t normally return audible books but I had to with this one. Very disappointed."
"One Last Stop is a decent read. August sees someone on the subway and falls for her. I thought the cast of roommates was an eccentric mix. The one part of the story that really didn’t work for me was the time travel aspect. Normally, I’m not a fan of time travel stories. I didn’t realize this book had that aspect from the description. However, it could have more appeal to different readers."
"The author called this an unbury your gays story, and it is, and that is glorious. And I’m a sucker for this sort of found family tale, even at the same time as it drives me crazy, I cannot resist the ‘keeps to herself girl rents a room from the worlds most interesting people and they love her fur no reason and she becomes one of them’ trope I guess.Now write me a book about Wes and Isaiah, please"
"I truly enjoyed this book! I felt connected to the characters almost immediately and I truly felt like I was part of the group figuring out how to help Jane. I sometimes find 3rd person difficult to read, but I bought the audio book along with it and it was great! I think the folks that didn’t connect with the book, may not like the found family trope…which is totally fine! But from my perspective, this felt like true queer friendships and found-family perspective that a lot of queer folks (like myself) find super comforting and realistic (even for the books’ timey-wimey twist). Already recommended it to many of my friends!"
"This book was SO good. The characters are diverse, and they were each their own person. The way the paranormal aspect of this story is woven into the contemporary-ness... it was brilliant. I loved the romance, it wasn't too ""slow burn"" but it wasn't rushed either... And the ending just made me SO happy. I adore Jane Su!!! Can I be her best friend please?"
"""Sometimes you just have to feel it because it deserves to be felt.""Intriguing, romantic, funny, hopeful, and so much more than I can put into words. I LOVED this book. I loved August, Jane, and all of the other characters in the story. A love story spun together with mystery and belonging and connection and grief and LGBTQ+ history, and more.This unexpected novel pulled me in right away, made me fall in love with the characters, NYC, and the community August finds herself a part of. It is beautifully written and shares so many diverse perspectives that there's a little bit for everyone!Read it! Do it!"
"Finished last night and I’m still processing! This book was a window in many ways- setting, culture, and more. I really enjoyed how New York City was such an important part of the story- almost a character itself. There is a sci-fi element that requires suspending disbelief, but it’s an enjoyable twist. I’ve never read a book like this before!"
"This book was well written and the characters seemed to just jump off the pages. They seem so real and lifelike. I felt like I was right there in New Orleans, New York and California with them the whole time I was reading this book. Thank you for writing such a great book!I offered to read this book and so very glad I did"
I go into stories without knowing what they are about as I did with this story.  It took me a little bit to understand what was happening but Casey McQuiston does a great job writing her characters and I enjoyed August and her roommates.  I also enjoyed the mystery that was woven throughout the story which August works to unravel.
"No like actually. Like I read it on kindle and plan on ordering the paperback to have in my library. If this was a movie I would watch it. I love that it doesn’t follow to typical tropes and obstacles in queer fiction. It is purely magic. I myself might just pick up and move to New York. I can’t afford that. But I can afford the paper copy so that’s gonna have to do. Can this be a movie please? With all the bad queer films we need a win and this would be a win. Thank you, just thank you for writing this book. From a 22 almost 23 year old too terrified to live my own love story, thank you for providing me one of if not the best one I’ve read yet."
"This book demonstrates love in so many different ways, I just want to give it a hug.I loved August, her quirky roommates/coworkers/neighbors who become her found family, and Jane.  August is one smart cookie, determined to help Jane remember her past.Casey McQuiston’s bright, smart writing is balanced with  shadowy mystery in both Jane and August’s story. The chemistry between August and Jane crackles, and the slow burn until they *finally* address their feelings (they aren’t just kissing for research!) is worth it."
"I didn't initially realize this book had a Sci fi time travel aspect to it, but I really enjoyed it. The whole idea of the book was so interesting to me. Towards the end there were some over the top mushy sex scenes that I felt didn't really add much but otherwise I liked this book and would recommend it."
"Although not quite as good as Red White and Royal Blue, still very good. I love all of the characters and feel like they have all become my friends as well. It was fun remembering the 70’s and seeing how much has changed through the eyes of someone that didn’t get to ease into those changes gradually."
"I absolutely loved Red, White, and Royal Blue, because who doesn’t love a good enemies to lovers trope?One Last Stop fell a little flat for me. I’m not sure if it was because I had such high expectations or the fact that I hated the time line part of the story. I found myself yawning through the parts with August and Jane, but I absolutely adored her roommates. They were so fun!This book was a little long and drawn out, definitely could have been shorter. Don’t get me wrong, I liked it, I just didn’t love it."
"I don’t write reviews because I am not good at it, but this book- oh this book. It blew me away with how much I fell in love with every single page of it. The characters are my everything. If it sounds like your sort of thing, please give it a try because it is worth all the stars and all the pennies. Do it! You won’t regret it."
"I could not love this story more. It is stunning. Delightful, hopeful, funny, clever, and inclusive. So much representation woven with a unique story. Not just a queer romance. A touch of science fiction, just enough to move the plot along, but the romantic aspects make you believe in love. I will be recommending this book for years!"
"I wanted to read something out of my wheel house and so when I saw this one available on NetGalley I requested it. I'm glad I did. I found the beginning sucked me right in. I got so many feels while reading this. It was humorous, without being silly and the characters were so loveable."
There are all kinds of fun characters and interesting storylines in here.Did I mention there is a cutie romance too?Well there is!I did the audio and it just added some extra feels while reading.Much love to NetGalley & MacMillan audio for my early copy.
"This was weird, fun, sexy, and sweet. The fantasy time travel aspect had the unexpected benefit of adding some LGBTQIA history that gave the story additional depth. I really enjoyed it!"
"this book is so loving, lived-in, wistful, joyful, gay. it's steeped in queer community and history and family. it's funny and dreamy and dead-sexy. and it's what we deserve. we deserve jane's smirk and her dirtbag rolled-up sleeves. we deserve august's helpless staring and her little oranges and the snap of a thigh-high stocking. we deserve queer women being bone-on-a-train horny and we deserve pancakes. goodbye."
"This was a cute story, but not what I was expecting. I ended up skimming a lot. I liked the characters, but the story just did not quite work for me."
A new favorite for me... I could rave about this book forever but I'll end up spoiling it for everyone so my recommendation is READ IT!!
I can't say enough about how much I LOVED THIS BOOK. Jane is my new book girlfriend and will be from now to the rest of eternity.
"I LOVED this book, the characters and the funny dialogue until the ending. SPOILERS - I know it is a romance but I thought the author went the safe route. Would have been more powerful, to me, if Jane walks into Billy’s having aged 40 years. That would have added the final star."
"i didn't read the back before starting so i went in not knowing anything about the book. when i started i was a bit eh , but once we started to learn about jane i was invested. i ended up reading like more than half of the book in a day."
Better than RWRB in my opinion!! Women kissing on the subway! Time travel! We love to see it!
"Could not put this one down. The style, the cast of characters, the brush into LGTBTQ history, the ridiculously over-the-top yet addictive plot... loved every second. Please forgive the lack of racial sensitivity, but tell me someone else pictures Kristen Kish as Jane Su 😍 Must read for someone looking for a quick transportation into a quirky and fun love story!!"
"A glorious, all-the-feels read that broke me in half and put me back together again!"
"this is such a heartfelt, classic romance absolutely thrumming with life—one of those heart-stopping cinematic books you can practically taste, with absolutely enormous emotional fireworks. a luxuriously immersive scope, big belly laughs, and a beautiful, beyond satisfying emotional pay-off. i'm already looking forward to my next re-read."
Not a fan of this book. I was bored through most of it and skimmed some pages. It was more tolerable towards the end when the pace picked up. I couldn’t connect with Jane’s “existence”.  I love books that linger in my mind for days after I finish them. This was not one of those books.
"I had such a good time reading this! I struggle to read romance a lot of the time, but this is an adorable romance and one of my favorite books of the year"
I couldn’t finish it. This might be the worst book I’ve ever read.
I have rarely felt more loved or seen as someone who has been lonely in New York than while reading One Last Stop. August and Jane is the romance I have needed in my life — and Casey writes the hell out of a love scene.
"what an amazing book! august and jane were so adorable and i love the author’s writing style. emotional, hilarious, and unforgettable! i highly recommend one last stop."
Love a good sapphic novel (there aren’t many) but omg this book was incredible. New favorite. Have already reread! 🤍
i loved this book so much. i finished it in 18 hours worth of a road trip and I'm in love with the characters
still thinking about it days later
Best novel I've read all year!
"I don’t know if I loved One Last Stop as much as Red, White, and Royal Blue, but I still really loved it.I loved all the elements of queer history, I loved the tight-knit queer community, and I loved, loved the NYC setting. It brought all the weird and crazy things I love about NYC onto the pages.The perfect mix of humorous, heartwarming, and adventurous. Definitely recommend!"
"Definitely a great read, I didn't put the book down. Recommend this book to everybody.  Please support this book.. 🥰"
"This 👏 Is 👏 A 👏 Science 👏 Fiction 👏 Contemporary 👏 Romance! I’ve honestly never read one and it’s just delightful. What a lovely, beautiful, everything-smells-like-pancakes-and-now-I’m-hungry love story. I’m going out for pancakes tonight.August has moved to NYC to finish college and figure out what she wants to do with her life. Her new roommates are amazing, interesting people, who help her get a job at Pancake Billy’s House of Pancakes. On her commute she meets Jane, a woman so intriguing that August makes sure to see her on the subway as often as possible. They strike up a friendship (for August, a crush) and then one day August realizes that Jane is stuck in time on the subway; she’s from the ‘70’s. From there August does everything she can to help free Jane.The world of this story, down to the details, is incredible and is what I’ve come to expect from Casey McQuiston. The characters either know exactly who they are or are finding themselves in the most honest and true ways. Everyone is three dimensional. The places (tiny apartments, diners, subways) are perfectly described down to the smells, scuffs, and graffiti.I worried, going in, that there would be the pitfalls of a “time-travel” story: paradoxes and other concepts I try to ignore when my nerdiest friends are yelling about them, but because this isn’t about time-travel, but more a science fiction story plot, I was able to dispense reality from the situation and just enjoy the creativity in the writing and the relationship between August and Jane.Another feather in Casey McQuiston’s cap, for sure. -Ford———————————Casey McQuiston knocked me on my ass. I remember the Q being called the QB and as I read the reminder of that fact, I got immediately nostalgic for that summer in NY and the person I chased to Coney Island. The soft-serve flavored kisses, the sway of the train and the feeling expanding in my chest. And the heart-break, I remember the feel of my heart cracking in half to the sound of the QB rattling on the bridge.This book was everything that summer brought to me. All the loveliness and longing, and even sadness. Gorgeous, languid, impossible feeling wrapped in a story that could only happen once.When I cried, I did so for August and Jane, but also for me. For the me of back then. The young woman, who believed in impossible things. I cried for the current Jane and August and the current me, who still believe in impossible things.Thank you for the book that made me cry, and love, and feel, and remember that bridge, that train, and that kiss. - Sky"
"I'm a jaded, long-time romance reader, and I loved Red, White & Royal Blue so much that it was urgent that I keep my expectations in check for One Last Stop. One Last Stop is Casey McQuiston's sophomore book, and I thought to expect it to be anywhere near as successful as Red, White & Royal Blue would be foolish. In truth, I barely read the blurb (and then promptly forgot what I read, as is my custom with blurbs), so the book was almost wholly a surprise to me. And, guys, I loved it. I loved it so much.I started One Last Stop last night intending to just read a few chapters, and I stayed up all night last reading. I almost cried when it ended. I never wanted it to stop.However, when I started the story, I felt a little... uneasy. Third person, present tense writing isn't my thing, and I was feeling a little disconnected from the story. At 10% in, I wasn't sure about it, didn't know where the plot was taking me, but once I started to piece things together, I was hooked (remember, didn't read the blurb...).I'm a time-travel, time-slip junkie, and books with those elements have a huge statistical advantage over contemporary books to be favorites of mine. Imagine my utter delight when I realized the full plot of this story. I was obsessed.Also, let me wax poetic about the chemistry. I've read a lot of romance books in my time, and I have certain preferences that are long established. I like my romances slow-burn and with enough sexual tension that it's thick and almost tangible. I like things to build and build and build until everything explodes. Casey McQuiston paced this romance perfectly. The physical and romantic chemistry grew and grew until it was unbearable, and then everything crescendoed and exploded. As someone who reads a lot of explicit romance, I would probably categorize this as on the tamer side, but because the sexual tension is incredibly built-up, it felt so satisfyingly erotic.Aside from the physical, I ached for these characters. I absolutely loved them together and I was rooting for them as a couple like I haven't in a long time. I was near tears at time while reading, just because of my own overwhelming feelings about the romance. Casey McQuiston made me love this couple and their epic romantic story.While the main characters were enough to carry the story alone, the side characters were all so amazing and well-developed that it enhanced an already amazing story. I'm talking the queer cast of my dreams, each with their own backstory and interest and flaws. I fell in love with each of them, and I found myself wanting to live in a little 6-story walk-up in Flatbush, just so we could hang out. They were all so impossibly interesting and cool, and Casey McQuiston wrote them all with such care and nuance.There are so many factors that I can't touch upon completely in this review because it's already extremely long and embarrassingly gushy. I'm talking about the Asian rep (an Asian butch character in a leather jacket, seriously be still my f*ing heart), the bisexual MC in a F/F romance, DRAG QUEENS, the humor, the backdrop of New York (in my opinion, the greatest city in the world), the 24 hour pancake house, and the mystery of the MCs uncle. I could wax poetic about this book for another 1,000 words, but instead, just read the book yourself. I'm seriously just ordering you to order it now.Casey McQuiston, you did it. One Last Stop was the time-slip, sapphic romance of my dreams.*Copy provided in exchange for an honest review*"
"One Last Stop by Casey McQuistonAvailable NowThis is such a fun and sweet romance! McQuiston has this gift of taking an imaginative and wild concept and making it feel realistic and relatable. Intent on taking control of her life, August Landry moves to New York City, enrolls in college, finds an eclectic group of roommates, lands a job, and falls in love with a girl on the subway. Seems like everyone’s fantasy, right? But August falls in love with Jane Su, a young woman who is fascinating, beautiful, smart, kind, and seems to know everyone. She also seems to always be on the train. As August falls more and more in love with the punk rock loving Jane, she also discovers that Jane doesn’t just seem to love a different time, she is literally from another time. Jane Su went missing 45 years ago and her connections to August’s life run far deeper than a school girl crush.As the two discover more about Jane’s past and what may have trapped her on the train, August and her incredible group of new friends do everything they can to save Jane from living on the train for eternity.I am a true sucker for a found family and August definitely won the lottery with her amazing roommates. Niko, bartender by day and part-time psychic, knew August would be a great fit through a handshake. Myla, artist and engineer, instantly goes out of her way to make August feel at home, but you also learn that she is always the warmest and kindest person in the room. Wes, former trust-fund baby now cut off from his family, is madly in love with the drag queen next door and has an adorable dog Noodles. The four roomies are instantly inseparable best friends and their bond carries over to saving Jane, and August, from a devastating fate. I loved that August was able to find this close connection to such an amazing group after a childhood spent with just her mother. We quickly discover that there is more to her and her mother’s relationship than a love of true crime and the quest to find her missing uncle, an uncle that went missing before August was born. When the truth comes out about why August and her mother were such a tight team, August needs her new friends to fall back on for support.Full of heart, hope, and witty banter, One Last Stop, is a smart and hilarious story of otherworldly love that transcends time.Thank you so much to Netgalley and St. Martin’s Press for the opportunity to read and review this title. The pleasure, as well as opinions and mistakes, was all mine."
"Romance, mystery, and finding family all come together in One Last Stop. Casey McQuiston’s sophomore novel brings a bit of magic to the New York City subway as August falls for a mysterious woman who has somehow slipped through time and is stuck on the Q line.August comes to New York City looking for home. She’s a little lost, lonelier than she ever would admit, and somehow manages to find roommates who become family. Myla, Niko, and Wes, along with their neighbor, Isaiah, and the crew at the pancake place August works at become family and are my favorite parts of One Last Stop. From Myla’s blazing energy to Niko’s kind and knowing soul to Wes’s grumpy and scared heart to Isaiah’s patience and fabulous drag persona, everything about the people who become August’s family grabbed my heart. These folx came alive on the page and their vibrant personalities endeared them to me and made me miss them whenever they weren’t in a scene.At the heart of One Last Stop are August and Jane. August has been a loner for so long it breaks your heart and I enjoyed watching her come into her own over the course of the story. Jane is a mystery I don’t want to spoil by delving into too deeply. She’s displaced in time, having somehow gotten stuck on the Q line since sometime in the 1970s. Jane is both porcupine and marshmallow. She will fight anyone who is bigoted or a bully but she also is tender at unexpected moments. The mystery of how she got stuck is just one of the many things you learn about her over the course of the story and I liked watching August peel back her layers. Their romance is solid, but for me it was one of the least interesting things about the book and I never felt truly invested. The chemistry just wasn’t there and I know McQuiston can deliver chemistry (Myla and Niko? Fantastic chemistry).I’m torn on rating One Last Stop because there are a lot of things I like about it. McQuiston’s lyrical prose captured me at times and the love and support between August and the family she made grabbed my heart and didn’t let go. But the first half of the book was incredibly slow and if I hadn’t loved McQuiston’s debut novel so much I might not have stuck with this one. It did pick up in the second half but I still finished the story thinking I liked specific things about it a lot more than the book as a whole.I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review."
"Happy PRIDE Month and Happy Pub Day to One Last Stop by Casey McQuiston! I enjoyed this novel, which the author describes as ""a public transit crush romance with a time slip twist"" so much. I haven't read McQuiston's debut Red, White & Royal Blue so I wasn't sure what to expect and simply sat back and enjoyed the novel set in New York City with side trips to New Orleans and San Francisco.The story features August, a 23-year-old student (named in tribute to her uncle) who moves to NYC to get lost in its hustle and bustle, and Jane, a retro-vintage commuter on the Q Train. August is instantly infatuated with Jane, and no matter when or where August gets on the subway, Jane is there ... how and why is this happening? With the help of her quirky roommates, her pancake diner coworkers, and skills grudgingly learned from her mother, August unravels the mystery of Jane. A major theme of the novel is found family - both in terms of creating family among friends who love, accept, and support you as well as tirelessly searching for a family member who disappeared decades ago.I don't typically read LGBTQIA+ romance or scifi/fantasy novels, but I was here for every minute of One Last Stop. The characters are wonderfully diverse in their ethnic origins, gender identities, and sexual preferences. This is a fabulous 'windows and mirrors' book for readers of all ages who can find themselves represented in its pages or experience life through the eyes of characters who are different from them.I listened to the audiobook and appreciated the narration by Natalie Naudus. There are some spicy scenes so be prepared if you listen without headphones. Thank you to St. Martin's Griffin and MacMillan Audio for the review copies; all thoughts are my own."
"I can totally see this being a new comfort read for lots of people, it was just too...meh for me.This is a story about a depressed bisexual fat woman who closes herself off to avoid being rejected by people around her and how one day she meets an Asian-American lesbian from the '70s who got stuck in 2020 on a subway. It has some poetic musings about life, love, and friendship. It has some nice steamy scenes and just two girls in love and admiring each other. It has a found family with quirky queer side characters that have a comedic line and helps the main character find herself through the power of friendship. It mentions some important moments in New York's queer history and celebrates the diversity of New York.I found myself wanting more from it. It's described as a rom-com, it isn't, and I wanted some sapphic romance but instead, we get a story that is more focused on everything else and which fails to deliver a satisfying romance in which you can feel the chemistry between the characters. They had romantic scenes but lacked all the romance, it felt like they didn't belong together.As for the main character, she was just a plain girl, there wasn't anything compelling about her. Biyu was definitely a more interesting character.This is a book that you have to forget how convenient everything is and how it all magically works out, for me, it definitely went on a little long and I found myself checking how many pages I had left every 10 minutes.I found the book...different from what I expected I guess but still enjoyed it as a whole and found myself smiling at some scenes. Definitely, something I would recommend to people."
"Thank you so much to the publisher for giving me this eARC in exchange for my honest and unbiased review (Release Date | 01 June 2021)SYNOPSIS | August has recently moved to New York & as she is riding the subway she meets Jane. This chance encounter is perfect & charming & August hopes that she is going to see her again... & she does. Every time August gets on the subway, Jane is there & August begins to suspect that these encounters aren't all that coincidental & something else is going on.WHAT I LIKED:- the whole ""true love conquers all"" mentality- a whole spectrum of representation- how the story & characters all fitted togetherWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:- that we only got August's POV so the romance felt quite one-sided- Jane's dependency on August to unlock her memories (I just don't think this is the healthiest basis for a romance)- that August's character is set up from the first few pages as not wanting to be involved in the detective life (actually kind of resenting it), yet she dives headfirst into the mystery of Jane and then chooses a career following the same path- the chapters were long & the story didn't have a sense of urgency so this took me over a week to actually read (I normally finish a book in 2-3 days)"
"Thanks to Netgalley and St. Martin's Press for providing me with an advanced copy in exchange for an honest review.Wow, what a story. This book was a roller coaster, and I loved every second of it. The dips, the turns, the surprise loops, the beauty of a love story that was never supposed to be.Very few books have ever made me feel the love through the pages so deeply. I literally wept for the last 15% of the book - happy tears, sad tears, heartbroken tears, elated tears, every single emotion under the sun tears.I'm not sure there are the right words to recommend this book highly enough. So just read it.Every single freaking star."
"""And so, the Q was a person.""One Last Stop is a sapphic time-bending romance that was too cute to quit from the author of the ever-popular Red, White, and Royal Blue. Full of found-family, unabashedly queer, kickass side characters, and true love that knows no limits. I was waiting with bated breath for this one to come out and of course, I LOVED it!Our POV is August. A girl stuck in a rut, who's emotionally kept herself under lock in key for as long as she can remember. She was a child turned true-crime expert due to her mother's obsession with her missing brother, and while August has been searching her whole life for a ghost—mostly, she's just wanted a home. She takes a chance on New York; on Myla, Niko, and Wes, her new roommates that are as beautiful and fleshed out and real as any MC character, and starts to find something like family.On the Q, she meets the magnetic Jane and, well, to say it's not love at first sight would be silly, but it sure takes August a while to realize that. Jane is a mystery wrapped in a leather jacket and a sharp smirk, kindness, and passion all coiled into a single body. And one thing August cannot resist is a mystery. Especially when she realizes Jane is *always* on the Q. No matter what. Now she and the others need to find out what's keeping her there and how to get her back to where she belongs. But can August keep her head in the game? Unlikely.Listen there were so so so many things to love in this book. It was rich, with beautifully diverse characters that felt so real and honestly were almost more of a driving point for me than the main romance. (I mean, that's a first, wow.) It was also HILARIOUS. I found myself cracking up more than once, the banter was so natural and fluid and full of affection. I adored Billy's, Isaiah/Annie and her drag shows and quick wit and how she knew exactly what she wanted. I loved how August was both a complete mess romantically but also felt for her when it came with the struggles with her mother and how she had grown up protecting herself from heartache. And Jane? I was in love with Jane from the first SECOND. They were allowed to be people. With complexities and contradictions and not an ounce of perfection in them to claim. It was beautiful. This band of misfits with so much love to give.The ending was everything I could have wanted. Full of madness and heartache and impossible things. It left me smiling even when it hurt, and that is the mark of a great story to me.I could talk about this for hours, but I will leave it here. One Last Stop hits the shelves on the 1st of June this year, make sure you watch for it!*As always, my thanks to Netgalley and the Publisher for gifting me with an ARC in exchange for my honest review.*"
"Let me guess… you have doubts that Casey McQuiston could follow up Red, White, and Royal Blue with anything even half as amazing, right? Well, I can safely say those doubts are completely unfounded.One Last Stop follows August as she comes to New York City on her latest stop to figure out what she should do with her life. Her childhood has left her closed off and she’s determined to prove that being alone is the only way to be. Plus, her roommates are strange and waiting tables is a horrible job. Not to mention having to take the subway every day. Except the subway is where she meets Jane and Jane is so interesting that August soon finds herself arranging her schedule to see Jane in the train. Until one day she realizes that Jane is always on the train… because she can’t get off. Jane has been trapped in time for 45 years, but August is determined to figure out how to get Jane off the train and back to her time. What August doesn’t expect is to find true friends, family, and love in the process.This book was un-put-downable. Or, in my case, I did not want to stop listening. Both the book and the narration were amazing. I can safely say that I have not read a time travel romance before and the concept would have given me pause if I had stopped to realize that’s what this book was. By the time I listened to it, I had completely forgotten it was part of this book. But it was great! Such a fun twist to a contemporary romance.What I loved most about One Last Stop is that it wasn’t just a love story. It was truly August’s story. She finds so much more than just love. She finds a way to move forward after running from family ghosts. She finds the most fierce and loyal group of friends who become her found family. She finds a place to belong and a purpose.  It sounds like a lot and like it could get too deep for a romance, but it’s not. Casey balances all of it with just the right amount of heart and warmth and sarcasm and humor and just, realness. And Natalie Naudus’ narration portrayed that all perfectly.And if you like found family stories even a little, you definitely want to meet this passionately irreverent and unabashedly queer family. This group is undoubtedly on my list of best found families.Bottom line, two book in and I can’t wait to see what story Casey brings us next. Officially an auto buy author for me.Thank you to NetGalley and Macmillan Audio for an ALC in exchange for an honest review."
"I didn't think it was possible, but I loved One Last Stop even more than Casey's debut, Red, White and Royal Blue. August and Jane were a dream couple - smart and sexy with the most delightful banter. Oof, I just adored them so much. And the found family? Absolutely made the book for me. It's not always true but I really did like every character; Wes and Isaiah's story arc was especially endearing.The magical time travel aspect of this story was such a unique twist - even though I knew it would be okay in the end (because hello, it's a romance and that's a rule that cannot be broken), I still found myself tearing up. Seeing August and Jane say goodbye with no expectation on their part that they'd see one another again...ugh, pull at my heartstrings.Seriously, I'm so happy this lived up to and went beyond my expectations."
"I really wanted to enjoy this book, but something about it just felt so disconnected at the beginning of a story. I don’t know if I had a hard time connecting with the main character as I was really looking forward to this romantic comedy representing readers of the LGBTQ plus community. I have thoroughly enjoyed the authors previous books, but I think the main character fell flat for me.Well I attempted to do this one on audiobook, I am going to get a second chance with it and try the print copy hoping that maybe it was the narrator and they’re portrayal of the main character that changed what the author was trying to do in the story."
"I definitely wasn’t expecting this book to turn out like it did. Overall, I enjoyed this book but there were certain parts I could do without. The book got very graphic at times (on a subway of all places) but the overall plot was so creative and clever! A story of a girl stuck in time on a subway in NYC and how she falls in love with a girl who tries to rescue her. Will she get sent back to where she’s from, get to stay with the love of her life, or worse?"
I really enjoyed this queer romance that had a surprise fantasy element! I was GLUED to the edge of my seat from the middle on and had to keep turning pages so I would know how it all ended!!
"I’m a sucker for any sort of time travel plots, and I really did enjoy the beginning of this. But after it’s revealed that Jane is a 1970s punk relic stuck in a subway car, the book just kind of spins its wheels. Also, I think the book is just not relatable for anyone over 25. The main character and her fabulously diverse “found family” are way more boring than their author realizes. I simply didn’t care to find out what happens with Jane. The author gave me no reason to.I’ve read both books by this author (One Last Stop being a sophomore effort) and while I do feel there is improvement, many of the same problems persist. I won’t be back for a third helping.Edit: I did wind up picking this back up and giving it a second chance. I amend my rating downwards. The ending sucks. Cheesy, easy, stupid, bad. The author had an opportunity to save this book, and give it some depth and feeling, but sadly chose not to. I'm honestly starting to suspect some authors think their characters identities are a substitute for an actual plot. Very disappointing to readers like me who like to *read* and don't give a hoot about identity politics. If you feel the same way, stay clear of this one."
"What can I say about this book that hasn’t already been said? It’s quite simply brilliant. I loved Red, White, and Royal Blue but this book just burrowed even deeper into my heart, and months after reading it I still think about it all the time.August is 23 years old, and her move to New York has not been as glamorous as she’d hoped. She ends up moving in with three eclectic roommates and gets a job waitressing at a pancake diner. She’s wondering how she can turn her life around when she meets Jane on the subway. Jane is retro, and funny, and effortlessly cool, and there is just something about her that August is drawn to.She starts changing her schedule and commute so she can see Jane more often. The two start to talk, and become friends, but gradually August starts to notice a few unusual things about Jane. For starters, she still uses a walkman, and her taste in music is decidedly old-school. Jane is stuck on the subway…and has been for decades. August sets about trying to get Jane to remember more from her past, and solve the mystery of how she became stuck in time—all the while, falling more and more in love with her.The supporting characters in this book were so, so outstanding. I want them all to get their own separate books because I desperately need to know more about them. I don’t want to spoil too much because you need to read this one for yourself, but even if the rest of the book and August and Jane’s story wasn’t so incredible (which it absolutely is), the supporting characters would have made this a book that I’ll hold in my heart forever.Natalie Naudus is the audiobook narrator and she couldn’t have done a more beautiful job of bringing the characters to life and sucking you into the story until you were completely immersed and felt like you really were right there walking beside them. I’ve listened to a few audiobooks performed by Natalie recently and she’s become one of my absolute favorites. You might recognize her from The Dating Dare, Cool for the Summer, The Donut Trap, and Skyhunter. The audio comes in at just over 12 hours long, but clear your schedule because once you start you won’t want to stop for anything!"
"I saw this book on the tonight show's reading list & the 2nd I've read from 2021 summer reading ljst. I was, admittedly,  a bit apprehensive about a story of 2 gay girls falling in love & the possibility of cliches and/or stereotypes shining thru. It's beautifully written and refreshing in its perspective & direct bluntness like having a personal conversation with the author. Totally recommend this book. Think I'll download Red, White and Royal Blue next!"
"as an eighteen year old nonbinary asexual lesbian who has NO idea what they’re doing with their life right now, who recently went through a break up, who only really has four close friends, and really needs to start looking for a job - this book was everything i needed right now, and more. casey is an incredible author and she truly outdid himself; one last stop is somehow, impossibly, even more heartbreaking and beautiful and important to queer youth than rwrb. reading this book was a rollercoaster, and i enjoyed every second of it. i wish the experience of reading ols for the first time on anyone and everyone."
"My heart aches for this book. That's the simplest way to describe it. Sometimes you read a book that is so important, so heartfelt and pure, that it just touches your soul and makes you ache inside. It is the most incredible feeling and I don't think I can properly put into words how grateful I am to Casey McQuiston for giving this to the world.Red, White & Royal Blue is my favourite book. I have read it once a month since I first downloaded it onto my kindle. It's my feel-good book. And I was truly content. And then I found out Casey was writing another book and I thought, how would she ever be able to write something as touching as her debut? I know now. Because it comes from the heart.One Last Stop is a story of found-family and soul searching and finding your place in the world. It is about acceptance and honesty and staying true to yourself. It's about redemption and love and laughter and heartbreak and all the things that make life so wonderful and complicated.If you ever, ever want to feel seen and heard in life, read this book. You won't be disappointed."
"I’ve been buying books for years, but failing to get beyond the first couple of pages. Perhaps I’ve fallen victim to my reduced attention span? Perhaps it’s because I keep buying dry sci-fi books that sound fascinating?Whatever the case, this book popped up on my radar after clicking on the “LGBTQ+ tag” and seeing it. I’m not the typical audience for this book - a mostly straight, white guy from England - but it grabbed me as soon as I started reading it. And I do mean that with no exaggeration. When I wasn’t reading this book, I was thinking of it and eagerly waiting until I was again. I did pace myself a little, but finished it in about a week. This book never strayed far from my thoughts. A week isn’t an especially quick time to read a book; but considering my recent failings, I’ll happily take it.I found it intoxicatingly lovely, sweet, charming, and beautiful. Yes, it can be a little clichéd at times - *cough* psychics *cough* - but the characters are great. They’re well written and I found myself wanting to meet them. The found family dynamic was great as well. I also think this would make a great movie, though I’m already preemptively worried they’ll butcher it.In summary, I truly do love this book, and I’d like to thank Mrs McQuiston for getting me interested in actually reading again."
"Very different from RWRB, which I loved and which remains my favourite of the two, but there was so many great things going on in this book!So many different threads, amazing friendships (I want to go to Christmas in July and live in the apartment block), more than one really cute love story (without any of them being sickly sweet in a bad way), multiple mysteries, time travel and some great referencing of a whole range of things from the 70's to date.  With all that it could have been a really busy, read but the various storylines are so smoothly interwoven that it isn't and the resolution of the mystery elements and the time travel are satisfying without feeling contrived.Definitely recommend taking a reading journery with this crew of well-developed (and well-represented) characters if you like a romance with heart including characters with actual personalities!"
"In a year when reading has not always been the enjoyable and easy past time it once was, this book held my attention.To get a story that's funny, intriguing, warm (and hot 🔥), with a fabulous cast of characters and keeps you reading even though you don't want the book to end is rare.I really enjoyed this book 😊 and can't wait to read it again.""And she can believe Jane had the nerve, the audacity, to become the one thing August can't resist: a mystery"""
"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️✨THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSi was a huge fan of mcquiston’s other book, red white and royal blue, so my expectations for this book were sky high. i came into the book thinking it was going to go in one direction, and it definitely wasn’t what i expected at all.the entire premise blew me away, because i wasn’t expecting jane to be stuck in the subway, i thought she was going to be able to leave the subway, which would’ve made for a completely different story, but i enjoyed watching august figuring out the logistics to her and jane’s relationship (especially when she confesses her love to jane at 3am on a tuesday)as much as i enjoyed august and jane’s relationship, i preferred august’s life outside of the Q, with her roommates, who i absolutely fell in love with. usually, drag doesn’t appeal to me at all, however the scenes where there was elements of drag with isaiah/annie depressant were very fun to read, as well as the christmas in june chapter, which (apart from maybe the heist chapter where they’re getting jane off the Q)  was probably my favourite chapter in the whole book.the subplot and august’s past dealing with augie did intrest me, and tying jane/biyu into the whole thing was a great move from Mcquiston. the fact that augie was a gay man in the 70s was very interesting, and the complexities that that comes with in august and her mother’s story add depth to the story.i did have mixed feelings about the ending. at first i was upset that jane went back to the 70s (before she came back), but i’d realised that it was probably the best ending to the story, and reinforces the quote from the start of the book, ‘when august saw jane for the first time, she fell in love for a few minutes, then got off. that’s how it is on the subway’ (or something along those lines, i don’t have the book on me at the moment). however, i would be lying if i said that i didn’t enjoy jane coming back and getting to spend the rest of her life with august.overall, this was an excellent book, which i would readily recommend to anyone looking for books about time travelling wlw."
"This well crafted book will make you laugh and cry. I loved the atmosphere the story created. The feel of the New York subway, even though I’ve never been there, the well loved dinner/pancake house, the quirky characters, the premise of someone caught in a place out of time, just everything about it really. McQuinston has the ability to build the tension, so that I read the denouement with my fingers crossed. Read it, you won’t regret it."
"It took me two months to read this, not because it was hard going, or a chore to read. It took me two months because that’s what happens when an author is so blindingly brilliant that I have to go back and read each line twice, three times, just to absorb how beautiful it is. Recommended a thousand times over."
"Some editing would have been nice. This book has a wonderful premise and excellent characters. The writing style was en pointe.  But there were at least 6 chapters after the halfway mark that should have been tighter. Great couple, beautiful writing, but get on with it please."
In my opinion this was super overhyped. I was really excited to get it but I didn't get invested in the story until halfway though. Even then i was only interested for 10 pages before I got bored again. I got to the climatic big moment and realised that i just didn't care how it ended. If you want cute wlw romance books I recommend Hani and Ishu's guide to fake dating or henna wars instead. The 7 husbands of Evelyn Hugo is also amazing but it isn't lighthearted.
"it was a nice read, would’ve liked a little more explanation at the ending and the pacing at the beginning was a bit slow for me😭. overall the story was intriguing and the main plot was interesting. the main couple’s chemistry was also quite decent. would definitely recommend!!"
"Pedi o livro no dia que lançou, dia 1 de Junho e já chegou, antes do previsto!Achei o livro maravilhoso, veio embalado perfeitamente, muito bem cuidado, estou muito ansiosa pra ler!!"
"I rarely write book reviews but felt compelled to write one for this book. Oh my god, don’t think just buy. I don’t know how the author managed to capture what it feels like to be a 20 something away from home, trying to find community etc."
"Fantastic novel, as a fellow bisexual gal in her mid-twenties I found it scarily accurate! Jane and August are true relationship goals and all the supporting characters are fleshed out and fascinating! I want to be friends with all of them."
not as floppy as rwrb kinda stiff and the cover is a little grainy too but ah well
This book got me in a day . It was even better then red white and royal blue . I think this is now one of my favourite books and I cannot wait to re read it
I absolutely devoured this - so funny and smart and such a unique story.
"the bar was high with RWRB, but this was really really good :))"
Amazing book
"I have read this book in two days flat. Would've been one day, but i had stuff to do.It is amazing. I bought this on preorder right after I finished Red, White and Royal Blue because I loved that book and I wasn't disappointed with this one in the least.It has a more complicated story line, and it doesn't make sense some time, but it is enjoyable and funny and the characters are amazing. You have to suspend your disbelief at certain turns when the book combines Astrology, Time travel and Just a hint of supernatural energy, but you will most definitely have at least one character in this book you identify with and who you can steal certain traits from. ( I don't judge, i do it too. )The LGBTQ+ aspect in this book is was more pronounced and ""important"" than the last one, you have characters from every walk of life. From a plus sized bisexual detective to a trans male psychic to a black drag queen to a shy nerdy emotionally repressed gay, they all get treated with a loving hand and kind words and the utmost care.I would definitely recommend reading this and I can't wait for her next book."
"I took my time thinking about what I was going to say about the book because I was seriously hyped about it and perhaps I should have expected a bit less from it. For the most part, I had a nice time reading it, and I would totally recommend you to check it out if you like queer found families, are an ally of the LGBTQ+ community, or you just want to see two people who’re not supposed to meet, falling in love with each other.The first part was a bit slow for my taste and it took me a while to care for these characters, specially August. I don’t know if they were meant to be that way since they live in NYC, but there were times I thought they were “too much”. Fortunately, when I got used to the way they talked and interact with each other, I felt like they were a nice found family.But I gotta be honest, August wasn’t my fav MC and though I get where she’s coming from, she annoyed me for the most part. Still, I applaud her courage to make things right, even if that meant breaking her heart in the process. On the contraire, we have Jane. Oh, Jane. She’s what you may call ‘prince charming’, with her joyful, sweet and flirty personality. It’s impossible not to like her. She feels like a real person and someone I’d be glad to meet IRL.Anyway, I would say that the best part is the second half. It’s more emotional too and the stakes are high. I had a couple of quotes that truly resonated with me and overall I’m just glad I got to read it with my gf. The 70-80s vibe was kinda cool too. I’d love to see it on the big screen!"
"One last stop is a step into q train. Where august meets a mysterious girl who got stuck there for a long time. How the story moves is so interesting.You will meet many characters which you will like. There isn't a single unrealistic character in this book.Even though its a science fiction, everything connects so well.When i read this book there were moments, i felt sad. But it has lot of cute moments. Basically its a romance novel, so u can guess what u can expect.If you like science fiction with the mixer of family, frnds and most importantly a single sided love, then this book is what you were searching for.The paper quality of the book is so good. I will give 5 stars for the book's paper.For story line:⭐⭐⭐⭐For romance:⭐⭐⭐For cuteness:⭐⭐⭐⭐For friendship and love:⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐For cover and paper:⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Overall: ⭐⭐⭐⭐P.S: THIS BOOK IS DEFINITELY NOT SUITABLE FOR BELOW 16"
"One Last Stop is a story about August, who just moved to a new city and meets Jane, a punk lesbian displaced from the 70s, on the subway.The book as a great representation of the LGBTQ community by presenting different genders, sexualities and also helps you understand and learn about different cultures and religions. It is not done in a way that seems like a character was made gay just to add some LGBTQ to the story, as I’ve noticed in some books before.This book has amazing characters! They are all well-crafted, clever and written in a way that makes you really think about what you’re reading. They all had their own unique story, personality and added too August’s growth during the book. I loved the way they supported each other. They gave me a bit found family vibes in that way, ultimate friendship goals! August did feel like the least interesting of them all, even though she was the one you followed throughout the whole book. Her narrative during the slower parts of the book were a little bit boring sometimes.The time travel premise of the story, while super interesting, didn’t really come forward as much as I thought it would’ve. Although it was really interesting to see how Jane’s live was slowly pierced together by August, through the constant interactions. On the other hands, the public PDA made me a bit uncomfortable reading it. Public PDA is a big no for me personally, so reading about the characters doing it really wasn’t my cup of tea.Overall, it is a nice queer story that is cleverly written and character driven."
"🚞 There was this girl. I met her on a train. The first time I saw her … I felt like I knew her 🚞🚞 THIS STORY WAS SOOO CUTE 🥰🥰 it was such a nice coming-of-age/found family story 🥰 I like how cute August was and how she cared so much for Jane after a one off meeting on the train 🥰 and dammit the last 1/3 of the book really nailed the whole sapphic-fated-epic-once-in-a-lifetime love 😄 I loved the Brooklyn community that August found with her 3 awesome roommates and the diner she worked at ☺️ Everyone just cared about each other and stuck together for the diner, the drag shows and helping August help Jane ☺️ this ending had me twisting and turning and constantly guessing and how August and Jane would end up 🤔 I liked the notes to LGBTQIAP+ History throughout the book and the people who came before August and that Jane grew up with 😊 This was such a feel good story will all the love, kindness and support that everyone deserves 🥰 this novel will live in my mind rent-free forever ❤️"
"First thing first, I LOVE this novel. Love it. Is it bc of the sci-fi/magical blend? Bc of the whole community involved in the story? Bc the mother/daughter is so problematically relatable? Bc I love Jane and I love August in equal measure? Bc all the freaking characters are lovable and awesome and I’d like to be friends with them all? Bc there’s a psychic? Whatever.Meet August: fatherless with a toxic relationship with a mother she’s trying to get rid off. She moves to NY and ends up finding her own family, aka Niko, Myla, Wes, Isaiah, and Jane of course. You happen to see and live NY in the ’70s with all its queer scenario and NY today with all the queer scenario. This must be the most inclusive novel I’ve ever read. So what happens is: August meets Jane in the Q, except she’s not exactly the 20 something vintage girl she looks like.And there are pancakes everywhere, and August is on the soft side of body-representation, and Jane is this freakingly cool woman. And there are references to Quantum Leap (Quantum Leap, Jesuschrist I loved that series and I’m pretty sure nobody remembers it, so I feel seen!) and the Goonies (I mean!!!) and the Breakfast Club (picture me heart-eyed).So what I’m saying is: I’m going to read Red, White & Royal blue and probably have met my new auto-buy author."
"I have been not so patiently waiting for this book since I heard about it’s existence, and I was so hoping that it wouldn’t disappoint. It was everything I wanted and more. The characters are full and real and I want to be a part of their little family so bad. The plot is original and engaging and well written. Brooklyn is a place I’ve always wanted to visit, and getting to experience August’s Brooklyn was suck a treat. There is so much love in this book, and it makes me want to love myself better. McQuiston’s two books both have pieces of my heart, and I can’t wait to read more of their stories."
"I really enjoyed this book. My only quibble is some inaccurate info about how the subway system works, that as someone who worked in the subway I have trouble overlooking. However, I decided that if I can suspend disbelief about a time traveling romance, I can get over the protective cover boards on the 3rd rail not being mentioned lol.I really enjoyed the characters in this story. Many romances I have read are weak on the side characters and sub plots. But this story made it feel like a real lived in world."
"The book arrived in one day (I'm from Germany) and totally exceeded my hopes. I read it in one day and would totally do it again, If I could. Its amazingly written, funny but also talks about serious topics (tho I found that the homophobia we still face in the 21th century was kinda not shown. It still makes sense comparing to the other time being talked about in the book). At first, after I've read a few reviews, I wasnt too excited about the time travel aspect, but the author really outdid herself with this trope. It isnt shown in a very fantasy way but more in a scientific and something that could actually happen. The book also includes the best found family trope I've ever read. I'm sure that every reader can relate to at least one character in the book( for me its jane:)). Everyone please go read this,its  honestly one of my favourite books ever. Deserve all the recognition."
The book was pretty great. Casey McQuiston is absolutely awesome. But I have complaints about the condition on which the book arrived. The book was quite dirty. This not the first time that's happened. The packaging and maintenance needs to be worked on.
I was really excited for this book because I absolutely loved her first novel “ red white and royal blue “.Sadly I was quite disappointed by one last stop. I didn’t expect the “ fantasy “ aspect of the story and would have preferred a “ real life “ more relatable story. Apart from that I found that there were to many parallel story lines of which I found some unnecessary. It was not a bad read but it didn’t capture me.  However I think it’s amazing that there are more and more books about homosexual love story’s and I really love the style of writing !
"Adoro la McQuiston, amo come scrive, amo i suoi personaggi, le sue storie e il suo modo di raccontarle. Dopo Red, White & Royal Blue ci si aspettava un altro romanzo altrettanto bello e lei non ha deluso le aspettative."
"When i got the Book, all i was expecting was a normal Lesbian Romance. The Supernatural Aspect caught me totally by surprise, but it was a very welcome one, as was the way above average lenght of the Book. Very enjoyable Experience."
"Fantastic story, fantastic romance, great characters, plot twist I did not see coming.  Whew.  Knocks it out of the park with humour  and sweetness and depth.  Unreservedly recommended."
"This was everything I didn’t know I needed and more. What a bloody incredible read. I loved the characters, I loved the setting and the sci fi mystery style. Pure perfection from Casey McQuiston again!"
"I really liked reading this one. In between it got a bit slow, but all in all it's a great story! The characters are so likeable and authentic, I loved all of them!"
So different from her first but no less enthralling. Pure magic in every sense of the word. This author is am auto-buy.
Good and as per expectations
Loved One Last Stop. Loved every character. Desperately want to see the party scenes on screen. Will read again soon.
I love august and Jane and every woman who loves women
"I found everything about this to be perfect. I adored it, I crave more, it was outstanding. Brilliant characters, brilliant storyline, brilliant story."
"I didn't hate the story, but it was a bit disappointing after it had be recommended it me by so many people."
"Made me laugh, made me cry, took me on a roller coaster of emotions I wasn’t entirely expecting! It’s settled, everything this author writes is amazing!"
Excelente libro
I feel bad reviewing this because I didn't get a chance to read it yet but the condition it came in wasn't very good so be warned.
I loved everything about this book. Buy it
"Devastatingly beautiful, made me feel so lost and yet found. Poetic and special. A book I will never forget and will reread and recommend"
Reads like a Netflix screenplay written by a 3rd grader who loves the F word. My bad for downloading it
Best book I read all year :)
I loved this book. The vibes are immaculate. It's light and fluffy book that both put you in a slump and get you out of a slump
"Such a fantastic read. Loved the characters. Loved everything, and was so sad to say goodbye at the end when I finished it."
"Well written, fun, and a beautiful exploration of Queer family."
"A bit of a slow start, but after a few chapters its impossible to put it down. I just love McQuistons writing!"
"havent read it yet, but im sure it will be great! the cover is v pretty :]"

"At a time when it appears as though most gay fiction getting published centers around Harlequin-like romances or other popular genre or appears to be meant mainly for titillation, André Aciman’s Call Me By Your Name (2007; 248 pp.) is both a notable exception and a true artistic accomplishment. The novel can be considered a coming-of-age story (a dangerously over-used subgenre in the wrong hands) as well as a love story. Set in 1988 and on the Italian Riviera, which adds to the charm and appeal of the novel, Call Me By Your Name is narrated by and tells the story of a seventeen-year-old American-Italian-Jewish youth, Elio Perlman, and his six-week, summer love affair with Oliver Ulliva, a university professor who is seven years older than Elio and who has been selected to live in Elio’s parents’ home as a guest “resident” while finishing a manuscript for publication as part of the parents’ way of aiding budding writers.Much of the first half of Call Me By Your Name has a “stream of consciousness” feeling to it as Elio, a very precocious and intelligent but shy young man, defies his better intuitions and finds himself more and more attracted to Oliver. Oliver, in turn, appears aloof, enigmatic, or simply unresponsive to the younger man’s growingly obvious infatuation. Aciman beautifully captures the multiple emotions: doubts, worries, hopes, and despair of an apparently one-sided attraction and romance to which any reader, regardless of their sexual orientation, most likely will be able to relate. Elio’s situation and Aicman’s characters and dialogue are all very true to life. Aicman’s references to the Italian setting, its culture, and historic figures (especially artists) add color to his tale without becoming a distraction or principal focus.By time both Elio and the reader are aware of Oliver’s true feelings toward the younger man, a new sense of urgency, an even greater feeling of sensuality and eroticism, and a more intense atmosphere of anxiety and impending doom enters the story—all of it exquisitely captured by Aciman’s exquisitely accomplished writing.The minor characters in Call Me by Your Name are portrayed as lovingly and precisely as the two leads. Elio’s father and a younger female friend who is dying of leukemia, in particular, are given scenes of appealing tenderness and geniality. Both are people readers would like to know and embrace. Call Me By Your Name is filled with psychological insight, beauty, realism, poignancy, melancholy, regret, smiles, wonder, joy and celebration, and pathos. If it is possible for a novel to contain a genuine reflection of what it is like to be a human being, Call Me by Your Name is that novel.The conclusion of Oliver’s six weeks with Elio and his family and the circle of friends he makes while in Italy before returning to the United States ends the way readers know it must, but it is not the conclusion of the novel. In the final chapter entitled “Ghost Spots,” Aciman benevolently gives readers further, later scenes depicting the lives of both Elio and Oliver. The scenes are like the rest of the novel: authentic and discerning with memories both sad and joyous while tinged with an aching, unforgettable bitter sweetness. Upon finishing the novel one can only conclude that Call Me By Your Name is a modern classic."
"This book was over the top good. Both in substance and in style. I came to this book from a recommendation form AARP (of all places!) for the soon to come out movie. After digging around it was recommended to read the book. Now I can’t wait to see the movie! I hear the director is top notch and after reading the book, I can give the same compliment to the author. I’m confident in my chosen arena in life, but can say I’m overwhelmed by the talent of the author’s style of writing. I now want to learn more about writing, history and all things Italian.Story line: Being an older gay man I’ve yearned for such talented writers touching on this topic. What was once considered taboo is now accepted. If the roles were reversed to “straight” characters ( like Summer of 42) it wouldn’t be considered taboo. Bravo for being brave and showing how love is love."
A queer romance with little substance. The only thing this book does is make heterosexual people feel progressive for reading an MM romance.
"Andre Aciman has produced gold. No.. more like diamonds, with this book!THE TEARS! My eyes are so sore. Oh wow! The book, the movie, the soundtrack, the characters and actors... unimaginably captivating. I have never cried while reading a book, but I sure did with this one. I assume it is because this story resinates with me so well that I could feel the love, friendship, hope and loss -- plus more through the storyline. Each page you turn or read is even better than the next.If you want to read a book that will captivate you the way it has captivated numerous others (myself included), please read this book.I want to applaud the author for this unforgettable store!"
"Admittedly, this book starts out almost painfully slow, with a lead-up to the romance that's near torturous when accompanied by the main character and narrator's obsessive thoughts, with the only thing keeping the reader engaged the dangling promise that these two idiots will, eventually, get together. But once it gets going, oh boy does it get going.Let me preface my praises of this book by saying that I had a difficult, love-hate relationship with Elio (protagonist and narrator). His obsessive reading, re-reading, over-reading, over-re-reading into every little look, word, silence, and lack of look, borders on the hysterical if not out-right insane and nearly drives this book's readers (or me, at least) insane right along with him. Not to mention that it nearly breaks the taut string suspending the reader's disbelief because honestly, what teenage even speaks let alone THINKS like this? But after reaching the second act, it's quite clear that this obsessiveness is what has isolated him from his peers and why he searches to be so completely understood by someone like Oliver, who speaks his same coded language of gestures and unspoken words - even though they're often not on the same wave length.Elio's fevered imaginings also make him an almost delightfully unreliable narrator, where something he narrates early on as fact (e.g. the cold, death-glares he'd receive from Oliver) turn out to be misguided by his prejudices and not true at all. It lends a tender, nostalgic quality to the whole thing (which is already close to bursting with nostalgia), knowing that all the events are not as they were but merely as he remembers them.I came to realize that the story was painful to read because it was a painfully exact replica of what it is to be a teenager, and not because it was poorly written or ill-conceived. It intentionally takes its readers back to a time when your insides were on your outsides, all your feelings exposed, leaving you raw and vulnerable, so that every glance, every snide remark, especially from the person you're infatuated with, is like hot knives on your bare flesh. The reason I was so infuriated with Elio was because I was infuriated with myself, when I was a teenager, and felt and behaved the exact same way. Elio, despite his staggering intellect for a seventeen-year-old, is a profound idiot just like I was a profound idiot.The meat of the story is the romance between our leads, slow and painful in its engineering (like a roller-coaster going up), terrifying, rocketing, elating, wonderful when it's happening (the roller-coaster plummeting), that leaves you aching, dizzy, and nauseous in its denouement (the end of the ride). You spend so much time worshiping Oliver through Elio's eyes that when he turns out to be the coward, you refuse to believe it, until you're dragged unwillingly to the book's end are slapped in the face with the reality that yes, Oliver was the coward all along.This is probably one of the most erotic reads of the 21st century, thanks in no small part to the breathless suspense leading up to their first encounter together, but also because the author understands how sensuality is enhanced by disgust. Even though the book sometimes crosses the thin line between sexy gross and full blown gross-out (by the end of the book ALL of the bodily fluids have been prominently featured), it leaves the burning, frenzied sensuality at its core stronger for it.I am confident that the movie adaptation (which I'll be watching soon) will be a perfect companion to this book, as it likely won't suffer from the book's flaws, such as being overly verbose, and its slow pacing on screen will probably feel more like sexual tension than having your nails being summarily torn from your fingers. Nonetheless, the novel contains some of the most stellar, quotable lines you'll ever encounter, and such gut-wrenching realism surrounding its heartbreak that you'll feel it as a hot knife across your raw skin.If I could say one thing to this novel it would be: I'll die if you stop."
"The 2017 film adaptation skillfully compresses the book's first two sections, minimizes the third section, and seems to ignore the fourth section, which in some ways is the most surprising. For that reason, I at first kept thinking I liked the movie better, the book tending to meander into musings in response to every minute event. However, when I got to the book's third section, aha... here was the real treasure, a sort of vie-de-bohème fantasy where Elio finds himself dreamily incorporated into an endless evening of literary camaraderie and bistro-hopping in Rome. The fourth section I'll leave unmentioned to avoid spoilers; suffice it to say the movie shares the basic outcome of the novel, but with nowhere near the fullness of detail or expanse of time. Another benefit of reading the book is realizing that accusations of a pederastic slant are overstated: Elio acts upon Oliver to a far greater degree than Oliver acts upon Elio, the latter already being a sexually active 17-year-old with a clearly adult intellect to match. To deem him a victim, you'd have to consider his eventual emotional let-down a cruel ordeal, when in fact it's what we all get a taste of at some point. In the end, reading this was like hearing a lengthy opera - I'm glad I had the experience, but I was also glad when it was over. I respect Acimen's talent, but I wager this is by no means his finest specimen."
"I want to start off my saying I am a movie buff and have been since I was a teenager. I always watch a movie several times to evaluate the acting, focusing each time on a different character.  For me a great movie is one which takes me into the characters world.  The characters must be believable.  Does the movie affect the viewer positive or negatively.  With all that said the characters of this movie are truly believable.  Timothee Chalamet has the ability to say with body language and facial expressions unspoken words as does Armie Hammer.  I could feel Elio’s pain and longing.  I felt Elio’s nervousness the night Oliver finally gave in.  I understood the guilt Elio felt the next morning.  The book says in words what the viewer had to capture from Elio’s actions.  Yet no guilt could stop the feelings that Elio had for Oliver and vice-a-versa. In life some things seem disgusting to think about but in the heat of the action everything is beautiful.  There is an old saying the bedroom is undefiled.  It is not a matter of what is right or wrong but was it given or taken from the heart.  This movie ignited memories for me and my teenage years and the struggling with hormones.  It brought back all my inhibitions the first time I participated in sex with another person.  At that age so many things can go through your mind and nothing is more reveling or can create so much insecurity then our own nudity and experience.  I would have given anything if my dad would have or even could have talked to me the way Elio’s dad talks to him.  Why do we put so much pressure on youth and growing up?  These two were bonded for years after, branded with an eternal love that they refused to act on.  I hate that Amazon has labeled this movie “Gay & Lesbian” because a lot of people may not watch it because of that label.  To all the parents out there the conversation between Elio and his father could change the relationship between you and your son or daughter forever.  I would give anything to experience a love so great that it would override all inhibitions and stand time.  I give it 5-Stars and highly recommend it."
"I really don't know what is the hype with this book.  It is so boring that I had to abandon it.  It is very rare for me to drop a book, but in this case there was no choice.  The reason for abandoning it?  No plot, no story line, just flat lined."
"I walked into the movie with high expectations.  The performances were indeed near perfect - especially Armie Hammer who caught the mercurial panache of Oliver, but also gave glimpses of vulnerability  underneath all the breezy self confidence.  In many ways I thought it was the harder role to play and he nailed it.  In fact, having seen the movie, which some might say was ""generously"" paced - others might call it tedious - I think Hammer's reading of the full text is the best and truest way to experience this beautiful work.  First off his voice as voice is a mellow light baritone - quite beautiful as an instrument.  As an actor's tool,  there is never any doubt as to whose ""skin"" he is in at the moment - predominantly Elio's since the story is told from his viewpoint.  When Hammer as Oliver casts his spell Hammer as Elio responds to his own seductiveness with such rapt wonderment that visuals are irrelevant.  Its almost the reverse of Norma Desmond's famous we didn't need words, we had faces..."
"I have to preface this review by saying that I am someone who reads frequently and has ordered many, many books on Amazon. However, I have never, until now, felt compelled to review a book.""Call Me by Your Name"" is a fantastically complex love story. I'vd never read such a pure, real romance featuring two men that does justice to the myriad of emotions that comes with any love affair, but especially one's first ""forbidden"" love. I think any person who gives it a try will appreciate this story, but it was especially poignant for me as a gay man.I could not put the book down and finished it in just two days. During this time I felt emotions ranging from excitement to genuine heartache. I think this story will stay with me for a long time. I plan to recommend it to many.I could critique a few small things, but they pale in comparison to all the wonderful aspects of this story."
"This story was about love and painful longing, however it went nowhere. The only thing I was longing for was the end of the book and that was midway through. The only reason I finished the book is because I don’t like to start a book and not finish it."
"Surprisingly intimate, stirring, and honest novel about two young people who fall in love. Are they gay or bisexual? It seems that Elio and Oliver are gay, but they are also having sex with women. The novel explores all the aspects of first love, forbidden love, true love, and leaves one in awe. I read it a second time to see the nuances in the emotional development of the two main characters. I highly recommend this book. It's not just for a gay audience. Anyone who has ever been in love can relate."
"I had no idea what to expect from this book as I began reading. The descriptions of events, moods, scenery and people were robust. Everything had to be described multiple times using similes.  At times I felt it was a bit too much.  I was wrong. Andre Aciman pulls you into the story like a slow morphine drip. Before you know it, you have succumbed to being one with Elio. You feel his pleasure, pain, heartache, guilt, desire and most of all, his sense of loss. This not a happy story, nor is it a sad story. Simply a story of life. 5.0 for peaches."
I have no words for how much I loved this book. It’s so beautifully written. It’s probably the only book I’ve read where I could completely relate to a character feeling so much longing towards someone in such a realistic way. All the impulses are there and all the emotions keep you reading til’ the end. Which I loved. This book will always be apart of me. I’ll remmeber it forever and have a hard time finding anything to match it.
"If you've already seen the movie, you've seen what a great director can do with a so-so book. A boring book. Luca Guadagnino and James Ivory deserve all the props for pulling a beautiful movie out of this mediocre mess. Because it reads like the fevered diary of a 14-year-old on their first crush. We get it, you really, REALLY like him. For 225 pages. With about four paragraphs of pretty prose. Nothing outstanding, just something to break up the monotony. I expected to see hearts scribbled in the margins. Like other reviewers I had to force myself to finish this book. And while the ending in the book is different, and messier, the movie made the right decision in its ending. And the actor playing Elio, Timothèe Chalamet, conveyed everything you need to know. Save yourself the trouble and just watch the movie again. It's so much better than the book."
"Rarely do I finish a book with an intake of breath and something close to a sob. But CALL ME BY YOUR NAME is one such book.André Aciman's CALL ME BY YOUR NAME is a story of finding one's identity; it is a story about the journey from youth to adulthood; and it is a story of desire. But above all it is a story of love--found, lived, lost, and remembered.If we are fortunate, we have in our lifetimes one of those heart gripping loves--the memories of which stay with us for the rest of our lives.Such is the focus of this novel. It tells the story of a summer love affair between Elio, a 17 year old boy living in Italy in his family's villa, and Oliver, a 24 year old U.S. graduate student who spends a summer at the villa as an intern to Elio's father who is a professor of classics.Elio and Oliver eventually have a passionate love affair. But when the summer ends the inevitable question is whether they will be together again. That option is unlikely, given the social mores of the 1980s when the novel takes place. Oh, of course there were gay romances then, but societally such were mostly subterranean.So they part. Elio, whose story we continue to follow, is bereft. He aches with longing to see Oliver again. After 20 years, they do reunite. The question that hangs between them is whether they will/can resume their love affair.I will let the answer to that question for the reader to discern.The ending of the novel left me with an aching emptiness--all captured in two words Oliver speaks ""Cor cordium."""
"This is one of the worst novels I have ever had the misfortune of reading. Page after page after page of Elio's obsessive navel gazing love for Oliver. Watching paint dry is far more interesting. As characters both young men are completely uninteresting. Whoever has the audacity to compare this bore to Proust has clearly never read a word of Proust, one of the 20th century's greatest writers. This is a review of the novel only. I have not seen the film."
the author is straight.
"4 stars""Perhaps, in the end, it is because of time that we suffer.""What a beautiful story. I wavered back and forth on my rating because this book was a little bit too purple prose for me but landed on a four because overall I really enjoyed this story.Call Me by Your Name is the story of Elio, a young man who falls for his father's student Oliver over one summer when Oliver comes to stay with him. Anguished by his feelings, he has no idea they may be reciprocated.“We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to feel nothing so as not to feel anything - what a waste!”I saw the movie when it came out in theaters and I loved it. I intermediately wanted more of this story so I went out and bought the book, but wasn't able to make time for it for a long while. The book is a little bit harder to follow from Elio's perspective, though we understand a lot more of his feelings. As a character he felt so young and so wise at the same time. Oliver was a difficult character to read, mostly because Elio had a hard time with it and we see Oliver from his perspective.As I said before I thought this was a beautiful story, Aciman has a way with words that kept me sucked into the story despite being a writing style I don't typically enjoy. If you are curious, give this book a chance!“We had the stars, you and I. And this is given once only.”"
"I first saw the movie and I absolutely fell in love. I don’t think I have ever been so moved and changed by a movie before in my life. I watched it 5 times within a week because I just couldn’t get it out of my head. I was obsessed and it seemed I just couldn’t move on from it so of course, I had to get the book to get the full details of everything. I just finished it and I have to say I’m even more wrecked than I was when I first watched the movie. The story just draws you in and won’t let go. It’s been a few weeks now since I first became acquainted with Elio and Oliver and I can’t see myself being any less addicted as I am now. It’s truly one of the best love stories I’ve ever seen. It’s not a fairytale and it’s not full of adventure. It’s a simple love story that you can relate to and thats the reason why I think it hits as hard as it does. It’s something that could happen to you and therefore it just feels so real. I am forever changed because of this story and I am so grateful that I have it in my life. It’s truly one of the most beautiful love stories I’ve ever read and watched. Do yourself a favor, read the book and then go watch the movie. Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer play Elio and Oliver so well. You would think they were actually lovers in real life because their chemistry is crazy. They bring life to such a beautiful story. I am so in love with the universe of Call Me By Your Name. Delve in yourself. You won’t regret it. Just don’t be surprised when it changes you forever too."
"when i started this book i hated it. when i got halfway through i was bored. when i finished i was disgusted, tired, frustrated, etc. this book isn't about two gay men, it's about two bi men and the fact that people don't say that is bi erasure.i don't even think it was about the two of them i think it was more about Elio becoming a person instead of this 2D piano prodigy, son of a professor that reads a lot. he dealt with heartbreak and loss and i think we should have seen more of his present life because it would have shown us more of how he changed after Oliver and after college and the however many years in between the end of he and Oliver and the end of the book.i don't know if anyone else's copy was like this but mine had a lot of missing end quotations in it. sometimes i genuinely think the dialogue didn't have any quotations on it but maybe it's supposed to be like that. i think they were mistakes and 90% of it was like that."
"I started this book with such great hope, based upon a friend's recommendation.  I kept on hoping even halfway through the book that I would find something uncontrived, something original, something of beauty.  That is a long way through a book to hope.  I left this book not only let down, but angry.  Angry at the machine that bestows the word literature on things that are no more than dressed up dimestore trash.  This book is a saggy old broad that depends upon her accoutrements to distract from her ugly truth.  The southern Italian sun and light, the highly educated family and gifted childhood, the homosexual erotica.  Now before you label me homophobic, you should know that I am not and that I knew the basic plot of this book when I entered its pages with such hope.  What I believe I found in this book is a sly and insidious homophobia, one which uses homosexuality and its current topicality to pull a poor book into notoriety.  It is as much an extra as the sun and the privileged family.  But worse because it is exploitive.  I could not find a memorable sentence in this book that did not poorly echo Durrell and the structure is so obviously Proustian that it is just sad.  In the end the book depends upon the same things that cheap pop novels and porn do:  Atmosphere and anticipation.  I ask myself that had this book been about a heterosexual love affaire, would it even have seen the light.  The answer is no.  And again, this isn't about orientation, it is about art.  The countless greats who have been gay should and would spot this as a weakness beyond justification.  I feel so sad for the millions of books that will never be known because of the publicity machine upon which this book depends and then helps to perpetuate.  There is deep cronyism at work here.  And it is presented upon a plate of grand egoism which flaunts the insult that it is to its readership and to american readers in general.Is there anything redeeming?  Only if this were the first book of an eleven year old could this book be called promising.  Then the so-called precociousness of the narrator, a thin disguise for how Aciman thinks of himself, might be worth the reading.  But no, this written by a man who was as much an heir as another child is to money.  In his case, a polyglot and intellectual family, that in Europe would barely stand out.  In his preface to the new edition of Bassani's oeuvre he speaks of how much he missed italy and hungrily sought out italian books to read.  Maybe.  Or maybe he remained in America because he would have been one more polyglot amongst the masses here in Europe.There is no skill here even where for moments substance makes an appearance.  This book depends as much on extras and lies and exceptionalism as a cheap travel book, only the ending is less obvious.  Don't be fooled and do not berate yourself for thinking as I do as you go ahead and read this book.  There will be a hundred voices from various factions, most of them making a profit, telling you 'No, you can't think that, it's not correct'.  Go, be incorrect, read a real writer, maybe one that writes something that has not been thrown in your face for all the wrong reasons.  Or, if you want to read trash, go for it. I love a good trashy writer who has perfected the skills of suspense and pornography.  But I never confuse it for art."
"This book is one that I won’t soon forget, for many reasons. The work, from start to finish, takes you on a complete journey that is all to familiar to anyone who knows the pain of lost love. The thing that sets this story apart is that it doesn’t matter that it’s two men who fall in love. Rather, they are two people, meeting at a time that wouldn’t allow them to be together. The beauty of the relationship lies not in what sex Elio and Oliver are, but in the connection and bond they form over such a short time. Human emotion and the depths of our ability to love makes this story hard to leave once you’ve read the last word. Be prepared to have your heart soar and sink, all at the same time. Love is never easy, but often painful. This story shows that in the best possible way."
"An intelligent book that treats sex with unabashed dignity. I believe the author, not just a book writer, left  a mysterious chapter that  only the reader can write.  It is difficult to write in the first person which Andre did a superb job.  Twenty year later Oliver's wife has left him.  His children are grown and living their own lives. Both Oliver and Elio remember each and every detail of that summer.  When Oliver is headed for the cab. Elio, in his mind is begging Oliver to turn and call him by his name.  That leads the reader to answer the mysterious missing chapter.  Did he, or didn't he?  If he didn't both will have to live as  described  by Whitman in Maud Miller,  ""The saddest words of tongue or pen are these.It might have been"". Another way to perceive the missing chapter is Oliver did turn and responded and the reader can write a happy ending.  The third choice is that Elio doesn't want to lose Oliver again and calls out himself producing a happy ending written by the reader.  The choice is up to the reader.  What a sneaky, brilliant writer Andre Aciman is!  I wish that the movie, though deserving of every accolade it received, had produced the book ending.  To say I loved the both the book and the movie is below an understatement."
"I loved the film, but loved the book more. I was also 17 in 1983 and also in love with a 24 year old married man. So the movie and more so the book really resonated with me.  The movie made my eyes water at the end.  The book had me full on ugly-crying and it felt better than therapy to be reminded that ‘forbidden love’ hadn’t only happened to me."
"I passed over this book for quite sometime in Kindle. I wasn't aware of the subject. I wish I hadn't waited so long. This is probably the most powerful book I have ever read. The subject matter is beautiful. The characters are beautiful. Their love is beautiful. I will admit the last few pages were the hardest for me to get through. My heart still aches for Elio. The tears flowed for a long time before I could gather my wits. A lot of the story was too deep for me but so full of wonderful details. I watched the movie first and was equally affected by the ending as with the book. So when I read the book I found it was so much more engaging and grabbed my heart and almost would not let go.I absolutely recommend this book to anyone who favors love stories. It is beautiful.Elio, Elio, Elio..........Oliver, Oliver, Oliver💖💖💖💔💔💔"
"–– 5/5 ––Call Me By Your Name follows the evolving and deeply impactful relationship between Oliver and Elio. This book is told from Elio’s perspective in a raw and truthful way I have never experienced before. Romance novels scare me more often than not because I find my self gagging at the stereotypical behavior of characters, and the often, unoriginal writing style. However, Aciman brought a whole new light to the concept of a contemporary romance by being simply truthful and blunt. The nature of the storytelling, was one of more of a reflection, rather than and explanation of events. I felt as though I was sitting in a room filled with the smell of old books, papers thrown over a desk, and a piano against the far wall. I was sitting with an old friend who I was having a true heart to heart with. We have no shame and no secrets. I find Elio sitting in a chair across from me, in his old age, looking back on his life, recounting the events, and the meaning of what it was to have loved and lost. He is sharing his story, one he has never told me before, and I am so touched, I do nothing but listen.This is a feeling of friendship is something I have never been able to experience before while reading a book. Normally, I take the place of the main character and I live through their words, their thoughts, and experience their world. But this was magical. This book gave me the friendship one only ever dreams of finding. One of pure honesty and trust."
"This is one of the rare cases in which a film is not only better than the source material but far better.For the last 1/3 or 1/4 of the book all I have to say is ""GROSS"".  I have read a lot of gay fiction so I'm not a prude but I was shocked by how quickly Elio went from virgin to scat.  I think it took a week?Also it was clear the characters were not practicing safe sex from their first encounter with the deliberate omission of condoms in the gays scenes contrasted with the deliberate inclusion of them in the straight scenes.I spent most of the book trying to get through the boredom of Elio's internal monologue and his pretentious parents.  I wasn't impressed by the film which I had seen earlier until I read the book and realized how little the filmmakers had to work with."
"I read this book about two weeks ago, and I still don’t think I can fully communicate just how much I loved it. It was so beautifully written that it left me speechless and in tears.I went into this book blindly. I knew Timothée and Armie were in the movie, but I didn’t know which character they each played. The only other thing I knew was that people were worshiping the relationship between Oliver and Elio.I’ll admit that when I first started it, I was a little skeptical. I came so close to giving up and just putting it in the stack of partially read books on my shelf. I didn’t understand the attention it received, and I was reluctant to try to figure it out.I am so glad I didn’t give up.Elio kind of annoyed me at first, and Oliver just felt like the typical arrogant love interest from every other romance novel I’ve read. I started to let the disappointment cloud my judgement and started losing interest. I ended up needing to reread a few pages in part two because I kept getting distracted. But I was determined to invest my time in the rest of the book to try to at least slightly understand the admiration of this book.That’s when things started to click.The character development for both Elio and Oliver slowly changed my mind on their characters. Elio was beginning to annoy me less the more I read, and I was starting to warm up to Oliver as well. Their relationship was growing, and I was completely invested despite myself.When I started the book, I expected it to be a 3.5 star rating, maybe a 4 star rating tops. I assumed I’d just be disappointed and move on to my next book. But by the time I fully finished the book, I was crying my eyes out, and all I could think was: “That was one of the best books I’ve ever read.”"
"Generally books are better than the movies that are born from them. The read the book before I saw the movie. I was so smitten by it I couldn't wait to see the movie. However, when I did I lost the imagery I had created in my mind from reading the book. I remember being initially disappointed because I had pictured the characters very differently. Although the movie follows the book very closely it leaves out some important, at least to me, details such as those in ""The Peach Scene."" I've seen the movie many times. I've grown to love the acting of Armie Hammer and Timothee Chalamet. They did a superb job. However, I'll always return to the book for the full story. I've now read the book three times."
"Its sensitivity to a young man's curiosity about so many things around him and beyond him and his burgeoning sexuality.  I understand the movie ends earlier than the novel which follows both chaps lightly for 20 more years.  Regardless of one's age, when recalling our youth, we have sublimated those painful days and months when we felt like we didn't fit in or our future looked grim and our intelligence seemed to evaporate.  The boy's father is a fantastic father in his unrestricted tolerance and understanding.  His attitude and posture make their Italian household welcoming and dynamic.  I was caught up in every chapter and the sexual climax--as it were--was only a small part.  The older lad too has great understanding and must see his younger self in the young lad.  All of them are so likable, even the gardener."
"This is certainly an emotionally draining novel, but not in a sense that that's at all a bad thing. More mournful it is in the idea and the realization that love and attraction can be fickle and complex, and you'll never overcome, or fully understand, the heart/the body/the mind. All, too, in part because you go through the motions with these characters, both longing for a semblance of self, truth, and intimacy. Their frustrations become yours, along with their loss and love and grief and unfathomable want...It's difficult to put into words how this book affected me, because I feel as though, in one way or another, and no matter your sex, no matter your sexuality, everyone can relate to the feelings expressed herein: of desire, lust, obsession, and the yearnings of youth that come and go, but leave you wanting. The story of Elio and Oliver is knotty and labyrinthine, but at the same time, not at all. It is hard to describe their relationship through those weeks (and then on through so many years), without feeling it is one of the most romantic and elegiac loves I've thus read in literature in recent memory. There is a great symmetry that parallels how we as humans dance around with mock indifference to desire, in essence wasting precious time for fear our feelings won't be reciprocated. So much time wasted; which essentially makes this story so very tragic: because it is so real and so human. The words that spill out harken to a time before, when things seemed possible in youth, but fear and uncertainty ran amok, leaving only so much, and then, just memories. This, here, is only bolstered by André Aciman's strength in writing such beautiful and lasting passages. His words bled deep red and warm, like lifeblood. I often found myself re-reading sentences solely because of their graceful poetics.I'll end with the end, which brimmed with depthless emotion, and caved me in upon myself. The feelings that remain are ones that remind me of a somber sensation: of a wonderful dream (or is it memory?) from long ago, that I can try to snatch from the air like a loose thought caught in the wind, to ponder over, and maybe even smile about, but which I cannot, in the end, seem to find when sleep descends."
The subject matter of this novel is often distorted by less competent authors. The emotional intensity and intimacy of CALL ME BY YOUR NAME shatters social stigmas and gets to the core of what deep love is all about. The reader is swept into the story by blatantly honest prose that takes no prisoners. The story of Oliver and Elio is simple and yet complex. As the emotional layers are peeled back one gets a personal view of two hearts experiencing the purest form of attraction. There is no bigotry here. Only the raw truth. This is a masterwork that will change the way mature people feel about life's greatest gift- the love of another person. If you're ready for the real deal you'll find it here. CALL ME BY YOUR NAME will bring you to your knees.
"One of the most remarkable books I have read this year!  After seeing and falling in love with the movie and it's actors as Elio and Oliver, I decided to purchase the kindle version and audiobook.  I was excited to discover how the screenplay was adapted from the original novel.  Best decision EVER!  Not only did I totally fall in love with the story all over again, but I enjoyed it far more for a very different reason.  Discovering that the movie consisted of only half the story, I continued reading/listening and was amazed by how much of the story we were denied in the movie.  The novel is broken up into several sections and being able to see Elio and Oliver into the future in the last two sections after where the movie left off was both heartbreaking and joyous. Within the pages of the book, we were able to hear the thoughts from the individual characters, which truly brought to life many of the scenes that came across as somewhat vague in the movie.  If you were a fan of the movie, I highly recommend reading the book.  Even better, listen to the narration of the audiobook for a fantastic performance by Armie Hammer, that makes you feel as if you are still watching the scenes play out in front of you as they were written.  The only thing that could have made the audio version any better was if Timothee Chalamet would have co-narrated."
"I've never posted a review on Amazon before but I felt I had to after reading this dream of a book. It is written as a narrative by Elio Perlman who over the course of an intense Italian summer in the 1980s falls deeply and passionately in love with Oliver, a visiting grad student from the US. Initially, it feels like unrequited love to Elio but the feeling is reciprocated by Oliver soon enough. Aciman conveys the feelings of confusion, guilt, joy, sadness and all pervading passion in Elio through dreamy and absolutely breath taking prose. Oliver is beautifully portrayed as well - seemingly a handsome, golden, carefree 24 year old at first but as we learn, equally intelligent, passionate and caring in the end.There are enough hints through the book to make the reader dread the inevitable parting between the two that will haunt them (and us) for the rest of their lives. Elio measures every other partner in his life as an event before or after his summer with Oliver.  The two never get over each other. Elio is as in love with Oliver towards the end of the book as ever - part of the reason he explains why he cannot go over to meet Oliver's wife. Elio and Oliver meet for the last time after a long gap - 20 years after that first, glorious summer in Italy, and the ending line in the book is the most heartbreaking prose I've ever read. It moved me beyond tears and I'm sure it's done the same to many others.I've lived in Italy for many years and this book also brought back haunting memories of that beautiful place - Aciman describes a transcendent Italian summer with chriping cicadas that immediately takes me back to quiet summer mornings in Umbria or Bologna with the smell of jasmine all around! There is something magical about Italy - the sun, the countryside, the people, the greenery - you just cannot forget or get over it. Now superimpose this beautiful novel on an Italian summer and it just cannot get any more perfect.Ultimately, the story though is one about all encompassing love, searing loss, sadness & heartbreak. It is the ultimate joy and bliss to find the kind of love that Aciman describes between Elio and Oliver. Most of us never do. The fact that it was so fleeting and could not keep the two lovers together haunts us. It makes us think of our own lives - of never being able to find love, of lost time, of wasted youth, of never having found the kind of real intimacy, the complete and total union of 2 souls where Oliver holds Elio's gaze and says 'Call me by your name and I'll call you by mine'"
"I wanted to read this book before venturing to see the new movie with the same name. If there is a perfect way to write about a leisurely summer in Italy where a young graduate student is discovered by the younger son of his host and professor.  And if deep abiding love can be decanted from the passionate sexual exploration of these two young men, then it is the finest wine that is poured out.  And, if years later both men leading separate lives they still can upon occasional meetings remember in their hearts a brief time that defines their living and breathing days.  Very powerful, very beautiful, very honest and worth your time to enjoy every word."
"This is an amazing novel, one of the best pieces of fiction I've read in many years. I had seen the movie, then decided to buy the book. While the movie was quite faithful to the novel, the novel manages to give you the entire inner dialogue of the main character, Elio, a teen who is smitten with the graduate student who is lodging with his family over the summer in Italy. The prose is poetry, flowing, intelligent, and captures incredibly well the conflicting emotions of infatuation that ends in separation and pain. The ending of the book is far, far superior to the ending of the movie. I won't spoil it for you, but the book's ending is far more hopeful and complex than the movie could manage, and ultimately this ending made me love the story all the more. Thanks to Andre Aciman for a novel I couldn't put down, literally!"
"Although the setting and era of this coming of age novel are somewhat nebulous, it seems to be quite a bit in the past, maybe even the 1960s. The teenage (and probably under-age) protagonist is the only son of a progressive academic family who becomes obsessed with an older graduate student who is summer interning at the professor's home in Northern Italy. Perhaps the title should be ""Can I Wear Your Swimsuit.' The boy's immaturity is countered by his musical virtuosity on the piano. He spends his days reworking classical sonatas by Bach and other composers. It allows him to profess a degree of snobbery and exceptionalism that he believes is sophistication. The best part of the book is an adventure in Rome where both characters seem to relax and just enjoy themselves. The boy returns pregnant with the belief that the relationship will bloom from that point forward. It all seems repressed. The real touch of sophistication is the parents' attitude toward the underage romance - they are just happy their son is happy."
"Very boring, and decided to abandon it. Not sure what all the hype is about. Even the dialog felt strange and couldn't connect their thoughts and for me became a frustrating read. Definitely not one my favorite books. Way overblown with good reviews that I question."
"Call Me By Your Name is a bittersweet story about a brief but idyllic relationship between two young men. While the tale of Elio and Oliver takes center stage, this novel is also a story about vulnerability, intimacy, self-acceptance, and family. Call Me By Your Name transcends the label of sexual orientation and the 1980's setting to be as fresh and piquant to a reader today of any orientation and of any age. This is honestly one of the greatest books I have ever read. A must-read if you plan on seeing Luca Guadagnino's film adaptation this fall!"
"A verbose, sometimes confusing writing style.  The book seems to be mostly about endless self-examination and angst.  I agree with some of the other reviews: boring, waste of time. Do yourself a favor:  skip the book and rent the movie."
"Everything about this novel rings true.  The hesitation, nervousness, beauty of a forbidden, first, everlasting love.  I'm crying because I hate to think there are men who would choose a ""parallel life"" over being true to their perfect love.  Maybe there is no such thing as a perfect love.  I don't know, but this is written so beautifully.  I guess I just love the idea of love as pure as Elio has for Oliver.  I highly recommend this book to anyone, but I especially think teenagers who might be questioning their sexuality, could find some validation in the words."
"So, no happy ending then?I read the book and then watched the movie. Thoroughly enjoyed both but I was completely devastated that the ending was so freaking sad.My first impression was that Oliver was corrupting this 17 year old; then I realized that not only did this happen in the 80’s and in a European country where perhaps people are more open minded, but also, Elio seemed to be the one making all the moves. Oliver did try to resist so no blame there.The first half of the book I was confused by Oliver’s hot and cold reactions. It was the same in the movie.I liked the way Elio was sure of everything but at the same time not sure at all of anything. And I was also about to roll my eyes at Elio’s inner monologues, but now i understand it was necessary for me to understand the enormity of what was happening inside of him. He fell absolutely and irrevocably in a love so intense and deep; there are really no right words to describe it.Both the book and the movie did such a great job at portraying this incredible relationship.I loved loved loved the book  and movie but I hated the ending so much.Let’s take a moment to talk about the super hot dude that plays Oliver. Jesus Cripes! Movie Elio wasn’t the only one wanting to climb him like a tree am I right?"
"I was excited to read this because there just aren't enough quality gay romance novels out there. However, despite some vivid, imaginative narration, I found the novel to be pretentious and over-the-top. One of the biggest problems with the novel was its central characters, two hyper-educated, obscenely privileged white guys who meet and fall in love among a backdrop that is probably too perfect for its own good. I understand that the novel seeks to explore love at its most indulgent, but at a certain point, it just becomes difficult to relate to a character when they're so excessively spoiled that everything, literally everything goes their way. Elio, the 17-year-old, spends his summers in a tiny, coastal Italian village, where his family has an oceanside house with a maid who makes his bed and cooks for the family every day, a gardener who maintains the landscape, and parents who let him do whatever he wants, whenever he wants. Oliver has no personality other than being gorgeous and intelligent. He's a professor at - wait for it - Columbia. To further highlight the excess of these characters, Elio's father, who is more understanding and kind than Elio probably deserves, buys his son and Oliver the most luxurious hotel in Rome so they can spend their last few days together in utter luxury, surrounded by culture and good company, and of course it's all picture perfect.The end of the novel has some good moments, but by then I'm not invested enough in the characters to really care. The characters' separation feels far from tragic. The author seems to want you to be devastated at how ""deprived"" these two fellows are for not getting to live every year of their lives living out the fantasy that was their summer together.If you're looking to just get lost in romantic fantasy, maybe this is the novel for you. If you're looking for gay romance with some emotional payoff, read Annie Proulx's ""Brokeback Mountain"", watch its powerful film adaptation, or read James Baldwin's Giovanni's Room."
"I have read all of the Mallory books by Carol O'Connell. My favorites are Mallory's Oracle, Stone Angel and now, Find Me. Given her rough life between ""almost 7"" and 10 years old, it is amazing that Mallory even survived so that the Markowitz's could take her in and nurture her.The stress of living her rigid life and being a Special Crimes Detective have taken their toll on Mallory. She had her supporters in Charles and Riker, even when they thought she was being bizarre. There were other supporters, friends of Markowitz, who cut her lots of slack because she is so brilliant at her job. I was getting worn down by Mallory fighting everyone in her life. In Find Me, Mallory ""plays nicer"".I realized early that Mallory was on an exploration of Route 66 (because of her father's letters) that just happenned to coincide with the serial killer's life. ""Sentimental"" would be a difficult word to use for those who know Mallory. Being the great detective that she is, she modified her trip to help solve the Chicago murder mystery that she stumbled upon. No crimes like"
"Like many others, I picked up this novel after seeing the movie. I'm not entirely sure why, but I'm glad I did.Admittedly, my reaction to the film was mixed. On the one hand, I identified a bit with the protagonist, Elio, who, like me, was a Gen-Xer and also like me, was sexually precocious during his teen years. I loved Elio's father even more: he delivers one of the most heartbreaking monologues ever recorded for stage or screen. (It's taken verbatim from the book, BTW.)On the other hand, the movie was slow-going at times, driven by characters not by plot. And while I identified with Timothee Chalamet's Elio, I'm not sure I liked him. I definitely didn't care much for Armie Hammer's Oliver.Then I read the book.Take my advice: read the book.I understood immediately why the film was such a slog at times: because all the real action is taking place in Elio's head. Aciman's stunning poetry--that's what it really is: poetry--conveys Elio's obsessive desire, his self doubt, his endless philosophizing in ways that will leave you breathless, in tears, or both.But perhaps the most interesting part of the entire novel is the ending, which is cut very short in the film. It's simultaneously touching, sad, and hopeful--in fact, you could argue that it's more of a sequel than an epilogue. (Fun fact: there's talk of making a second movie based on chapter four.)Oh, and to anyone who might've argued that this is a book (and film) about a sexual predator, you are correct. But the predator isn't Oliver, it's Elio. That much is clear from page one.SEMI-SPOILER BELOWThere was a death toward the end of the book that gave me pause. Did anyone else wonder about that? Given the period during which the death occurred, you could infer a few causes. I felt like Aciman was hinting at this, but very, very obliquely."
"Call Me by Your Name is a touching and bittersweet novel which tells the story of a 17 year  old American-Italian-Jewish young man who falls hard for their summer exchange student. Elio's father and mother have always hosted exchange students in their home during the summer. Their home is on the Italian Riviera. This year, 1988 turns out to be different however when Elio Perlman has a six week romance with Oliver Ulliva, a young professor from the United States, working on a novel, and is 7 years older than Elio. Elio's father sponsors someone every year to come spend time with his family and to aid in anyway he can with their manuscript.At first Oliver acts aloof and doesn't pay Elio a second look as he goes about his days. Elio feels neglected, rejected and unable to stop his feelings.This book is a beautifully written book bringing us all back to how important first love is, and in some cases transcends the years. I don't want to say anything else except that I loved this book,  it was so well written and I know it will take me a long while to quit thinking about it. The subject of sex was handled beautifully and not vulgarly, and it is a perfect read.  I gave this book 5***** stars and have added it to my tbr list again over the next years!"
"5 beautiful, poetic, stunning stars!Wow! I am so in love with this story! The writing was so beautiful, it was like reading a long beautiful, touching poem. My words will not do it justice.A coming of age story, experiencing your first love. So much passion in the words, I felt the love Elio felt for Oliver. I felt the pain deep in my heart that Elio felt and wept with him.Another thing I really loved about this story was that it was so uncynical, there was no mistrustfulness or negativity, no malice or racism there was no shame, no embarrassment, just a pure celebration of love and all the sorrow that comes with first loves.This book will remain in me for a long time or perhaps forever. That's how deep it touched my heart. Because at the end love is love, is love!One of my favorite parts was towards the end of the book Elio's father gives him this speech that had me sobbing like a baby. The most beautiful speech a parent can give to their child full of tenderness, love, and understanding. He acknowledges that Elio is heartbroken. He validates his pain. And though he doesn't ask Elio to confirm that he had a relationship with Oliver, he does let Elio know that what he had with Oliver was rare and special and encourages him not to shut himself off after this experience, but to feel the pain, and sorrow, but to also feel the joy he felt when he was with Oliver, to embrace the happy memories, and to realize how lucky he was to have had a friendship/relationship like the one he and Oliver had.""Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened!""*sighs* Beautiful, just beautiful!"
"Andre Aciman has written a stunning novel.  The protagonists are a 17 year old Italian boy (Elio) and a 24 year old American professor putting final touches on a masterpiece.  For his age Elio demonstrates intellectual yearning along with sophisticated classical music musicology. The setting is a six week period in an unidentified town near Venice where the Piave River empties into the Adriatic Sea.  Both primary characters are complex persons with often internally warring emotions and attractions.  Aciman's writing is beautiful and cultured.  His depiction of the scenery and other characters is wonderfully detailed. As I read the initial portion of the novel, I saw the plot unfolding quite slowly.  Aciman's writing portrays in considerable detail the developing emotions of the two.  Is there going to be a real connection?  As you read further, the draw of the plot pulls you ""in"" more and more strongly -- and I found myself reading more slowly and savoring each phrase.  With the days spent in Rome and through the end of the novel, the reader is pulled into the lives of both Elio and the professor.  I would be surprised if almost all readers weren't similarly moved."
"OK, so I heard about the movie that was coming out in November and wanted to read the book. Wow, what a wonderful story about human relationships and how the relationships shape our character, nature and persona. There are some very erotic parts of the book that will be interesting to see how they present them in the movie...if you've ever been in love with someone much younger/older read this book..."
"As many other reviewers have noted, the book is not lockstep source material for the movie. If your reasons for liking the movie revolved around joy at seeing a tender epic romance between two men, then you’re likely to be disappointed in the book. They are very different, both in content and in tone. The movie is lighter, sweeter, more joyful in places. Their love is made to feel singular. The aftermath of the nosebleed scene, the midnight scene, the scene outside at night with Oliver’s legs wrapped over Elio’s as they talk about how little of the summer they have left...I didn’t appreciate the genius of the script, the blocking, and the acting choices until I realized these favorite heartfelt glimpses into their intense intimacy didn’t come from the book. The book narration from Elio is TELLING us about their singular, intimate connection while SHOWING us that Elio is just perpetually lusting after literally anyone besides his parents and Mafalda, Manfredi, and Anchise. LITERALLY everyone. Excuse all my emphasis, but it really turned me off after a while. I started to rolling my eyes and talking out loud to the book at some of this. Really, the book made it hard for me to buy that this had been a special relationship at all, not to mention the defining romantic relationship of Elio’s life. The language can be interesting. Read it if you want to fill in a few details the movie omitted such as the gifting of Armance, Oliver’s skills in the kitchen and the garden, Oliver attending Harvard for undergrad, etc.  But, definitely skip it if you want to preserve the beautiful intimacy and romance of the movie. I wish I had spared myself."
Love that there is no line of older/younger male/female. It's love between two human beings. My experience when I was 18 & he was 28. Will always have my 🖤. Still hoping one day to fall in love again.
"It kind of bothers me that people refer to this book and the movie as a gay story.  It is not, it is a story of love, awakening, realization, a young man finally living out his thoughts.  Elio had been the host to other guest for many years, this was the summer of the actualization of his many thoughts.  If you have seen the movie this is the complete story.  I read the book after seeing the movie, I now consider the move a snap shot of what is in the book.  The last scene in the movie was powerful, it did not even happen in the book and the book goes on for 20 more years after that winter.  I bought the book, I had checked out the electronic version from our local library, it turned out to be the audio version.  I absolutely fell in love with the audio version.  Let Armie Hammer (Oliver) tell you the story.  I listened and read along.  There is a line in the book that really struck a cord with me.  For Elio that summer became his focal point.  Everything in life was measured by that summer.  Things in his life either happened before or after that event.  I now know that is true in my life and I have asked other people about their focal points.  Andr'e has done a great job of showing us what love can be and we get to sit down and read about it."
"Incredible and phenomenal. Highly, highly, highly recommend this novel. Everything in the novel (and film) was beautiful and pure. The story has no label mentioned at all which is what I hope to have in society one day. The novel has no consequences or punishments at all for the two characters falling in Love. It’s just about two beautiful human beings falling in love, no labels and no punishments. Just two humans falling in love in the most beautiful way. The characters are well developed and the writing style is phenomenal with lots of hidden meanings and references to famous figures. A very intellectual and beautiful book, highly recommend and highly recommend watching the film too :) can’t wait to hear the many awards this book and film deserves and for the dvd to be released!"
"I have to admit that I only heard about this book because of everything I've read about the rousing success the movie adaptation recently had at the Sundance festival. I decided to read it in advance of the forthcoming movie release that is due this fall. The author, Andre Aciman, tells the story of a young, introspective and highly intellectual Italian-Jewish boy, Elio, in his late teens, who falls for a handsome American graduate student, Oliver, who is hosted for by his parents in their beautiful Italian home for the summer while he works on his manuscript.The story is narrated as a recollection by Elio when he is in his late thirties. It is a nostalgic and detailed look back of a love story that includes beautiful characters in an equally beautiful Mediterranean country during a hot summer in the mid 80's.I couldn't put the book down from the moment that Elio first described Oliver's arrival at his Villa, through their slow, tense filled flirting which leads to an intense love affair during Oliver's last two weeks in Italy, and their brief reunions in their later adult lives.I have to admit, as much as I loved the story of their intense and youtful affair, the romantic in me was hoping for a different outcome for Elio and Oliver. Nevertheless, Elio and Oliver's story will stay with me for a long time. If nothing else, I'll be reminded of it anytime I eat a peach!"
"I loved this book when it came out 10 years ago. I was apprehensive about seeing the movie, and felt that Armie Hammer would be wrong for the role. But the movie not only brought the book to life but enhanced it, by telling the story in the present rather than as the first-person memoir of the book. Having loved and been so moved by the movie, I was apprehensive about rereading the book. I’m happy to report it holds up brilliantly and the “epilogue “ - what happens in the years later - which was not in the movie, was both heart-breaking and incredibly touching. These characters will be with me forever."
"This book has ruined every other romance novel for me. I’m so sad I finished it so fast because I don’t think I’ll find anything as emotional, intimate and amazing again. This book is the definition of intimacy. I wish I could put my feelings on this book into a stellar and detailed review but that feels impossible and I know I still wouldn’t be able to do it justice. Just read it!!"
"Beautiful story, romanticised a hell of a lot more by its setting. Also avoided some of the cliche gay stereotyping, labels, that seem such a major part of discourse these days. Surely the most moving moment for me was Elio's father's discussion with him, conveying such love, pride, acceptance, and even a little envy. Very beautiful moment in the story."
"I absolutely love Call Me By Your Name. It's a very beautiful and sexy and mouth dropping novel. I love the chemistry that Elio and Oliver had within each other. I was in tears throughout the final chapter, Ghost Spots, but I loved every moment. André Aciman did a phenomenal job and I was sad to see the novel come to an end. The love they had touched me and I hope to find love like that one day. When I finished reading the novel I was in tears and speechless because it was so heartwarming and no words could truly express how I felt. I would recommend this novel to anyone with an open mind. If you're searching for something with true love between to men or just two human beings period then you've come to the right spot. I have not seen the movie yet, but I've heard many great reviews, and I'm excited to see it for myself."
"Wow.. this was such an intense love story that delves into the most relatable and truest desires and fickle tendencies of the human condition. It harmoniously contrasts the paradox that is both the tragedy and life force of memory and love. This sheds light on the nonsensical way that our wants and obsessions can be self perpetuated, driving one to do the uncanny and regrettable, all merely in order to continue wanting, wishing, imagining, but never really having. A small qualm I had with this book was it seemed slightly pedantic, particularly when making so many very specific references to works of literature, art, music, mythology, or even just the extremely higher level vocabulary which could have easily been replaced by more common vernacular. Even though I didn't understand any of the references, I still feel confident I soaked up every important aspect of the story."
"When I first picked this book up, I half expected that it would be nothing but teenage angst,and that I'd put it right back down. I was so wrong. Oh, there is angst. But it's along the lines of Crime and Punishment. It drives the story. It's a rich flavor that you want to savor right along with the brilliant imagery. (I could taste the apricots and smell the ocean and I wanted to be there.) The characters are unforgettable. The dialogue is very good. If an author falls down to me, it's usually in the dialogue. But in Call Me by Your Name it is perfect. This story, will make you cry. It'll make you laugh. It'll make you wonder. I loved every minute of it."
"This book takes you on a physical, spacial and emotional journey of self discovery and love. It combines music, philosophy, literature and location to create a world in which the reader is lushly and effortlessly transported. I was reading this book with not just a sense of wonder but also a feeling of having been a fly on the wall watching this relationship unfold. Some authors use detail like a hammer, Andre uses it with the light touch of a skilled painter when creating a piece they have no idea will become a masterwork. For them it is merely a labor of love that is transformative to everyone that be holds it. The same can be said for this work of fiction that reads like an intimate biography."
"I saw this movie 4 times in the theatre. Probably the best movie of 2017. It was so different from every other movie released. The only film that compared quality wise was Phantom Thread. And definitely one of the best ever love stories. Timothy Chalamet was so available and emotionally raw as an actor in this. Armie Hammer was good, and Michael Stuhlberg and Amira Casar were also phenomenal in their smaller rolls. Very impressed with Luca Guadagnino as director of this also. Looking forward to his next film. A remake of Suspiria. Coming out in November 2018."
So I watched the Movie first and had so many feels for the story and the production that I was in tears. Friends told me the book ends differently so I read the book. In the movie I find Elio bold and energetic. In the book he comes across as a whiny brat who’s pragmatic.The story is beautiful the writing style however gets a bit confusing as it easy to confuse who’s saying what.I enjoyed the movie more as I found Elio in the book was just a bit too much. Also there are inconsistencies in the book that don’t add up on the timeline.Still a beautiful story though but I’d say watch the movie instead of reading the book.
"This is a wonderful book to experience ""emodiversity"" at it’s best.First, upon being two thirds through the book I wanted to rate it with four stars. At times it gets too obvious that it’s been written by a Harvard literature professor, especially as he - in my opinion - occasionally over-demonstrates his mastery in literary constructs. Sometimes less is just more.Thinking back though it was just such a pleasure to read and I feel it changed me slightly as a person. For the better!"
"I read this book over the course of a few weeks. I put it down for a little while during the middle of the story, since I never really had that 'wow I cant put this book down' feeling. The beginning 3/4ths of this book were slow reading. I started to get very impatient with the characters. There was a period where Elio and Oliver went back and fourth with their affection, and personally I felt like it dragged on. But then again maybe this was an intentional response by the author, since Elio was going through similar feelings of impatientness.My point is, the pacing in this part of the book made me put it down for a bit. I later convinced myself that I needed to finish this book because I started it, and I can't stand not finishing books. I was pleased to find that the latter half of the book was much smoother to read.I have my issues with the characters themselves, but thats all personal preferance and doesnt really effect to the quality of the writing itself.Since youre wondering, I thought the characters seemed rather self absorbed and had a sort of ""I'm edgy and deep because I'm smart"" vibe. But thats just me.Despite that, this book was meticulously and beautifully written. You can see and feel all the scenery, and the analogies were satisfyingly accurate. Although I found it too meticulous at times, I obviously found it intriguing enough to write this review. Go ahead and give it a read, you'll probably like it."
"The story was good but I had trouble with the writing style. One and two page paragraphs were the norm. I found myself skimming through some of the longer ones instead of reading them in their entirety. It did seem to capture the angst of what a young person goes through with his/her early sexual encounters, especially the ones trying to figure out their true sexual preference. I would now like to see the movie to find out what was done with the essence of the book."
"I saw the film before I read the book.  I have to say, I enjoyed the film more.  I think I would have liked the book more had it not been told solely from Elio's narrative.  I would have loved to know Oliver's perspective.  I found Oliver's stream of consciousness writing to be confusing, often questioning whether events were actually happening or if he was imagining them.  His obsession with Oliver in the beginning was a bit overdone, in my opinion.  That said, I also found the events that took place in the future to be a bit rushed.  All in all, it is still a beautiful love story."
"I'm fairly obsessed with this book/movie/story... When I watched the movie and read the book, I didn't see the relationship between Elio and Oliver as a gay love story (nor do I see this book as gay literature... Elio and Oliver are presumably bisexual anyway). I just saw it as a love story, and I think a lot of that can be attributed to the way Aciman writes Elio's thoughts and desires out. What I like about the book that wasn't portrayed as well in the movie is that in the book, you get so much more insight on how Elio feels towards Oliver, which makes sense considering that the book is told from his point of view and that would be hard to do in the movie. The way Elio expresses himself is so beautiful, and I feel that regardless of the reader's sexual orientation, it is very relatable in the way that he describes the story of his first love. You see everything through Elio's eyes; you become Elio. I saw one reviewer say the buildup to their relationship was slow, and I agree, but I suppose part of why the slowness didn't bother me is because I watched the movie first and knew what was going to happen. With how erotic this book is, I definitely would advise caution to younger readers (especially if they're not used to talk of same gender sex). This is my favorite book (and movie) in a long time. I will almost definitely read it again multiple times in the future. I am glad that there is more portrayal of same sex relationships in literature and media nowadays. They're very refreshing among all the straight love stories, and I think that's another reason why I loved this book so much."
"Let me start by saying I LOVED the writing in this book.  It was beyond beautiful and I really felt like I was spending summer in Italy.I feel like I could read this book over and over again, and each time take away something different from the story.  The first time I read it I was confused about the main character.  I didn't understand what he was going through and thought that he didn't really know himself, but then reading it again I think he might have known exactly what he was doing and possibly just scared of it.  Everyone might think something different and that's what makes this book so special."
"I hadn’t seen the movie, and I’m really glad I read the book first. It is so gorgeously written; I kept going back to reread passages. The pacing is definitely literary - which totally lends to Elio’s painful, adolescent yearning - so don’t expect a lot of plot other than their relationship and plenty of self-reflection. The portrayal of desire and boundaries is as complex as it is enticing. And there is plenty on the page. If you’re up for a trip to the Italian Riviera and an unforgettable love story, highly recommend!"
"I'd say you should read this book especially if you have seen and loved the film, you really get into Elio's head and as expected there are more details and scenarios that occur in the book that aren't in the movie. This story just exudes raw human emotion that everyone can relate to in one way or another and the ending had me reeling for 3 days."
"Having now finished the third installment of this trilogy, the author keeps you in suspense right up to the last page. If you like long involved novels, then this is for you. I don't know of any novel out there, of the current fare, that the characters are so well developed, that by the time you get to the third, it's character's become like old friends. This is not a happy or ""feel good"" story. It's a mystery with a lot of twists and turns in it. I've no doubt I'll be revisiting these novels again and again."
"I discovered this novel because of the online buzz about the new film, starring Armie Hammer as Oliver, Timothée Chalamet as Elio, and directed by Luca Guadagnino. I've not seen the movie yet, though I found the novel, about a first love between two bisexual men, one 17 years old and one 24 years of age, a fascinating study in the coming of age of young men, which is written IMO in very lyric and poetic prose. The ending, as the two men mature apart from each other after a summer leading (slowly but intensely building) to the satisfaction of the two protagonist's ultimate sexual desire for each other, is quite bittersweet but immensely satisfying. A very fine read, indeed!"
Wow!  A moving love story for the ages. A bit graphic in spots but so heartfelt  that it only worked to make the characters more beloved. I am so glad I got to read this story but I don’t have any desire to see the film. I believe it would never compare on screen. The authors writing is so very descriptive and poetic.
"I am not a book reader... period.  But after having seen the movie, I was compelled to get the book and audio book.  Armie Hammer reading this novel is amazing.  Very interesting that he goes from playing OLIVER in the movie, to reading a book that is from the point of view of ELIO.  As he has said in numerous interviews, it really gave him a new perspective on the story.  The stream of thought format of this story takes a while to get used to.  The story is timeless and wonderful.  Love is Love is Love....  I highly recommend the Audio Book and the MOVIE !"
"I saw the movie before I saw the book, and even going into the movie (a screening that a friend suggested) I hadn't heard of it and didn't know what it was about. I loved the movie, and immediately went to buy the book. This book is so beautiful. Aciman's style/syntax took me a second to get used to, and even now I don't know if I fully understand some of the words and phrases he used to convey the story, and probably won't until the 100th read, but overall I got the story. It is such a wonderful story and I thoroughly enjoyed every part of it. It's definitely one of those books I'll keep coming back to over the years. That being said, I also can't wait to take what I have gathered from this book, and rewatch the movie to better understand that story as well."
"Much has been reviewed about this novel already. I’ll not repeat that here, other than to say I’ve never been so glad for sweet heartache as I am having read this story. And that’s no spoiler— the emotions evoked in the narrative speak of human experiences that, by their very nature, are rare, fragile, and temporary. The yearnings of late adolescent love and sexuality are relatable to a degree that you feel as though you are experiencing the first person narrative yourself, you are experiencing Elio and Oliver’s relationship. All the ups and downs, the exhilaration, the crushing and breathless longing. I’m grateful for the experience, and jealous of others who get to read this story for the first time."
"I have never been more excited and stimulated by a book like this before.  The writing is other-worldly.  How does an author find such perfect words to describe life, love, angst, romance, palpable connection and erotic connection.  Aciman is a genius.  it is that simply profound.  This book changed my life and made me feel optimistic about love, and humanity again.  Please read this and be transported to the world of love, lust, an aliveness stirring in all of us, waiting to explode."
"This book affected me so strongly that I had to stop reading it and just think about its implications regarding the lives of all youths, straight or gay, who fall so deeply in love at so young an age. And regarding the issue of ""pedophilia,"" I just wonder if a person younger than Oliver would have taken such care of Eloi, whose father is, on the whole, correct about the worth of the affair to his son. I read the book because Aciman was once an Alexandrian, as I am at present, but his writing is so beautiful that I will now search out his other books."
"This novel was absolutely fantastic. Like a lot of people recently, I imagine, I only knew about it because of the movie, which was also excellent, and which turned out to be very faithful to the novel. Some of the major differences are that in the novel we can actually hear Elio’s constantly running thoughts, and the two main characters’ relationship is more explicitly described. I devoured this novel in a day and definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys well written epic romances. I think it is better than Andre Aciman’s more recent novel Enigma Variations, although I also enjoyed that one. I look forward to rereading it many times in the future."
"Having seen the film first, I had concerns--some of the characters' actions didn't make sense, but the book provides more context to the relationships. My biggest problem: the writing itself--tortured speculation, agonized question after question--which I can understand given it's written from the perspective of an inexperienced and insecure teenage narrator--but at times went too far. Most sensitive, talented teens recognize when an attraction is primarily physical and if mutual love evolves, as it does here, don't continue torturing themselves with constant doubts even after connecting, but live in the moment with joy. Some seriously overwrought language here, with way more back and forth on the narrator's part than seems believable."
"I admit, it took me 3 tries to read this book- solely because I was not very familiar with the writing style. (I just recently began to read for entertainment, since nothing on social media appeals me) I got through 30 pages the first time I tried to read it but I suddenly stopped because I realized that all the words that I was reading was going in one ear and coming out the other. I didn’t want to give up on the book yet so I bought the audiobook and got through an hour of it. However, it was practically useless. I don’t know if it’s my short attention span or what but I found my self not really listening and when I did listen and focus on what was being read, I couldn’t add anything up.! So I took a two day break, and that was absolutely worth it!!!When I finally tried it the 3rd time, I was determined to finish the novel. The first part of the book were choppy, since it’s told as distant memories. It jumped back and forth from his more recent memories and to his older memories. I got confused at times but it wasn’t hard to put two and two together.I found myself falling in love with the characters and the writing style, which totally came to me as a surprise because I absolutely dreaded it in the beginning. ITS DEFINITELY ONE OF MY FAVORITE WRITING STYLES NOW. Aciman has a way of vividly showing you exactly how Elio was feeling and his thoughts.I don’t want to spoil anything so let me just say one more thing, the ending is absolutely heart wrenching. I found myself crying so much, and feeling for both Elio and Oliver. IF YOU’VE WATCHED THE MOVIE - READ THE BOOK LET ME TELL U, THE END IS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE BOOK!Call Me By Your Name is easily one of the best love stories ever written. I can’t wait to reread it and bring back all the memories and feelings I felt when I first read it. Even if you don’t get the writing style very well, push through it. It’s a must and if there one book you need to read in your life time, it’s this one. Totally tragic and beautiful."
"“Call Me By Your Name” will wreck you. Let it. It sweeps you away, seduces you, inevitably breaks you, and puts you back together again.The themes of first love, friendship, family, identity, obsession, shame, acceptance, and unconditional love are palpable and nuanced throughout the book. They validate the human experience in subtle and colorful ways.Aciman is a master of human psychology, articulating our torturous internal- monologues when faced with obsessive desire. He perfectly captures the tap dance of neurotic self-doubt, while elevating the courageous and sometimes crazy things we do in the pursuit of loveHumans can be brutally unkind, and savagely cruel, especially to ourselves. It’s hard being human. But no matter who you are, no matter who you love, at it’s core, “Call Me By Your Name” highlights the grace and liberation in discovering acceptance, safety, and unconditional love, from our loved ones. Especially when we struggle to, and even sabotage, loving ourselves.“Is it better to speak or die?”“If not later, when?”“We had found the stars, you and I. And this is given once only.”"
A superbly perfect array of charming characters in a fantastic setting. The love and admiration between generations is touching and the attraction between the visiting research & writing professor and the adored grandson is simply beautiful - their 7 year difference in ages vanishes into nothingness because ….. love is love..
"I do not do much reading but this caught my interest.  It is a very unusual story about mis-interpretation, desire and timelessness as opposed to the typical love story about boy meets girl, argue, make up and lives happily ever after.  Call Me By You Name is without any doubt a classic masterpiece. I will not summarize the story here which is told byElio as a memory or a dream from the distant past. Call Me By Your Name is an extremely intense roller coaster of emotions. It answers the question, ""Can true love last forever?"" I would rate it at least a 20 out of 5 starts.  If you saw the movie and liked it, then you have to read the book."
"Beautifully written.  Particularly appreciated the narrative voice--a thoughtful mature adult vividly recalling and recounting perhaps the most important summer of his youth and reflecting on the meaning of a passionate romance from that vantage point.  The movie, however well made it is as a film, cannot provide the book's access to the inner life and thinking as well as the emotional turmoil and the  intense passion of the central character/narrator.  Of course I AM looking forward to seeing the film for it's visual beauty and storytelling of a different kind, and I am confident the director will enthrall me with this just as much as he has in previous films.  Yet,  that said, I strongly recommend people read the novel for a more richly layered and nuanced portrait of Elio, a deeper probing of his psyche, and his wide-ranging meditation about a host of engaging topics."
"I often gasped at the insight into moments which seemed to be my moments at a previous time, or perhaps a conglomaration of swaths of time with perhaps a few people, not only one. But what a genius way of telling so thoroughly what truths live so commonly, yet are never spoken of or acknowledged by, I don't know - culture, society, novels, plays, movies or even to an extent, my precious few precious loves? But especially that one most precious love. Achingly beautiful and magnificent!! Would I begin it again, hell yeah!"

Call Me by Your Name: A Novel









  
  
    
  Can you ever recall a love that pierced your heart and confounded your senses? This is one of them. Slowly unfolding inpage after page of carefully plotted entrapment for the reader as well as for the couple at the center of it all.  Andre Acimanhas created a rare and deeply moving story of love without regret - a sensuous and lyrical piece that will live within you longafter the book has been closed."
"Not just perfect LGBT-themed book, perfect book, period!  Characters are so well-written that one can't help but identify with them right from page one.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that this book was a  moving, emotionally packed experience.  I was literally on the verge of tears a number of times! No wonder a movie is being made of it.  I highly doubt it'll be as good, but I'll see it anyway, just so I can re-experience  story on screen.  Do yourself a favor and buy this book now."
"This book in incredibly, beautifully written and encapsulates the raw emotions associated with lust and love without ever using those words. It's poetic. It's mesmerizing. Before you know it, you will be finished with the book because you simply cannot put it down. And what's better that falling in love in when you have a story set in the romanticized, historic Italy?! I hope you enjoy this book and fall in love with love by embracing the feeling(s) you maybe have never been able to convey/share or even feel. André Aciman is one of the most brilliant writers I've ever come across and this has become one of my favorite reads of all time."
"A gem. If you’ve ever loved and lost, this embodies those memories like a ship in a bottle, laden with memories and longing. One of the sexiest books I’ve read in a long time. Maybe ever. An instant favorite. Beautifully written. Timeless. Can’t wait to see the film."
"A master work of poetic prose. An intimate look into the mind, heart, soul and spirit of a young man in love. A great romantic love story. A beautiful glimpse of Italy. Written by Andre Aciman, born in Egypt and now a professor of literary theory at New York University. The movie of the same name is great but of course it cannot compete with this outstanding literary accomplishment. This book won the Lambda award for gay fiction in 2007."
References were tricky to get as it was a very cerebral book of much literary content.Sweet and very layered story.The movie on this one might be  better than the book.  Actually looking forward to the movie.Worth a read though.
"Call Me by Your Name is story-telling at it's finest!This miracle of a novel precisely captures the nostalgic feeling of first heartache, a romantic, senual, itallian summer and ultimately, what it feels and means to fall in love.Aciman's way of writing captures the ingenuity of being young and wanting something more than anything else in the world and going back in that point of our lives where we felt most ourselves.Elio and Oliver's story will go down in history as the greatest impossible love to ever be in literature since Romeo and Juliet's.My heart was shattered after I read the last lines of the book and begged to put an end to the suffering I felt for Elio and Oliver. I wanted more for them. They deserved a better ending than that.Poetic and bittersweet, and very real and raw!Now thankfully, after 12 years their story continues with FIND ME.I'm definitely gonna be one if the first thousand readers to read it on October 28!I was looking for this book since August 2017 and I was so ecstatic to find it on Amazon!After 2 years of looking through bookstores I finally purchased a personal copy!And it was amazing!Get yours now!"
I heard of this book via film I never saw. Reading this brought me to tears as I remembered my first love and how we capered about without letting others in on our love and the encounters we had behind closed doors. My heart broke for Elio having been in his shoes. Shoes that never fit just right after the summer ended. How it all started with a hand carelessly or carefully placed on my knee that night that started a fire that one day just died. The memory I will always have and the wondering of how life would have been different if times had been different.
"Andre Aciman has written a story that brings in complex feelings and emotions among its many characters, particularly the primary ones - Elio and Oliver. The narrative by Elio offers a window into how he goes from being a boy to a man, while still not forgetting the boy. Anyone that has loved, particularly that has loved and lost, is likely to relate to the emotions that the story evokes.The book feels slow and meandering (particularly part 3, San Clemente Syndrome) more than a few times (many of the 1 star reviews are based solely on this) and there are a couple of over-the-top (and perhaps unnecessary) kinky incidents, but when you remember it's a narrative by Elio you will probably excuse the pace and the kink. The best part of the book, quite surprisingly, was the last (part 4 - Ghost Spots). The last 37 pages bring some sense of closure, but also raise the inevitable question of how people could have chosen different paths in the fork of life and ended up in different places. If, by the end of the book, it hasn't made you think, it's likely you didn't put as much into reading the book as it deserved. If it didn't leave you with some nostalgia you probably didn't immerse yourself in the characters as you should have.While a work of fiction, it has a sense of realism that should appeal to many readers. This is not a literary masterpiece. It is a love story written in a certain style, time, and place. So if you're looking for a literary masterpiece you should probably pass this one and spare yourself some disappointment. Also, if you like a fast paced book that gets to the point quicker, this is not that book. And finally, if you are going to be offended by a couple of the kinky references you should stay away. I have taken one star off for all these reasons.P.S:  I have not watched the movie based on this novel, but wanted to read the book first. I will also acknowledge I rarely get to read fiction and would not have heard of (or read) this book if it weren't for the publicity surrounding the movie.Update 1/13/17: I re-read some parts of the last part, and ended up upgrading my rating from 4 to 5 stars. Also, I watched the movie. It's extremely well made, but the ending is different from the book. Also, due to the limited length of the movie it doesn't have the riche detail of the book. I certainly recommend watching the movie. And if you haven't read the book, I'd recommend you read it before watching the movie."
"This is one of the most heartwrenching, heartwarming, and mind bogglingly good novels that I have ever read! It is so masterfully crafted that you will be transported to the setting of this beautiful book. You'll fall in love, you'll cry, and it will all be with it in the end!"
"I absolutely fell in LOVE with this movie. The acting was outstanding so after getting totally lost in this movie decided to read the book. I am very happy that I watched the Movie first. Its a rare occasion that you should probably see the movie first and read the book after. The Movie is not as graphic or detailed as the book and there are parts in the movie where reading the book after clears up any confusion. There are only a few things in the book I didn't like such as one part involving a toilet situation which I really wish they had left out, and certain parts seemed to drag on a bit.  But ultimately its a good read IF you have seen or plan on seeing the movie."
"I have just finished this book and I can genuinely say that it is one of my all time favorites which says a lot since I am a prolific reader. This author is a wonderful stylist with uncanny insights into the gay experience. This is somewhat surprising since I assume he is heterosexual.  The bio indicates that he has a wife. His profound contribution, I think, is to memorialize that magical moment in one’s life that can never be forgotten or recaptured and how it lingers as a bittersweet reminder of what could have been. For me, his best writing is the final chapter and, especially, the final sentence. I loved the book and highly recommend it."
"As an avid reader, I cannot believe it took me so long to get to this book, but I'm so grateful I did. Aciman does an impeccable job of combining sensuality, love, culture, family, and acceptance into a beautiful story in this novel. With intense writing and detail, Aciman chronicles the story of Elio and Oliver as if it is truly his story to tell. You feel captivated by the language, setting and pure, intense, love beween the two main characters. I feel reviews shouldn't spoil, so I will let you experience the beauty and pain of this story yourself.If you are questioning this book, get it! This story of passionate love and heartbreak has it all. The intense tale of Elio and Oliver will have you dreaming of summers in Italy and apricot trees. Don't miss it!"
"Everything about this book resonated with my life. I cried so much as I was able to become Elio through the reading and fall in love with Oliver. It brought memories of my own past ""Olivers"" and the regrets I now feel for such unfulfilled loving relationships that never came to be because of how life's plans dragged me into a different path. I  am a 28 year old gay man that identifies so much with Elio and the conversantion he had with his father will forever reside in my mind and heart. I treasure this book with all my heart."
"Spoilery""Twenty years was yesterday, and yesterday was just earlier this morning, and morning seemed light years away.""Call Me By Your Name is a superlative novel that meticulously and comprehensively looks at the human condition from the folly of youth to the introspective later years. Told almost entirely from the stream of consciousness mind of a seventeen year old Elio, who simultaneously possesses intelligence beyond his years whilst embodying the insouciance of youth and trafficking in the same inane fickleness of the average teen in matters of the heart, and in him Aciman’s crafted a character that is quintessentially relatable.I was immediately transported back to my own teenage years. I remember being that person, though Elio is leaps and bounds more intelligent at seventeen than I could ever hope to be then or now. The profundity of his insights are staggering and keenly observant. But the games are the same, the angst the same, the intensity the same and, most importantly, the devotion the same.""There is a law somewhere that says that when one person is thoroughly smitten with the other, the other must unavoidably be smitten as well. […] Love, which exempts no one who’s loved from loving, Francesca’s words in the Inferno. Just wait and be hopeful. I was hopeful, though perhaps this was what I had wanted all along. To wait forever.""First loves are oftentimes the hardest to let go of; they leave an indelible mark. For Elio, Oliver is that person. Oliver, the doctoral student who came to stay with him and his parents one summer in Italy, left a watermark on Elio’s soul. Six unforgettable weeks and an intimacy forged that some have no hope of ever attaining. They lived. They loved. They became a part of each other.People talk about the “simplicity” of youth but to my mind it was never simple. Elio has never been in love before and when you don’t know a thing it’s hard to know what to do with it, how to care for it, how to keep it. At seventeen he can’t possibly understand the rarity of his connection with Oliver, so he tells himself there will be another and there are, that it was never intended to last and maybe it wasn't, that is was a summer fling, but who's to say that makes it any less seminal?That’s what Aciman has done so masterfully with this novel; is it or isn’t it? Aciman has crafted his own Mona Lisa with Elio.""All that remains is dreammaking and strange remembrance.""Life goes on, people drift in and out of our lives; some leave a lasting impression while others are evanescent. Oliver left a space to be certain, but Elio left one too and maybe those spaces are capricious depending on time and space.""-how we move through time, how time moves through us, how we change and keep changing and come back to the same.""The ebbs and flows of life transmogrify memories; make them sharper at times and less so at others, depending on where one is in life. Again, I think this is the genius of this novel: it’s not a singular experience. I’ve no doubt if I reread it in 5 or 10 yrs I’ll have a different interpretation; a change in perspective and the whole thing looks completely different and I feel like the same can be said of Elio. Will it always come back to Oliver or is that they’re in the same place where so much occurred twenty years ago? That place that meant so much from the berm to Mafalda and his parents to the bookstore to playing the guitar to paradise to afternoon naps and lazy days and nights spent f***ing each other’s brains out. Is it so much Oliver or it is the desire to recapture that place, that time? The romantic in me wants to wallow in the heartbreak and vilify Aciman for countermanding the rules of romancelandia, but to simplify this novel in such a way, to make it solely about loss is a disservice to the narrative. It’s more than that.""Time makes us sentimental. Perhaps, in the end, it is because of time that we suffer.""The complexities of Call Me By Your Name left me feeling mawkish, clearly, but it also made me contemplative. Maybe I missed the point and it is solely a novel of love and loss with the primary objective being bittersweet heartbreak, but I choose to believe (this time) that Aciman deliberately penned a novel to make every reader take stock and cherish what they have, what they have had and what they will have. There aren’t very many novels I can say the same about."
"I read this in one night, and I loved it. Then, I read it again, slowly, over the next week. This is the most brilliant piece of writing. It's worth every second of time you will put into it.For those who are reading this because of the movie, understand that they are like fraternal twins. The two are similar in shape and structure, but different in many ways. I personally like the book better- you understand the ""why"" behind their relationship a lot better, and you get a lot more of the emotion between the ""call me by your name"" theme"
"As all the other reviews say, beautiful and sad at the same time. Amazing capture of the ambivalence of youthful infatuation, the adult realisation that it was so much more. The film was amazing, but I think the way the book goes further in time completes it more perfectly. In the film we don't really know how this summer has affected Elio, but in the book we gain that knowledge. Cannot recommend highly enough."
"After watching the movie, I was compelled to read the novel. Let me tell you, I read a lot of books. From auto-biogrphies to young adult fiction to cult classics, I've read it all. This is the one book that I have not been able to let go of.I finished it in a day. Started reading at 9 am, didn't put it down until much later into the night. It left me in a state of disrepair that i'm not quite sure when I'll be able to recover from, but am so very grateful to be in. The writing style, the way it follows Elio's thoughts, they are so invoking emotionally.I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone."
"Beautiful. I'm not that much if a reader, not as much to be anyway. So it says a lot for a book, a story, for a journey when it refuses to let me go or when I refuse to put it down until daylight breaks the following day. Call Me by Your Name is a wonderful story. Be prepared to get attached to characters as if you were there yourself. Be prepared to relive some of your own memories of your first love.Its never a bad thing, but when I put the book down after finishing (not for the last time perhaps?) It left me feeling sad, incomplete as if I wanted and needed more. I fell in love with Oliver and Elio. Kudos to you André Aciman. Later!"
"When I saw the film in College it changed my life. When I read the book it changed my life, again. When I found out ARMIE HAMMER recorded the audio book? I immediately got it. Yes, it changed my life, again. It showed me the story in an entirely new perspective. Hearing the voices come to life, directly form the page, made me get misty eyed multiple times."
This is the Gay Romance novel and Bildungsroman that I should have had as a teenager.  I've been waiting thirty-five years to read a book like this.
"I actually saw the movie before I purchased and read the book, because I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Despite knowing how the story unfolds, I still loved the book. The author has a magnificent writing style, the characters were fully developed and likable and the story authentic. Perfect coming of age love story.I also appreciated the ending of the book, which was different from the ending in the movie. The book's ending gave me closure."
"Oh my, what to say, what to say...Call Me by Your Name was enchanting and enthralling in every possible way. Written in a stream of conscious style, 17 year old Elio pulls the reader into his world and brings them along for every thought, every moment, every impulse that passes through his mind. It's an intimate, sometimes awkward ride, but you can't help but connect with Elio's exasperated attempts to make sense of himself and his emotions as he navigates a tricky relationship.There are hundreds of things that make this story worth consuming, but I'll start with what has stuck with me the most: the atmosphere. Elio's family owns an Italian villa in the small town of B and the European, lazy summertime environment leaks from every page. From incessant cigarette consumption to hours spent reading by the pool and taking trips to swim and traveling to bookshops in town, Elio's romantic endeavors are paralleled perfectly by his romantic environment. I'll be honest, I'm writing this review after also having seen the movie and then immediately preceding to read the book for a second time, so perhaps the images from the book and film are intertwining in my mind, though flipping back through the pages, I find lines on every page that just ooze sexual tension and summer heat.Elio's thoughts are confused and honest, fully encompassing the battle between his emotional and intellectual hemispheres. He's impulsive but reflective, somewhat timid in nature but tends to be forward in his speech. Dialogue is woven into thought, Elio's fantasies feel as real as his physical connections and every emotion he describes feels open and true. No complications in Oliver and Elio's relationship are glossed over and every moment of doubt and discomfort is identified and analyzed. I guess if there's one thing about this narrative that feels unique in comparison to most romantic books I've read, it's the unwavering honesty on every page.I will admit, this read is intense and at times uncomfortable (I can think of one or two now infamous scenes in particular) but there are moments in this book that took my breath away. The novel's third part was by far my favorite as it shows Oliver and Elio at their brightest, clad in love and acceptance among Rome's beautiful backdrop and it's definitely a section I appreciated more the second time through knowing the pains of the final act to follow.Overall, there is so much I could say about this book; the story hasn't left my mind at all these last few weeks. I'm encouraging everyone I know to dive headfirst into this beautiful story whatever order they wish to consume it. (I recommend 1. soundtrack, 2. book, 3. film). This is a book I'm sure I'll be picking up again this Summer, though unfortunately, not in Italy :((4.75/5 stars)"
"Truly one of the best and most hypnotic novels I have ever read. Relatable on so many levels and taps into your heart and spirit in a mesmerizing way. The motion picture is an adaptation of this amazing book and I highly recommend both. If you see the movie only, you will definitely want to read the book as it delves into scenes and paints a broader picture that you might miss while viewing. I do not hesitate to give this an A+ rating for it is beyond wonderful."
This just snuck right up on me and punched me in my stupid face with its beauty. I am ruined.
"This book will touch your heart and remind you of your first love, your best love, your biggest regret, the things you can't live without, and it will do all of that with such beautiful prose you'll find yourself re-reading entire passages as soon as you've read them the first time. The world in this writing is so rich, I felt like I could breathe the summer air in Italy, feel the wind on my face, and taste the apricots (hehe). A truly gorgeous book."
"A brilliantly written ""pure"" love story that unfolds over a few weeks during a sun-drenched Italian summer and then echoes strongly still in the hearts of the lovers twenty years later.  Narrating the memories of a seventeen year old, Aciman captures the uncertainty of youth coming-to-terms with sexuality, and life itself, with amazing skill, wisdom and depth of knowledge.  Although this has been categorized as ""gay"" fiction by many, as a straight male I found it to reflect the universality of first love without regard to preference, reminding me of my own first love and the emotions that came and went as it developed and eventually evaporated."
I haven’t seen the movie but the book is okay. I feel like it finally gets good the last third (it’s completely enchanting when the author talks about the characters the location and everything) but leading up to it is a lot of story building which I personally don’t have two thirds patience for. I don’t regret buying but I won’t read it again and I wouldn’t rank it in my favorites.
"I just want to say, this book is so amazing. Personally, I read the book after watching the movie and so many things were left out of the movie. The book goes into Elio’s thoughts and intentions, different events that happened, and even an extra character that was not included in the movie! I was able to finish this book in about 3-4 days and let me tell you I wish it never ended! Totally recommend if you have watched the movie and even if you haven’t and just want to read a book about true connection, obsession, and genuine teenage thoughts."
"No matter what the readers sexual inclinations are, this novel (more a poem than a novel) is an emotional journey. I haven't seen the movie and am loath to do so as the book left me speechless.The  reader can feel the Italian Riviera, its beauty, its hazy luminescence, its sunfilled days. Never have I read a more accurate description.A wonderful story."
Andre Aciman has written such beautiful prose in this novel.  I highlighted quite a few passages to return to when the mood strikes.  Anyone who has had a transformative love affair that lasts for decades will relate to the narrator.  This is a beautiful love story.  I doubt I will see the movie.  I simply cannot understand how the story could be told in another medium.
"The author made me feel like I had a front row seat to the lives of these 2 people. A front row seat to 2 people falling in love - and that entails ...the sweet and doubtful moments we had falling in love. Love the way the author describes the scenery -  makes me want to book tickets to Italy ASAP!  I am so thankful I read this book , as I hesitated first, not knowing if I could relate to a love story about  2 young men falling in love -however it so exceeded my expectations, as it was just 2 souls who found each other. I promised myself I would find and read a book I could enjoy, even if I was not on vacation, sitting by the ocean. I found just the right book! I was whisked away to Italy and  thrust willingly into this love story.  I also like an intelligent read- where there are words I don't know. I pride myself on my vocabulary, and when I can find a book that challenges my vocabulary, giving me words that so aptly describe just the right mood, scenery... It makes me feel like I found a treasure. Thank you to the author! Cannot wait to read more of his books!"
The writing here is so sublime. Not the writing quality you expect in a story like this. Enthralled the whole way through the book even the second time. It just gets better.
"I liked this book and it was maddening.  It was about obsession, teenage obsession, wanting what you want to the exclusion of everything else, than getting it and pushing it away, while still wanting it. It made you feel sorry for Oliver, trying to make everyone else happy, and meeting everyone else's expectations, while having so few of his own met. It was a trip back to being a teenager and feeling everything so intently while having so little grasp of what was really important, or anything at all that exists outside of yourself. Even genius children can be idiots."
"This book is both beautifully written and tortuous to read. Elio lives entirely in his own mind, completely self-absorbed and endlessly dissecting everything that happens (or does not happen) to him, to the point where I was skipping whole pages because he just became so tiresome. But after finally ploughing through the book, I found myself haunted for days by his story. Elio reminds all of us of the intensity of youthful passion and the melancholy of trying to piece together a life after first love. This is not a book I would read again, but I won’t need to because I will certainly never forget it."
"Call Me by Your Name, the book and the movie are both astounding. Elio brings us along his nuanced internal journey of both fighting and understanding his desires, ultimately becoming one with Oliver.In the movie, I’m amazed that Thimothee Chalamet was able to evoke the complexities in Elio’s mind to his performance. James Ivory’s Oscar is well deserved.While the movie leaves us with the aching sorrow of Oliver’s departure, the book follows 1-15-20 years later, basically reflecting in my mind, that although they’ve lived different parallel lives, they both still share their deep intimate connection."
"I wish there'd been a book like this when I was 17 and not understanding my feelings.  This book would be helpful to any high school senior that might be unsure or questioning, and is willing to turn off their smartphone and be immersed in this great writing style.  But no matter one's age, the book has many worthy ideas about life and loves, and about family and friends, art and literature.  I really couldn't put it down.  It was a book I woke up early just to finish because I couldn't stay awake until dawn  like Oliver and Elio could.  :-)--i- ---t--- --t- ---i- ----t- ----i-- -------I tried a separate review of my recent audiobook purchase  but the Site wouldn't post it and couldn't tell me why, just forwarded their guidelines to me.  So I'll try here to see if this is satisfactory.I wasn't sure if A.H was the correct choice to read the audiobook, yet I wanted to have it so went ahead and ordered it  I am nearly done with a 2nd listen and can say that he is simply outstanding.  Plus I learned there is something about hearing the words that helps put together pieces that I may have not understood to the extent Aciman intended.  After all, it is quite a dense, exquisite, and complicated story about and narrated by this complicated young man Elio.  I suppose one might give this as a Christmas gift to some of your more discerning friends or family members, if they are willing to hear this kind of honesty concerning bisexuality, and love between two young men."
"Saw movie first. Doesn't follow book. Book explains via first person narration of Elio that he pursues his initial gay sexual relationship with Oliver. The Call Me by Your Name, name reversal behavior they adopt during the affair is so genius. It solidifies their interdependencies and identification with each other that lasts through the years. It was highlighted in the movie more than the book. It creates the bond between these guys. They never speak of love but it is so evident. Both movie and book is Kleenex time. The fantasies and sexual behavior of Elio made me laugh, I'm seventy yrs old  reading about a hormonal kid was a scream. Can't wait for sequel."
"I'll start by saying, I loved reading this story. Knowing the outcome doesn't stop you from falling completely into the story.. The over all feeling of the story was enchanting, loving & filled with longing. I absolutely loved reading and falling unmistakably in love with Oliver as Elio does. Elio captures what it is to be young and awakened by love. The inner dialogue makes this story come alive and put real weight into it. The story leaves you haunted with the memory of their love."
"I loved the vivid settings, the character development, the inner thoughts of the protagonist, and the evocative sense of the Italian weather in Summer.  All of this worked to provide the backdrop for such a good story.  Other books that have earned four stars from me can't come close.  I was saving the five stars for something really special.  Now I wish there would have been a whole other category to illustrate how much I loved this book."
"From the moment you begin you are taken on quite a journey that is sweet, funny and very endearing because you don't want it to end. Elio and Oliver really pull you in because they are two captivating men who led you enthralled from beginning to end, it is hard t read this book an not cry at certain moments and smile shyly at others,  I look forward to reading this book for Years to come:)"
A romantic coming of age love story of young precocious man who initially dislikes a handsome somewhat older grad student who visits an Italian villa in early eighties then comes to idolize the stranger and falls rapturously in love with him; heavy duty sex ensues  secretly and very romantically in detail to my immense pleasure. And your's also I bet.. Made into a great movie.Tim Chalamet and Armie Hammer. Understand?
"I watched the movie version of this book first, and I absolutely LOVED it. I decided to read the book as well, and now, I’m wrecked. I can honestly say that, to me, the movie is an excellent distillation of the book. The casting couldn’t have been better with Timothée and Armie, and their chemistry is out of this world. All this to say that this is an unusual marriage of Call Me By Your Name film and book that works harmoniously and beautifully together, at least for me.Having started with the gorgeous movie, I clearly had the idyllic scenes in mind of northern Italy, and of Elio & Oliver, PERFECTLY embodied in Timothée and Armie. The movie allows their relationship to unfold organically, and the book serves to fill in a few little blanks for me, not that they needed to be filled after the movie, but it is the source material, after all. The monologue by Mr Perlman in the movie moved me to tears (beautifully done by Michael Stuhlbarg), and the book carries the story 20 years further than the movie does, the main reason I’d wanted to read it.SPOILERS AHEAD... Seriously don’t read further if you don’t want them.I feel a little devastated by it, to be honest. I’m so used to HEAs in fiction (not necessarily “literary” ones, mind you), that I was hoping against hope that these two beautiful men would find their’s by the end of the book, since the movie left me a little heartbroken and maybe sobbing a little bit (but you’ve got to see the movie- it’s so wonderfully done). What I find instead is that they’ve lived their “parallel” lives these past 20 years (from the end point of the movie), keeping tabs on each other, never forgetting, but perhaps living in a coma. Their lives converge sparingly over these years, too painful for Elio to watch Oliver’s other life. He still hasn’t met Oliver’s wife and 2 sons, and will not, because then Oliver’s other life would all be too real. I broke down when Elio tells Oliver that he doesn’t want to find out that Oliver had died via a letter from his son along with a return of the postcard that Oliver had taken from Elio’s room of Monet’s berm (their special place). The only person Elio wants to see when he dies is Oliver. Not sure where my heart is since it’s been ripped out.Please, PLEASE, Luca (the director), IF you do indeed film a sequel to the movie, covering the rest of the book that the movie didn’t, please carry the movie further than even the book had, and for the love of God, please give Elio and Oliver their HEA. I don’t think I could bear anything less. I would wait as long as you needed to make this happen, but please allow Elio to call Oliver by his name, and Oliver Elio’s. I don’t think I could watch anything less."
"Without a doubt, one of the best books I have ever read. It hits with a punch. It is sexy, funny, sad, shocking and so very memorable. I read it slowly, because I did not want it to end.  If you do not cry at the end of this book, you have no heart.  Totally Wonderful. I cannot wait for the movie."
"this book broke me, fixed me, and then broke me again. i love how vulnerable this story is in the movie and in the book. i watched the movie before i read the book and to my surprise the movie didn’t quite spoil the book too much. i mean of course there are a lot of similarities because it’s the same stories but the movie didn’t make the reading experience any different. i love this love story with my entire heart and if you haven’t seen the movie or read the book before…brace yourself. it’s heartbreaking."
"I decided to read this book before I saw the movie, and I'm thrilled that I did. The book is powerful and goes into much deeper portrayal of the young Elio's feelings for the older student Oliver. The book's ending is different from the movie's and much more satisfying, even though it made me cry. I've found the books are always much better than the movie versions anyway."
I have never been much of a reader so I was told I should try an Audible and started with this book.  Wow!  What a wonderful journey and beautifully written.  I was quite moved by the story and characters and locations.  The biggest compliment I can give it is that it makes me want to listen and/or read more!  I found myself thinking about the book long after I had finished reading it.
"I read this book before the movie came out (because I'd heard about the film), and I absolutely loved it. Incredibly lush, sensual, thoughtful writing throughout, and genuinely every bit as glorious as the movie that came later. I don't think I could compare the two mediums, actually, because each one is a bright sun unto itself. Cannot recommend the book highly enough! Really superb from start to finish!"
"no other romance i've read compares. as elio and oliver become each other we begin to become them too. every coy movement, lingering touch, moment of anticipation, and coded expression of heartache and intimacy feel like a punch in the gut or a fluttering in your chest. you feel everything as they do, and even the quieter moments of stagnation or pain - which would seem unbearable to us in any other love story - feel beautiful and earned when recounted by aciman's elio.a startling triumph of iintimacy, emphany, eroticism, and acceptance. not to be missed, and a great companiom to the film."
"Oh, this book is so lush in descriptions - you feel you are Elio feeling everything. The feeling of first love. The fear of rejection, the elation of mutual admiration, and the pain of knowing already how first love will end. But the slow burn to get there is so worth it. This book is beautiful and relatable to anyone who knows the joy and pain of first love. And knowing this first love will somehow always linger and interweave itself through our lives."
Read this because I enjoyed the movie. The book is significantly better! A beautiful love story that I found myself jealous of constantly. Beautiful writing and enjoyable to read.
"This book was amazing. André Aciman did a wonderful job capturing the emotions between Elio & Oliver. Maybe it was just me but I could actually feel the emotions - Elio & Oliver’s angst on how each felt for one another, their passion, the sex, Elio’s emotions later in the book. The Rome scene was probably my favorite part of the book. I won’t spoil any of the story but such an great story line between the two characters. I was glad that I read the book first before seeing the movie. Although A great movie, the book is so much better in providing in feelings of all the book’s characters especially Elio & Oliver.  I highly recommend reading this book."
"What stands out in this very popular novel is the resentment, the sense of anger and withheld emotions in Aciman's narrator's obsessive thoughts about his maddening crush on Oliver, who at first seems to barely notice him.Pretty much everyone I know has or will see the film adaptation, and while this is not a film review, and I'm not going to deconstruct the clearly bisexual aspects of this therefore not-exactly-gay story, which have been written about extensively in many publications and websites, what lacks in the film's artistic and simply dramatized scenes are the ruminative angst-ridden and Proustian inner thoughts of our young narrator. But you know that."
Most beautiful sensual heartbreak I’ve had the pleasure of reading. LOVE LOVEE LOVEEE the movie and the book even more. André truly has outdone himself with this book. I’ve felt like I was back in Italy with Elio experiencing his first love and heart break. I loved it so much not only because of the love story but because of how much I related with Elio throughout the book. I’ve looked at my first love the way Elio looked at Oliver from a far. I couldn’t put it into words but Aciman did and it’s absolutely beautiful. I legit cried at the end but it didn’t outweigh the moments where my heart and soul was filled with joy and happiness and don’t even get me started on the speech Mr. Perlman gave at the end. It truly has changed me and my day to day life. I would definitely recommend this book to others. Try it you won’t regret it
"Anyone who has ever been young and impetuous cannot help but be moved by this beautiful, lyrical coming of age novel. To say it's a love story is to understate its humanity. I read it in one sitting, because it was impossible to put down. Even though the protagonist Elio's life couldn't be more different from my own, as I read I found myself remembering my own youth with the same longing that infuses every sentence of the novel. Deeply romantic, deeply artful, literary without being pretentious, intellectual without being dry, full of life and vigor, one of the best books I've read in a long time."
"This unique love story has made realize that love is love and to wonder why we fear two men falling in love.  Elio never seemed to get over Oliver, but Oliver did what was expected of him by his family and society.  The screenwriter was very true to the novel."
"A beautifully written book about a young man's infatuation with another man, set in Italy. It is written as an older man reminiscing about his first love when he was seventeen. All the insecurities that a young man might have regarding his sexuality and his yearning to be loved by the target of his affections is beautifully described in acute detail. Whether his love is reciprocated  is one for the reader to discover. The thrill and tension of young love is almost palpable by the reader in this bitter sweet love story."
"Beautiful book about the roller coaster feelings of first love and first heart break. The book explains some background that the movie only lightly touches on to help you better understand Elio’s POV. I’ve watched the movie 4 times & read the book in the last 4 days. It’s not just a LGBTQ movie & book, it’s one of the most beautiful love stories I’ve ever read &/or seen."
"This book is so much different than I imagined that it would be! I picked it up in Walmart a few months ago and then placed it back from lack of funds, but then I saw it on Amazon a few weeks later and knew I couldn’t pass it up! It has a different way of writing than I had expected. It tells a story in past tense, but it’s still a very good read, even when it can be hard to understand. Isn’t that what makes most books great? Having to think about them even when you aren’t reading them?It came as promised in a new little fashion. No bends or anything from the packaging! I loved it. It made me really happy."
I actually watched the movie before reading this book.  I think it is a beautiful story of love and loss.  I found I would sometimes lose track in Elios' thoughts and reality.  But the book has such an overwhelming sense of the inner dialogue of a person discovering his or herself. It touched my heart in so many ways.  Very well done and the movie did it justice.  Everyone involved with this book and production should be very proud to bring to life such a moving work.  Thank you Andre Aciman!
"I bought this after watching the movie as I was very touched and felt quite deeply the emotions portrayed (love the film), but as almost always, the book was definitely better. It felt more raw and the description of love, emotions and thoughts hit me at a deeper level through the book."
"The writing is beautiful, however, I found myself rereading parts because I had lost the thread. Found myself experiencing the color and the heat of Italy. Aciman drew his characters with a fine point pen. I grew very fond of Elio's dad. I wound recommend this to anyone with an appreciation for coming of age stories and the ache of love that must only shine in shadows."
"Love the story. Thought it might be something I really disliked, but took a chance. Could get wordy at times, but still well written. Its not a happy story but I would recommend it. Want to see film now."
"*If you can still somehow swing it, I suggest first the audiobook, then the movie, then the book.*Call Me By Your Name is an incredibly beautiful, soulful, and honest look at love and discovering who you are. The writing is sumptuous; every word carries with it a feeling. I'll never use the word ""billowy"" again without thinking of Oliver and Elio and summer in Italy 1983.I can't recommend this book, in any of its forms, enough."
"Reading this shortly after watching the film was resonating. I can't decide what I recommend first, the book or the film but definitely both. This was also the book that broke my year-long hiatus from reading (former book lover who read a new book a week). I find myself returning to these pages, searching for the quotes that keep me up at night. Powerful yet so nonchalant. A story that makes me sad but the love throughout makes me return each that."
"Book arrived fast and the book is one of the best I have read in years.  A wonderful love story.  I hope everyone reads it and then sees the movie.  I also will order from this bookseller again, they are also great.  Looking forward to reading other books by Andre' Aciman."
"All Call Me By Your Name fans of the original book (and now, 2017 movie) will LOVE this audiobook (Audible.com Release Date: October 3, 2017)!!! I re-read my original book on a recent family vacation to Maui and by the time we returned from the island, I had a whole new appreciation for reading André Aciman words so I ordered the audiobook version ♥… with everything that is happening in our country, throughout our neighborhoods, within our communities and actually, all that is going on with the entire planet, attempting to BRING PEOPLE CLOSER TO US throughout life as outlined within André Aciman words, read by Armie Hammer via the Call Me By Your Name audiobook is wonderful beyond what any words can express!!!… heck, I wanna start an internet campaign, #AudiobookGrammyForArmie!!! Armie Hammer deserves a Grammy for Best Spoken Word album for his audiobook recording of Call Me By Your Name! (or, at the very least, Armie Hammer deserves a Nomination for his for Best Spoken Word re: his audiobook performance of Call Me By Your Name!!) ♥"
"What a wonderful read! If you loved the movie, you'll definitely enjoy the book. It's a great complement, giving you even deeper insights into Elio's mind. The author does a fantastic job writing Elio's emotions, so much so that you'll know the exact feeling he's describing. 10/10 won't be able to put it down!"
I decided to read this book because I just saw the film. I am soooo glad I read it. It definitely explained certain scenes that were somewhat ambiguous in the movie as well as gave me a better idea of who the main character really is. I hate/love when books make me feel absolutely emotionally involved and this book is up there on that list. It is one of those books that I will think about for weeks and will come back and read it years later only to find that my understanding of things have changed.
"Beautiful story of a once in a lifetime first love that was short lived but the memories and it's affect lasted a lifetime.  My heart ached so much for both Elio and Oliver and I was an emotional mess afterwards.  Even though the central romance is a gay romance, the bittersweet emotions are universal to anyone who has experienced a deep but lost love.  The novel is lovely with many passages of gorgeous prose.  The film is equally beautiful and affecting, though it does lose some of the internal thoughts of Elio from the novel.  In any case, this is one of the most emotional and heart wrenching romances I've ever read, even more so than most of the ""straight"" romances I've read."
"I can't begin to say how much I love this book. I saw the movie first, and love it so much that I wanted to read the book right away. I bought the book and devoured it in less two days. It's gorgeously written and helped to explain some of Elio's motivations that I didn't fully understand in the movie. Plain and simple, this is a beautiful love story. I was so sad to be finished reading it, but know I will re-read it again soon. Thank you, Mr. Aciman for creating such a beautiful piece of art."
"This story will steal your soul and make you rethink your views on life and love. The author has written it in a way that intrigues, entices, stimulates and absorbs you. There are so many hidden depths to explore and passages that you can’t help, but read and then read again. So many passages that can be so applicable to your own life if you open your eyes and mind enough to realize."
"Luminous, swoon-worthy novel of first love and its corresponding heartbreak written in the manner of Proust. A coming-of-age masterpiece that is not to be missed. The translation into film by the Italian director Luca Guadagnino is genius. Gripping and lushly sensual, it adheres very closely to the spirit of the novel. In my opinion, enhances it. Go, nay, run -- and read it!"
"Whew! At first I was tired of the games and the constant second guessing and second guessing the second guessing of Elio. I did grow to love him as an incredibly precocious and beyond intellectually gifted 17 year old. I didn’t get truly sucked in until about half way through. I ended up realizing how much Elios trepidation was both classic teenage angst and also, and much more importantly, a thoughtful and frightening journey into homosexuality and deep love."
THE MOVIE IS BEAUTIFUL!!! and I got the book because the movie was so well done that I wanted to read the book. AND I WASNT DISAPPOINTED! Im the type to prefer watching the movie over reading the book BUT WOAH both the movie AND book are amazing!!! I recommend you watching the movie and then reading the book!!! AND THE MUSIC AAAAA 200000/10 recommend!!! and TIMMY AND ARMIE WOWOWOWOW
"This is a rare case where I liked the movie better than the book.  The read was good, but the flaw is in telling of the story in hindsight.  If a 17 year-old boy were telling the story, I would have enjoyed it, but a man approaching 40 is recounting the story.  The story is excellent, in my opinion, as it captures the sensuality and the complexity of the relationship and emotions, and it does so beautifully.  However, the narrator as an almost middle-aged man detracts from the core of the story.  Despite this, I still recommend it."
"This novel has truly taken my breath away. It has been a day since I've finished, and I am still very overcome with emotion. I have never been so moved, so in love, and so heartbroken by a piece of literature before. While it does contain a slow start, you get hooked pretty fast. I find myself getting the chills every now and then when I think about it. This book is for anyone who has ever loved - no exclusions. 10/10 recommendation."
"I watched the movie first and read the book second, which is honestly a weird thing to do. But it made me realize so many details that I did not catch after seeing the movie, as well as learning new things about the story and creating a more complete idea of the story and this world in which Elio and Oliver and Vimini and Marzia live in."
"We've all had a love like the one described in this novel. You're usually just starting to drive, or thinking about college. It's the first time eye contact with a person can make you feel cold and hot at the same time. You have a year, a season, a week together. You're so entwined with each other that no one realizes that selves don't disappear that easily unless they weren't fully formed in the first place. And twenty years later you still think about that person, no matter how many people have made you feel that way since, and you wish you had the wisdom then that you do now, and could have realized how fleeting it was. You would have taken better notes, been more honest, lingered more.Andre Aciman has bestowed this wisdom on Elio, the narrator of this novel. His memory of a summer with his houseguest Oliver is described elliptically, circling the same events but through different details, just as we do when we recall seismic life events such as these. The writing is nuanced, lush, and unabashedly romantic. A work of fiction has not made me weep in probably a decade, but Aciman's skill at depicting a teenager's overthought self-consciousness through an adult's regretful bemusement rang truer than any depiction of emotion I can remember in fiction. I read the book twice in one week and purchased the audiobook (also recommended) to listen to while driving. Quite simply one of the most humanist, gentle works I've ever read."
I don't have anything to add that hasn't already been said. A really lovely story. It's short but I tore through it in record time. I'll be thinking about this one for many days to come.
"Beautifully written book. I learned more about how men feel romantic, very different from the feeling I have always had. Having know some wonderful gay couples through my life, but have never known the degree of intimacy written in this book was quite a reverence for me. The prose was easy to read, inspiring and stimulate intellectual interests.  Having said that, it is not the type of books I would seek out."
A beautiful tale beautifully told. I challenge anyone who reads this not to have a few  grateful tears to wipe away as the story ends. It takes time and sometimes seems repetitious but enjoy the emotional  layers  that are calmly layered in this fine literary piece of work.
"Although I'm not a gay male I really enjoyed the book. Being a lesbian I had to be so careful with who I had relationship with in the 90s. My heart goes out to my fellow LGB, especially those who were before us and had to carry their love like life or death secrets. To the many out there who still have to hide.. stay strong you aren't alone. Keep fighting."
Totally unacceptable story line.  Did not read past first few pages.  Found the subject offensive.  Wish I had not wasted $10 on the Kindle Book.
"Well written, emotional, and relatable.  Loved the literary references.  Descriptive and inviting.  I would recommend this book to young and old alike. It speaks to all of us."
"I love this racy Romantic story. The plot is thin, but the tension is high from beginning to end. A masterpiece of Sehnsucht. Aciman's prose is a sort of Henry James for dummies, with the difference that in this novel there is a huge palette of tone levels and graphic details that might offend some readers. The only thing that bothered me is the frequent expressions in Italian with translation inserted immediately after. The musical references are profound though, especially the part about transcribing Haydn's Seven Last Words (a piece whose history is a history of transcription), or improvising on the piano in the style of different composers. I think the book does does something similar by transposing, improvising on Nabokov, Proust, James, or English into Italian into English."
"If you can stomach Lolita, this is for you.The constant use of second person was distracting; the narrative lofty."
"Simply the best novel depicting all the romance, passion, exhilaration and heartache of a first love. We all remember our first love, don't we? A beautiful thing for most of us. But when it ended, oy vey! Your heart broke.Well, read this terrific novel to remember. Maybe it will even help you understand. And see the even more terrific movie of 'Call Me By Your Name' to experience it first-hand in enchanted Northern Italy. A beautiful experience."
"What a book!!! Highly Recommended!Rarely is love capture in such a way that you get to feel it so deep in you. Irregardless of your gender or preference you will end up feeling something.  Aciman, was able to write a book that will take you back to your first love, first moment of enchantment, first discovery of how great is to love someone else, maybe even more than yourself. The journey of Elio and Oliver is really a journey of self discovery and romantic coming of age.  The book explores how deep can we feel and how deep can we give ourselves to someone else to the point of not knowing who is who anymore. Time plays an important role in the bookl, making the reader feel anxiety, passion, melancholy, joy, love and a desperate need to devour each page.I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
Finished the book through tears and I'm not particularly sentimental.
"It’s a good novel! I just wish the main character did not have lengthy verbose daydreams, which sometimes confuses the reader if he/she is reading aboutthe present moment or a moment being recalled."
"When first reading the book, I thought it was just everywhere. I was not sure what was going on as the transition from past to present didn't flow too well. The time line did not always match since there were plot lines that would get mentioned twice, or the author would forget that something possibly insignificant was written to later contradict herself.However, the nostalgia left by the book was overwhelming. I truly felt that I was feeling the hreatbreak myself because of the way the author wrote the book. It had so much detail that I submerged myself into it and forgot that it was justa book. I felt the pain that Elio felt. I need to reread this book soon to catch everything I missed."
"I’ve read few, if any, novels that portray a person’s thoughts and memory in such a detailed, realistic and compelling way. It is about intimacy between two humans, of course, and rightly celebrated for that, but the first-person narration puts the reader squarely inside the interior world of just one of them."
Truly enjoyed this book. Wonderfully flawed characters that will be apart me forever. Beautifully written  ❤️Thank you so much 😊
A most beautiful love story. Should see movie before reading the book. I keep thinking of the story all the time and brings back wonderful emotions.
"That is the first thought I had when reading the last word, albeit a little more colorful language. I highly recommend this book to everyone, film fans and new readers alike. Truly heartbreaking and tragic on one hand, but so understandable on the other.  First love, true love, strong love all comes together in this story and really begs the question, ""Is it better to have loved and lost, than not loved at all?"" That's up to the reader to figure out. And this book won't answer, but will make you contemplate an answer."
This was my first time reading a gay romance novel. I enjoyed it and think it’s beautifully written. It was a nice beach read.
"I am not a reviewer but I can say that book is beautifully written. The book is more of memoir, Elio telling his perspective of the events that occurred. I love how mature Elio is for his age. I have never have I cried so much while reading a book before. I listened to the audio book while reading just so I could hear Armie Hammers voice telling the story."
"Like many people, I saw the film before I read the book. (Or maybe more people read the book first?) Anyways.. I’m one of those people who can appreciate having a film as reference for specific details; in this case, visualizing Italy sets the tone for the book. I didn’t think it was possible to be more blown away than I was while watching the film but I was wrong - this book is a masterpiece. You don’t need to be a huge fan of LGBT literature to appreciate the true love between the Elio and Oliver. I will be rereading this book for years to come."
"Loved this book! Wanted to read it before I saw the movie. I couldn’t put it down! Aciman’s writing made me feel the emotions with Elio as he was feeling them, the ups and the downs. I felt slightly bereft with loss when I finished the book and am still hoping to find something similar to read just to get those feelings through a story again. And it really made me want to own a villa in Italy! Still haven’t watched the movie, I might be too scared to not like it compared to the book."
"To be able to wreak magic with words and also have unique insights into the human psyche is miraculous.  This book will tug at your heartstrings. Persevere through the first part, which can be a tough read. It will be worth it."
"I saw the film before reading the novel. I was curious to see how the story would end, but it still feels incomplete. Hopefully the sequel (which is moving forward) will give a more satisfying wrap up. Seems as if LGBTQIA stories never get a happily ever after."
I love the movie and I like the book even more. To hear Mr. Hammer read the book is so frickin' HOT!
This book was amazingly well written and a beautiful story. I read it after the movie came out and chose to see the film. I think I’m sorry I saw it. It was much better to imagine the characters in my own mind. I did not like the casting or the Americanization of the film. Read the book for the skillful and beautiful writing
"Amazing story, beautifully written with the every detail woven into every scene, i could visualize what was happening vividly and was completely into the story, some conversation are literary works of art, i love how it ended, a complete story,, I have recently seen the film, after reading the book, , , the film is nice and with good acting, but it had only bits of the story and didnt have any discription what was going on, good movie but was disappointed that it wasnt quite like the book,, like oliver's espadrilles, mentioned several times in the book,, he wore sneakers in the movie, , unfortunate,,"
Anyone who's had a life at all can totally identify with this book. It brings back memories that you buried long ago in a cathartic and reflective way. I love this book.
"This book is unlike anything I've ever read before. Told from the perspective of a young boy, it's about his summer in Italy with an older man. The author really gets you into the head of Elio and you can really feel what he's feeling. A beautiful read about life and love."

   bought this book in august after being obsessed with timothée for a few months. the movie was beautiful and i wanted to see how the book was. reading it was better than the movie in my opinion since you can let your mind wander to italy and imagine you being in their place. lovely book and i keep rereading it. here’s are pictures of the cover and the back along with a video to show that the pages are still in tact after reading a million times."
"This is an incredible book for any queer empath who struggled to come out. I felt so many of these words deep in my soul, and that’s a powerful thing to read a character so like yourself."
"An incredibly relatable story that so painstakingly and beautifully captures the gut-wrenching emotions and thoughts behind unrequited, forbidden, and young love. Regardless of gender or orientation, this story can reflect many of our own lives and experiences. And that makes it all the more engaging to read."
The movie doesn't do this book justice. It's the kind of piece that lingers with you long after the final page is read.
"Eloquent, fascinating , enchanting, the language, the descriptions. The tension, i had to use my imagination but i saw everything in vivid colour. I'll never see another peach and not be thrown back to a moment of  absolute intimacy. OMG sensual, thought provoking....... i loved it."
This book and the movie are Must Read and Must See.  The greatest love story of all time.I could go on to write 100 pages and it wouldn't be enough positive things to say.JUST BUY IT....AND THE MOVIE TOO.....**********  10 STARS....
"Call Me By Your Name is one of the most beautiful, most beautifully written novels I have ever read.  Yet is also one of the most frustrating, because it left me so conflicted.  But that,s just me."
"One of the best book I've ever red, Time to watch the Movie. I felt so much Love on this, and Literally unforgettable. I don't want the book to end. #CallMeByYourName @tchalamet @armiehammer"
"The movie adaptation was good but then you also missed a lot.Aciman brought a smorgasbord of emotions in his novel and a love story that does not submit to boundaries, a coming of age book - daring and provoking. This book is not for all, you have to be tolerant and have an open mind. A good summer read - it's complicated but it will come together  and reveal itself in the end."
"I feel the need to comprehend every word of this novel...I read it, stop, and think about each and every line again. LOVE LOVE LOVE and I highly recommend every single person give this a read. I found myself writing down so many quotes that stay with you for a very long time. I almost want to read it again !"
saw the movie 1st and had to read the book...a beautiful story!! i will def read the sequel...asap! thankyou Andre Aciman
Saw the movie and thought the book would give better insight into the characters. I was pleasantly surprised with the ending which was different from the movie. So if you wanted more of Elio and Oliver's story after the ending in the movie it's definitely worth reading the book.
"Please read this book. It will not disappoint you. If you enjoyed the movie ""Call Me By Your Name"" you will enjoy taking a much deep look into the character of Elio's mind. I could not put this book down. As soon as I finished it I lent it to a friend who I knew would love it. Now all I want to do is reread it."
"It makes no difference if the love is between a man and a man, a woman and a woman or a man and a woman - ""Call Me by Your Name"" is a true love story. I have read the book once and am now re-reading it to see what I missed the first time around. I have not seen the movie yet but I am really looking forward to seeing it."
"This book is a true work of art. It is written in such a way that you suddenly DO feel like you're there with the characters. I cannot get through the last 10-20 pages without sobbing. I have read it 4 times now and it doesn't get old. This novel has touched me and changed my life in a way no book has before, and I will forever find heaven when reading it. Thank you."
"Listening to it before I watch the film. I already know what’s going to happen, I skipped ahead. But cmbyn will make you laugh, make you cry, make you want to be young again, and being twenty, I want to be seventeen again. And I would love if Armie Hammer could stay at my house this summer. I’m hoping Call Me wins all of then academy awards it’s nominated for. This is one of the few LGBT love stories where no one dies of AIDS or no one kills them selves because they feel guilty of exploring their sexuality, or coming to terms with their sexuality, it’s a rare, true love story that tugs at your heartstrings. I would highly recommend this novel to young and old, gay or straight, martian or earthling."
I am so moved. I am wondering though. Do we always have to go back to what hurt us to prove that we have healed? I loved this book from start to end. Everything about it is surreal. The characters were real and their life was real. I wished it could go on and on.Emotional rollercoaster of note. I must say Elio is stronger than me. Oliver is braver than me. I loved them all.
"I don’t remember the last time I read a book so rich with feeling, so faithfully evocative of longing we have all experienced, I am almost certain. Aciman weaves his words together so hypnotically that I was two thirds of the way through it before I had to put it down for other commitments. Truly a spell-binding work of art.PS - took advice from a friend to read this before seeing the movie and I’m so glad I did."
"I do not possess adequate words to describe how I feel about this book.  It is in my top 3 reads ever. Right next to The Bell Jar. This book!  Its imagery, though grotesquely erotic at times, is written with such a beautiful hand. I adore every word on its pages as Elio adores the skin between Oliver's fingers.This book.It's art. It's uncommon. It's a stunning display of humanity and love and obsession."
"I have never read a love story that affected me like this one. It is so passionate and, from inside the mind of a teenager, really illustrates all the ""what might have been""s in a relationship. The ending made me cry. Such beautiful characters and fantastic story."
A true “first love” story...was rooting for them! I wanted to fill in the holes after watching the movie. A good read.
"What a beautiful story about two people discovering themselves in each other. Wonderful to have a gay love story from the heart. Caiman grabs the reader by all the insecurities we all suffer when love is new and we are new to love and doesn't let go. Anyone who has had a crush come true, gay or straight, will see themselves in these characters. Aciman's writing is poetic in both its lovely language and its laser simplicity."
"I loved how the Author focused on the thoughts of the narrator which is Elio the main character. You can feel while reading all the things that crossed his mind. Every single thing. And you can feel yourself in his shoes whether you're a man loving a man, a woman loving a man, a woman loving a woman, or a man loving a woman. You don't see sexes, you see humans. And I LOVED that the Author went far into their future, what happened after the summer with Elio and Oliver. It gives the readers a closure. A very well deserved closure."
"André Aciman paints an exquisite story of love and friendship during a languid Italian summer in 1983.  The narrator, Elio Perlman, recollects how his life changed at age 17 when Oliver, a 24-year-old American graduate student, came to live with his family for the summer. Elio becomes enamored with his family's house guest's confidence and carefree attitude toward life, and he can feel himself being changed by Oliver's presence.  Relationships are about chemistry.  If it is true in chemistry that the greater the bond between two molecules, the greater the release of energy when that bond is broken, then a bomb blast goes off in your heart and leaves a hole when you read the last lines of the book.  Call Me By Your Name celebrates the pure joys of unconditional love without judgment, shame, punishment, or destruction.  A triumph in story telling, that will leave you breathless."
"This is, by far, one of the best books I’ve ever read.  I have a voracious appetite for books and rarely have time to reread titles.  I read this twice in one week and listened to the audiobook.  Simply beautiful!  Haunting, existential, witty, clever, intelligent, loving, emotional, lush, stark, piercing...not a story you’ll ever forget reading.  This turned me upside down and inside out yet, somehow, fixed me back into one piece in the end."
Not since André Gideˋs “The Counterfeiters” have I seen a better exposure of feelings. What a great book. Thank you.
"Atmospheric novel about an adolescent boy’s first love for a man. Bogs down in bits with incessant introspection, but overall a wonderful read."
"I saw the movie before I read the book and though there are similarities, there is a power in this book that grabs you by the heart and never lets go, especially towards the ending. It really took my breath away and as a fellow writer, I have a lot of respect for the intense emotions this story hit me with and continue smoldering within because I have felt and thought all the things that Elio has. It’s amazing and very personal to connect to a character like this."
This is an incredible book about love. I originally started reading this book because Timothée and Armie did so well in the movie. I'm so glad I read this because I understand the story better now.
"This book has received so much good press/word-of-mouth, that I must have missed something. I did not finish the book out of boredom with it. I didn't like one of the main characters at all. The other main character seemed to say the same thing over and over and over again. I am in the minority on this one. There's got to be more to this story than what I had read."
"One of the most beautifully crafted books I’ve ever read. My heart is still pounding from both movie and book. Luckily, we purchased the audio and book....and I had at least Armie’s voice while reading an arrangement of words that takes me back to my own Oliver\Elio reality.Truly a masterpiece! I am forever immersed in the world of Elio and Oliver. My eyes devoured each word as it lept from the page.I am forever changed by this story...And yes, nature found my weakest..."
"nothing does this story justice, it's the book I'd give anything to experience for the first time again, the story has no great dire tradgedy yet it still manages to pull at your heart in a relatable and emotional way I've never seen beforeit's the transition from youth to adulthood and all the growing pains that come with it. it's beautifully written and you can see everything, it's an aesthetically pleasing setting, with a once in a lifetime story. my favorite book"
"I cried at the end of the movie, then I cried at the end of the book even harder"
"This novel is about a love so raw, passionate, and intimate between two beings. It leaves your heart shattered but filled at the same exact time. These characters, their story, and the messages portrayed through the novel are things I have come to find myself thinking about every single day since I first read it. It is a beautifully written novel and a must read for everyone."
"The novel read by Armie hammer,make your heart melt by the sound of his voice reading one of the best novels I have read in a very long time"
"This is a most poignant, intelligent, devastating love story. If you’ve ever been in love or hope to be, you will be shaken to your core. A must read..."
"This book is very beautifully written, so at the end of it, I wanted to pick up another book by the same author. But oh, the characters made me want to shake them. More Oliver than Elio, tbh. But good stuff."
The author gets the reader inside of Elio's head as he recounts first love in the way that tuggs at the heart of everyone who has experienced an overwhelming compassion only to have to say goodbye to someone who has become literally a part of you. This is one book where the seeing the movie first may be helpful.
"The book is very good so far! However, there are small wear and tears throughout it. Some of the pages have small rips and some words are scratched off! I decided to buy a new one but will try and refund this one."
I loved the story. I also saw the movie and enjoyed it also. Every time I hear Call Out My Name by The Weeknd I think of this book.
"A beautifully written book that takes you back to your first true love.  The writer has captured the incredible emotions and physical implications of the initial passion two people share.  It was like he was able to crawl inside you and extract similar experiences and pull out the very best of the wonder and awe.  A true treasure for any man who has felt the love and passion of another man, even if for only a short time."
"Beautiful poetic writing.  Not a lot happens through the book, most of it is inside Elio’s head as he navigates his first true love with a backdrop of Mediterranean Italy in the 80s. It’s relatable from a perspective of first love and all the games you play in your own head. A sweet love story with many happy moments and some tears at the end."
I haven’t actually read the book just yet but the quality of it is amazing for the price I got it for.
"I honestly am so happy that I got this book. I’ve been waiting to find it for a decent price, and I finally did! It is so stinkin cute, and is literally just everything I hoped for. Then again, you can’t go wrong with a book. The cover quality is so good, and had the grain like the originals from 2007 do."
"best book i've ever read. such a beautiful way of conveying feelings, and so many familiar situations. wonderfully written."
I read the book and seen the movie.  Both were fantastic!  I think it's a great story about first love and loss.
"""We found the stars,  you and I.  And this is given only once.""  On the last page of this soul-touching love story, I burst into uncontrolled sobs.  What more can I say?"
"One of the strongest and most accurate depictions of young gay/bi experiences so many of us lived in the mid to late 80s before the advent of the internet and apps, when longing and desire didn’t have immediate gratification with a click to swipe, but instead was satisfied in the art of subtlety, flirtation, and pent up angst. The love shared between Elio and Oliver transcends the pages of this novel or even the movie... it enters your heart as you read the first person telling, and it combines with your cells as if you ingested Elio’s peach. You can’t escape this love. The novel will stay with you for a long time."
Gorgeous prose that speaks true with every line. I couldn't put it down and utterly sobbed when I was done. Honestly one of the most moving love stories I've ever read.
"CMBYN is a masterpiece, beautifully written, daring, raw and deeply cultured.The story is haunting in the best of ways."
First love. First heartbreak. What could have been. Haunts the far corners of your memory forever. I think Elio would have realized that the reality of Oliver would never have been as wonderful as the memory of Oliver. But the pain of not having had a chance to know for sure...
"A beautiful love story, touchingly and tenderly told.  Emotional and gripping from start to finish.  A must read for anyone interested in young love.  Made into an equally beautiful movie, one that deserves to be seen over and over again."
"I’m a wreck. An absolute wreck. This was probably one of the most beautiful pieces of literature I’ve ever read in my life and I’m so glad I found it. The way the author writes about attraction, passion, longing, and unspoken feelings was just so painfully observant it was like reading a very long personal love letter."
"This is one of the best books I have ever read. Sometimes it is a little hard to follow but never the less it is by far one of the best love stories I have ever read. The way the author describes a young boy finding his one true love and really becoming the person he is meant to be. A truly among, Heart wrenching roller coaster that will leave you mad but also in love yourself."
43% DNF..boring
Stupid.
"Everything about this book is perfect. The cat and mouse chase, the over-dramatic emotions. You felt like you were 17 again and feeling all those emotions of someone being the most important thing in the world to you. So well written. I didn't want it to end."
"I was motivated to pick up this book after watching the trailer for the movie of the same name, and was captivated by how beautifully it captured the essence of sensual love. In fact, having just finished it, I'm compelled to read it again to revisit its dreamy language. A story like this, that makes you cry silently at the end, deserves top rating."
This book wasn’t bad. I’ve read better. I can’t say it’s horrible because I did read all the way through but there’s some parts that I had to skip over because they were either too much description or too cringe
"This story was touching and well written. The feelings between Elio and Oliver were well developed, especially later in the book.a bit too much explanation of feelings and thoughts earlier in the book. Loved the Latin and the pain of life. Good book."
One of my favorite books that I've read this year!
What a wonderful book...such a magnificent love story..so well written..I am reading it for the second time now...and once you see the movie you will never forget it..
"Outstanding.  A romance based in reality.  Best read after seeing the movie, imo.  Each is 1/2 of the whole but can be understood individually.  Both clarify and enlighten the other.If same-sex relationships bother you, kick that idea out of your head and focus on the dynamic of falling in love.  It's the same no matter who's involved in the relationship."
"This become one of my fav books. Amazingly and vividly written book, with great and true to life characters. This love story is so beautiful and touching. And as a heterosexual person I really don't look at this love story as a homosexual love story, as I can see comments on the internet - it's really just a beautiful and touching love story. Just two people in love in amazing Italy. I cried my eyes out. This book is mesmerizing. A classic!"
It captures the raw truth of knowing what you could've but also were forbidden to have. It's both beautiful and heartbreaking.
"Dull, lugubrious, unbelievable characters"
"totally disappointed, gave up after reading third of book ."
"I love this book with a burning passion. I'm one of those heathens who go see the movie first, but after seeing it, I needed more from these characters. Aciman is truly an excellent writer to capture the essence of these two young men, specifically Elio, from whose perspective is the majority of the story told, and the content is fulfilling and phenomenally written.The actual product was in absolutely pristine condition. I was very happy to receive it."
"If there were a TEN star category, this would be in it."
"One can't deny that the story is well written, with beautiful flowing sentences. I also realize the story is told through the main character's thoughts and wishes. As I read this however, I kept screaming for something to happen, especially the first half of the book."
"I wanted to read the source material prior to seeing the movie adaptation. Easiest and most satisfying 24 hour binge read I’ve come across in a while. A sentimental love story that doesn’t tread into cheesy. Honest, endearing and complex characters. The anticipation and longing that builds made me not want to put it down with sentiment that leaves the heart simultaneously brimming and broken."
I loved Aciman's style of writing.  This was the first book of his that I had read and I felt that it was beautifully descriptive of the settings in Italy and the character development was also very well done.  I'm excited to see the movie because the book was really lovely.  I enjoyed this so much that I am now reading a book of essays by Andre Aciman.
"Brilliant depiction of a love affair that became the core of the lives of two male lovers. The older-week -hidden behind a later, conventional existence retains the stars of a love which never died. The younger-followed his heart and never denied who he is-retained the burn. None was ever the same. Masterful."
"EVOCATIVE , INCREDIBLE SLICE OF LIFE AS IT REALLY IS."
"read this book. Wonderful writing! I ached, cried, laughed, shouted while reading it. Beautiful to the last page which left me wanting more. I actually kept looking for pages to read when I was done....just a fantastic book."
"Just was not my cup of tea. I do not harbor bad feelings about gay men, it was just too much."
So much better than the movie read the day I purchased it.  This is a well written sad but excellent book.
"This book left me speechless.  It is the most amazing, emotional story to grab the strings of my heart in a very long time.  I finished this book with tears streaming down my face.  I don't remember the last book to do this to me.  Mr. Aciman has portrayed, with perfection, the impact one person--our first, true love--has on the rest of our lives.  This is a must read!"
Beautiful book! Read book before u see movie.
"I enjoyed this book thoroughly, though it was a bit too much in the young man's head at moments. And it was personally frustrating to witness their missed connections.  I was aching for them to get together.  In  the end, I thought it was a beautiful story of the both of them coming of age.  A good read."
"An extraordinary work, intensely romantic & lushly detailed. An excellent companion to the 2017 movie.  Well worth your time to read!"
"The novel is an excellent coming of age and first love story of two gay men, and is extremely well written.  The latter portions of the story seemed to me to drag on a bit, but I thoroughly enjoyed the entire novel.  The setting in northern Italy added an extra dimension to the adventure and tension throughout the story.  (NOTE:  In my opinion, the movie version is even better in as much as it ends succinctly and without the details of the characters' later lives and disappointments, yet captures the angst of not staying true to oneself.)"
"I couldn't put this down once I started reading it. Exhilarating, heartbreaking, hopeful. Ah, first real love!  I thought of old loves where instead of a breakup, there was a definite day of separation where you go off in two different lives, knowing you may not ever see one another again. Ah, there's always Rome!"
"A beautifully written poetic novel on a young man's rite of passage.  Forget the insipid movie with its terrible mis-casting, here is the real stuff: languid, lovely, loquacious, and loving."
"A little too emotional to review at present. Will review soon.  Such a beautiful story of love and friendship. Watched the movie then read the book.  Loved that the movie was almost verbatim, line for line. That just doesn't happen anymore. My favorite book in the world."
"I have never read anything that has affected me as much this story. The emotions and lessons are universal, despite the experiences and identities being so niche. 80’s. Italian. Summer. Love. Beautiful.(Go see the film too, it’s even better dare I say.)"
"One of the most interesting and best books I've ever read. It took me a little while to get into it I found myself thinking ""what is all the fuss about? This is weird and strangely written and NOT good"" for the first many pages but that did not last long. I was soon completely absorbed by this book I literally read it until the sun came up I could not put it down. I read a lot but can count on one hand how many books have made me cry. This is one of them."
"There are only a fraction of romantic gay novels compared to the heterosexual ones. Those of us seeking that kind of reading will find this story painfully beautiful and maybe familiar. Despite the exceptional setting of the Italian villa on the water, and the esoteric scholarly pursuits, the story strikes a universal chord."
"Loved the book even more than the film, if that were possible. Wish the print font was larger for these eyes that have seen so much."
"""...look me in the face, hold my gaze, and call me by your name."" This book has left me literally breathless. What a wonderful way to end it. An absolutely gorgeous story and I can't wait to see the movie. Truly stunning. Wow."
"An absolutely amazing book. It's heartbreaking, but completely fulfilling and decadent. It'll make you laugh, cry, and think about your first love."
"The writing is poetic, and graphic, and literate. I very much enjoyed reading it though it did take several pages till I appreciated its voice. The neurotic stream of thought was at times confusing and at times profound. But ultimately, it was cumulatively beautiful like a poem that sits with you long after you have finished reading it."
From the first page it grab your attention and never let you go. It’s the greater love story I ever read. Never two people has been so close and yet so far. Eliot was a very lucky man to know such a love and to be surrounded by such great parent. The best
"Personally, I thought the movie was better but this was still a wonderful book. It's told from Elio's POV. At some points it was a bit wordy and strange, but overall it made me feel like a teenager again and feel what Elio was feeling throughout the book. That's all but impossibly difficult to do as an author, but when it's done right it's fantastic."
By the time I had reached the halfway point I was so emotionally involved I truly begun to relate to it like it was a true story. How anybody could find fault with this book for any reason cited would leave me thunderstruck. The book ended too soon for me.
"I found this book to be so many things:  A love story, a tragedy, beautiful, painful,  amusing, annoying, frustrating, heartbreaking.  The author does a wonderful job of drawing the reader into the lives and hearts of these people.  I read this book in a few days.  It is a beautiful story and it broke my heart because it happens every day where what the world wants and what we want can cause such things to happen."
"The author's portrayal of the growing intensity of passion, vulnerability and shyness involved in infatuation transcends the boundaries of gender and sexual orientation. The prose matches the passions with elegant sensitivity and surrounds the affair with the warmth of the Italian countryside, lusciously evoked. The reader is pulled into a sensuous world."
"Decided to purchase after hearing about the movie.  I'm a fan of LGBT works, considering I fall on the LGBT spectrum myself.This book was one that I would instantly put on par with ""The Song of Achilles"" and ""Aristotle and Dante discover the Secrets of the Universe"".  It also kept me up into the early morning hours.The language that Aciman uses is one that evokes a sense of longing for a love that is both forbidden but wanted.  The novel has been described as part of the unofficial Canon of LGBT works, and I can see why.The story is from Elio's point of view, and shows how love can captivate the heart of the young and youthful.  It is a story that moved me in ways that I fear may not go away any time soon.  Though many see the relationship as problematic (and indeed I see it that way too), it is not a predatory ship, in the sense that we view it today.  The younger chases the older, in a surprise twist of fate."
"This book was amazing. It’s portrait of young love was beautiful and enticing, romantic and heartbreaking. Just wish it could have been longer, but all good things end eventually."
Such a beautiful story.  I loved it. The language was poetry.. The author chose such great words to describe everything
"Just read it. If you like music to gently provide atmosphere i could recommend: Aguas da Amazonia no. 4 , Amazon River (Philip Glass- Paddle to the Sea)"
"I bought this book for my 16 year old daughter because she loved the movie (and I always encourage reading). She said it was a great read if you liked the movie, but did drag at times. Overall, she recommends reading teh book first, and then seeing the movie."
"I am sobbing. For so much life this work has brought so lovingly back to the forefront. Like listening to internal dialogue, this novel is quiet and loud, succinct and a jumble, harmonious and a cacophony. There are works that help shape the life of the people who miraculously come to know them. I firmly believe this one changed mine not only for it's raw honesty and it's unwavering fearlessness, but for it's tenderness and it's ability to hold my hand along the way. It is timeless in it's humanity and perfect in it's ability to extract the melancholy that every life is bound to hold. It revealed parallel lives that I once pondered about and allowed me to feel like that tragedy though always with us is simply what life was about. I don't think I will ever forget Elio and Oliver because they are me and when I call myself by my name I will be calling them by theirs as well."
One can't begin to adequately describe the tugs on the heartstrings of this compelling novel.  The writing is genius. A must read for the truly romantic.
"This books is a MUST READ for any hopeless romantic. If you love love you must read these sentences!André Aciman's choice of words to describe Elio's feelings for Oliver.. I have not read anything like it. You just find yourself reading the lines over and over. This is a book I will re-read because I know I will find even more beauty in it the second time.Now excuse me while I go listen to Liszt, drink apricot juice and read Inferno. (buy this book and I can promise you my words will make you smile) (well, hopefully) (yes, it's an insider) (okay, read this book now) If not later, when? (okay, that's an insider also)Later!"
"Loved the book, but interestly, I had a hard time getting through the beginning, but sailed through the latter part...probably because of my age, too. Wonderful story; thank you."
"Well-educated, buff, sociable professor falls for a hopelessly neurotic teenager?  I really don't think so.  Elio is super annoying.But it is well written."
"This is one of the best books I've read in years. Between the gorgeous imagery, stream of conscious, romantic buildup, and insight into the pureness of finding one's self and love for the first time... this was simply a beautiful book. Please, please, please read this before seeing the movie if you have a chance. The ending in the book is so much more powerful and satisfying you'll thank yourself later."
I’ve ordered this book seven times. Why? Well I’ve given a copy to my friends so they can experience this amazing story. I’ve read that book 10 times and half way through my 11th! This book is truly amazing!
"Two young men cross paths on a summers day, and were forever changed. Their summer together was like a traumatic event but at the same time like a fairytale that needed to happen. Craved into their lives as a memory, a dream. Yet when revisited, like a wound that has just healed with its skin still raw and sensitive."
Daughter loves this book. Better than the movie.
Quality Paperback Novel . Right size for Travel & Leasure reading .
READ THIS IM IN LOVE a little inappropriate more than movie but it’s amazing
The product arrived in amazing condition. Not to mention it was one of the best books I’ve ever read. 10/10 would recommend. Note: the dent at the top right corner was my fault.
"Incredibly well written in terms of plot development and the inner mental processes of someone coming to grips with an identity reality!  Though quite detailed, the novel moves also great at a good and engaging pace, and the linguistic elegance is striking. Most of us have had a ""true love"" experience like this (whether hetero or homo) and the develoment of the story is totally engaging. Bravo!"
"I'm wrecked that it's over, but I don't know that I've ever known a more beautiful novel in all my life."
"I lived a life as this, South of Rome.  One Summer with someone I loved.  I went back to America.  He married and had a son. This novel brought back strong memories of those Summer months on the Mediterranean coast.  I just tore my heart out to stop the pain.  But thanks for the story.  It can't have been a work of fiction.  Well done!"
Best book ever - read it 3 times already!!! Can’t get enough of Andre Aciman writing and read almost all of his books including the new one Find Me which is the continuation of Call Me By Your Name!
"Different than any book I,'ve ever read.Some lovely writing, thought provoking situations, and heartbreaking in many ways. Love is love is love ."
The cover of the book was a lot darker than it should've been (it was more like a navy than the sky blue) and the printing was crooked. I recommend buying it from somewhere else.
Good product.Fast shipping
"The writing was beautiful, describing the people the places and all of emotions and connections of these people.I wanted it to go on and on. I wanted their love story to continue.Bravo!"
"There are few blaze marks for those who trailblaze through the wilderness of puberty and up the crest of manhood. Here there are hache-marks on these trunks and the axe of André Aciman is sharp. Just as fallen trees are the nursery for seedlings and the child is the father of the man, “Call Me” has helped me recover my own path backward to the source of my first love, out from my own choked underbrush to an open clearing."
"This is beautiful story. Elio and his family host a tutor in Italy. Seventeen,, self-involved, Elio is not sure what to make of Oliver.Aciman has woven a heart wrenching tale of family, love and the romantic tuggings of Elio who resists fate until he realizes he has to pursue where his spirit has directed him toward."
Great book would recommend
This is a raw honest depiction of a young man’s experience with an older man. He is poignant. I loved the way The author took us into the experience of the young man from within his psyche
"No words can describe the beauty of this novel. Iv never held love the way the author writes of it. Words can not be described by me of what a true romance novel should look like, but call me by your name does."
"I can't really say more than what's already been said about this wonderful book. It's beautifully written, with some exceptions where the prose becomes too heady (mainly in the first half). The last third of the book contains some of the best passages I've ever read about life's most treasured and unique intimacies and their hold over an individual's life."
"Excellent!  The ending is surprising like the end of Gone With The Wind......Scarlett and Ashley Wilkes!  Everything is done so subtly!  Remember, Elio has no male compadres who match his brilliant brain, but Oliver does!  The book, unlike the movie, shows a Rome that enthralls Elio.  Mental Brilliance!"
"Excellent book; makes an awesome companion to the movie, which we also loved."
This is one of my all time favorite books that I have ever read. Beautiful and heartbreaking! Beautiful love story! I absolutely love these characters!
"A real slog getting through this book.  I don't understand all of the buzz surrounding it.  I was bored nearly to the point of quitting without finishing but thought it might get better.  It never did, just went on and on and on pointlessly......"
"Don't read this book in a public place. It's something so intimate, so pure, so heartbreaking that you'll need to be alone. Truly a romantic masterpiece"
I saw the movie first and I’m glad I did. It helped me better picture the characters. Truth be known. I liked both. Some parts of the book better explain parts of the movie.
Beautiful movie. 🍀🌻
"I cannot remember the last time I enjoyed a book  as much as this one. The things I hoped for, happened. You don't have to be gay to enjoy it.(I have not seen the movie yet)"
"Some of it seems like it wasn't translated very well example of some of the dialogue it was a little hard to tell who was saying what. But I'm not giving it 4 stars because I love the story so much! I would sit and read it for like 3 hours at a time, and each time I finish reading I would feel like I just got back from vacation in Italy and I felt so refreshed"
I was drawn to read this book after watching the movie.  I am not a reader but found myself mesmerized by the author’s ability to capture such deep emotions between people and how these feelings were constantly being evaluated. I lived and felt many of these emotions.  I am so pleased someone captured lost emotions and memories.
"I was not as passionate about this novel as other reviewers. I thought it was too slow to build, although I understand this was done to heighten the tension between the two main characters. There was too much internal monologue on Elio’s part. It was not until the two finally come together that I started to enjoy the piece. The evening in Rome was one of my favorite segments and I wish there had been more like that. Of course, then they would have been together for more than a few weeks.I thought the writing was quite good, if at times pretentious. The characters were well fleshed out.I don’t see the concern over the 7 year age difference. Elio is 17 (not underage in many states or countries). My own parents had a 7 year difference.I loved the father’s attitude toward the relationship. However, I am not sure I liked how females were almost treated as a way to get past one’s homosexuality. Perhaps this is due to a straight author writing in the realm of LGBTQ fiction?Of course, it had to have a sad ending. I am not a fan of revisionist writing (what if). But... what if it had all played out the way I had hoped it would?"
Incredible! A one day can’t put it down until you fall asleep read. I loved the way it’s written and how it is so expressive and suggestive at the same time. Lovely love story that doesn’t know sex or race
I have seen the film first and it was so brillant that I wanted to dive more in the universe of Elio. And I was not disappointed. I got a deeper insight into Elio’s feelings. Amazing writing. I fell in love with Oliver and Elio. This story is everything. I’m obsessed about this book.
"I cannot do this book justice in a review, so you’ll just have to trust that it’s amazing, and read it for yourself."
I felt like I just lived through the lifetimes of Elio and Oliver. It’s beautifully written and strikingly blunt all at once. I can’t wait to read the sequel.
"This book was amazing.  Truly well crafted and you will lose yourself in emotions you forgot you felt in the past.  Remarkable. Watching the movie ASAP. If you love a love story, this is the book to read.  There have been thousands of heterosexual love stories written which have been great, but to finally read a novel testing the boundaries of homosexual love was unexpectedly satisfying."
absolutely wonderful book. the movie made me cry soooo hard and so did the book. it almost painted a bigger picture than seeing it on screen
"Oddly, I think I liked the movie better than the book.  The book is lovely, it's beautifully written, but I didn't love the ending.  And I think, having seen the movie first, certain things (like the fathers speech at the end) had much more impact on screen than if I'd been reading that page like any other page.  The book does help clarify some points, but seeing it on screen made it so much better."
"The words, their position on the page, the story, everything about this book is achingly beautiful from start to finish."
"What a wonderful book!  The drama and back story is truly magical. The romance is something that many people will envy. The writing can be a little difficult to follow because the narrator can go off on a long memory and you forget what he was originally talking about in the story. However, overall it was a wonderful read. Highly suggest!"
"Short, but good read."
I loved this movie. It's almost a fairy tale with the amazing scenery and beautiful love story.  It is more of an art film than a straight run of the mill movie.  If you have trouble following subtext or like a lot of expositionary dialog telling you what is going on you might not enjoy this film.
"Had to read after seeing the movie because I wanted more background. Aciman is a master of description, and his development of Elio is sensitive and thought-provoking, but Oliver comes across as a narcissistic puppet-master who is afraid of and continues to sublimate his true, and unresolved, feelings. The screen adaptation takes some liberties with Aciman's plot, but not too detrimentally.  Reading the book before seeing the film may leave you dissatisfied."
"Superbly told story. A beautiful romance, a coming of age story, a tale of first love realized and lost. It is truthful and it is touching without being overly sentimental. It has humor. It has heartache. It has balance."
"Very excellent writing and I hope they do a good job on the movie. It is a powerful novel about intimacy and also denial, which is the tragedy in this novel."
"All the hype around this book I found it okay. Glad I read it, won't be making recommendations for it and time soon."
"What an interesting read. You’re in the mind of Elio and he is very descriptive and elaborate about what he feels and thinks which ties in with movie. Elio was lucky to really soak into his very first emotional encounter with a man and as most of us gay men can relate, our first encounters might have not been the same. So living vicuriously through him was as intended! Very slow at first but worth it after mid way of part two of the book."
What a beautiful and lyrical novel. It's simply a love story of young/old. I think everyone should read this novel.It will stay with you.
"Memorable book, with engaging writing style. I felt like I was there in France. A beautiful coming-of-age novel. Like all good novels, this one leaves you with something to ponder."
This book really was enjoyable to read and filled in some of the story that was not in the movie.  Highly recommend this read.
"Even though the frenzy of Timothee Chalamet is still very present (can't say I'm immune from this either) objectively speaking, this book is very well written. The diction and syntax used in this book truly gives it a certain aftertaste. The tone in this book truly resembles the movie, if you have seen that. I personally watched the movie, then read the book which I almost never do but the movie made me want to see more. I highly recommend this book I throughly enjoyed it!"
"This book is incredible. If you’ve ever been in love, had a summer fling, spent a weekend with someone or just got to know someone and knew you’d most likely never see them again, and even if you did things would be different between the two of you, this book will put you back in that place and time. Aciman beautifully depicts the relationship between Elio and Oliver in a way that makes you feel what Elio does. I haven’t cried this much with a book in probably forever. Read. It."
"I watched the movie before reading this. It made no difference. This book I could not put down. Of course, there is much more here than a movie could ever capture.VERY MOVING! I would recommend this book to anyone I know."
"I was blown away by this book.  Completely transported by the depth of this love story that just happened to be between two men, separated by 7 years (17 and 24).  Both had tremendous admiration for each other, and the lust was just part of that. The writing must have been quite affecting, because I still get a pit in my stomach when I think about the story and how it ends.  The agony and the ecstasy are almost too much to bear. Better to have loved..."
What a beautiful and powerful book. Now re-reading in anticipation of seeing the movie. This is memorable literature.
"One of the most beautiful novels I have ever read, I immediately read it again. It has all the doubts and fears and hesitancy and rapture of two young men (17 and 24) who have mainly thought of women and now do not know what they feel toward one another. One tries to speak to the other and fails; the second guessing and misinterpretations are so real, so eloquently written. And when they finally come together and are free to make love and become almost one person, they know that the days are short and they have only a few weeks to say and do everything they feel."
"This is a beautiful story about the elusiveness of love and caring that is never quite fulfilled, but also never extinguished."
"I know only a handful of novels that are as beautiful in writing and conception. This reminds me of some of the work of Edmund White, but with something gentler and so deeply understanding."
very good
"my favorite movie of the oscar nominated films for the year.  beautiful film with outstanding acting, setting, story, and music.  this is one of those films that will stay with you after you leave the theatre."
"I read this in two nights, after seeing the movie. I knew there had to be more to the story, and there was. Seeing the movie first made the book that much more enjoyable. But now, I want to see the movie again. I will watch it with different eyes now. I cried at the end of the movie, and even harder at the end of the book. I didn't want either to end."
"Sheer soul, the perfect love story. Exquisite connection between these two, rarely ever seen put into words. Forever seeking him"
"More than a bit florid, although basic story is okay.  I thought the movie, except for that scene with his dad near the end, was nice.  Also, very funny,  as I remember my own adolescent flirtations."
This is one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read.  The words are so powerful and the story is exquisite.  It will definitely be a book I will come back to again.
"A great love story.  At first it felt a bit jarring as there wasn't a lot of lead up in the first few chapters, but once finished I loved it.  However, I will not be reading the sequel as the reviews are so horrible, and will be content with where the book ends."
Haven’t seen the movie but knowing it had been made into a film is what sparked my interest. What a beautiful love story! To see the movie would leave me disappointed.
"This book is so good, I recommend for anyone looking for a good read"
"Such a wonderful romance but without treacle or self conscious regret. A beautiful evocation of finding love at the right time and place in life, all the while knowing it’s short-lived. Every moment rings true."
I think this book might've ruined me for other books. I can't get it out of my head.
"I unfortunately came to find this book later rather than sooner, but I am happy I was able to learn of it. The way Aciman moves the reader with his words and brings to life emotions I never thought possible, truly captured what a first love is all about. I enjoyed reading this and would highly recommend to anyone else looking to celebrate something so natural between two human beings"
"The first three parts of the book will make you fidget in your chair (possibly due to your aching to get to the good stuff, or you're just tired of Elio's yapping). There's something about the last chunk of the book, however, that really stirred me. The book is spellbinding no doubt (pretty words and such), but the last 30 pages or so make you realize why you bothered to stick around."
"Elio is by far the most real character I have ever found in any novel. He felt so real like a friend telling me his story, a fascinating story by the way. The attention to detail is unique, so well written. I am not a fan of romance but this book is so popular I had to give it a try. I can't be happier I got a copy. The doubts, the fear, the longing, everything was so real I could almost feel it myself."
"This is one of the best books I've read in ten years. It sizzles with longing and pure humanity. I love Elio's voice, so intelligent and full of adoration for Oliver. A celebration of Love and the eternal summer of youth, beauty and the abandon of first love. I can't gush about it enough."
"I loved this book very much. I prefer a happily ever after ending myself, but the book was still very good."
"Andre Aciman transported me back to those turbulant and wonderful times of my teenage years.  His ability to conjure up those emotions that teenagers experience when confronted with their first ""real"" crush (or love), be it straight or gay, was accurate and quite amazing.The story takes place in Italy, and centers upon the relationship between 16 year Elio, a musically talented, acutely intelligent son of a university professor, and Oliver, a 24 year old, who is writing his dissertation, and has come to spend the summer with Elio's family.  Every summer, Elio's father would select and host a doctoral student.I felt the author had woven a magical spell, when he described the languid summer days by the pool, the beach, cycling into town for icecream or Elio and Oliver's getaway in Rome.Essentially, the story is about the interlude of love and awakening, and then, love lost and ultimately how this impacts on their future lives.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Aciman's prose made it difficult to put down. ""Call Me By Your Name"" is one of the few novels that I would definitely reread."
"Amazingly acted story of first love, and awakening gay orientation. Actors do an amzing job, and break and exhilerate your heart, all in the same movie"
Great book even after seeing the movie
"I’ve watched the movie as soon as it came out, and it’s currently my new favorite movie. I heard the book was much sadder than the movie however, so that’s the only part I’m not really looking forward to haha. The book was in excellent condition 👍"
"I kept re-reading the last paragraph of the book because I couldn't bear the idea that this story would end. Aciman has such a powerful yet subtle way of articulating emotions that we've all felt, but rarely managed to express - even in our own minds. Stunning, stunning, stunning."
"If you enjoy having your heart in one piece, I would suggest a different book. This book ripped my heart out of my chest with one sentence, tore it apart, and then threw the pieces into a fire, while I read along, entranced.The writing style is absolutely unique and the narrative style took a bit of time to get used to, but once I settled in, it was a great ride.Truly amazing book, but I would never read it again, because I don't think I could live through that a second time."
"Bought the book after seeing the movie. It was wonderful to understand Elio's thinking throughout the novel, and it gave me a better understanding of the scenes in the film. Also, it gave me the closure I needed after crying my eyes out in the theater, as it goes twenty years further when Oliver and Elio finally meet again in person."
Some parts great but the second half was dryGood romance story with surprises but some of the dialogue was infuriating.  Why can't they say what they mean tosay???
it is not a great literary work either. just a romantic romp that led my interest. a picture of a too smart teenager and a young professor put together for a failed love story.
The author took too many liberties to tell a simple story about how passions begins and end. It had very little to do with love.
"When I read a fiction, I ask: Did the writer feel?Quite often in love stories, the answer comes: No.And I lose interest. I get bored.Not with this book.Each page said that the writer felt. He did. I had almost forgotten how much I enjoy reading lyrical writing. Old love doesn't die easily. This book has got me interested in that old love."
"Conceptually I like this book but I became bored towards the end of the book. The entire book is pretty much Elio's internal debate on his feelings towards Oliver as well as his sexuality, and while these are absolutely ideas that deserve lots of pondering, the book begins to feel a bit repetitive and slow. Also, I personally could've done without reading the apricot scene"
"I don't think everyone will enjoy this book, but something about it struck a chord and I found it achingly beautiful.  Perhaps it was the Italian setting, perhaps it was the beautiful boys in flirtation.  In any case, I was weeping by the end of the book, but that's a good thing."
"This story breaks me!Unlike a lot of stories where I’ll read the book first & then see the movie, this was the opposite for me. I felt with the movie I didn’t get the ending I needed so much. The book provided that ending but be careful what you ask for."
"I loved this story, taking me to Europe and reminding me that love and attraction is just that no matter the age or gender. Beautiful descriptions, characterization and dialogue. My favorite scene is when Elio’s father tells him he knows about his love for Oliver, responding with love and encouragement—a model for all parents."
"The way the writer writes in this book made me struggle to read it. I felt it could of been done differently, but I am not a writer. The book offers more story and a continuation of that fateful summer encounter. Overall I was content in the end."
"Aciman,a physical and emotional descriptions are so.vivid you can feel yourself in the narrator's role even if you've never experienced anything like this. I couldn't put it down and loved the beautiful language and the plot."
"This movie is amazing, first I read the book and them I saw the movie, why can't they make movie's like this all the time?"
"Beautiful love story, well-written, and haunting. I couldn't stop thinking about Elio... As an avid reader of gay coming of age novels, this is one of best. It's right up there with Dream Boy (Jim Grimsley) which would be my vote for #1. I'll be purchasing a copy for my bookshelf to read again."
"I have never before related to a character so thoroughly as I did with Elio, or perhaps the author himself. I don't know what it says about me, but I was genuinely comforted in knowing there are people who think, analyze, and who feel so closely to the way that I do; who feel partly undiscovered, even to themselves, and who secretly desire to be wholly understood and truly seen above everything else. What an introspective, intelligent, and emotional read. This one has changed me."
"Though I tired at times of the relentless second guessing of Elio- even to the end of the novel (I get it.. you're a love obsessed teenager), I found the work totally original, brilliant insights by all of the players, beautifully written, and reminding me of my younger self.  I highly recommend this extremely moving love story to anyone and everyone."
The most beautifully written book i have ever read!I became absolutely in love with Andre Aciman's writing after reading this book. i'm only sorry i did not discover this book earlier.
"Watched the movie 3 times..had to read to novel...Evoked the same emotions, more so with the book. Tears of joy, some of sadness, but mostly felt envious of Elio and Oliver's journey,..their story. Some people go their whole lives never experiencing what they had...their friendship, relationship, love...whatever you choose to call it. And as scary, painful, wonderful,  and life altering as it was, they didn't let fear keep them from being happy, if just for a few weeks,, but really for the rest of their lives. Neither would change their past...lose those memories."
"It was soooo boring. I dropped this book, which i never do. Its literally just some erotic fan fiction that you can find on watt pad. I can not understand the hype of this book.  There was no sort of character development, nothing happened!!!! It was just a book about a boy who liked a guy. Literally nothing special or interesting."
"I wasn't aware of this book until I saw the movie. The author does a brilliant job of capturing the obsessive thoughts of a teen who is filled with desire. It will take you back to your first infatuations with all the highs and lows that are so relatable, so human. If you were enchanted by the fine movie, I highly recommend this beautiful trip inside Elios mind."
"I’ve never read words describing so well the heart’s solo song. The movie did beautiful justice to the book, but the book overflowed with inner thoughts and feelings so true, you feel as though the book was written about you- or that perhaps you wrote the book."
"This book is definitely on the list of one of the best books I've ever read. The main character Elio describes everything the the finest detail, making the book that much more enjoyable and relatable. Its a story of experiencing love that will never be lost or forgotten and its definitely a book that will be remembered for a long while."
"what a brilliant, thought provoking, grand, humble, humorous, beautiful, and heartbreaking story. I've seen the film, whice is amazing, but after finishing the book it's clear that as always, the film can't compete with the complexity and beauty of the Novel. a must read for everyone who things of himself/herself as a feeling person, and of course for every gay or bi man out there."
"Elio as a boy becoming man, is precocious, of uncanny intelligence and is an unremitting romantic. That is the compelling thing about this read. He is destined to be identified by the first and best of his love affairs and carries a summer of love as a talisman for life. No one can be as compelling as his lover Oliver, so we must become enraptured as Elio is and their days together are told in lavish and torrid language. Transcendent union cannot last, but the ride along the way is pure delight. This book is destined to be a romantic’s classic."
"A fast read, you can't put it down. It swirls and swirls and never loses momentum, even as it ends it keeps swirling in your mind."
Good read about young love . Over the beautiful country and many unforgettable years. So many memories to.hold on to
"can't put it down read, even better than the movie which is really hard to do, great book!"
"My first Aciman novel. Not my last. Amazing insight into the self of a young artist in love. I kept thinking of Proust and sure enough Aciman is exploring the great French author. While it seems repetitious the exploration of the soul of the young man is multi-faceted. Like looking at a diamond from many angles.  The young artist is also a musician who reinvents the classics, reinterprets them and it all seems so simple. His infatuation with the scholar overshadows his own self. Takes over his own name. In must re-read Later."
"It’s as good as they say it is and more. It’s the most beautifully written book I’ve ever read. It’s like reading poetry, except this I understood. I wish book never ended. I read it twice, back to back. I can’t remember which book I read twice within few days of reading it the first time."
Loved this book! And the pain and pleasure throughout. A love story BT two men. Anyone who is LGBTQ can relate
"Beautiful story.  It does go on too long after Oliver leaves Rome, but it’s still satisfying.  Movie is an excellent match to the book."
I loved the story telling in this book.  Well written - even with a narrative that might be edgy for some.
"I never read a book like this that had me out of breath. You are brought to the world of Elio and instantly start rooting  for him.Although the end is expected, you still hope that something happens that will make them end up together. My favorite line from Mr Perlman: Right now there's sorrow, pain. Don't kill it and with it the joy you felt. Five stars for me"
I loved the movie but the book is beyond compare. I am not sure that I have read a more honest account of true love. It is heart wrenching yet peaceful all at once.
This book had such an emotional effect on me. It was so beautifully written I felt like I was the main character experiencing all these emotions. I read it in one day and know I’ll read it again- Such a great book.
"Just plain brilliant! The author captures such distinct infinitesimal details about youth, longing, communication and burgeoning sexuality. Really extraordinary use of language, metaphor and inner monologue."
"I'll not soon forget this book. The film is three months away from release. If it creates in me one half of the effect of this book, it will be a masterpiece."
"It was quite boring, don’t get me wrong I love the aesthetic and everything but it was super long. the movie was great tho"
Oh gosh. I loved this book. I will read it again. The language is beautiful and so is the wonderful relationship. What beautiful love.
"The best read within the genre I've encountered in years. Wish it existed in audible. Not a fluff piece, but not overwrought or dull by any means. A book to remember and give as a gift."
The most beautiful words of love I’ve ever had the privilege of reading.  Words that create an extraordinary visual image. The intensity is unparalleled.
"A wonderful, beautiful book. There are sentences within the novel that capture everything I’ve ever felt, everything I’ve failed to say out loud."
"So beautifully written. The feeling I felt, made me feel like I was 17 again and falling in love. Absolutely brilliant!"
"My sister absolutely loves this book.  I haven't read it yet, but I might have to steal her copy soon.  Thanks!"
"i got ghe book becuase of the movie and honestly i loved this. all the emotions i felt sad, happy, flustered at some moments. the book though is great quality and the cover comes off too."
"I haven't finished reading it yet, but so far it's very good"
Just finished reading it in a couple days thanks to Snovid 2021 that just hit Texas. Love the book and the movie.
"I LOVE THIS BOOK. The only thing I wish was different was the cover. I really enjoyed the movie and the actors so I was hoping that the hardcover would have had an option to have them on it. I had paper backs and only purchase hard covers. That being said the books itself was in great shape, and read like a book (acts shocked)."
The only thing good about this book was the father's relationship with his gay son. Otherwise It sucked balls!!!
"Captivating, breathtaking, heartbreaking.I invented my heart for Elio and Oliver. I'm such a mess right now.One of the best book I have ever read.Highly recommended."
"Well, it kept reminding me of Thomas Mann’s Der Tod in Venedig. But then at a venerable distance.The novel is good, but lacks brevity. And is somehow to predictable.Perfect novel to make an American movie."
Well worth a read but some sentences are in Italian and while some are then written in English there are some that are not explained in English so it is confusing for those who do not speak/understand Italian.
"Heartbreaking, yet profound and well written story"
"Never cared for that period, even it's a book, let alone the Prince being demanding & a bully."
I read this book after watching the movie. Wish I would’ve read the book first-so many good things left out of the movie:( This is such a beautiful love story.
Can not wait for story to continue
Beautiful writing highlights the tale of first and enduring love in 1980's Italy. Very much looking forward to the upcoming movie adaptation this fall. Highly recommended.
"I watched the movie and knew I had to read the book. The movie was beautiful and it made me think the book had so much more to offer, which it did. So incredibly well written and I tore through it in one day - and have read it again already."
Well written..lucky enough to have had a relationship like this..it remains in every cell...the writer captured those feelings and actually transported me
Beautifully written.  I haven’t seen the movie.  But the setting was so wonderfully portrayed it was almost like you were there.
Very moving story of first love and finding yourself.  Be prepared to cry!
One of the best novels I have ever read in my life. Highly recommended to those who are open minded and looking for a true page turner. Not many books are like this. I was deeply moved.
I absolutely loved this book! I never heard of this author before and was unaware that this book was even written until the movie came out. I saw the movie first and so far have read the book twice. I was so moved by this book and the movie that I am still feeling the effects. I am hoping for a sequel.
I really enjoyed this book. I recommend it to everyone.
"If ever there was a tome to remind that the saddest of all phrases is, “It might have been...” it is this book. A treasure that gets the real terror of life, time and love exactly right. I’ll be haunted by this book for a while."
"Of course this is great. The obsession of youth and how much people can matter to you are so well portrayed in this. Little pretentious but it works for the characters. The end made me weep, because I relate more to Elio than anyone should."
"I am just going to talk about the quality of the book and not what it's about. I am always afraid to order books because sometimes they're too small or dented or something like that. This book was not, however. It was a good size and was not dented. The cover was also smooth. Nice quality book."
"Wonderful , wonderful! What a love story , nothing explosive, but it's timeless . We can smell the summer and see their faces ."
I gave it 4 stars because I felt it was wordy. It was a good book though and it really touched on the topic of finding out about ones self. It was well done without being too overly sexually explicit. I would recommend.
"Wow! So beautifully written and unlike anything else I have very read. So much meaning behind the well written words, I simply couldn’t put it down."
"After viewing the movie, I decided to read the book. It is an amazing first person narrative, but I don’t think Aciman wrote it for casual readers. It wasn’t a quick read for me. Sentence structure is sometimes unusual and while every word he wrote fit perfectly, many of those words are uncommon.That said, I truly enjoyed this book!"
"Summer love, may be the most important one you have. I loved this book."
I loved the story. The movie came out on cable TV the week after I read the book and I enjoyed that too. But the book was better.
"I loved this novel from start to finish. There are some moments that are incredibly real and raw. It was a wonderful read. I will warn people who are uncomfortable with reading some sexuality or sexual elements, there are a few moments in the book that get a bit racy. All in all, a wonderfully written story that I thoroughly enjoyed."
Perfect book!!! Loved it so much 🤗 The cover really pops out 😊
"André Aciman is one of the most talented writers alive. He writes ecstatically and evocatively in a way that anyone who has felt love and lost it would relate to, while transforming it into pure poetry."
This book is amazing! So times wordy but for the purpose of immersing you in the storyteller POV and life! I’m Elio and this book is Oliver!
"Beautiful story, very well written. It's a bit slow but the quality of the writing compensates."
"It’s beautiful and honest, I definitely recommend."
I liked the movie but the novel is SO much better. Highly recommend this book!
"Like A Boy's Own Story by Edmund White, this is a novel that is written over the head of the youthful audience that is most needful for a book about first love.  But this is ultimately a gripping and evocative love story, even if there is something in it that just does not feel like reality.  The love between the charismatic visiting scholar and the younger man who idolizes his American breeziness feels like something old and obsessive rather than youthful and liberating.  This obsessiveness is implied by the unusual title of the novel.  And some might object to the fluidity of the attractions here that leaves women desired but abandoned.  Fortunately the middle section of this book contains perhaps the best date in literature, an unforgettable night in Rome.  And the parents in this story are wonderfully embracing of the love they are astute enough to see developing in their Italian Riviera salon.  Thus, there is much hopefulness in this period love story that seems to pave the way to our own days.  The Stern Librarian (I had a love of my own)."
"One of the most breathtakingly beautiful novels I have ever read in my entire life. Aciman’s prose is truly one of a kind, and it makes you feel everything the main character is feeling. I related so much to Elio I could picture myself being in his situation and it only made the experience of reading the book more intense. I recently got the chance to watch the film at a film festival and it made me want to reread the book. I also downloaded the audiobook, so everything related to this book; I recommend. Achingly stunning."
"This is a great story. It's a slow start, and then it turns into something one doesn't want to put down.  Beautiful setting on the Italian Riviera for a love story."
"I watched the movie while traveling on a plane and it captivated me so much I had to download the book as soon as I arrived to my destination.  The movie was a little slow, but this book was one of the best books I have read lately.  Loved it from beginning to end."
"What a hauntingly beautiful book! It was so thoughtful and well-paced, relatable, beautiful, and nostalgic, even for someone who may not have experienced the events in it."
This is a beautiful story. I loved every sentence and every minute of reading it. I was so touched by happiness and was also brought to tears. This book will remain close to my heart always.
"Heart, soul, deep feelings, finding your place in your life and in the world. I felt like I lived and loved in Elio's eyes. This made me laugh, made me cry, gave me joy, and gave me a melancholy disposition knowing that the time they had was fleeting."
"Highly recommend. I read this while I was in Italy, which was perfect for the setting, and the beautiful writing will stick with me long after I've left."
"Call Me by Your Name is such a beautiful love story. An Italian summer of love.If you've ever secretly wanted someone, you should read this book.If you've ever been in love, you should read this book.If you've ever questioned whether or not to speak to someone you're attracted to, you should read this book.If you've found the love of your life, you should read this book.If you love love... You. Should. Read. This. Book."
I love this book so much!! I just finished reading it and I’m crying! The book came good and no pages were wrinkled
I really enjoyed this book. It is not for everyone! Very well written but make sure you know what the subject is.
An excellent  novel....the author transports  you to Italy as the characters come to life. Be prepared  to shed tears as this beautiful  story comes to a close.
"Read the book after seeing the movie. Like the movie more. The book is an easy, fast read and captures the sexual nature of both characters. I totally didn't get why the section about the poet needed to be in the book. It seemed way out of place, but that's me. Understand why it wasn't included in the movie. Overall, enjoyable and would recommend."
"The story told with so many thoughts of the main character was exquisite.  At times it was hard to decipher who was saying what, but it may have just been the kindle format I was reading.  I recommend this book for anyone who wants to read a roller coaster romance."
"the book flows in such a calming and enjoyable way. as someone who wishes for a life that i may never get to live, i strongly related to these two characters and felt close to their story."
This novel is so profound and life affirming that even the incredible film couldn't quite capture its beauty. I think about it constantly and have reread it several times. Aciman's prose is exquisite.
Saw the movie and had to read the book. I loved them both!
"After buying the movie, and after seeing it 4 times in the theatre), , I learned so much of the Original Book and needed to read the rest of Andre Aciman's book, I  just can't get enough of a fix from ""Call Me By Your Name""."
"It is a poignant insight into coming of age in one's own skin, falling in love for the first time and the way life's path is filled with surprises, sometimes painfully enduring."
"This Book was an excellent read about first loves. I Loved at the end, the reader gets a sneak peek into the character's future and where each ends up in life."
"Highly recommend- especially if you plan to see the movie.  I purchased the audio book and only got through 30% of the book before I saw the movie, and it added a lot of nuance that simply can't be conveyed in the movie."
"It’s a book that will make you fall in love it takes what it has given to you and it leaves you wanting more, more of that love, more of the pain that we have felt but it all ends. It ends the way it should have ended the way life ends things. You’ll love the book trust me."
my daughter loved it
This book destroyed me. I cannot stop thinking about these characters and I don’t think I will for a while.
"A wonderful first-person depiction of a teenager’s first real love, with all the doubts, yearnings, and cravings that come with it. Captivating. I also can’t wait to see the movie by the same name, which received the Oscar for best film adaptation of a novel. I wonder how Elio’s doubts and yearings, as well as the physical intimacy, can be portrayed on the screen.“Later!”"
"The novel- like I fell asleep in the sun on a breezy day and had the most beautiful dream.The book itself- in great condition! A small mark, but felt new.Very happy with my purchase!"
gorgeous book.
"First I found the style a bit confusing but once I got into it I found it had a wonderful flow. By the end I was so touched and moved I cried like a baby. Loved how characters were developed. I can not get it out of my head, it's like I was on vacation and have vivid memories of the places and people."
Aciman skillfully and unabashedly captures the intense yearning and desire that comes with an all-consuming love and lust. I'll never look at a peach the same way. 🔥🍑
Definitely worth reading for anyone who has loved someone and continue s to hold that person in their heart long after they are gone.
"I read CMBYN immediately after seeing the film. I have mixed emotions about both, but one thing is for sure, this story is easily a favorite of mine in either platform. I understood why Guadagnino made the edits he did for the film, but if you were a fan of the movie, you definitely need to read this book. The passages after their summer, I feel, are just as important to Elio and Oliver’s story. A love that transcends time. I’ve accepted what happens between them, but I’m at war with it at the same time. Perhaps, I’d like to believe that in some other parallel universe Elio and Oliver found their way back to each other and fell in Love all over again and created this amazing life together, full of global scholarship and travel. And maybe have kids of their own, maybe Elio would give their son the same advice his dad gave him? I’d like to think so, but I very much appreciate that this wasn’t the case."
"The book is very lyrical and showcases the love between the two lead characters in a very dreamlike quality. For those who love the movie adaptation, the book has a different ending that is just as poignant and powerful as the film's ending."
Beautiful beautiful story.
I love the movie. I just wished the movie was more loyal to the book as written. Beautiful and reflective. I hope it gets the nod by Oscar. Five-star rated. Well acted and the casting was just splendid. I hope for a sequel when Oliver came back to visit the family like the book.
"there was a little bit of damage to the book when it arrived, but that’s not a huge deal, just a little annoying. i also got it new so i didn’t expect it to come with damage."
This book is very well written and captured my interest from the start. Couldn’t put it down. 5 stars all around.
"What a fantastic book!  James Joyce meets Proust and Flaubert.  The prose style is fluent and literate, the insights into the hesitancies and uncertainties of a love from which both parties hold back and the slowly building erotic tension have seldom been better portrayed, made all the more poignant because both may be heterosexual - which just goes to show that we all fall somewhere on a line between exclusively gay and exclusively straight and may even move position on that line given the right circumstances.  And then the final encounter in later life was once again hesitant for all the right reasons: recherche du temps perdu tends to be difficult and unsatisfactory at the best of times and is usually sad.  To me every nuance of feeling, thought and reaction was legitimate and uncontrived and the descriptions of the warm Italian summer were poetry.  A beautiful story which I am sure to return to soon.  Please buy it!"
I really couldn't stop crying.
"Yes! Yes! Yes! Loved this book. Loved the setting and absolutely fell for ALL the characters!The Charm Offensive is witty, awkward, heartwarming, and funny AND deals with some very serious topics including mental health and queerness. Plus, the author does this with such care and does it seamlessly. How can this be her debut book?! THIS will definitely be a book I will be recommending for the rest of the year.Charlie has been picked to be the next Prince on a reality dating show. But he's kind of awkward and he may have some issues that he doesn't want to share with the world, nor the women he will be ""dating"". Enter Dev, his handler for the show. He is all hearts and flowers and has always believed in Love and the ""Happily Ever After"". He grew up watching the show he currently works on and he just loves LOVE. These two couldn't be more different, but Dev is determined to help Charlie find his Princess and will get him to loosen up throughout the show AND on his dates.Throughout this story, I enjoyed seeing both our main characters figure out who they were and their journey to find happiness and health...and possibly love. It just took both of them time.Alison Cochran created a world that is very current and relevant and gives us characters that you can't help but love. They are relatable, flawed and are dealing with figuring out who they are all while being in the reality dating world. THAT definitely made for some great comedy. Ms Cochrun was able to poke fun at the setting and introduce some very strong and diverse characters that gave us a truly amazing reading experience.With all that said, this is a book that is entertaining, but also makes you feel good and makes you feel like you are part of this messed up family. You grow with them, you discover with them, you travel and drink with them, and you love with them. You get to experience some highs and lows and you will completely and totally fall in love with both Dev and Charlie and their journeys to happiness.This book is for all you reality dating show fans (or the closeted ones 😂) or the ones who like to poke fun at them. You just can't help but laugh at all the shows antics.I can't wait for more from Alison Cochran!""Your story f........ matters. Only you can tell it."""
"I’m not stingy with five star ratings. However, even if I were a hesitant 5-starer — if, say, I only gave out one or two a year — I can assure you with 100% certainty that The Charm Offensive would still get five stars. As it stands, I’m giving this book twelve stars (approximately one star for every hour I spent binge reading it), because sometimes the five point scale just can’t capture how much you love something.The Charm Offensive is so deft, so caring in the way in handle so many different topics — topics I’ve seen butchered even by experienced authors I trust. The plot is romantic as hell and follows a familiar pace and is chock full of some of my favorite tropes. But also, it doesn’t shy away from more serious topics — things like mental health, and the importance of queer representation, and ace-spectrum identities, and journeys of queer self-discovery.One of my favorite rants is the importance of queer representation in media. Not just because it’s important for queer youth and queer adults to see themselves represented, but also because seeing queer identities, queer romances, queer stories told and celebrated — for many people that can be the catalyst for looking inward and discovering truths about themselves. This book is practically an ode to that rant, and reading it made me feel whole and happy in a way that I can’t put into words.Please, please read this book. It’s a charming (ha) romcom, it’s a love letter to neurodivergent folks, it’s a celebration of the representation that queer people are — and have been — fighting for.  This book spoke to me, and I hope it speaks to you too. 12/5🌟"
"​I absolutely loved this book!​ ​This follows Dev who is a producer on a reality tv dating show called Ever After. And Charlie, who is their prince and star who is looking for true love.This is easily my favorite romance/rom com I've read in a long time and a top book of the year! Charlie and Dev have amazing chemistry together. Watching their relationship unfold was so special. This book is emotional, funny, heartwarming and so sweet.It tackles big topics like mental illness, identity and acceptance. There is a diverse cast of characters with so much representation and I loved them all. Sometimes I feel like side characters are just there to move things along but they all had a purpose and personality and I loved when they were around.I didn't want the book to end and may have gotten a little teary eyed at one part. ​​Even if you aren't a reality tv fan (which I'm not) you're going to love following Ever After and learning the behind the scenes of the show. And of course, you'll adore Charlie and Dev!Thank you to Atria Books for sending me an ARC in exchange for an honest review."
"I didn't read romance for a long time. The formulaic plots with generic characters that generally seemed interchangeable. But I love a good rom com, and eventually decided there must be a bookish equivalent.Lots of asking the internet helped me find them.  I've read a few now and been delighted to find that in addition to the rom com-esque qualities these new romance novels also had so much broader representation.  I was seeing queer stories and stories where women bigger than a size six were treated as sexy and worthy.This pushed all the right buttons for me.  On a surface level the story of forbidden romance behind the scenes of a reality show was a fun and engaging plot.The leads were awkward and charming. I appreciated that a queer man of color was one of the main characters.The side characters were amazing and even the ones that were cast as adversaries from early on were fleshed out, fully realized people and not cookie cutter villains.But it was the discussion of mental health and security that truly went somewhere nothing else I've read has. A romance novel with characters on the asexual spectrum or where they/them singular pronouns are used without comment or explanation is not something I was expecting to find.I loved every word"
"You know that feeling you get when you hold a book in your hand only to realize you better get all your tasks for the day hastily completed, because you probably won’t stop once you start reading?This is definitely going to be one of those experiences for you.Within a few pages, the characters’ charms (and Cochrun’s sensibilities) had me hooked. I will admit that I went into this knowing little to nothing about The Bachelor, the obvious source of inspiration for the novel’s own reality show. This, however, did not impede my enjoyment of the story thanks to Cochrun’s careful world building.I also especially liked Cochrun’s treatment of the intimate scenes. I am personally not a huge fan of overly descriptive sex scenes, but I felt Cochrun presented Dev and Charlie’s physical relationship with so much care and dignity that it made me better understand the characters and their budding relationship.While it is a romance book, there is also a sincere exploration of mental health, therapy, labels within the LGBTQA+ community, and the stigmas that accompany them all. This careful inclusion is what took this from a cute book to, in my opinion, the top contender for best romance novel of the year.I so enjoyed The Charm Offensive (in one sitting, as predicted), that I immediately went online to buy all her other novels, only to find this is her debut work. What?! I am so impressed and am now eagerly awaiting the opportunity to pre-order whatever she releases next."
"“The Charm Offensive,” by @alisoncochrun is an mm romance. think the bachelor, but make it forbidden since the prince of the show is falling for his producer handler.the steam was not there, but behind closed doors - but what it lacked in on page, it made up for in chemistry, a connection soul deep and the ability to evoke the love developing between charlie and dev. i loved the BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ representation in this story, along with the fact that our H’s both dealt with some pretty heavy themes. They were raw and real, and showcased that even in the midst of the unknown - that they were each other’s person. In love. In friendship, and in partners.amazing debut."
"I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH! I’m not someone that enjoys reality dating shows but as soon as I read the synopsis for this book, I needed to read it. I was lucky enough to receive an ARC in exchange for an honest review from Edelweiss. I seriously did not want this book to end, there were so many things I loved about it. There was so much representation, the lgbtq+ and mental health rep were especially well written to me. It made me laugh so hard (“I’m into puzzing”), cried a lot, swooned, and spent more than half of the book with my heart clenched in the best way possible.*I’ve only ever read one book with OCD rep before this one and the way Charlie’s was written was just so well done. As someone that’s dealt with OCD my entire life, it means so much to me to be able to read stories like this and be able to see myself in it. I just feel like so many people don’t truly understand what it’s like to actually like with OCD and this is especially shown in the way that pretty much everyone has treated Charlie throughout his life.*Also, as someone that has dealt with mental illness my whole life, I search for characters that have mental health issues that don’t stem from a traumatic event. I had a great childhood, the most loving parents, and a support system that never makes me feel less but I’ve still always struggled with my mind. So seeing characters like Dev that had a loving upbringing and has always seemed so put together and happy but struggles despite all of that really resonates with me.*Another thing I loved was the conversation about how you don’t always have to have a label for the way your feeling. For a lot of people labels can be really nice to have but for some people nothing quite feels right but that doesn’t mean that your feelings don’t matter or aren’t as valid. You know who you are more than anyone else ever will so as long as you’re doing what makes you happy and feels good to you, that’s what truly matters.*I could honestly go on and on about every little thing I loved about this book but I’ll just leave it at this. I completely adored The Charm Offensive and I hope everyone picks up a copy in September and loves it just as much as I did! 💛"
"The read is sweet but a little slow. It could have used a little more heat. I don’t mean graphic sex but it seems the author couldn’t handle much of any description and settled on the equivalent of sex as shown in a 1950’s film with everything insinuated. The characters are all fleshed out and interesting, and the way she deals with mental health issues is excellent. I just felt the book lacked umph. It was enjoyable but not something I will come back to.."
"I adore this book! Every word of it. It has everything: so much feeling, and wonderful, deep characterization, and so much heart, and an awesome sense of humor. I loved the way it approached serious issues, not shying away from them. It made me laugh and cry. It's heartwarming and uplifting, and I can't wait to read it again. Looking forward to the author's next book."
"🌹This book is laugh-out-loud funny and sure to delight anyone with a love of reality TV and fairytale rom-com love.🌹The mental health rep is this book is phenomenal and authentic. Mental health challenges like anxiety, depression, and OCD are treated with care and seriousness without defining the characters completely. This is a fun book, but one that packs a serious punch in representing and normalizing struggles with mental health.🌹LGBTQIA+ rep, including a character who is struggling and questioning his identity and labels. This books normalizes the power of being loved for just who you are, even if you don’t have all of the answers yet. 💕I read this book in one day, and will be recommending it to everyone I know!"
"I am new to romance novels so I generally easy reads. This book was perfect. Firstly, I found myself being irresistibly drawn to how cute the characters are. I was also impressed with how masterly the author interweaved issues of mental illness, self-esteem, and past trauma into a romantic comedy. It's not an easy line to thread so kudos! I'd highly recommend anyone that's a fan of easy/light-hearted romantic comedies with cute queer main characters."
"If you are a closet watcher of reality tv (especially of the dating variety), then this is a must read. This book gives you all the intrigue and fun of ""peeking behind the curtain"" at your favorite reality tv show, and the warm-hearted view into the lives and loves (and anxieties) that we have all experienced at some time. From the first to last page,  this book was a delight complete with a roller coaster of emotions. Cochrun is a fresh new voice that deserves our attention. I can't wait for her next book... please tell me there is another book!"
"I absolutely loved this book. At first, the premise reminded me of the Hulu/Lifetime show UnReal. All the characters were so great. Mental health awareness was front and center and I was glad to see a book tackle this head on for once. It doesn't mirror everyone's mental health experiences but I connected with it a lot. It's definitely one of my fave books of 2021."
"I really enjoyed this story. I had trouble diving all in at the beginning because I wasn't sure how it would all play out,  but I loved it! So great to see this take on reality TV. Cute!!"
"Absolutely loved this book. Read it in one night and I didn’t want it to be over. The characters are all painfully relatable, and so beautifully written. The book touches on a lot of mental health issues and a beautiful understanding from other characters. There’s also lot of different LGBTQIA+ representation throughout the book, which was amazing. As someone who is demisexual, it’s amazing to see a demisexual main character :) xx"
Such a cute book and love the positive messages about mental health. It’s very easy to fall for and cheer the characters on. <3
"New to me author, once I started this book, it was a weekend treat.  Cannot wait to read more by this author"
"I loved this story. It made me angry, laugh, and cry. I loved the characters. I highly recommend this book. Enjoy!"
"I knew that I would love this book based on the premise, but it really blew me away. I feel like it’s a rare thing to feel like you “know” the characters in a book, and I feel like Charlie and Dev (and honestly everyone else) are so multi-layered. Loved it from start to finish."
"I flew through this book, it was so fantastic!!! The plot was just the right Amount of trope and the characters were diverse and complex. Overall one of my favorite reads of the year so far!"
"This book will make you laugh, cry, and fall in love with all of its very easy to love characters. The author does a great job making Charlie and Dev relatable with being honest about their mental health."
Good Author
"4.5 starsThis was such a beautiful and tender novel. The premise intrigued me right from the start and the fictitious reality dating show Ever After was the perfect backdrop for this adorkable romcom. It allowed favorite tropes like forced proximity, friends to lovers, workplace taboo/forbidden, and even a little fake dating to really shine. The story unfolds following the show’s timeline, and though it does create some very long chapters, everything flowed together wonderfully. It’s hard to believe that this is Alison Cochrun’s debut novel.The mental health representation, humor, and emotion were balanced so well and I loved how the story explored sexual identity. My heart was bursting with love for Charlie and Dev while I was reading. Every longing glance and brief moment of contact helped fuel the slow burn between them. It was so beautiful how they saw right to the heart of each other and could just be exactly who they were. Their struggles and concerns were relatable and understandable and every hurdle they encountered only made me love them more. So many times I wanted to reach through the pages and give them both a big hug. I appreciated that they didn’t always have all the answers and that they were still working towards being their truest and most healthy selves. I thought the mental health representation was really well done and it was the raw honesty and vulnerability of these characters that truly made this book outstanding.The secondary cast of characters were all equally wonderful and added just the right touch of humor and heart to the story. I would love to see spin off books for each of them, especially Parisa and Jules. As much as I loved The Charm Offensive, I do wish that Dev being Indian American had played a more significant role in the book. There really wasn’t any exploration or discussion about Indian culture or how it might have contributed to his character development. It almost felt like a throwaway mention and besides his name, it was easy to forget that Dev was Indian American at all.The Charm Offensive is a heartfelt and beautiful celebration of queer joy, queer love, and choosing happily ever after.CW (from the author’s website, possible spoilers):-On-page anxiety, panic attacks, and experiences with depression-Conversations surrounding OCD and mental illness stigmas, including workplace discrimination (off-page, alluded to)-Drinking and discussions of alcohol dependency-Familial estrangement and rejection based on mental illness (off-page, alluded to)-Brief references to homophobia and racism (all challenged)*I voluntarily read an advance review copy of this book*"
"There are times in every reader’s life when they come across a book that changes them in some fundamental way, that expands their universe and broadens their worldview. For me, ‘The Charm Offensive’ is one of those books.From the time Dev Deshpande was a little boy, he’s believed in the power of the happily-ever-after. Which makes working as a talent coordinator on the reality dating show, ‘Ever After’ seem very on brand. He helps others find love even though his own love life is in shambles. Enter the newest star of the show, disgraced tech genius Charlie Winshaw. Charlie is in desperate need of a redemption arc, but his stiff, anxious affect is proving to make everyone’s life difficult on set. When Dev is assigned to help Charlie open up, they’ll both discover that sometimes you find love in the most unexpected of places.Going into this novel, I expected a fun, light-hearted rom-com about a reality dating show. Oh, how I was mistaken… in all the best ways possible. Are there light-hearted moments? Check. Wittiness in spades and laugh-out-loud punchlines? Check, check. But, oh, is this novel so much more.This is the kind of story that reaches across gender, ethnicity, heteronormativity, neurodivergence, and mental illness boundaries in stunningly beautiful and emotionally searing ways. The love story between Dev and Charlie blooms like a rose, its present thorns just as important as its petals. The reader is introduced to a wealth of characters who have a miscellany of life experiences that all enrich the narrative… these strands, when woven all together, form the most beautiful tapestry.We need more stories like these. We need more characters like these. We need more narratives that don’t shy away from portraying said characters as flawed people who have struggles; who are so brilliantly and three-dimensionally human. One of the things I love about romance as a genre is that it continually pushes the boundaries of fiction, and isn’t afraid to shy away from reality, all while providing readers with a sense of hope for the future.And this novel gives me so much hope.Thank you to Atria Books and NetGalley for providing me with an ARC in exchange for my honest review."
"What a cute and heartwarming debut! I cannot squee enough! Fans of The Bachelor are going to be clamoring (I mean, clamoring) to swap out their final roses for crowns after reading this book.Not only does it feature a charming reality TV show romance that takes place behind the camera lens of a dating show called Ever After, where princesses a'plenty are out to ensnare one awkward prince's attention and hopeful proposal, but it also happens to be a slow burn that is both neurodivergent AND queer...which makes it even better!Charles (Charlie) Winshaw, the resident Prince Charming, is a tech genius who comes on the show hoping to breathe life back into his career. He isn't there to find love. He doesn't believe he's capable or worthy of it, *cries* , so he's only in it for the good PR. However, despite his good looks, he's a falling-out-of-cars, vomiting-on-other-people's shoes, please don't touch me, stammering mess. His natural awkwardness, OCD, and severe anxiety make him a tough sell with the cameras as well as with the female contestants. In other words: he needs help. He needs coaching. He needs someone who can get him through the season.Enter: Dev Deshpande.As one of the producers of Ever After, Dev has spent the last six years helping contestants on the show find their happy endings, and since he is a hopeless romantic, he is determined to do the same for this newest Prince Charming. Once he becomes Charlie's handler, therefore, it becomes his job to find ways to make him less stilted, more comfortable in front of the camera. He has to help him learn how to interact better with the women, open up, wade through his anxieties, and, you know-- draw out his charm factor. He will do whatever it takes to give Charlie his best chance at finding love on the show. Even if that means spending an excessive amount of time bonding, laughing, touching, and going on ""practice dates"" together.As you can probably imagine, all of this not-so-required close proximity shoots their mutual attraction through the roof, allowing them to realize they have much more in common than they'd originally assumed.Like Charlie, though, Dev has his own demons. He's three months out of a long term relationship when the story starts. He also suffers from chronic depression, which makes him prone to alienating himself from those who care about him most and resistant to seeking the help he needs. It's not an easy journey for either of them but they combat crises of sexual identity and low self-esteem with such patient understanding, with such profound sweetness, that it's beautiful to witness. Truly melts the heart!The care and sensitivity this book takes toward mental health issues, toward sexual spectrum inclusivity and understanding, and toward believing yourself deserving of love was like a breath of fresh air. I only wish dating shows today were half as touching as this was. I know I just finished reading but already I want to sink back into Dev and Charlie's height difference, jet off to South Africa, straddle a scooter, and experience the warm and fuzzies all over again!"
"3-3.5🌟starsI thought this romance started well but then it flagged for me and went on for too long.  The mental health issues discussed in relation to the main characters gave the story depth and heft but, for me, they also took away from the romantic bits.  I was expecting something lighter.  I also wondered why none of Charlie's family members, not one of them, ever made an appearance.Thanks to Atria Books and NetGalley for sharing a complimentary advance copy of the book;  this is my voluntary and honest opinion."
"I honestly wasn't sure about reading and reviewing The Charm Offensive because I have never been a fan of reality TV shows unless it's cooking/baking ones, so I didn't know if a book about a reality dating show (like The Bachelor...) would hold my attention at all even though I love rom-coms, but boy was I wrong! Alison Cochrun's debut novel is so amazing! I read it and loved it so much. Trust me, if you love The Bachelor, you'll love this or if you're like me and aren't a fan of those types of shows, this book will still steal your heart!Ever After is a widely popular reality dating show, and Dev is the show's producer. He strongly believes in the romance of fairy tale true love even though the 6-year relationship that he thought was his own happily ever after just blew up, and he's still got to work with his ex, Ryan. Still, his job is to make sure that this season's Prince Charming, Charlie, a tech millionaire who is only on the show to reboot his image and get hired again, finds his true love.Charlie not only doesn't believe in true love but doesn't want to be on the show. Although he's the perfect looking prince--gorgeous, debonair, suave, he's just awful in front of the cameras and acts terrified with the women. Dev is assigned as his handler to help him learn how to act in front of the camera, loosen up, and act around the women and as they spend time together, Dev realizes that Charlie struggles with severe anxiety, panic attacks, and OCD and these struggles are why Charlie is stiff and awkward when the cameras are rolling. When they're together, Charlie is completely different and able to be himself with Dev.The connection between the two is fantastic--Charlie has zero chemistry with any of the women he's supposed to pick at the end of the show's season as his princess, and he is finally able to admit to himself and Dev that he's never had a real relationship with anyone or explored his sexuality. Meanwhile, Dev is there for Charlie, being sweet, amazing, supportive, what he calls ""Fun Dev"" while struggling with his own depression that he wants no one to see. I loved these characters and how their relationship developed. The writing was excellent.So, this book is way deeper than I expected when I started it! Yes, it's definitely a romance. It's got wonderful, fun flirty moments that had me smiling, hot, sexy scenes that were just wow, romantic scenes that made me tear up, but it had so many emotionally heavy scenes that broke my heart and made me ugly cry. I have severe generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks,  and have suffered from depression, so I felt so seen by the author in the scenes that she wrote about both anxiety and depression. She did an excellent job writing about it, and I applaud her for doing so.I love this, but I think I already said that. If you were a huge fan of the book Red, White, and Royal Blue like I am, then I think you will too!Thank you NetGalley for the ARC in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own."
"5 starsI have died and gone to m/m romance heaven, and you will, too, when you finish this fantastic debut novel! By the way, in this case, ""heaven"" consists of imagining yourself in a throuple with these characters. You will be sad to leave them so soon!_The Charm Offensive_ is set in a _Bachelor_-style reality program, _Ever After_, where Dev is a producer/""handler"" and Charlie is the bachelor/prince. Readers get to hear from the joint perspectives of these characters, and especially in a romance, this feature adds so much. Because readers meet Dev first (only by a hair) and learn that he is attempting to manage the recent breakup of his six-year relationship, it's natural to root for him and hope for his happiness. Charlie, however, has chosen to make himself a reality tv star, and this leads to an instant sense of mistrust. To what should be the joy and relief of readers, both characters are clearly flawed but also unwaveringly loveable.Self-discovery is a critical feature of this work. Both main characters are struggling with mental illness, and they manage their experiences in disparate ways. The portrayals of their experiences and the ways in which others treat them are empowering and realistic, and I expect that many readers will find this aspect both relatable and endearing. Along with their respective mental health struggles, Dev and Charlie are each having to come to terms with what they feel they deserve in terms of intimacy, romance, and attention from others. Cochrun pays keen attention to what constitutes un/healthy relationships and behaviors - both romantically and platonically - and gives various examples of just a few possibilities (while responsibly noting that there are many others from which to choose). Particularly with where one of the main characters lands, this feels like an especially inclusive read on the identity front: one not seen as often and that I appreciate being represented here. Regardless of their own identities, readers will feel either seen or exposed to new possibilities throughout the novel.I truly LOVED reading this and am dying for a whole series a la Guillory and Hoang. There's a great setup for a future installment here, and I'll be requesting that ASAP if it comes to fruition. Also, we can never have enough Parisa.This universe, these characters, and this rep are magical, and I can't wait to read anything Cochrun puts out next. I am definitely interested in accepting this tiara and being your ongoing reader, and I have no doubt that folks who pick up this one will clamor to join. Highly recommended!"
"Mostly I just want to tell you to read this book because it’s hard to put into words how amazing it is. Allison Cochran has written something really important here. It’s a romance that we really need in the world today.Charlie is someone who has struggled with OCD, severe anxiety and panic disorder his whole life.  After a crushing blow with work, he decides to make a PR move and go on the show Ever After which is modeled after The Bachelor. As the star of the show he has a handler named Dev who has struggles of his own but buries them so most people don’t really see what’s going on in the background. Part of Dev’s job as Charlie’s handler is to help him navigate dating 12 different women who are the contestants on this bachelor-style show.  When he realizes that Charlie is having a tough time with social interactions he decides to take a more personal approach with Charlie and spends more time with him directly coaching him through the process. These two become super close and watching their friendship grow while at the same time realizing things about themselves is really something amazing to see on the page.Cochran does a better job than any other author I’ve seen in dealing with neurodiversity, sexuality and gender preferences and racial inequalities in such a way that there is acknowledgment of the real struggle these characters do face in society and at the same time the struggle they have with themselves and the acceptance of who they are.  This is not just a romance between Charlie and Dev, which by the way is sweet and steamy and fun, but it’s also a book where both Charlie and Dev learn to accept themselves as who they are and even more important to love themselves as who they are and that self-love doesn’t come from another person. Charlie's journey of learning about intimacy is beautifully written.  I love that she included discussions of medication and therapy and being brave enough to open yourself up to someone. And while she is dealing with some of these very real and very big issues, this book is so funny.  I laughed so many times.  The interactions, the contestants, the silly games that they do to compete for Charlie’s love and the trips are all super entertaining and had the pages turning until the very end.  I could not put it down.All in all, this is a super gorgeous book written with wit, honesty and humor. It’s easily one of the best books of the year.  I highly highly recommend you read it."
"It’s been a while since I have devoured a physical book in one sitting, but once I started The Charm Offensive, I literally could not put it down until I finished. I do also want to say that I was incredibly apprehensive of this book going in because I can’t stand reality TV, BUT this book surprised me in the best possible way.Dev Deshpande is the most successful producer on the reality TV show Ever After (think The Bachelor but make it the fairytale version). He truly believes in love and happily ever afters, which he ensures that his contestants always get…even at the expense of his own love and happiness.Charlie Winshaw is unlike any Prince Charming that Ever After has ever had on the show. He’s awkward, emotionally distant, has a severe touch aversion, has a lot of anxiety, and wants nothing more to just be able to return to working in the tech world. If a fake engagement at the expense of his mental heath gets Charlie back to work then so be it.After Dev starts spending time with Charlie, it quickly becomes clear that Charlie has severe social anxiety as well as other mental issues, which precludes him from being able to interact with any of the contestants. Dev decides to create ‘practice dates’ with him to get Charlie to become more comfortable and to open up. But what happens when the practice doesn’t feel like practice anymore?First and foremost, my boys need to be protected at all costs, and I will lay down my life for Charlie and Dev. Both of them were incredible characters that I immediately fell in love with.What I thought would be a witty, banter filled rom-com sprinkled with the drama of reality TV was so much more than that. There are so many incredible conversations surrounding mental health and its importance. Also, Charlie is not out as queer, so there’s an entire conversation surrounding questioning and labels, which is so important to see on page. I loved that for Charlie and the fact that Dev and Charlie’s PR manager and best friend Parisa never pushed anything onto him.The representation in this book really is fantastic. You have a myriad of characters of color as well as queer characters with different labels as well as characters that aren’t using labels. I genuinely couldn’t help but falling in love with all (ok, everyone except Maureen because she’s trash) of them.I could go on gushing about this one, but honestly, pick this one up. It is so freaking amazing.Thank you to Atria Books for providing a review copy. This did not influence my review. All opinions are my own."

Dev, a true romantic, has been working on the show for 6 years and this season has a role shift when he is assigned to work with the prince. Charlie, this season’s prince, is quite different than the previous contestants and is actually looking for love at all.Oh how I loved this book! The raw honesty, the detailed look at depression and other mental health issues, love being accepting of flaws!! I cannot say enough good things about it!This book is a contemporary romance novel. As far as the romance, *chef’s kiss.* We have two characters go both feel they aren’t deserving of love or a happy ending. This was completely relatable and felt so sincere. Despite the events occurring on a set for a reality tv show, I think anyone who has ever felt less than deserving, can see themselves in these characters.The book also took on a ginormous helping of mental health. The experiences that the characters had felt completely true and sometimes too familiar. While I’ve never dealt with OCD myself, I felt Charlie’s experience was still relatable and honest. I think the author did an amazing job of depicting the range of experiences that can occur with mental health and I loved seeing the very bad days. The use of Fun Dev was so raw and real, it allows for the readers to rethink how they approach one another and themselves.Overall, this book is a 10 out of 10! It included so many laugh out loud moments, as well as brutal honesty and the true meaning of loving one another. Of course there were some cheesy moments (it is set on a reality dating show, after all). The depth this book has though, it’s almost impossible to describe. Plus, any HEA fans still get the ooey gooey romance and love scenes. For the characters, everyone was fully developed and layered. I loved learning more about the side characters through their interactions with our main cast. I loved how each character was able to share their sexuality, as well as their experiences with mental health and therapy. All of these interactions normalized these topics that have been taboo for way too long."
"The Charm Offensive by Alison Cochrun is a romantic comedy that brings a fairy tale believing TV producer together with his worst nightmare, a tech genius who doesn’t believe in love and is about to star on a reality dating show. Dev Deshpande loves his job on Ever After where he helps people meet their true love in a fairy tale setting. He is given the job of keeping Charlie Winshaw in line after the show gets off to a rocky start. Charlie is trying to rebuild his image and get back to work. When his publicist and best friend convinces him to do the show he hopes he can make it through it unscathed and with no panic attacks. This goes down hill quickly and he finds the only bright spot is his producer and handler Dev. Dev gets Charlie to open up to him and they “practice” dating so Charlie can look more comfortable on air. But practice leads to so much more and then men are faced with the question of can their lives work together outside the bubble of Ever After.Charlie Winshaw broke my heart and put it back together again throughout this book. He was so painfully awkward yet so sweet that even when he did the wrong thing I just wanted to hug him. He is honest with Dev from the start about his struggles with mental illness and although Dev strives to push him outside of his comfort zone he still respects that there are boundaries with Charlie that shouldn’t be crossed. Intimacy between Charlie and Dev wasn’t just about bedroom antics but so much more with snuggling and little kind things they would do for each other.Dev Deshpande loves his job and helping the men and women on the show find love. He believes in love and ends up believing that with his help he can help Charlie find love with one of the contestants. This job becomes so much more difficult as he falls hard for Charlie and deals with the repercussions on his mental health of watching Charlie romance the ladies. Dev makes the tough choices that lead to hurting each other over and over which as much as I cringed with sadness I understood.This book highlights mental illness in so many different ways and brings to light the fact that it’s not always pretty and can be hard to read. There is also so much LGBTQIA+ representation among the characters and Charlie works through where he falls on the queer spectrum. With a great collection of side characters supporting Charlie and Dev through their trials and tribulations as the reader  you wish you could be friends with them all. Overall I enjoyed the way the book was broken into the weeks of filming and the small sections of filming script (I’m a big fan of mixed media within books).5 stars for Charlie and Dev opening up and embracing who they are and each other in this sweet romantic comedy."
"Thanks to the publisher and Netgalley for the complimentary ARC. All opinions provided are my own.4.5⭐️Alison Cochrun’s lovely The Charm Offensive has a funny Bachelor-type premise that’s sometimes satirical, sometimes appreciative. It also focuses on mental health—on OCD & depression in particular.Mental health rep matters—especially in romance—because everyone deserves unconditional love & acceptance *&* because the way characters and their struggles are written can change not only what readers think about things they haven’t personally experienced but what they have.Charles Winshaw is a hot nerd & the latest star of Ever After. He’s also not doing so well as a dating tv star. He’s only there as a publicity stunt so he can get a job back in the tech world he once rocked.Dev Deshpande is an utter romantic who believes he’s actually helping people find HEAs as producer on the show. He’s assigned to be Charlie’s handler & help bring him out of his awkward shell for viewers.But somewhere along the way Dev’s overtures help Charlie feel more comfortable with him & also with others…& Charlie’s newfound confidence & awareness of his feelings for Dev give him the strength to reach out to Dev in return.Often sprinkled with moments of humor—especially in the beginning of the book—Cochrun takes on dating shows & contestants & cargo shorts & puzzing & it doubtless had my lips quirking.As the book progresses & Charlie opens himself up more emotionally, I wanted more of Dev’s reticence to be explored & for there to be more time with him settled into his feelings & for them to be settled longer together. The ending feels somewhat rushed.But the consideration of mental health in this book, of OCD & depression, is valuable & touching, & the realizations both Charlie & Dev come to about the actions & risks they need to take for ultimate happiness are hard-won & admirable.The Charm Offensive is not a light read but it is one that can speak to a lot of people. I’m really looking forward to Cochrun’s next read!CWs: panic attacks; depression; intrusive thoughts & compulsions; OCD; generalized anxiety; panic disorder; biphobia"
"This rom-com has been on lots of fall reading lists, and rightfully so. I loved this terrific story of two men who don’t believe they will find love falling for each other.The catalyst for Charlie and Dev meeting is Charlie’s starring role in a Bachelor-style reality show, Ever After. Dev fell in love with love watching Ever After when he was just a kid. Even working on the show as a handler, Dev still believes that it’s possible to find true love through the formula of reality TV, and he’s thrilled to be a part of the process. In contrast, Charlie doesn’t believe in finding love on a TV show, but he’s not on Ever After for that, anyway. Charlie just wants to rehabilitate his image so that he can get a job in the tech field after being booted from his old company.Dev’s and Charlie’s attitudes about reality TV-inspired love may be very different, but it turns out that their beliefs about love on a personal level are similar—neither Charlie nor Dev actually believe that they will find someone who will love them. Charlie’s been conditioned to hold himself apart from others because he thinks his severe anxiety and OCD make him unlovable. Dev longs for his own happily ever after, but in his heart of hearts, he thinks no one will be able to accept the lows caused by his depression. In their own way, each of them has given up on the idea of romantic love for himself.Reading their romance unfold through the story was an absolute delight for me. Charlie has the looks of a Prince Charming, but he’s a social disaster. He is also an utter sweetheart, and his flailing is awkwardly adorable, but it takes a while for Dev to truly appreciate him. Being on the asexuality spectrum, Charlie has never experienced attraction before, and he has to work through those new feelings. Once he does, though, he’s all in for a relationship with Dev, but Dev’s insecurity—and the formulaic machinations of the show—get in the way before Dev and Charlie find their own happy ending.It's a great read, and I’d recommend it for anyone who loves a good rom-com.A copy of this book was provided through NetGalley for review; all opinions expressed are my own."
"As the producer on the reality dating show, Ever After, Dev is assigned to be the main talent’s handler. Although Charlie may look like the perfect Prince Charming for the show, there is a lot of coaching that needs to happen in order for the show to move forward. With all the time the two have to spend together, Charlie and Dev begin to build a deep connection. Charlie never could have imagined that he could find love on the show, let alone with Dev, who is off limits.THIS BOOK BLEW ME OUT OF THE WATER! I thought it was going to be a cute rom com set against a reality show backdrop, but it was so much more than that. This book focused on mental health and the ideas that we are all a work in progress. It’s ok to need and ask for support and for what you need to get through rough times. I liked that it emphasized the fact that the media and entertainment industry put a lot of shame on mental health struggles and how we need to shift this mindset to something more positive.The other important focus of this book was how we need to do a lot more work on breaking out of heteronormative thinking. I was reminded that sexuality is not binary. It’s a spectrum and even then, putting labels on people aren’t always as appropriate or necessary.I loved Dev and Charlie’s characters and their coupling. They were each easy to love in different ways. Dev was a charming and relatable guy who puts people at ease. Charlie is an accomplished but vulnerable man looking for direction in his life. When they two were together, they were PERFECTION. They had an intense chemistry that not only helped them connect on a deep level, but also brought the steam to the bedroom.This book gave me all the feels. I found myself entertained, amused, gutted, and feeling warm and fuzzy. This is a must-read for 2021!Steam level: 🔥🔥½⚠️: homophobia, anxiety, depression"
"When I received a widget for Charm Offensive, I stuck it in my “not now, later” (i.e., “forget about it”) file. I love the LGBT genre but am not really drawn to rom-coms, which generally don’t hold enough depth for me. I also saw that it was based on a famous reality dating show that I watched faithfully for years before deciding it was kind of fakey. There it sat until I saw the high ratings that kept coming in. That led me to my LGBT-genre-star reviewer Larry’s shelf where I saw 5 stars and his statement “I couldn’t have loved this book more if I tried.” Well, fine. I rescued my widget from the “forget about it” file and dived in. And yeah, I couldn’t have loved this book more if I tried!After a few pages of setup, I started to smile. Not long afterwards the “laugh out loud” moments started in and then later I ended up teary-eyed. This book really caught me off guard with some serious themes. Rejection, self-doubt, self-identity, mental illness, sexual identity, morality, acceptance, and multiple aspects of love are all there in spades. And, oh my heart! For a debut novel, Ms. Cochrun really knows how to bring out the feelings! What a wonderful character Dev is. He pretty much rescues Charlie’s broken life in this book, and in turn, Charlie rescues Dev. The side characters enhance the story nicely, especially Jules, Parisa, Daphne, and Angie. The plot is much more substantial that I had expected, and the reveal near the end is an unexpected surprise.What more can I say other than I loved this book and am anxious to see what Ms. Cochrun writes next? I recommend Charm Offensive to anyone interested in a funny yet serious, very human story with a large dose of heart.I would like to thank Isabel DaSilva of Atria Books, Net Galley, and Alison Cochrun for an ARC of this novel. Opinions stated are mine alone and are not biased in any way."
"This book was really well done! I love books that have really deep and meaningful messages but are still an overall FUN read! This book definitely encompasses those aspects perfectly!Dev is a handler for a Bachelor-esque type show. When Charles is selected as the next Prince, it’s quickly evident that the producers will have a lot of speed bumps as Charles is anything but your typical reality star. Humble, shy, awkward, anxious, and totally uninterested in being there, Charles immediately struggles with his new role. However, Dev is a hopeless romantic and he is determined to help Charles find happiness, he just doesn’t realize that in doing so, he may have to open up and let himself find happiness as well.This novel tackles A LOT. Most characters seemed to be suffering from a mental or psychological condition (depression, OCD, anxiety, etc.) and faced discrimination or a personal struggle with their sexuality, race, and/or gender. It subtly used a variety of pronouns and highlighted sexual orientations rarely seen in contemporary fiction. Part of me wanted more focus on a couple of these facets rather than the whole kitchen sink, but I’m not sure that any one could have been easily cut. I think that speaks to how well Cochrun developed the characters and executed the plot.There was just enough laughs, steam, and drama to keep me turning the pages without being overwhelming or too repetitive. I also really liked that though the book was generally predictable, the last 15% really did surprise me in the best way!Now I want a sequel with Angie’s quest for love as the first bisexual Princess please!If you’re looking for a fun, progressive, inclusive read, this is one that cannot be missed.Thank you to Atria Books and NetGalley for a copy of this novel."
"The thing I loved most about this romance is the fact it really celebrates having a strong connection with someone. Not to go all Grey's Anatomy, but it's kinda like a ""you are my person"" type story. Someone who appreciates every aspect of you, the good, the bad, everything. And seeing all of that play out mixed in with some steamy love scenes made this book a worthwhile read.Even though Dev Deshpande works behind the scenes on a reality dating show which is pretty heavily scripted, he still believes in fairy tale romances. His own love life is a bit of a mess at the moment though. He'll be working closely with this season's star, Charlie Winshaw, a tech guru who has recently taken a major hit to his reputation. While Charlie might have movie star looks, he sure isn't camera ready as he comes across stiff and anxious while interacting with the female contestants. Looks like Dev better figure out a way to make this guy more comfortable on camera. And maybe off camera as well.I don't watch Bachelor type dating shows and I like how it's not a requirement in order to enjoy the plot of this book. If anything, the writing pokes fun at ""reality"" television and how producers manipulate things behind the scenes. (Knowing this does not stop me from binge watching Real Housewives shows every once in awhile.) While the overall tone is light and fun like most rom coms, the author does a good job incorporating heavy subjects into the storyline, such as mental illness.The pacing in the second half slowed down a bit, but things picked up towards the end. The story has heart and I recommend it to anyone who loves a good happily ever after story.Thank you to Atria Books for providing me with an advance copy! All thoughts expressed are my honest opinion."
"This unconventional ""Happily Ever After"" is one of the best books I've read this year!This story unfurled in such a natural progression, it felt so real, nothing forced or contrived, which is absolutely counterintuitive for a book centering around a dating show a' la The Bachelor.Let me preface this by letting you know I absolutely despise the fake crap that is a show wherein people debase themselves to ""win"" the ""love"" of a stranger. However, the love that grew between Charlie and Dev was absolutely beautiful and they are so so damn imperfectly perfect!! I love them both so much!I was struck by how realistically mental illness and neurodiversity was handled, as it is something common (which it SO is), and the notion that seeking professional help is not only accepted, but necessary. That the overall message was that you can be dealing with issues, and still be worthy of all the love in the world. That you need to be healthy for you, before you can be healthy for anyone else.And the queer rep hit so much of the LQTBQIA+ spectrum. And it was so normative, just a part of these wonderful, multi-faceted characters, not their main, defining trait. And did I mention the racial diversity of the cast? Truly, this book is so deliberately and consciously inclusive, but in a totally organic way that never felt artificial or forced.I read this book in one sitting, immediately pre-ordered a physical copy from Amazon, and I will be recommending it to everyone I can!I also received an eARC of this book from the publisher, and am leaving this honest review voluntarily."
"I enjoyed the hell outta this book. It’s so unique and consistently hilarious with wonderful MCs, but it’s also deeply emotional and heartwarming and angtsy and swoony and sweet. It’s absolutely one of my fave reads of the year.There are so many things I love about this book:• MCs Charles and Dev are adorable and wonderful• The humor - I laughed my @$$ off. This had me LOLing on like the second or third page and then every few paragraphs thereafter• The unique premise/setting - the Bachelor-type TV show where Dev works as a producer and Charlie is the “prince” looking for love is really fun and outside-the-box• The fantastically diverse cast - we get characters of many ethnicities and sexualities represented here and it’s beautiful• The spotlight it shines on mental health - depression, panic attacks, severe anxiety, OCD and mental health stigma are highlighted and handled in an authentic and sensitive mannerOne of my favorite aspects of Dev & Charlie’s relationship is whenever Dev comes to a realization about Charlie’s needs, he doesn’t dismiss him or judge him (like when Charlie voiced a concern about people touching him without permission). Every time Dev learns something new about him, he immediately changes his behavior where necessary so Charlie will feel more comfortable. Looking out for Charlie’s mental and emotional well-being (and preventing any anxiety triggers for him) became second nature for Dev. I loved that. 🥺🥰I received a digital ARC from NetGalley and Atria Books but it does not impact my review."
"🔥🔥2/5 Steam RatingIf you’re in the mood for a fluffy romance, this book isn’t for you. However, if you’re looking for a witty & sweet romance that’s also deep and will give you all the feels… you’ve come to the right place!I think I can go on about this book all day, so let me summarize it for you.𝐖𝐇𝐀𝐓 𝐈 𝐋𝐎𝐕𝐄𝐃:• The witty one liners had me laughing and messaging a friend with them!• All the representation in this book!!! Neurodivergent MC, an Indian MC, and an interracial relationship• So much LGBTQIA+ representation 🏳️‍🌈; this book dived into what asexual is an the spectrum that can be seen. There were also three characters that used they/them pronouns which I LOVED seeing written so casually. So much of the LGBTQIA+ community had representation in this story!• The focus on mental health; especially OCD, anxiety, and depression• 𝐂𝐎𝐍𝐒𝐄𝐍𝐓!!! So rarely do you see characters asking for consent, so I loved seeing it repeatedly done!• Parisa is the best wing women; we all need someone like her in our lives!• Even though this story covered deep topics, it was still witty, charming, and so sweet.Looking back, the only thing I wished was different, was that it was written in first person. I think it would have been a bit more impactful and a touch easier to remember who’s POV I was reading. With that said, it didn’t impact how much I loved this book!Thank you @atriabooks & @netgalley for this #gifted ARC. These opinions are my own."
"This is such a charming and heartfelt novel! There is so much wrapped up in this package that I'm almost at a loss of where to start. Dev and Charlie have wonderful depth and character creativity that has you rooting for their ship hardcore. The mentions of different aspects of mental health, OCD, coming out, workplace discrimination and different sexual representations fit so well together.My favorite part of the whole novel is the underlying message of healing yourself and that love will not heal someone fighting a personal battle. Self acceptance of mental health issues and seeking out assistance and healthy resolutions to ease the internal storm. It truly makes you think about how much you put before yourself - work, school, relationships, etc. Cochrun truly put soul into this novel and you feel it shinning through the characters.Though this is listed as a romcom I found myself getting misty-eyed more than lauging out loud. Not necessarily a bad thing considering the depth Cochrun put into this. However, I was hoping for more on the humorous side overall. Slightly longer than I expected and the pace does slow in a lot of areas. Overall though, I was hands-down smitten with Charlie and Dev. I adored this novel.I would recommend this to readers looking for a wonderful LGBTQ love story that brings mental health awareness to the table and tugs at your heart strings in the best way possible. Thank you Atria Books and Simon & Schuster for the gifted digital copy in exchange for an honest review!"
"The Charm Offensive is a book that I wanted to take a chance on given the blurb. I am SO glad I did, as this is definitely one of the best books I've read this year. I was drawn in from the beginning by its beauty, awkwardness and heart.Charles ""Charlie"" Winshaw is Prince Charming, the lead on Ever After, which is a Bachelor-style reality show. He's brilliant, awkward and gorgeous, which makes him the perfect lead. Dev Deshpande becomes Charlie's handler on set and Dev has always been a romantic at heart, so his position on the staff of the show feels like the perfect match for him.Both Charlie and Dev have their own issues they are dealing with. Neither of them has really ever been vulnerable enough with others to open up, but that changes when they begin to open up to one another. They both are struggling in different ways and we learn through these two amazing characters that taking care of ourselves (both physically and mentally) and leaning on those who care about us is a must even if it is difficult. It also shows that you have to learn to love yourself along your journey.Alison Cochrun did a an amazing job with this novel. I not only enjoyed Charlie and Dev and all that developed between the two of them, but the cast of characters who supported them were equally as endearing, unique and diverse. I really appreciated the focus on mental health in this book as well. It's not talked about nearly enough and it is so important. I highly recommend this book!"
"Thank you so much to Atria for my advance copy of The Charm Offensive! I can't express how much I loved this book. I melted into a puddle of emotional goo. I read it along with my book club and we were so fortunate to be able to have a Zoom chat with Alison Cochrun! I was blown away when she told us that she wrote the first draft of the book in SIX days! I am not a huge Bachelor fan, but I definitely appreciated that part of the story line. Charlie becomes the next Prince on Ever After, a popular dating television show. He is not the ideal person for this position, but he has his reasons for leaping out of his comfort zone. When filming starts, he realizes he may not be able to pull this off after all. Dev has devoted himself to the production of the show for the last six years and after a turn of events, finds himself taking over the role of Charlie's handler/coach. What comes next is a story full of great banter, flirtation, discovery, and the best mental health representation that I have ever read in a book. I applaud the rawness and openness on the topics of depression, anxiety, and OCD. I flew through the chapters... I had so many emotions in the short time that it took me to read the book. My heart broke and swelled for Charlie and for Dev. I could not get enough. I was swept up in this not-so-fairytale story of two perfectly imperfect people. I felt like I had a front row seat to this show and the characters were so real. And that includes all the side characters!"
"This is a m/m romance that was sent to me from the editor. This is a DARLING book and I enjoyed ever minute of reading it. I'm not sure if people who watch The Bachelor will like this because it might deflate their belief in the show after reading this book which is set mainly in the background of a similar fictional show (I personally dislike ""reality"" TV). Dev, a twenty-something man, is a producer who believes in happily ever after after seeing this show as a young boy. Even after working on the show for several years and a recent breakup with one of the other producers, Ryan, he vociferously defends HEA's. He's usually in charge of the women vying for the bachelor and he's got it down to an art, however, Dev's being promoted to the care of, and corralling of the new bachelor, Charlie. Charlie is a tech CEO with a number of issues - OCD, anxiety, and germ phobia. Dev is thrown in the deep end with Charlie, starting with Charlie vomiting on Dev's shoes. This story progresses with Dev and Charlie helping each other and becoming closer before a realization hits Charlie. I loved how naturally the changes they each went through evolved in this book and the other crew members that basically formed a tightknit friendship among them even if they all didn't realize it. The ending was amazing.Thanks to NetGalley for providing this book in exchange for an impartial review."
"We just loved this one! The premise hooked us - lead of a Bachelor-style TV show falls for his (male) producer? Yes, please! - and then the execution gave us a compatible couple and adorable love story on that backdrop. Dev and Charlie are both working with their own mental health struggles, and seeing them support each other throughout the relationship was wonderfully heartwarming. Also the sexual tension was real!!!In addition to the love story, the Bachelor-style TV show backdrop perfectly encapsulates the reason why we watch. (One of our favorite lines references the ""large conservative fan base"" and the ""even larger feminist fan base that claims to watch ironically"" - we feel seen and called out in equal measures!) For a faithful viewer of the Bachelor franchise (she hesitates to say ""fan"" but she's watched every season since 2003) who also calls herself a feminist and claims to watch for the producer interference, this book was the culmination of every Bachelor fantasy. Cochrun serves us with the behind-the-scenes producer manipulation and storyline construction while also managing to give us that ooey-gooey lovey-dovey feeling we really want when we sit down to watch.Keep the CWs in mind (check them out at Cochrun's website) and then dive in!This objective review is based on a complimentary advanced reader copy of the novel."
"THIS BOOK IS EVERYTHING! I was excited about an LGBTQIA+ themed forbidden romance set within the world of a heteronormative reality dating show, but worried about the relationship possibly being more secretive (shaming) than celebratory. However, Alison Cochrun has done a fantastic and sensitive job of creating a world in which pure love does exist.The Charm Offensive is the story of reality TV producer, Dev, who is reassigned to be a ""handler"" for the male contestant, Charlie. Almost immediately, the two bond, but the show's expectations and their life experiences create a complex tension and steamy chemistry that drives this novel forward. I love so many of the characters in this book and want each of them to get their own versions of happily ever after!I especially appreciate the way the author has included a diverse group of queer characters, including those on the asexual spectrum without it being forced or a negative stereotype. Mental health also plays a large role in the storyline, and neurodiversity, including OCD, depression, and anxiety disorder is handled with care. This book could have gone off the rails with the wrong author, but Alison Cochrun skillfully delivers a beautiful love story. I highly recommend it!Advanced gifted copy by publisher for honest review."
"Firstly, I should like to start by thanking NetGalley and Aria Books for providing me with an e-ARC in return for an honest review. Let me say that this is one of the easiest honest reviews I have ever been able to write. Not since Red, White and Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston have I been so excited to have read a book. The Charm Offensive is definitely top for me of all the books I have read so far in 2021 and I know like Red, Hot and Royal Blue I shall have to reread it.I think that Alison Cochrun's students have been especially blessed to have had her as their teacher but I think Alison should concentrate on writing.I don't like retelling stories in my reviews. I like to leave a lot for the reader to experience and find out on their own. To say that I totally loved this book would be an understatement. The story reaches out to so many people and thank you Alison for showing that fantasy endings can and should happen in the LGBTQ community. I am sure fans of the Bachelor and Bachelorette might be a light perturbed but I truly wish that ABC would do LGBTQ versions of their shows. Not only did the book highlight gay and lesbian relationships but it went one step further and tackled in a minor way interracial relationships.So many other issues were touched up and were done so in a very touching and professional manner. Nobody could ever be offended by the contents of this.I found it charming, provocative, and I didn't want to put it down. Usually we tell people to ""not quit their day jobs"" but I would say to Alison "" please oh please quit your day job"". I cannot wait to read this again and for your next book.This is a must read for lovers of reality and fantasy television, LGBTQ relationships and romances that are not typical or predictable. Was a very easy 5 stars to give."
"I don't know where to start with how much I loved The Charm Offensive. Alison Cochrun's debut novel is incredible and powerful in the way that it discusses mental health and queerness.CW: obsessive-compulsive disorder, severe anxiety, severe depression, biphobia, queerphobia, misogyny, dismissiveness of mental healthDev and Charlie were a couple that I found myself invested in wholeheartedly. I loved the two of them together and how they were able to bring out the best in each other. They understand each other and are willing to push themselves outside of their comfort zones to make the other happy. This was a slow-burn romance that just made sense with who the two characters are.I loved the way that mental health and queerness/sexuality were discussed in this book. Cochrun shed light on the side of depression and anxiety that we often don't see, the not so pretty side. I found it to be relatable and beautiful. I loved that both Charlie and Dev learned to love the parts of themselves that were hard to love. I also appreciated the way that therapy was normalized.This book is a must-read for anyone struggling with their mental health or sexuality. Please just read this book you will not regret it."
"4.5 stars.The Charm Offensive was adorable. I can’t resist a “The Bachelor”-esque reality TV premise, and seeing this was a LGBTQ story as well? SIGN ME UP.Charlie is a socially awkward tech genius who is on this dating show to get back into the tech world after a problem at his previous company. He’s there to “fall in love” with one of his female contestants but instead finds himself falling for his producer, Dev.What was so great about The Charm Offensive is how it discusses and deals with mental health. It’s such a big part of this story, but instead of taking away from the romance, it adds to it. Charlie has lived most of life with OCD and anxiety and throughout The Charm Offensive, he emotionally grows and discovers that he (and everyone who struggles with mental health) is worthy of being loved.Both Dev and Charlie make mistakes but they both grow from them. I loved how the characters were so fleshed out and we got to know them so well. It made it so easy to root for their happily ever after.I loved The Charm Offensive and I’ll be watching for more from Alison Cochrun.Thank you to NetGalley for the review copy."
"Ms. Cochrun has written a fun book that will, I think, be enjoyed by many. Readers follow Dev and Charlie, all the while wondering if there will be a “happy ever after” for them and if so, with whom? You may think you know and you may even be right and yet, this is still a book that is easy to spend time with.I enjoyed the notion of setting a book on the set of a reality tv show. I don’t watch shows like The Bachelor but this may seem familiar to fans of such series. I liked the behind the scenes story. I also enjoyed the character sketches and the over the top way that the contest was portrayed.Gay relationships are a part of this story. Readers early learn that Dev has been hurt by another man who works on the show. Will he move forward and find love? Will Charlie who is supposedly brilliant in business but lacking in how to deal with others find what he is looking for? Read the book to find out.By the way, spend a minute to think of what the title of the book does or may mean. I had a few thoughts on this.Many thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for this title. All opinions are my own."
"A clever and timely BIPOC/LBGTQ romance about an endearing reality show producer named Dev falling for the charming and awkward contestant Charlie Winshaw. Witty and brimming with tender chemistry, this is a romance I want to hug and reread! A brilliant and heartwarming debut!Dev is a hopeless romantic and has been working on the reality dating show “Ever After” for years. So when Dev becomes the new handler for Prince Charming Charlie Winshaw, he can’t help but fall for the computer genius who sees the real Dev. The only problem is Dev is forbidden to start a relationship with one of their contestants, and to top it off, everyone thinks Charlie is straight.A mix between “Red, White, and Royal Blue” and the “One to Watch,” this is a book that is the perfect mix of angst and comical. It probably helps that I’m already a huge reality television fan, but Dev and Charlie make this book lovable and compulsively readable. With all the longing looks and sweet overtures, I found myself completely falling in love with this couple. Fun from start to finish, a romance that will most likely be in my top ten of the year!"
"Calling all fans of The Bachelor and romance—The Charm Offensive is the book for you! This book takes place on a fictional dating show called Ever After. Our two main characters are the Prince (the Bachelor character) and one of the show’s producers!Charlie, the lead for Ever After, is the most precious cinnamon roll. I fell for him as soon as he appeared on the page. To the outside world, Charlie seems extremely intelligent and standoffish. But, in actuality, he’s shy and anxious.Dev, one of the producers on Ever After, is a hopeless romantic. He believes in the show’s mission of people finding true love-- even though no one else on the staff shares that belief. When Dev meets Charlie, he’s determined to help Charlie fall in love.Little do they know, Charlie does find love...with Dev.Read this book if you like:Friends to loversBooks that make you laugh out loudCinnamon roll charactersThe sweetest romanceAmazing representation and conversations discussing the importance of representation in the media"
"Thank you so much to the publisher for gifting me this physical ARC in exchange for my honest and unbiased review (Release Date | 07 September 2021)SYNOPSIS | Dev is a believer of true love & has worked as a producer on the set of a bachelor-style reality tv show for many years (Ever After). This year, the prince of the show is a rich tech nerd in need of an image reboot (Charlie). Dev is tasked with helping him get comfortable on camera to make this the best season yet except Charlie doesn't fall of any of the female contestants... he falls for Dev.WHAT I LIKED:- a whole host of topics are covered including LGBTQ+ representation on main stream media, anxiety, mental health, depression & therapy- the behind the scenes into the chaos of filming a reality tv show- the slowly creeping up on you romance was very sweet- the overarching vibe of every person, no matter what they are dealing with, is worthy of loveWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:- closed door romance- I kept forgetting that Dev was Indian"
"WOW. I'm obsessed. This is the best book I've read in 2021. It's going to become an instant hit. The Charm Offensive is EVERYTHING you want in a queer rom com. It's funny, charming and full of amazing reps. Dev has wanted a fairy tale romance all this life but never believed it was for him. He works on a bachelor type reality show, he helps people fall in love all the time. Insert Charlie who is the shows next 'Prince Charming', he's trying to rebuild his reputation. Charlie and Dev form a friendship. They confide in each other and eventually realize their bond goes much deeper. I loved Charlie and Dev so much. Their intimate conversations felt so real and vulnerable. I don't wont to spoil too much of this story but I couldn't have loved it anymore. I loved the OCD, Mental health and other representations. The author handled these topics with ease and grace. I loved how easy this book was to read. It was like you were hanging out with your best friends. I haven't stopped thinking about this book since I finished it! LOVE!!!!"
"Okay. I absolutely loved, LOVED this book! It has romance, diverse characters, LGBTQ+ romance, mental health awareness, and just great writing!I want to talk about the mental health a little bit. This book has both main character struggling with different mental health situations, and both of them try to keep it from people. I really appreciated the focus on this throughout the story. Mental health is so important to me. Making it the forefront of this story was wonderful. I loved the acceptance and growth that the characters have as the story goes on!The romance was wonderful. I was so connected to these two characters and I loved watching their relationship bloom! There are some absolutely wonderful supporting characters that I fell in love with too.All I can say is that this book has 𝒄𝒉𝒂𝒓𝒎𝒆𝒅 me and if you love rom-coms you should read this! Pub day was yesterday, so go grab it!!I was provided a gifted copy of this book for free. I am leaving my review voluntarily."
"I'm struggling a bit to find the words to do this book justice! It is real, complicated and so incredibly sweet. It showcases mental health and queer themes in an incredibly thoughtful way. I loved everything about The Charm Offensive!The premise of the plot centers around tech genius Charlie who goes on Ever After, a reality dating show, to rehab his image and get his career back on track. Problem is, Charlie as a contestant is pretty much an immediate disaster that producer Dev is assigned to ""handle,"" if there is any chance to save his beloved show.I absolutely adored Alison Cochrun's writing and the way she created such deep characters and an engaging storyline. This book melted me in a way that very few romances have, I am pretty sure I literally swooned while reading this! I am hoping there is a Daphne book next but will be reading whatever Alison Cochrun writes going forward. Even her acknowledgments and message to her students hit me!Thank you to NetGalley and Atria Books for an advanced copy of this and the opportunity to share my honest review. All thoughts and opinions are my own."
"The Charm Offensive is absolutely a charming, addicting, and slightly over-the-top book…kind of how I expect the reality drama show in the book would be.The two main characters, Dev and Charlie, are obviously going to get together in the end but that doesn’t ruin the book for me at all because, again similar to reality tv shows, it’s mostly about how we get there and the journey rather then the actual ending.The author also tackles a lot of major issues such as LGBTQA+ representation, racism, asexuality, mental health and therapy. But the way she handles these issues is almost really casual but still incredibly telling and inspiring? I love how they were issues that affected the characters but it didn’t feel too preachy. It just was.The diversity in the cast is incredible, but I kept forgetting that Dev is supposed to be Indian. I felt like in real life this is something that would have come up more, especially considering how talked about the rest of the issues are. Some characters are just the way they are and it’s accepted but others are still learning their truths which feels accurate of the real world. And it was nice to read about someone coming out and everyone just being like okay cool. Also, did anyone else keep forgetting Dev was supposed to be taller than Charlie?!This book is romantic, funny, inspiring, dramatic and an incredible joy to read. If you love those trashy (in the best way) romantic TV shows then you 100% have to give this book a shot. There’s nothing to hate about it!"
"Whew, I needed this adorable read right now! Lately I've been reading some duds and this was a great change from that. It's a bachelor style reality show where the leading man falls for his producer, such a cute premise! Add in that it's a gay romance and I'm hooked already.Dev loves working on Ever After because he believes in true love and likes seeing couples get together. Charlie has never been attracted to anyone but is going on the show as a way to show his old company that he can appeal to investors and pass as neurotypical. From the beginning, Dev knows just how to talk to Charlie when he's panicking and makes him feel safe. The guys had a great connection and as it grows, it's clear they're meant to be.I thought this was fun, sweet, and an easy read. There are some explicit romance scenes and language as this is catered to an adult audience.I voluntarily read and reviewed this book and all opinions are my own. Thank you to Atria Books and NetGalley for the copy."
"This book has the charm and feel of Red White & Royal Blue with a lot more will-they-won't-they push and pull to it. In other words, I loved it.Dev has depression and doesn't believe he's worthy of love (despite his love of love stories and belief in the fairy-tale endings he orchestrates for his reality dating show). Charlie has OCD and anxiety and doesn't believe he's worthy of love -- and also doesn't know he's gay.It's a lot to unpack, and it's handled *beautifully.* Just. Chef's kiss. As someone with mental illness (and a therapist - the 'we're all in therapy' moment was beautiful and relatable) who is queer, this book was everything I wanted. I cried rather a lot and was very emotional throughout and never wanted it to end.The entire cast of characters was wonderful and I want them as my friends now, please. (Except Maureen. She was a terrible person.) Alison Cochrun has just pole-vaulted onto my list of absolute must-read favorite authors.I received a review copy of this book."
"I really enjoyed this book a lot. Even though I'm really not about dating reality TV at all, I also really liked the way this played around that setting to build this surprisingly sweet and delightfully funny queer romcom.  This book includes a very diverse cast in a lot of different ways, characters that cover a sexuality specrtrum: gay, lesbian, bi, ace; characters that are multiple different races and cultures, and of course characters that live with mental health issues.  I love this representation, and the way that it feels natural and unforced.As for the romance itself, both Dev and Charlie are likable characters, each with their own trauma and past history, but who see each other and start falling in love within the context of this fake dating show. I laughed and I empathised, and I definitely was cheering them on, and no spoilers but I loved the end in a lot of different ways.If you're looking for a fun romcom with heart, you should definitely check out The Charm Offensive."
"My heart is so full after reading this book. While I’m not a Bachelor Nation fan, reading One to Watch last summer proved I can love a reality dating show book without actually watching the shows.Dev and Charlie are perfectly imperfect main characters that you can’t help but root for. They are raw and real as they struggle with identity, mental health, and loving themselves. From the moment we met Charlie my heart squeezed as he struggled with his anxiety and Dev helped alleviate his discomfort.The story is so tender and I felt like I was experiencing the vulnerability and intimacy alongside our leads. It highlights the toxicity of reality television, the sexiness of consent, and learning to trust someone with every part of yourself. And I loved the diverse and supportive cast of secondary characters.I could keep gushing but instead I’ll just say read this beautiful story!Thank you Atria Books and NetGalley for my copy in exchange for an honest review."
"Alison Cochrun is a new author to this reader and this ""The Charm Offensive is a first time story read.  Where to start...I wasn't sure whether or not to read this ARC as my typical genre is historical romances .  I decided to give it a try and was quite surprised to read a delightful romance comedy.  I loved the banter between the characters and frankly, Dev was annoying to me at the beginning but I warmed up to him as the story continued.  This was a new and refreshing story that did not take me long to read because it kept my attention to the end.Although I like reading stories where the characters have flaws to overcome, however this one had more than I anticipated. I do believe both characters had to fix quite a bit in their lives and had to come to the realization that it must be you as the person to work through them to get you to your happiness.  Not much into same sex romance stories, however this debut by Ms. Cochrun was heartfelt and a nice comfy read."
"Thank you NetGalley for an advanced copy of THE CHARM OFFENSIVE by Alison Cochrun. My favorite thing about this book was the behind-the-scenes on a reality dating TV show. I don't even know for sure how much of it was accurate, but I still loved the feeling of seeing what that's like. I've only seen like 1 1/2 episodes of The Bachelor, but it's prevalent enough in the collective media culture that I have my opinions on it and this book only solidified them, while also showing the possibility of a happier future where people get to celebrate who they really are instead of hiding it away, where reality shows could actually reflect a more diverse America. Both Dev and Charlie were lovely main characters with plenty of depth and growth and chemistry and I really appreciated the representation of mental health in this book as well. Basically, this book was lovely and I flew through it. It had great tension, great voice, and a great moral. I recommend it!"
"The Charm Offensive by Alison Cochrun is an awesome, witty, sassy, and perfect contemporary romance that I thoroughly enjoyed.I am so glad I was able to read this book. The cover and synopsis drew me in, the wonderfully developed character cast, plot, and pacing kept me coming back for more.I loved Dev and Charlie. Both come to the table with their own complicated pasts, hangups, insecurities, and imperfections. However, underneath it all both are lovable, likable, realistic, relatable, and charming. They have great chemistry, and both compliment each other remarkably well. Each seemed to help the other heal, move on, find purpose, and find a future within themselves and with one another. I love it when I get to see a healthy relationship.The author did a great job with balancing out serious issues and diagnoses with humor, banter, wit, and wisdom. A great mix and a great ending.5/5 stars"
"4.25 STARSSet amidst a long-running reality dating show backdrop, “The Charm Offensive” is a unique, diverse take on a more traditional theme.  Not only does it explore the concept of love while showcasing relationships in its varying forms, but it also addresses mental health issues that so often go untreated and even ignored.Boasting a writing style that is both witty and heartfelt, I was easily drawn into the story right from the get-go. The two main protagonists were exquisitely charming in their mutual fallibility and bearing witness to their burgeoning love connection was quite endearing.  However, I felt the author was trying a bit too hard in her efforts to demonstrate normality by depicting only characters that furthered this agenda.  Still, I applaud her endeavor to shine a spotlight on the true meaning of love and to finding it in the most unlikely of places."
"I love Dev and Charlie so much (and all the side characters tbh). Their story is beautiful and If you’ve ever watched The Bachelor (ironically or not) or Unreal you’ll appreciate this book.Maureen’s little tirade near the end of the book is (sadly) exactly how I imagine the behind the scenes of the bachelor playing out. I would give ANYTHING to see a season of The Bachelor play out exactly how this book did.The Charm Offensive made me laugh out loud and swoon hard but I also learned so much. There is a ton of representation in here, LGBTQ+ rep, ace/aro spectrum rep, mental health rep. I loved the dialogue about acceptance and figuring out who you are and that there is no timeline or deadline for learning more about yourself. These are the conversations and this is the content I wished I had been reading all my lifeThank you so much for this arc. What a delight."
"Charlie Winshaw agrees to appears on Ever After, a bachelor type reality show to find love and save his professional image.  Dev Deshpande is his production handler tasked to coach him through the next nine weeks, ensuring he bonds with the contestants and succeeds in finding his true love.  When Charlie falls instead for Dev it makes the process easier and more difficult.  He realizes his only Happily Ever After includes Dev instead of a woman, but how can that happen without breaking his contract and Dev losing his dream job?The Charm offensive gave me all the feels.  Written with amazingly developed characters, who are broken, strong and resilient, this rom-com was so unexpected.  The realistic storyline faces difficult, current social issues with ease.  Charlie & Dev are fantastic together with off the charts chemistry.  It has to be one of my favorites this year!"
"Ok everyone, get out your library card or credit card because this book right here is one you are going to want to order IMMEDIATELY… this is not a drill!! 🚨The Charm Offensive  is easily in my top favorite books of the year. I wanted to absolutely devour it but at the same time, I never wanted it to end! I read the last page and seriously considered restarting the book all over again because I wasn’t ready to leave Charlie and Dev’s world. 🥰I could blabber on and on about how fantastic this book is, but instead I’m going to give you my 5 best reasons why you NEED to read/preorder right this very second:1. Dev and Charlie are the most endearing characters ever. I could not get enough of their banter! (the same level of fun and spice as Emily Henry-type dialogue!!) 😍2. There was fantastic mental health representation! So many scenes where this was the forefront and it was done authentically. 👍🏻3. You will find yourself unintentionally smiling through the majority of the book (I got a lot of strange looks when reading this in public and laughing out loud!)  😁4. It takes place on the set of The Bachelor… need I say more? There is PLENTY of drama and the author calls out the flaws of the show accurately while still making it fun to read. 💃🏼5. Reading this book feels like an escape into a fairy-tale…but one with modern issues, genuine characters, and a happily-ever-after that won’t make you roll your eyes. 🥰If you like the bachelor, Emily Henry books, or adored Red White and Royal Blue, you are going to fall head over heels in LOVE with The Charm Offensive! 💕"
"""You're not obligated to figure it out, or come out, or explain yourself to anyone, ever. But also, labels can be nice sometimes. They can give us a language to understand ourselves and out hearts better. And they can help us find a community and develop a sense of belonging""I adored this book beyond measure!Let's just start with all the rep though: Indian-American gay mc with clinical depression, gay mc (possibly on the ace spectrum) with anxiety disorder, OCD and panic disorder, Chinese-American bi character, lesbian character, Black ace biromantic character with anxiety, non-binary queer character, Muslim pansexual side character, Black bisexual character. NO ONE was cishet. Okay that's a joke, but I am so full of love for all of these beautiful queer characters.This book is about a reality TV show called Ever After. Dev Depshande has been a producer on the show for 6 years and he's put in charge of the new prince, Charles Winshaw, after the other producers struggle to make him fit the mold of the show. Dev believes the show can really help people find love and he works hard to help Charlie open up and work on accepting himself in order to help him find that love. Everything gets a little chaotic from there.Romance tropes within this book: idiots in love, there's only one bed, fake dating (in a lot of different ways), kind of forced proximity, kind of workplace romance, KIND OF the grumpy characters is only soft for the sunshine character, etc.There is so much to appreciate about this book. I would say it almost ends up on the side of too sappy, but what else should a romance be? It has my whole heart. There's in-depth plotline about mental health, mental illness, trauma, learning to accept romantic and platonic love, caring about yourself enough to work to be healthy. I appreciated that the mental health issues contained in those book didn't just feel like a plot-device that was quickly dealt with. I really, as the reader, felt seen in these queer characters.I also trul.y enjoyed how the book was laid out. Each section was an episode of the show and I think this is another book that could easily transition into a movie!All in all this was a gorgeous debut and I can't wait for more from Alison Cochrun! I would recommend to EVERYONE!Thank you to NetGalley and Atria Books for my ARC!"
"Delightful!  Charlie is probably the absolute wrong man to be on the reality dating show Ever After.  He's got social anxiety and, even more important, well he's not really into women.  Or anyone for that matter.  So why do it?  He needs to rehabilitate himself publicly and boost his tech company.  Dev, the producer of the show, has recently broken with his long time love.  He takes Charlie in hand at first because he needs his work to work and the show to entice viewers.  It quickly becomes apparent, to Dev if not to Charlie, what should happen.  This has a wonderful cast of diverse characters, a great sense of humor and a happy ending.  Thanks to Netgalley for the ARC.  It's a very good light read about learning to love yourself."
"I’m going to attempt again to put my intense feelings about this book into words, but nothing I can say will do it justice imo. The Charm Offensive has been on my radar for the past several months. My arc-reading book club decided early on that it was a must-read for the summer for us. I knew--I just knew--that this book was going to hit every mark for me, so I kind of put it on a precious pedestal until I felt truly called to crack it open. When I finally did, it did NOT disappoint.Dev Deshpande is a long-time producer of reality dating show Ever After. He’s a firm believer in fairy tales, but can’t seem to make his own HEA stick. Tech rockstar Charlie Winshaw has recently been cast out of the company he helped found, and has been convinced a stint on Ever After can solidify his spot back in the tech world. Charlie’s a “non-believer” of fairy tales, and his mental health struggles on and off-camera are proving to be one more barrier in his grand plans. Dev is determined to get Charlie to the altar, no matter what it takes.The vulnerability with which Alison Cochrun writes every single one of her characters is mind-blowing. We get to know every single layer of both Dev and Charlie by watching them open up about their depression (Dev) and anxiety and OCD (Charlie). Cochrun invites us in on conversations about the entire spectrum of sexuality and romantic/non-romantic love. She authentically flips the script on (most) reality tv shows, toxic work environments, normalizing therapy, and so much more. Each and every character is well-developed and Cochrun really drives home that EVERYONE is worthy and deserving of a HEA.Charlie, from his first pages, made me feel so incredibly seen. TBH, my OCD has been so ingrained in every fiber of my life for about the last 30-odd years, I think I sometimes forget just how “present” it always is. It’s there in numbers. In digital clock faces. In my prayers. In left shoes that try to encroach upon a line only meant for right shoes. In my nighttime routine of kissing my kids to sleep (and my dog). Anytime I have control of the volume. Snacking--(again with the numbers.) All just part of the daily routine. All part of what keeps my anxiety in check (for now.) I don’t think I’ve ever felt an author did more justice to conversations about mental health.Thank you SO much to Atria Books for a review copy of The Charm Offensive, which is easily one of my VERY favorite books of 2021. I’ll be reading this one again and again."
"When I read the blurb, I thought it sounded like an interesting premise. I've personally sworn off reality dating type shows years ago because they are so darned scripted, so I was curious to see what this new to me author would do with the twists it would obviously take to make it inherently MM. I really enjoyed the push and pull not only between Charlie (who I just wanted to hug) and Dev (who I wanted to hug even harder) but also all the people in both of their lives including the contestants who all added something to the whole. With frank discussions about mental health and the gay community, I found the story to be a refreshing look at all the different ways to find love on all different spectrums."
"BLINDSIDED. I was COMPLETELY BLINDSIDED by the pure perfection of The Charm Offensive. My heart could not and still CANNOT handle it. The Charm Offensive is hilarious, gut wrenching, and an utter roller coaster of emotion - I laughed hard and yet, I cried even harder. It's not only an advocate for the LGBTQ+ community, it is also an advocate for MENTAL HEALTH. Once I was done, I wanted to simultaneously hug the book and throw it at the wall. It's flawless. Dev and Charlie are absolutely priceless.All the stars and all the adjectives, The Charm Offensive will be a book I shove in everyone's face. My goodness. Alison Cochrun has quite the future ahead."
"Oh my God...this book was SO GOOD. It was funny and romantic and so very soft. It was inclusive and educating (but never preachy). The dialogue was hilarious, the love scenes were swoon-worthy, and the grand gesture at the end? No spoilers but my heart was beating so fast in anticipation. I could imagine how the author felt while writing it...to finally be giving the characters (and the readers) the HEA they'd been waiting for. Dev and Charlie might be my favorite romantic couple of the year and this book will undoubtedly be in my top 5.Thank you to the publisher and Netgalley for my complimentary ARC. All opinions are my own."
"The Charm Offensive is an endearing tale of giving yourself permission to be loved.  I absolutely enjoyed Dev and Charlies blossoming affections throughout the pages.  Two men, both making a name for themselves in their careers, will steal your heart with one chance meeting where sparks fly.This book does not shy away from exploring mental health, OCD, depression and the LGBTQA community.  It is packed with so much depth and emotion while still being funny and lovable. The Charm Offensive, all in all, is a fantastic entry in LGBTQA+ romance novels.Thank you NetGalley and Atria Books for the complimentary copy."
"Being a Bachelor/Bachelorette fan, I knew I would like this book. What I didn't know was that it was a book I needed. The discussions around mental health, anxiety, OCD, and depression as well as sexuality are things that I wish we would see and hear when watching Bachelor franchise shows.Alison Cochrun did a phenomenal job of giving life to not only the main characters, Dev and Charlie, but also all the supporting characters. Every thought, feeling, and emotion, I was right there feeling it with them.Bachelor fan or not, this is a FIVE STAR, must read for all!ARC provided by NetGalley in exchange for my honest opinion and review."
"This was such a wonderful rom-com!!! I loved the characters and all their issues!! Dev works on a reality love tv show. His own love life sucks though! Charlie is cast on the show but he doesn't believe in love and only agrees to do the show for his image. As Dev and Charlie spend time together, they realize how much they like each other even though Charlie is supposed to be dating 20 women for the tv show. I loved the mental illness aspects of the book. This is a wonderful book to settle under a blanket and just lose yourself in the story. I received an advanced readers copy and all opinions are my own."
"I was a little unsure of this book going into it, just because I’m not a big fan of reality tv shows but I liked the premise and was the excited about that! Thanks to NetGalley I got to read it early and I must say I loved this book! I loved how there was this connection between Charles and Dev even before it became something more. Alison Chohrun did a great job of not only staying true to the characters and their identities but also in depicting the depth that comes with mental health. I saw so much of myself in the things that Charles was struggling with and that made me be able to relate to him so much better! And I know people who would be able to say the same for Dev. Add to that such a diverse and supporting group of characters and The Charm Offensive has everything you could hope for in an LGBTQ+ Contemporary novel!"
"I really enjoyed this book and devoured it in ONE night! Loved the reality tv trope and thought this concept was timely considering The Bachelor alum Colton Underwood's coming out earlier this year. I also loved all the LGBTQIA+ representation -- gay, lesbian, bi, people of color, women in power -- we need more stories like this on the market.Disgraced tech millionaire, Charlie, is cast as the new love interest on a popular, long running reality dating show with the hopes of rehabbing his tarnished reputation. He soon realizes he has more chemistry with his male producer, Dev, then with any of his female co-stars. Charlie is such a precious main character -- so sweet, authentic and endearing on his journey to self discovery. I fell in love with his character right away. Both of the main characters are dealing with some pretty heavy mental health issues and I loved the way the author handled them. Mental health needs to be talked about and normalized.This is the first book I've read by the author but I will definitely be reading more. I think she may have setup another standalone romance novel at the end (is that just me being hopeful?)TAGS:fiction, romance, contemporary, LGBTQIA, mm romance, male/male romance, queer romance, lgbtqia romance, workplace romance, mental health, depression, ocdMY RATING: 4/5 StarsMY RATING SYSTEM:1 star = I don't recommend the book2 stars = I would not read the book again3 stars = I enjoyed the book4 stars = I liked the book and would recommend to others5 stars = Everyone should read the book; I would read the book again & again*Thanks to Edelweiss, Alison Cochrun & Simon and Schuster for providing a free eARC in exchange for my honest review #Edelweiss #CharmOffensive @edelweiss_squad @AlisonCochrun @SSEdLib"
"I absolutely was blown away with this book. The Charm Offensive is a fun but emotional and moving queer love story. Dev, a producer for a reality dating show, wants nothing more than the happily ever after love story. Charlie, the newest contestant on said reality dating show isn't sure that love stories even exist.  Dev is tasked to  make Charlie the perfect prince but will this story end happily ever after. I requested this book simply because I want to diversify my reading. It was sort of strange to read a story that didn't portray a character that was similar with my own identity, a white cisgender woman.  But as I read I learned so much about identity, love, and mental health that I connected with the main characters in a way I never would of thought I would. I loved the exploration of main characters dealing with mental health issues, the good and bad and everything involved.  Lovable characters, well developed and rounded. Plot was interesting and the story was a quick read. Highly recommend to everyone.Thank you to atria books via netgalley for providing me with an arc in exchange for an honest review."
"This book was hilarious, adorable, and definitely put me in my feelings! Dev is a producer on a Bachelor-esque reality dating show and gets assigned to deal with the season’s lead, a brilliant but awkward tech bro who unlike Dev, does not believe in fairy tale love, and only come on the show to rehab his image. What ensues throughout the course of filming is a hilarious and sweet story full of queer representation and serious discussions of mental health. I enjoyed this book so much and highly recommend it!"
"I loved reading about Dev and Charlie. This book comes across as being a sweet rom-com about a reality TV show, but the author does an amazing job of weaving in what it's like to live with mental health struggles. The characters grow so beautifully, and it's refreshing in a romance for characters to realize that they need to look inward and work on themselves rather than relying on a relationship to fix their problems. It has a great variety of queer representation and is such a heartfelt and funny book."
"An excellent debut with an exciting premise! Cochrun deftly plays with archetypes and subverts expectations. And while luscious descriptions of the myriad of destinations the show travels to aren’t given, each place carries emotional depth for the characters. All of whom are excellently crafted, realistic, flawed and enjoyable to read about. Charlie and Dev’s relationship is the sweetest thing and the strong messages about a variety of mental illnesses helps strengthen the readers’ bond with them. There’s a little miscommunication and a little mess here and there but overall The Charm Offensive is a largely enjoyable read from beginning to end."
"This might be my favorite book of 2021. Following along on Dev and Charlie's journey together and separately was exactly what I needed right now. I loved the care put into representing groups of people in this book: people who know who they are and label it proudly, people who would prefer not to be put into any more boxes, neurodivergent people struggling, but also neurodivergent people learning to thrive. There was so much growth from the beginning of the book to the very last page, and it had me on the edge of my seat in a way most Bachelor/ette seasons don't manage to anymore.Another thing I love is the way Cochrun writes an ensemble. Everyone in this book felt important in one way or another, from Charlie's would-be princesses, to the crew of Ever After, and Charlie's best friend, Parisa. I found myself rooting for all of them in one way or another, because it was clear they were all on journeys and had growing to do alongside our main characters.Overall, a wonderful debut that I know I'll be coming back to whenever I need a book that feels like a warm hug."
"The swoon, the representation, the pace, these characters!! AHHHH! I was so NOT disappointed, I think this will be a favorite for many this year.I am so happy I was able to read this early, it's a romance that will touch your heart and mind.The Charm Offensive is amazing! Grab it now!"
"This book gave me all the fluff, and all the reality tv tropes I wanted, and so much more! The representation in the book is fantastic! The way mental health is dealt with is so good to see. But the one that really got me was asexuality. I wasn’t expecting that and it was expressed so well. It really meant a lot to see that."
"This book is so much more than just a story about a reality TV show contestant and producer. This book is fun, fresh and never once felt preachy as it dives into not only romance on tv, but also how complex loving yourself and others can be, mental health, and has characters finding themselves throughout their journey. I loved every page!"
"The Charm Offensive is THAT book for me! Immediately I laughed and wanted to read more. I loved the characters: Charlie,  Dev, Jules, Parisa. Alison Cochran made them alll so important and nobody left out. This story had a basis around the Bachelor and reality TV dating shows. I found myself doing deep belly laughs at certain points and smiling so big during my whole read. Whoops, I may have even read this in one sitting."
"Better than Reality TV.Why read this book. Why Not? The characters are diverse and natural, even though I don't know any Tech Moguls or TV producers. Dev and Charlie spend the whole book getting to know each other and falling in love and falling in love with themselves."
Thank you so much for the ARC (netgalley) !!This book has potential to be in the top 5 favorites of 2021.Excellent.
"I was in the pits of despair about how difficult it is to find a cute, contemporary romance that's also well-written, when this book came along and brightened my day.The pairing between the two main characters, Dev and Charlie, is pretty flawless. I especially loved Charlie with all his quirks and his forthright nature. I also really enjoyed the character arc for Dev's ex, Ryan, because I think the villain ex trope is too easy.There are conversations in this book between the characters that feels more like a very-special lecture for the reader (at which point I turned to the back cover was not surprised to discover the author hails from Portland) than a real discussion. I also felt the ending was a bit rushed. But, overall, this was a fun book that I devoured in a couple of hours. I would recommend this to any fans of contemporary romance."
"Holy wow! This book was everything! Simply everything.Think the Bachelor with all the pomp and circumstance of a prince looking for his princess, and you will have our fictional show 'Ever After'. Charlie is this year's prince, and he's much different from the contestants who have been on the show for the last 20 years. Charlie isn't looking for love, but he is looking for a way to get back into the good graces of the company he started with his best friend, after being fired. This show is his ticket to normalizing himself to the public, so that he can end the rumors and speculation in the media about his erratic behavior. That might be easier said than done though when even being touched without permission can send him into a panic.Dev is one of the show's producers, and this year is Charlie's handler. It's his job to make Charlie look good for tv, and at the start, Charlie's anxiety and quirky behaviors are making Dev's job pretty difficult. But Dev believes in the show and in each contestant’s ability to find true love through it, so he is bound and determined to make Charlie relatable and likable.As the two get closer, and open up to each other about their own experiences and how that has gotten them to where they are, a beautiful love story developes between the two of them. Only problem is that Prince Charming needs to pick a princess at the end of this show.Alison Cochrun has hit a home run with this book in so many ways. The Charm Offensive is sweet and genuine, it portrays mental illness in such a real way, and it touches on so many of the diverse natures of love in a very authentic and true manner. I laughed out loud, I cried both happy and ugly tears. I'm amazed that this is a debut novel, and I'm so incredibly excited to see what Alison does next!Thanks so much to Alison Cochrun, and to Atria Books who supplied me with an ARC of this book through Netgalley in exchange for my honest review."
This was a lovely and original take on the reality dating show concept that had the two main characters having a real intimate connection that naturally progressed throughout the story. I was fully engaged while reading this story and read it in one sitting. I was enamored with both main characters and their relationship and loved how their bond was explored.This was a story that touched on many important topics with grace and honesty that I completely appreciated because it elevated the story to a more real and personal tone that made it more realistic. I loved this story and loved how the author took chances that paid off.I fully recommend this novel and cannot wait to read more from this author.
"Charlie is an anxious, awkward tech dude with OCD who struggles with relationships and he really just wants to get his job back. Or get a job in his industry. So what is he doing on the reality dating show, Ever After?? Well, he is hoping it helps his reputation and will get him a job.But it’s much harder than he expected. He finds it hard to open up to the contestants, doesn’t love being touched, and practically runs away when one of them tries to kiss him.That’s where Dev comes in. He is Charlie’s handler/behind-the-scenes helper. He believes in true love despite not finding it himself. He works for the show because he believes they help people find love.Well, this season, it’s Dev’s job to get Charlie comfortable enough to open up to the women contestants and look appealing to the audience at home. Through the time they spend together, Dev discovers more about Charlie. About his life, about his mental illness, and about his past. This helps him better understand Charlie and help him through the dating process.But they also happen to be staying in the same suite/hotel room/place throughout the filming of the show. And the more they spend time together, the more they bond and the more they realize I THINK I HAVE FEELINGS FOR HIM.As they begin to understand their feelings for each other and that those feelings are reciprocated, they begin a romantic relationship. Which…as you can imagine, is incredibly difficult to do when they can’t let anyone on the show know. But they make it work.And they are cute and passionate and totally oblivious to how obvious it is that they care for each other lol. People find out but it goes pretty well.It’s not people finding out about them that leads to the problems that come up. It’s Dev and Charlie themselves. Their pasts, their inner demons, and what they think they deserve. As someone who occasionally questions their lovability, I totally understood this aspect of Charlie and Dev’s characters.Although, just because I understood it doesn’t mean I wasn’t yelling JUST BE TOGETHER!! COMMUNICATE!! STOP RUNNING AWAY FROM YOUR FEELINGS!! WTF DEV?!?! CHARLIE, GO AFTER HIM!!But this is a romance so of course they come back together and the way they do is so perfect and so them. It’s romantic and  chaotic and so wonderful.Charlie and Dev, through Alison Cochrun’s writing, imprint themselves on your heart while you read this story. They are perfect in their imperfections.I’ve read books that have mental illness rep before, but not many of them have felt so completely real and right and true for me.Reading Charlie’s characterization was like being punched. I don’t have his same mental illnesses, but it felt like looking in a mirror.AND DEV! I love him and his belief in true love and his doubts about himself and his utter belief in Charlie’s amazingness.The supporting characters are incredible too. Jules is amazing with her snark and her care for Dev and Charlie. She also felt highly relatable to me. Parisa is possibly the best supporting character to ever exist. I LOVE how much she cares for Charlie and how much she’s willing to do for him. She is THE BEST. I also love Skylar and Ryan and Daphne and Angie!! They are all so wonderful and I would probably kill someone to get a Daphne book.I also really like how the book explores reality dating shows, how they exploit people, and how footage can be manipulated to look a certain way. It’s a really interesting part of the book and not something I’ve seen explored before.If it wasn’t obvious, I’m giving The Charm Offensive 5 out of 5 stars. If you’re looking for a fun, complicated, beautiful contemporary romance with Bachelor vibes, PLEASE read this book!"
"Dev is not looking forward to filming the new season of Ever After, especially since he will now be working not with his boyfriend of six years, but his ex. When he gets put in charge of their Prince Charlie, he definitely has his work cut out for him, but their working relationship quickly blossoms into a true friendship, and both are left wondering if there isn’t something more there…It’s hard not to compare this book to the bachelor franchise, so I am not even going to try. If you are a bachelor fan you need to grab this book! It has all the typical bachelor drama we love to see, but mix in a bit of Colton and a bit of Chris Harrison drama. I loved that this book seriously represented everyone. We had almost all levels of the LGBTQ spectrum, anxiety disorders, OCD, panic attacks, and pretty much every skin tone you can think of. I expected a gay love story, but got so much more! Especially when it came to the mental health conversations, the way they were treated in the book was as just a part of who the person was instead of a reason to ostracize them. If you love the bachelor, or love to hate it like I do, you don’t want to miss this one!"
"Screw the “rules”: 6⭐️sI love love LOVED this story! The characters are so genuine and appealing, the story itself is fun and inviting, and on more than one occasion I was talking to my Kindle while reading. I just couldn’t get enough of it!!!The mental health aspect of this story is truly unlike any other I’ve seen (and I’ve seen some great representation!). The issues these characters dealt with felt very real, and I think we need to be seeing more of this as our world and the people in it are experiencing more of it. It is a great way for someone who hasn’t been very exposed to people with mental health issues to gain a better understanding, regardless of the fact that it is from a fiction novel. Standing ovation on this aspect.I really enjoyed the concept of a dating show and all it’s fake aspects, as I do not like those shows in real life. Reading about all of the behind the scenes plots and people and how everything comes together: fascinating lol. I also love that Charlie appears to be pretty standard and typical for the “Prince” of the show, but he could not be more different from what the show thought they were getting!Finally, the M/M love story. I could not love it more. “Falling” into each other’s hearts is how I would describe this one. They just seem to “know” each other right off the bat, and the way their love story unfolds is toe-squishing, squeal-inducing, and will definitely melt-your-heart.As always, you should read and form your own opinion, but I highly encourage you to pick it up and if you want to gush about here, I AM HERE!!!!"
"This book is adorable and very romantic. The premise and the setting on a dating show is so fun, but the story still has a lot of depth to it. I really like the characters - they are complex and flawed, but you are always rooting for them. I especially like the representation of people on the ace-spectrum - very well done and always important!"
"This book has so much: A hopeless romantic who - despite working in the almost heartless reality TV industry - still believes in HEAs for the contestants in a Bachelor-like show. A sweet & traumatized nerd who didn't know he was demisexual till he meets said romantic. A couple of great friends. Some heartbreak & serious chemistry. It was a great read and I will definetly read ""The Charm Offensive"" again."
"I would give this book a hundred stars if I could!I love it so much, my heart is so full right now. I devoured it and also wished I could read it again for the first time! Save to say it's a new favourite.(Also can't wait for Daphne's story!)"
"Gideon the Ninth is a book about a swordfighter named Gideon who is my favorite literary character of all time. Gideon is so witty, so funny, so charming, and such a thorn in Harrowhark’s side. Harrowhark is a necromancer, while also being the main ruler of the Ninth’s planet. Both of these characters are harboring a few secrets of their own, but they are both so unsure of their pasts and their futures for so very many reasons.That is, until one day the Emperor has invited all eight necromancer heirs, from all eight loyal Houses, to compete in unknown trails to possibly ascend into something that will make them immortal, but the costs of losing can very well be their lives. No necromancer can compete without a skilled cavalier by their side, and Harrowhark has no choice but to get Gideon to help her and save the future of the Ninth House.But once Gideon and Harrowhark arrive on the Emperor’s planet, they soon realize that the tasks are going to be much more mysterious and much more difficult than anyone could have predicted. Especially when cavaliers and necromancers from the other houses start getting murdered. Gideon is not only tasked to help Harrowhark, she also has to ensure that she keeps breathing herself, while also trying to figure out who is doing the unspeakable things to other competitors.Tamsyn then leads us on this beautiful adventure, where twist after twist occurs so seamlessly that you can’t help but feel completely enthralled. The writing is so beautiful, so intelligent, and so very impressive. And the way the entire story is told is so very transportive! I mean, this book has one of the scariest settings I’ve read all year, but I felt like I was right there battling for my life, with a goofy smile on my face. And the atmosphere and constant chill while reading? It’s unparalleled and truly an experience like no other.I love this book for many reasons, but I also love it because it’s over the top, and has so many one-liners, and it’s painfully romantic, and the girl gets the girl at the end. And it’s what’s I’ve been waiting my whole reading life for. This is a better, and way more unique, and 100% more impressive version of what straight, white dudes have been publishing in SFF forever. I keep seeing people say that they feel this book is too confusing, the characters too over the top, and the world too complex, but I just don’t feel that way at all. This is the story my sapphic loving heart has been searching for in epic fantasy my whole life. Gideon the Ninth is my f/f loving, literary loving heart’s anthem, and I plan to play it on repeat forever.This book has the best enemies to lovers romance I’ve ever read in all of my years. Yeah, you read that right. In my whole freaking life, this is my favorite. I’m talking OTP for the rest of my days. I didn’t exist before this ship sailed in this first book. And this book also has such a central theme of trust, and what it means to put your trust in another. Also, what it means to be trustful, and the privilege of having someone put their trust in you, unconditionally. And this book also has an amazing discussion on power dynamics and imbalances, and how important it is to be aware of these things while putting your trust in yourself and in someone else, simultaneously.Overall, this really just felt like the book I’ve been waiting my own personal eternity for. This felt like the book of my dreams and my hopes. All I want is ownvoices lgbtqiap+ books, with f/f relationships, with cutthroat girls putting themselves first, but allowing themselves to be vulnerable enough to maybe let someone else get to see a softer side of them. Almost like I’ve been reviewing books for five years now, preparing myself to read and review Gideon the Ninth, even though I know no word combination or sentence structure I could ever come up with could do it justice for this story. Basically, I know this book isn’t going to be for everyone, but if you feel like you have similar reading taste to me, then I implore you to give this one a try. I mean, if the tagline “Lesbian Necromancers in Space” isn’t going to sell you, hopefully my emotional, bleeding heart self can. This book means everything to me, and I hope you enjoy if you pick it up."
"**SPOILERS**This book isn't a bad book, but it's not a great one either. The great failing of it is in its character Harrowhawk. I get that she's not exactly supposed to be likable- but she's damn well insufferable. And not in a fun, anti-hero way. Just obnoxious in an out and out obnoxious way. Also, a fascist, slaver way.The weird skirting around enslavement and slavery also put me way, way off. Like, I would have expected Gideon to be a hell of a lot more pissed off about it- and every chance she could've had for the revenge she obsesses about is passed on due to 'sentiment'- or not capitalized on in the least. It's an unfortunate dynamic to have sentiments for a slaver. Especially now, with where we are in the real world, there's not much redemption to be allowed for fascists. This book goes to great lengths to allow it. There's a lot of work put into trying to work all that out, and it doesn't pan out for the author. Granted, I'm only 3/4's through the book, but the cavalier way it's been treated so far has annoyed me so much I had to put the book down.It's clear where the plot is going- and it doesn't sit right with me that one half of the relationship was literally abused and tortured by the other half. There's enemies to lovers and then there's abused slaves to abusive slavemasters lovers. Uncomfortable is putting it mildly. I also know how it ends, and it's just bad. Real bad. The sacrifice is infuriating.Basically, I expected it to be much, much better- and it could've been, except for Harrowhawk. Seeing that the sequel is all hers just about did it for me. I don't think I'll be revisiting."
"I was really ready to adore this book. Humanity has spread through the universe and (at least part of it) is currently ruled by a necromantic god-emperor who apparently at some point resurrected humanity from extinction (or, at least, a sizeable portion of it?) The Emperor instituted Nine Houses, ruled by powerful necromancers, each with its own character and bailiwick. The empire is tottering, shot through with rot and decay (as you’d expect from an empire built upon necromancy) and most of the Emperor’s champions, super-powered necromancers called Lictors, have fallen over the myriads since the founding of the Empire.And yes, “myriad” is the right word here, used frequently in the book in its archaic meaning of “a unit of ten thousand.” My inner word-geek squealed in delight at this.And our heroine spends most of the book running around wearing an almost-kinda black trench coat, totally ‘80s mirrored shades, and a rapier. And she spurts ‘80s quips like a gay action-hero.This, ladies and gentlemen, is Grade A Brian bait.But…You knew there had to be a “but,” right? Brian only giving three stars to a story that looks like it was based on notes by Clark Ashton Smith but strained through ‘80s action and anime tropes? That blurs the line between sci-fi and fantasy? What gives?What gives is the plot. It’s a mess. Our heroine is enslaved by a sadistic necromancer princess. Their relationship is… plot-convenient? It’s not so much that I didn’t buy it, but rather that I picked up the wrong signals. Our introduction to their relationship felt less like the opening to a romance/buddy cop thing and more like setting the stage of a nasty revenge. Rather than helping us to like both of these characters and straining at the antagonism that separates them, I started off hating the princess and never really warmed to her.These two are summoned by the Emperor to a conclave of the scions of the Nine Houses (each accompanied by a body-guard/champion and no one else) to a decaying palace on a distant world. Once they get there and we’ve met the other scions and their attendant cavaliers, things devolve quickly into Agatha Christie’s Ten Little Indians.Things are made worse by the antagonisms of the various scions. Instead of working together (something that should be the obvious move once you understand the rules of the game, since it’s nearly impossible for anyone to succeed without cooperation), they assume (for no good reason I could discern) that only a few can rise to Lictor in spite of being told outright that it’s the Empreror’s dearest hope that they all achieve that status.But you can’t really blame the scions, because the Emperor himself set this up in an incredibly stupid way. Shuttles we are told are “valuable” are tossed into the ocean and sunk instead of merely being flown away. The rules are poorly explained and even more poorly enforced. Once the secret of attaining Lictorhood is understood, the most devout house of Emperor-worshippers declares that such a thing is blasphemy and does its best to prevent anyone from becoming a Lictor, to the point of actually attempting to murder the other scions.It’s a neat premise described with excellent word-smithing that falls utterly apart if you poke at it at all.Still, it’s a fun read for all that. Just understand that this is a romance/mystery/thriller sort of thing, much more Ten Little Indians meets Jane Eyre in space with skeletons than Dune. Also, it’s of the more prudish sort of romances, where things never get to the point where fade-to-black is necessary. Don’t let the frequent references to dirty magazines and the course language of our protagonist fool you on that point, either. This romance is headed towards a union that is purely symbolic and spiritual, so if you’re looking for torrid lesbian shenanigans, this ain’t your book. If you’re cool with all that, and turning off your brain to avoid “fridge logic,” there’s a fun little romp here for you."
"First off, the novel suffers from the ""reluctant hero"" syndrome - the main character does not want to do what they are pushed to do. In the opening of the book, Gideon wanted to get away and people were trying to stop her - clear goal, clear obstacle. But after Harrowhark takes her to the first house planet, Gideon does not have a real purpose - there are chapters of her going around aimlessly, meeting random characters - it's all just so boring. If there's no goal, there are no stakes and no matter how interesting the author tries to make the world itself, it's going to be boring. And it was.Moreover, Gideon character was the only one in the whole book who thought/talked as a modern person. I understand that there may be a difference between how people express publically and in private, but it was not the case. All the other characters had elevated speech and Gideon had modern. I understand it was an attempt to make the character edgy but it just takes her out of the story context.It's all TELL not show. The basic principle of good writing - show, don't tell. It was all telling - we were told how badly Gideon was treated, but we were never shown, so it's hard to feel empathy for the character. We were told how bad the other people were but never shown - so the readers never get to experience the evilness. For example, in the beginning, we are told how bad the Lady of the Ninth is just rotten, just complete evil incarnate according to Gideon. We were never shown. There was this example that Harrowhark killed her parents and used them as puppets, but we never met the parents, we did not have a connection to them, we never experienced what really happened - it doesn't feel evil, just odd and cartoonish actually. The whole book tried to be so dark with skeletons walking around but what I pictured was old cartoons. It never felt dark, eerie or ominous, more like absurd.The descriptions and there were a lot of them, were very poorly written. It's clear that the author tries to be edgy and unique, but it just didn't work (e.g. comparing a house to a beautiful corpse - I mean you can have a few edgy descriptions but when everything is described like this, it just doesn't really paint any picture). It was a bunch of non-coherent word salad trying to describe these visions and completely failing (at least for me).I managed to read up to 25% and just gave up. There was a big vision and an attempt to write it, but I don't think the author had the skills enough to fulfil it."
"I couldn't finish it. It was assigned reading for my sci-fi book club and I picked it up 3-4 times, made a little headway each time, then dropped it again. It just didn't compel me to read further. The style is cluttered and self-important; I felt like I needed a machete to clear my way through the word jungle in order to follow whatever little story there was. The characters are occasionally funny, but mostly sound like obnoxious smart-ass teens (which I suppose they really are).I stopped when Gideon and Harrow were about to leave the planet of the Ninth House. I just didn't care what happened to either of them and couldn't make myself continue. I think the goths-in-space aesthetics is supposed to make up for everything, but, in my case, it wasn't enough to overcome the sheer reading tedium."
"Harrowhark Nonagesimus, Heir to the House of the Ninth, is in desperate need of a Cavalier. She must be accompanied by one if she is to accept the invitation from the Lord Undying himself and travel to the First House to study to be a Lyctor. Her original Cavalier has flown the coup leaving her with one option: Gideon Nav. The problem is that Gideon hates Harrow and the feeling is mutual. Gideon has spent her whole life attempting to escape the House of the Ninth and join the military. With promises of freedom, Harrow manages to convince Gideon to step into the roll of Cavalier Primary and accompany her off-planet. Studying to be a Lyctor is not what Harrow, or any of the other seven house representatives, expected and the price to be paid to attain this goal may be more than anyone is willing to pay.Necromancers in space. Those are the bare bones of Gideon the Ninth but not even close to all this book is about. The world is very hard to picture and is one of the things that made the first half of this book pretty hard to get through. The reader is thrown unceremoniously into this strange world and you either sink or swim. Many people reviewing this book said they didn't finish it, quitting before getting to the half-way mark. Those are the sinkers. Those of us that pushed through the first half of the book are the swimmers. I can understand why so many people chose to stop reading. I found myself struggling to understand the world, the role that each person played, and how high the stakes were to each character. But I pushed through because the writing was so different than anything I'd ever read before, the characters were fantastic, and I was eager to see where the story was going even if I didn't totally understand what was going on. I was rewarded handsomely for my endeavors.Let's start with the writing. The author has a way of using words in a different context than they are normally used in. Tamsyn uses words like ""nuggety"" and ""robust"" to describe people. Descriptions that make little sense yet you know exactly what the author is trying to tell you. She has a completely unique writing style and I doubt you'd ever be able to confuse it with anyone else's. This was the first thing that grabbed my attention in this book. The second being Gideon. I wholeheartedly have a female crush on Gideon Nav. She's absolutely crackers and mouthy and badass and I will never get enough of her snark. She also makes hilarious and vulgar jokes from the beginning to the end of this book, usually at Harrow's expense, and doesn't think that being in a life or death situation is quite reason enough to stop. I loved it. Yet, she garners your sympathy for the life she lived and you also just want to hug her. I haven't been all up in my feelings over a character like this in a long time. The dynamic between Gideon and Harrow is genius. They hate each other but are now in a situation where they must rely on each other for survival and it's awesome to see that play out on the page.This book does take its sweet time getting to the point. I believe that this story will lose a lot of readers based on this fact alone and it's a real shame. Once you hit the half-way mark in the book things start picking up speed very quickly. The story goes from meandering to full speed ahead in 6 seconds flat so the pacing isn't one of its stronger suits. All of the heirs and their cavaliers are from one of eight houses and I believe that each house represents a different planet. From what I gathered each planet is also quite different. The people hailing from them are all different as well; they share different beliefs, they dress differently, talk differently. The only thing linking them all is their service to the Emperor. The planets and the dynamic between them is one of the elements that is seriously lacking information. I am hopeful that much more will be explained on this front in the next two books. As for this book, the whole story is narrowed down to this one building- which is also hard to describe other than to say it's huge, old, and dilapidated-on this one planet. All the characters are residing here in order to ascend to Lyctor.There are skeletons everywhere. They are used as laborers and housekeepers and cooks. Harrow is able to raise skeletons fully formed from a single knuckle bone but that isn't the case for all the necromancers. Their gifts all lie in different areas and not all of them raise the dead in the way you would imagine. Again, an area that needs more explanation. When reading about raising the dead you can pretty much assume it's going to get dirty. And it does. Downright disgusting. I wasn't expecting the level of blood and gore that I found in this book but it worked.This is possibly the hardest review I've written. This book is extremely hard to explain and because of that my explanations lack fluidity. Just know that this book does have its faults but all in all I found it to be a fantastic story. It has a unique plot, extremely diverse and interesting characters, and the ending left me with a latent need to have the next book NOW. Which isn't going to happen and I'm pretty beat up about it. As stated on the back of the book, Gideon the Ninth is LGBT+ friendly and all different types of people are represented. There are some triggers to be aware of: Violence, Blood/gore, extremely vulgar language, suicide, death of a parent/s, death of a sibling, mass death of children, abandonment, chronic/fatal illness."
"Honestly, I agree with most of the 5-star reviews. Gideon and Harrow  are spectacular characters in a weird and crazy tale.  So, why only 4 stars? Well, here's the problem--the story is confusing. We start with essentially just Gideon and Harrow. That part of the book is a bit slow. Then they show up at the Lyctor trials, and suddenly we have 8 couples (more or less) wandering around. These new characters are not introduced gradually. They're all there and active all at once. The problem isn't helped by the fact that characters are frequently referred to by their house numbers, not their names. For a long time I had difficulty keeping track of who was who. Advice for readers: make a copy or printout on paper of the Dramatis Personae listed near the beginning and keep it with you as you read. I did not do this, but I wish I had -- it would have made the story so much easier to follow. Eventually this problem abates as (SPOILER ALERT!) most of them get killed.It's not that the number of characters is huge -- it isn't. But a more adept author would figure out a way to introduce new characters gradually, so that when you see the name ""Protesilaus"" (for instance) you don't have to look him up. I didn't have any trouble remembering who the members of the Fellowship of the Ring were, because by the time the Fellowship forms, we've known Frodo, Sam, Pippin, Merry, Gandalf, and Strider for many chapters. And Boromir, Gimli, and Legolas are introduced in the Council. (OK, to be completely honest, Merry and Pippin were practically indistinguishable until they became soldiers of Rohan and Gondor.)"
"Oh my god! I don’t even know what I read besides it was the weirdest thing ever and I loved it. Gideon is amazing. I cannot express my feelings besides incomprehensible screaming! At first I was a little confused but as the world built and the excitement and suspense I got so invested. Gideon is just so sad, but perfect, hilarious, and amazing! I want to know these characters, I need the next book now, I want to live in this gothic horror show!"
The book kept me interested enough to finish it but the writing and characters are fairly mediocre. I was 90% of the way through before I could even remember who most of the characters were because they were so poorly fleshed out. Author keeps referring to them by their house number but calling someone the sixth doesn't help me know who that person is and I shouldn’t  need a reference guide when reading a story to refer back to know who you are talking about. The plot twist was so blindly obvious that you couldn't not have ever read a book before if you didn't see it coming. The whole premise of the plot was poorly conceived and the logic of the world itself makes little sense.
"You know the kind of reality TV shows that stick a bunch of really annoying people in a location together and try to generate maximum drama?  And how most of this drama is a result of these people being the worst kind of people and unable to interact like human beings?  That's 100% this book, but in space.(Yes, there's necromancy and swordfighting and stuff, but that is a tiny part of the book compared to the ""drama"" between the awful characters, especially the awful main characters)"
"From the glowing reviews I expected a wonderful read. No. Let's be clear, this book has nothing to do with science fiction. It could count as space opera. The best thing about the book is the cover art. This is essentially an Agatha Christie style isolated island murder mystery. So, what is wrong here? 1. No character development. Even half way through the book I still needed to look up who was who due to there being no differentiation of characters except by how they dressed. 2. World building doesn't live up to (haha necromancy) what are honestly some good elements that never get fleshed out. 3. Plot twists that are never set up. I stopped reading in the last portion because of one of the clumsy twists. Save yourself the time and money. A definite no."
"I finished this book.The plot and setting were engaging and well thought out but the characters were painful.Gideon, the titular and main character, was born in a necromantic convent world very unlike our own. She was raised isolated from any peers except one who tortured her... yet she speaks like a 15-year old internet geek girl from 2010 with turns of phrase and vocabuary that are out of place and unbelievable. Every time I almost suspended my disbelief, Gideon's inauthentic jarring voice dragged me out again. My eyes are literally sore from rolling.There are some great ideas being developed here, but the author needs to separate her own voice from her characters."
"First of all, it became clear quite early that the description of the book was written off the first chapter. The main characters are kept much too busy to read magazines. Which is a good thing! However, I’m not going to say much about what they did because to be fair to the blurb writer, it’s a bit hard to say anything without spoiling important stuff. My only real issue was that characters had multiple names and it was sometimes hard to remember which was being used-luckily they were distinct enough from each other that what they did and how they did it were as informative as names. I was also not wholly happy with the ending. However, getting there was fun. I’m glad I bought the book."
"2.5? 3 Stars?Ugh this book is so damned hard to rate. First of all, it was soo slow, and I had no idea what's going on. The world-building is definitely minimal and continues to be so throughout the book. All the reader knows is that there're 9 Necromancer Houses that serve the Emperor (who we never really see), and there was some sort of Resurrection event ten thousand years ago.The relationship between Gideon and Harrow is so weird, and maybe because it took me a while to read the book, but I just couldn't get into the change in their final relationship. The entire enemies-to-""lovers/best friends"" part felt really faked.Perhaps the worst part of this book is that I didn't understand the antagonist at all. Her motivation wasn't clear. The Emperor left her behind to suffer--she agreed to it? and now she hates him and wants to kill him? So many unanswered questions there. I don't get it.The parts I really enjoyed included the other characters from the other Houses. I loved learning about all the other Houses and their different necromantic powers and the House politics. The mystery also picked up about halfway through the book. Canaan House had great atmosphere, it felt so abandoned and haunted and unreal but beautiful at the same time, especially through Gideon's eyes as comparison to Drearburh.I'm so conflicted about the second book. Will questions be answered? Or will it be the same as this where nothing is answered? What is the enemy that the Emperor is speaking of? Ugh, I want to know but I'm not sure I can withstand reading it."
"This book, and the universe underpinning it, is founded on seemingly fascinating principles. Unfortunately, the writing style in this book goes out of its way to obscure everything to such an extent that, when it finally tries to lift the shroud, the reader doesn't care anymore.The characters are needlessly complex, yet at the same time rigidly typed. The ""romantic tension"" for the main character feels forced. The background stories seem poorly constructed.As far as the plot goes, the book moved so slowly that there is only a faint ember for the sequel to latch on to. And the ending makes a mockery of the rest of the book with how fast the characters suddenly advance in skill.Overall, a great concept, very poorly executed."
"This is more of a dark YA book with characters that may be LGBT but the author never outright says it. The only indication that some characters are LGBT are through minor affectionate scenes and a declaration of ""love"" which frankly I thought was more a declaration of friendship.  The characters themselves at times were unlikeable (won't spoil it) and the story was slow going. I'm sure most people will read it based on the reviews I saw but not my cup of tea. I honestly would have read the next book but this one was so slow going I'd tear my hair out if the second one was the same so I'll pass."
"I really wanted to love this book. Lesbian necromancers in space! Sounded perfect for me, but I was wrong. It’s a poorly executed, overly written bore. This books suffers from trying to be too many things at once. Is it a space opera? A gothic mystery? A fantasy with necromancy? It would have been better had the author stuck to fantasy with a gothic feel. The fact that this is set in space simply doesn’t do it any favors. We get a very desolate, gritty setting, skeletons doing chores and all that, with little modern conveniences, but also space ships??? It’s like the author had this great idea and just decided, let’s set it in space! It doesn’t work. We aren’t given any logic or explanation. We are simply told, hey there are several planets in this universe and we use space ships! Oh, and by the way,  much of this story is told and not shown. Where is this complex book I have heard about over and over again? I’m just not seeing it.Aside from all of that, it’s incredibly boring. A book about necromancy with a foul-mouthed, badass butch lesbian set in space shouldn’t be dull, right? You would think it would be exciting, thrilling even, but no... I just didn’t care about any of it. All the drama between Gideon and Harrow could have been enough to drive this story, but instead it came off as a bit toxic and very tedious. The pacing is uneven, the characters are flat, and the plot takes to long to develop. Sigh.I can’t begin to describe the depths of my disappointment. Judging by the reviews here and everywhere, I suppose I am in the minority. Wouldn’t be the first time. File this under, don’t get the hype."
"Tamsyn Muir’s Gideon the Ninth (The Locked Tomb Trilogy Book 1) is a stunning blend of fantasy, science fiction, and horror. I first became interested in it when I heard it described as “lesbian necromancers in space,” and that isn’t a bad description.Gideon is one of my most favorite main characters. She spends most of the story stalking around in a deep black robe with her face done up in skeleton makeup and her not speaking to anyone. The reason this is so wonderful is that Gideon is an absolutely irrepressible redhead who loves puns and crude humor. So when she finally busts loose it’s just a blast to behold. Harrow is really interesting as well; she seems at first to hate Gideon (Gideon is 18; Harrow is 17), but the relationship proves to be more complex than that.The “lesbian” part of “lesbian necromancers in space” is comparatively subtle in this book in the series, although it’s also very straightforward. Mostly it shows up in Gideon’s tendency to notice other women’s hotness and get distracted by long legs. I expect it’ll become a bit more central in the next novel. I like the way it’s presented as absolutely normal and not anything worth explaining, excusing, or hiding.The genre is really interesting. This is a space-faring society, so it’s science fiction. There’s necromancy, which reads like magic but clearly has some technological underpinnings, giving the story a distinct vein of fantasy running through it, especially because the aesthetics of the space-faring people are not heavy on technological doodads. Wood and marble, for instance, are much more common in the buildings of the First House planet than metal is. I’d also call this partially horror. There are certainly a lot of corpses, a variety of nasty monsters, and plenty of bloody death.One trick I really like is the way in which Gideon talks. She uses very modern vernacular (e.g., “hug it out”). It works perfectly to show how she’s different from the important people around her, those who’ve been raised as royalty, and it gives her a very distinctive feel.There are obviously some interesting things about Gideon. She’s an orphan and no one knows where she’s from. There’s one exceedingly unusual event from her past, and another event that proves she isn’t entirely normal happens in the present. Then something happens toward the end that kind of seems to contradict where those other details were going. The book is carefully-enough written, however, that for the moment I’m trusting the author to get back to that mystery in the next book.My only problem with this book is that the next one can’t come soon enough. I stayed up until midnight reading, and that’s highly unusual for me!"
"The book was very clearly always planned to be part of a trilogy, and does not stand on its own right.The biggest issue with this book is that no amount of beautiful language will ever make up for a lack of story and a disappointing plot full of holes and Deus ex Machina.It's trying really hard (and at times succeeding) to present the world as seen through the eyes of a gritty teenage lesbian (this is not a spoiler; that much is obvious in the first few pages). Sometimes the language is excessively flowery or pretentious, but overall that part is solid. Except, maybe ""deep REM"" sleep. Ahem.However, there are too many mysteries that do not have a reasonable explanation. There is a lot of action, but all of the reasons behind it always come out as a complete non sequitur. In the second part of a book, the situation is similar to what one would see in a mystery novel, except the reader is left in the dark with no meaningful clues, and when new information is revealed, it seems that it was also surprising to the author herself to figure that out."
"This book had me at hello. The beginning grabbed me by the shoulders and shook me violently. Think Star Wars but instead of The Force it's Necromancy. It's modern but medieval, Gothic but Sci-Fi. The cool factor is way up there yes you can judge it by the cover and I can't stop thinking about it all the time even weeks after reading it. I recommend it, but no unconditionally. I give it four stars because after the beginning it turns into a sort of Agatha Christie Murder Mystery where all of the mishmash of characters start playing whodoneit.  I typically don't like these types of stories because I lose track of who is who and I get impatient for the reveal. Also our perspective is Gideon's and like me she doesn't spend a lot of time sussing out the nuances of each character. But again I am hungry for more and I already have the next book on pre-order. The dialogue is beautiful in its banter and the frenemies trope between Harrow and Gideon has me hooked. The trope needed a little more time to grow but I can also understand how Harrow cut the petty cruelty early to focus on her mission, but I wanted that to be drawn out a little more because I'm greedy.  Gideon is also fitspiration I practiced doing chin-ups for Ensigns to clap.  Get it for the world and the dialogue but understand there are a few bumps in the road to navigate, but that didn't keep me from wanting more."
"I'm really struggling with the rating of this book. Does it meet the ""liked it"" threshold for three stars? Is it more appropriately just an ""it was okay""?I threw the book in my cart after hearing a few seconds of a glowing review on NPR. I can't recall everything they said with great fidelity, but I remember that the reviewer, when pressed, said that if it was like anything it was like Game of Thrones (""and NOT like Star Wars"") and that there was some truly beautiful writing (she had used more poetic language to describe the prose). She was mistaken, though. If you're going to compare this book to anything, it ought to be the Hunger Games or Maze Runner or some other throwaway young adult fiction with a manufactured competition-like plot device with a multitude of characters you struggle to remember. And the prose did not spring from any poetic or literary vein. Often, it felt like the kind of language my eighth graders would have used when I taught eighth grade (which may have been why I always imagined the main characters as younger than the author intended).But the story DOES get pretty engaging as you go along. Some of the elements show some real creativity and the author has clearly done the work to build a fairly interesting universe. There are times when she teeters near the edge of giving us too much information about how necromancy works (who was it who made the assertion that the more a fantasy writer describes precisely how magic works, the worse the book?), but she manages to stay just on the right side of it.I won't be surprised if this book bounces back and forth between two and three stars as I reassess my feelings about it, but I doubt I'll pick up the sequel if that tells you what you need to know."
"This is an interesting book. The concept is fascinating and the characters are, if not fleshed out (in-joke, read the book), at least memorable.The problem is that it was extremely difficult to read. Every character in the book has at least 4 names and they aren't easy to remember names. The author's style of using all 4 names interchangeably, would be fine for the two main characters, but it's extremely difficult to follow when we're introduced to 14 more characters that are discussed only occasionally.The other thing that really made me sad was that the writing, while full of 50 cent words, was very difficult to follow. In several places, it was very hard to tell which character was talking. The authors descriptions were mostly OK, but you will have to learn a lot of language in the book.Another point, the description given in the blurb essentially has nothing to do with the story and, only tangentially, the characters.It really makes me sad, because the entire concept behind the book is so fascinating. I'll get the second book, but I'm not entirely looking forward to it."
"3.5 “One flesh, one end"" starsNote: There are very few books I suggest that Audio is the only way to go, but this will be one of them. The dialogue throughout is strange and in the hardback the formatting is odd and can be a little too much.Gideon is not anything like I first thought it would be based on the cover. For one I thought Gideon was a boy. She isn’t, she is a sword wielding woman, stuck on a dying planet/territory called the Ninth that has more dead things running around at the will of one person that it has living. Gideon has tried 87 various ways to escape this dead planet only to be thwarted at every go, mostly by her nemesis Harrow to be stuck on a planet she hates. From the beginning you could see these two could be just a few turns away from turning from enemies into something more.***The Lady of the Ninth House stood before the drillshaft, wearing black and sneering. Reverend Daughter Harrowhark Nonagesimus had pretty much cornered the market on wearing black and sneering. It comprised 100 percent of her personality. Gideon marvelled that someone could live in the universe only seventeen years and yet wear black and sneer with such ancient self-assurance. ***The Ninth is a land full of secrets and dead and Harrow is keeper to both. But she needs Gideon to be her swordswoman for a trial set by the emperor. If Harrow succeeds in this trial, she will get something special akin to immortality and a way to save the dying Ninth house. If Gideon helps, she is promised freedom.I really wasn’t sure what I was getting into when this was said to be Queer Necromancers in Space. I definitely thought there would be more lesbian like things, but other than the fact Gideon is definitely into girls there isn’t much pushing behind that. She likes the look of girls and thinks a few thoughts along those lines. There is a underlying current of something building between Gideon and Harrow, it could blow up spectacularly at any moment into more. But not much time is spent on that at all.Mostly this is a tale of going to a strange place with hidden catacombs to search for the secrets of the former Lyctors to become one themselves.***The whole place had the look of a picked-at body. But hot damn! What a beautiful corpse. ***It is dangerous as the other eight houses are there also and everyone is competing for keys that will show them the secrets of how to be better necromancers to the point that eternal live becomes yours. It gets messy as Harrow and Gideon are thrown into ever more dangerous situations trying to stay alive, discover who is killing off the competition and learn the secrets for themselves as well.I’m going to give the author some big props for having such a strange idea full of imagery, brutality and death. She did a great job of not doing the expected in this. I didn’t really get some of the motivations of why a few things happened the way they did but I was surprised by so many things especial Gideon and Harrow’s connection in the end.Gideon was easy for me to like. She has a great fun sense of humor that is very out there and I think that listening to the Audiobook for this novel made it better for me. The dialogue is a little twisty at times and the narrator sorted it for me so that I didn’t have to think about it too hard.***“My uncle can’t eat with your kind around,” he said. “Please leave.”Gideon had a million questions. Like: Your kind? And: Why do you have such a baby uncle, one the colour of mayonnaise? And: Is “your kind” people who aren’t nephews and who have middle fingers? ***For all of it’s inventiveness there is a large chunk of time where nothing is really happening in the story. The worldbuilding could have been flushed out a bit better as well. We are in this really cool story where there is a galactic war happening. But other than there being 9 necromantic houses to the emperor, each with their own way of performing necromancy I don’t know much. There seems like there is so much to explore in this setting and I didn’t get enough info on the characters to really form strong attachments to most of them. Also, some of the deaths still didn’t make sense to me later when the perpetrator was revealed. Since I couldn’t reconcile a few events I have to drop the star rating. Don’t let that discourage you, there are some great, strange wonders throughout the book and the ending literally shocked and amazed me. I will definitely be picking up Harrow when it comes out.***“It’s bad enough that we’re stuck in this burnt-out old hovel without me scaring you. Isn’t it fantastically abandoned? Imagine all the ghosts of everyone who must have lived here … worked here … still waiting to be called, if we could figure out how. The Seventh doesn’t do well with ghosts, you know. We offend them. We’re worrisome. The old division between body and spirit. We deal too much with the body … crystallising it in time … trapping it unnaturally. The opposite of your House, don’t you think, Gideon the Ninth? You take empty things and build with them … We press down the hand of a clock, to try to stop it from ticking the last second.” ***Truly a unique story."
"I've been in a bit of reading rut of late, and it's been a while since I found a work of pure fiction that fell in love with and just wanted to devour in one sitting.  While I didn't quite read it in one sitting (I did need to eat, sleep, and work), I did find this a difficult book to put down, in all the best ways.This is an interesting blend of sci-fi and fantasy, with spaceships and swords. The world-building is good and revealed naturally without spoon-feeding you the background and also leaves you wanting to learn more about it.  I have a certain fondness for the characters trapped in a remote location where help is unable to reach them, trope.  And this book is a great version of this trope.I think the characters are a particular strength of the book.  Gideon, the title character, and from whom we experience most of the story is the most endearing.  She's sarcastic, funny, honorable, and in her own way smart. Her amusing observations really made the story for me.I also quite liked Harrow.  She is introduced as selfish, capricious, and nasty but as the story progresses we learn more about her and why she outwardly behaves the way she does.  By the end, I really felt for her and look forward to her story in the next book.Also, this was recommended to me as ""LGBT fiction"" which I suppose it is.  Gideon does appear to only be interested in other women.  But in truth sexuality isn't really addressed in the novel and I find that rather refreshing.  We know Gideon is queer because she is attracted to other women but it's never commented on by any of the other characters.  In fact, many of the characters appear to be either gay or bi/pansexual.  But it's just never an issue.  There's no angst about it.  No coming out journey.  Not that either of those things is necessarily a bad thing, but I do find it refreshing to have queer characters where that is treated the same way characters being straight is.All in all, I found this to be a highly entertaining story full of interesting characters.  I can't wait to see where the series goes from here."
"This book could not have been a more pleasant surprise.I bought it on the recommendation of Charles Stross, another solid author, and though his flippant ""lesbian necromancers in space"" quip is accurate, it in no way encompasses the width, breadth, and quality of this story.It has all of the hallmarks of a fantasy/sci-fi classic - amazing worldbuilding, fantastic characters, just enough""technical"" explanation to make things understandable without getting bogged down in details, and most of all, GREAT writing. I mean it.  There are only a few authors I've read who have exhibited this level of mastery over phrase and vocabulary (Mark Lawrence springs to mind), and it's a genuine pleasure to read their work.  Thankfully, Muir also understands the value of humor and humanization, so the high quality of writing is joined to a narrative voice that will keep you giggling through a thrilling, twisting, necromantic murder mystery.The characters arcs are also handled superbly, leading up to an ending that is both shocking and absolutely perfect. The sequel has now shot to the top of my ""can't wait to read"" list."
"Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir was an SFF title I was excited to read because so many friends were raving about it. As always, I waited for a Kindle deal before grabbing a copy and finally felt like I was in the right mood for it recently.I have to be honest, the first 30% of this book was a bit of a slog to get through. So many words but I felt like basically nothing happened? I was tempted to DNF but I kept reading because I wanted to see why so many readers loved this. The pace did pick up eventually and I found myself intrigued by both the worldbuilding and characters. The science and math behind necromancy was interesting, and I liked the swordfighting scenes. Plus Gideon's internal monologue and snarky dialogue was hilarious, and there's also lesbian rep throughout the story. However, there was way too much blood, gore and bones in the book for me to truly enjoy it.I thought this would be a fun space fantasy but it reads more like a murder mystery for me, emphasis on both murders and mysteries. Maybe veering towards horror too. And I felt like the book ended with so many questions and not enough answers. I do get why this was a hit with so many, it's a pretty unique book, but sadly I couldn't say it worked for me. Still give it a try if the premise speaks to you. Like I said, so many others loved this much more that I did so it might work for you too."
"I hardly ever get to the point of not being able to finish a book, but I definitely got there with this one. I made it to about halfway thru, and then couldn't continue. I really didn't care about the characters or want to know what happened to them, so I stopped reading.The reviews I read sounded interesting, but I guess this just wasn't my type of story."
"A delicious combination of science fiction, fantasy, and dirtbag teenagers competing for immortality using necromancy and the sword. Tamsyn Muir's ear for dialogue is nicely set off by a lingering aura of doom that flavors everything despite the ironical and very teenage perspective of Gideon. I can honestly say I didn't expect the midpoint of the plot, much less the ending, and am excited for more adventures of Dirtbag Necromantic Teenagers in Space."
"So, I try to help authors out by adding fair reviews.Here it goes.LIKEDThe story is extremly unique. Fresh in the sense that I dont think you will read anything like it.Gideon herself is very likeable. She has a simple approach to life, which is endearing.She also has a dry sense of humor.The plot has many twists and turns, which leaves the reader to wonder what will happen next.◇CHALLENGES/DISLIKEwarning: spoilerThe romance aspect was non existent. There was some mild flirting, but then you find out those avenues were never meant to pan out.It is kind of prudish,  as another reader points out.  Once you realize who was supposed to end up together, there is really no chemistry because they spent 86 percent of the book wishing each other death.NOT SEXYGideon was just done wrong. Not only does she have to make the ultimate sacrifice,  but she dies without ever being loved.There is no closure to her family history. She never learns who she is.She dies a Virgin. Are you kidding? I mean, what kind of pallid reflection of patriarchy is this?As others are mentioning sometimes it did get  confusing realizing who was who. Seems like the author was a bit wordy and spent too much time trying to use her best dictionary-combed vocabulary instead of speaking a bit more plainly to reach  more readers.Finally, inclusiveness, there are no black, brown, or yellow people in the distant future?SILVER LININGIn spite of that,  much of the book was entertaining enough to keep me invested. In fact, I will likely purchase the rest of the series in hopes that poor Gideon 's half life will have some type of closure.Harrow's uppity self can suck a melon."
"While I liked the main character, Gideon, and the background was the right amount of creepy, with some cool sword fights and necromantic magic, the plot takes a while to get interesting, and less confusing. Set in a universe made of nine different houses, each serving the Emperor's First House with their different style and manner of magic. The Ninth House where Gideon has spent her life as the Reverend Daughter's, Harrowhark, verbal punching bag, lives amongst skeleton servants and ancient nuns. Harrowhark, heir to the Ninth, is a bone witch and Gideon is, well, not, and for some reason, the entitled Harrowhark feels it gives her full rein on how horrid she is toward Gideon.Then the Ninth receives an invite from the Emperor. I had to read the his missive three times before I semi-understood he was inviting Harrowhark and her cavalier to the palace where they would engage in some sort of battle...tournament...duel to the death so they may become an immortal Lyctor (not in the dictionary). Unfortunately sensing imminent death, the Ninth's cavalier bolts leaving Harrowhark no choice but to bring Gideon in his stead, but first she must put down her kickass dual-handed sword and learn the art of a rapier, a totally different style. And it also means she has to be Harrowhark's sideman.Well they arrive Emperor's Palace and meet the heirs and cavaliers of each house and thank god there is a list of Houses and their representatives in the front of the book to reference. Frequently. Some memorable, others not so much. The Palace itself is a character with it's rat maze of hidden rooms, secret courtyards and ancient laboratories, all covered with layers of dust and ancient mold. Each team is given a ring and shown to their quarters and then...nothing happens. For days. There is no explanation as to how to play the game or what they are even supposed to accomplish. I was able to put the book down and walk away too many times during this part.Then the book turns into a game of Clue. A season of Survivor. All with sword play, duals to the shame, alliances, and weird monsters. It's this part with the interesting magic, the intrigue, the literal back-stabbing, when the book really picks up.Confusion aside (still don't get the thanergenic energy science), I did enjoy this book for it's mystery, the creepy palace and Gideon-her sarcastic sense of humor helped me get past how much I disliked Harrowhark. Now, on the topic of Harrowhark-mild spoiler ahead-I see her name in the title of the second book. Do I want to spend an entire book with Harrowhark? I do. I do but with the option to throw it across the room yelling expletives.3.5 stars for slow start and Harrowhark's existence."
"(This review originally appeared at History That Never Was.)Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir has garnered a lot of attention, receiving nominations for the Hugo, Nebula, and Locus Awards. As of this writing, it has won the Locus Award and is in the running for the Hugo Award. The praise is well deserved, as this novel of space lesbian necromancers is a delightful read, filled with twists and turns all the way until the end.The titular Gideon is an indentured servant of the Ninth House, one of eight necromantic houses that serve the Emperor (the Emperor’s house being the First House). While she is trying to escape her servitude to join the Cohort, the Empire’s military branch, she makes a wager with Harrowhark Nonagesimus (aka Harrow), the heir to the Ninth House, and things start going downhill for Gideon. She and Harrow travel to another planet, where Harrow is to undergo testing to become a Lyctor, one of the most powerful necromancers of the Empire.What follows is a locked “room” mystery, replete with necromantic constructs, archaic dueling rules, and a whole lot of humor. The narrative flows between gothic description and wise-cracking dialogue, much of which comes from Gideon herself. There’s a large cast of characters, but they start dying off pretty quickly (don’t get attached to anyone), plus everyone has a surname that’s related to the number of their House, which makes it easier to track who’s who.If you like your space opera full of snark and heart, you’ll love Gideon the Ninth."
"""May I be burnt one atom at a time in the most silent hole in the most lightless part of space...""--------------------------------------Oh Gideon! I have not read such an enjoyable original fantasy story in a long time. This story is unbelievably dark, I mean it's an entire universe built on necromancy but there is such heart and humanity within it. Gideon is this hard as nails swordsperson living her life as pretty hopeless, faithless orphan in the Ninth House just looking for a way out. When she is forced into service as a cavalier under the heir of the Ninth House she must learn to fight with a rapier and dedicate her life to a woman she despises. The banter between these two made the story for me, they are sharp and cutting and it is so entertaining to read.The world building is insane but in a good way, you will need the character summary on the first page as you learn each of the nine house's representatives. I'd say it's akin to Game of Thrones in that there are so many compelling characters and insane magic that you'll be lost at first but will soon find yourself struggling to put the book down. I got to one point where I considered taking a day off work to finish. I am glad I waited until the sequel was out because I couldn't go long without dropping back into this universe. If you like dark fantasy, do yourself a favor and check out Gideon!"
"This is one of the most difficult reviews I've written because there was so much I liked about this book. The writing is fantastic and is what sucked me in to begin with and kept me going. Amazing use of voice and unique world building.However, at times I had no idea what I was reading. I would reread paragraphs three times and just couldn't grasp the image being described.I'm also not a horror fan and while this is a mashup of genres, it ultimately has a background of horror. Blood, guts, and gore, and that's not my thing.There are unanswered questions and clues given that were dropped/unused at the end. Obviously they can surface in the sequel, but given the ending I'm irritated by it.Spoiler follows:...I also deeply dislike books in which the MC is sacrificed at the end to save someone who was cruel and at times abusive. I might have viewed the book differently except for that ending.  There are unanswered questions about Gideon's birth and backstory, including a clue found that she kept in her pocket. Perhaps she will be resurrected. Still didn't like the premise of her sacrifice.Found it difficult to relate to any character. Also deeply disturbed by the family suicide scene. This is probably just not a book for me. But I wanted to like it."
"Wow. One of the best, most entertaining books I've read in a long time, this just grabbed me from the start. Muir has created such an interesting world and populated it with stock characters with a twist, each with their own engaging quirks. The snarky goth girl, the sickly beauty, the diametrically opposed twins, the nerdy Sherlock type. But she manages to avoid getting bogged down in cliche and has written something truly unique . Oh, and they're all necromancers, although each has a different primary ability or approach to the necromantic arts.The plot? This is basically And Then There Were None set in a decaying castle on a remote planet that used to be the seat of the Emperor (of the universe). The heirs to the 8 noble houses have gathered, along with their cavaliers (bodyguards sort of) at the emperor's call to complete a challenge. Do it and they will become Lyctors, sort of an immortal super-powered King's guard. But what exactly is the challenge? That's part of the challenge.  As the necros attempt to answer that question, the bodies start to pile up.Gideon has such a fun and funny voice, I was constantly chuckling to myself when I wasn't horrified at the latest gruesome fate.  I kept having flashes of Mean Girls and Heathers coming thru.  I can't do this book justice, just read it.And forget the ""lesbian necromancers in space"" blurbs. Yes, Gideon likes girls. But there's no sex and this isn't really a space book. There are some extremely funny comments and observations, however, but that I found that capsule to be misleading. It's so much better than that."
"REVIEW PROVIDED BY: KellyNUMBER OF HEARTS: 3 3/4Where to begin with this book? Let’s start with the cover. Is this not one of the most amazing book covers you have ever seen? If you buy the hardback the edges of all the pages are black (sigh). It looks amazing on my shelf, I am looking forward to getting the other two books in the trilogy too.Okay on to the story.It took me a long time to get into this story and I mean a very long time. At about 50% I was finally feeling the story. At 60% I was hooked. The story took a long time to develop. There were many times that I was confused over who was who and everyone’s nicknames for each other. I think what made it hard to get into is that you don’t know the history of the world or the characters right away. It is a slow trickle of information in the book.But the one character that I loved from the start was Gideon. Everyone loves an underdog. Gideon is great! I loved her sassiness and forwardness.And with the ending of Gideon the Ninth...... Well I can’t tell you that.But overall I did enjoy this necromancers sci-fi story. I am looking forward to Harrowhawk the Ninth.Disclaimer:I purchased this book and this review is my own opinion and not a paid review."
"For someone like myself who has read tons of sci-fi and fantasy books all my life, an original story like Gideon the Ninth is delightfully fresh, invigorating, and most of all, fascinating entertainment.The debut author Tamsyn Muir has something for everyone—horror, humor, puzzles, and murder, all in a solar system far from Earth.It’s a big mashup of all these ideas and more, and somehow it all works as Muir throws out mysteries and plot twists left and right that make you keep reading late at night. It definitely earned its Hugo nomination.A lot has been said about the “lesbian necromancers in space” plot, but don’t let the characters’ sexual orientation deter you from reading this book if that aspect is out of your comfort level.There is no overt sexuality in the book, and nothing graphic to cause discomfort to anyone.I’m definitely looking forward to the rest of the series. For teens on up."
"This book starts in the very first paragraph with a fun hook that made me choose it for our book club. Gideon was a stranger to me but I knew she had a sense of humor, courage, and a stash of dirty magazines.  What more could I want?And it turns out I made a good choice. Most of us who read it loved it.  The others admitted they aren’t sci-fi fantasy fans.The plot was satisfyingly twisted, the characters fun and interesting, and it was nice to see the characters grow a bit by the end of the book.The big ‘house secret’ was deliciously horrifying, or maybe just horrifying, I haven’t decided.  But in any case well worth getting to, and explained sooooo much.In particular I loved the way the author normalized being queer.  It just was.  No gay phobia, no needing to come out.  It made me hope that one day we will live in a world like that.... but not that world, I prefer my skeletons remain dead.  ;)My only critique was the names.  Three names or titles per person left me perpetually confused during conversations with more than three people talking to each other.  A print out chart of all the names, titles, and nicknames would be a god-send.But I can forgive her for all that name confusion because of the epic final fight scenes.  Yes scenes, plural.  It’s one fight but it should be called part one, two, and three because it just goes on and on and on with descriptions that made me feel like I was watching a movie.I loved it!  And I’m buying the sequel!"
"I’m not even sure about this 4 star rating, maybe it should be a 3, I’ve changed my mind so many times. This rating reflects my reaction to the last 2+ hours of the book. I think the first two thirds could have been more clearly/cleanly written and shortened considerably. Without spoiling the end for readers, while exciting to read, the end it was not very satisfying. The advertising of this book as “two lesbian necromancers in space” while correct, is misleading some readers who expect the story to be about and from a lesbian perspective. It’s not, Gideon just happens to be a lesbian and some of her remarks reflect that. Not much else can be said without giving it all away. I will read the description of the next book in the series carefully before purchasing."
"It's so nice when a book that has a lot of hype and expectations built actually fulfills that potential.  I ordered Gideon mostly because of the epic dust jacket (yes, I judged a book by the cover) and that Charles Stross quote ""Lesbian necromancers explore a haunted gothic palace in space.""  What I received was an intricate locked palace mystery in the vein of Christie's ""And Then There Were None"", with a badass heroine reluctantly serving as cavalier to her arch-frenemy and master bone magician Harrowhark in a high stakes contest. Harrow is trying to attain immense power as a Lyctor to the Undying Emperor.  Gideon just wants the freedom to leave the Ninth House forever.The game is on and the main obstacle to their ambitions are necromancers and their cavaliers from the other Houses.  Dulcinea, Palamedes, Silas, and more all make for an interesting cast of characters. Each wants to be a Lyctor, and someone is willing to kill to get what they want.  To become a Lyctor, they have to solve a series of deadly puzzles, keep the others from getting there first, and stay alive.The first half of the book was a slow, but satisfying burn as we are introduced to this world.  I liked Gideon and her nemesis Harrow right from the start.  The space opera aspect is a bit like Dune's; there's a vast Empire through space but what matters is the characters and what is happening to them now.  The necromancy was a very satisfying way to tie together space opera with magic, much like Star Wars did with the Force.  The second half of the book, as the mysteries were revealed was fast paced and engrossing.  But, the conclusion was brilliant. The book had such an expected, but perfect ending I laughed out loud in satisfaction.Bring on Harrow the Ninth. I can't wait. And please, oh please, Tor: give it that glorious black edging that Gideon received."
"If you are creeped out by skeletons or descriptions of unattached flesh, I don’t recommend this book. If you’re a dude and you principally enjoy reading about dudes, I don’t recommend this book. If you are allergic to That YA Smell, I don’t recommend this book. If you’re trying to focus your reading on Haute Literature, I don’t recommend this book.Everyone else should get going.I read this in one day (today) because I was enthralled by it. If I reread it, it will be to spend more time thinking about skeleton servants and a moss castle, because these are more or less #goals.Strengths:You can really feel the hate coming off the characters that hate each other. That’s often not written well.There were sword fight scenes that I found compelling, which is unusual for sword fight scenes for me. Probably it helps when it’s sword fights with skeletons coming out of the dirt and stuff.Every stupid page of this had me wishing it were a movie just because the environmental and monster design could be so, so good on screen. Googling tells us they have sold rights, but that alone doesn’t promise anything.The characters do not have Same Voice Syndrome, a great amount of which I take for granted in this kind of thing, so that was really good. I could read another whole book of Harrow being an imperious jerk savant. (I am hoping that the sequel has not granted her too much character development for this…)You are not exactly sure what kind of book you are reading at many times.The world building was fun, the right amount of “oh you know what those people are like”.A lot of time when people write fake churches, you can smell exactly what kind of thing they think constitutes Church. Either Muir covered up the seams of appropriated fragments far better than most, or she hails from something close enough to Catholicism to make the fake thing feel real for me.“necromancer lesbian from the goth planet” really ought to be enough to sell this, but did I mention they paint skull face makeup on?Weaknesses:Not all of the sword fights were interesting enough. I think to some extent I can’t picture the monsters well enough to set up the fights in my head, but also that’s probably more a me thing than a book thing.I wanted more wlw romance than I got, damn it. However, I am willing to accept that this much cool description of animated skeletons and an ideal quantity of wlw romance may be unrealistic to demand from a single book.I got the different houses mixed up in my head by the time the names weren’t being repeated all the time. Fifth? Third??A number of MacGuffins were introduced in a way that might have meant this was all a bit mystery-you’re-supposed-to-be-trying-to-solve-along-with-them, which sounded like a pain. I decided not to keep track of them with their various descriptions. It turned out this was fine, but there was also a whole plot moment when it turned out everyone had been relying on a false assumption about these MacGuffins, but this assumption hadn’t been adequately communicated for me to pick up on anyway, so…There were times that it felt like all the “planet” stuff could have been transplanted into “realms” (or, more obviously, “districts”) and nothing substantial or even superficial would have changed.I didn’t expect the ways the plot went, but they also didn’t feel like resoundingly satisfying twists.The distant 3rd person voice and the voice closer into Gideon’s head were jarringly different at times."
"I read a lot, I spend a lot more time combing through books looking for something with that spark to keep me interested past the first few pages.  I don't know what I was expecting when I picked up Gideon, but I sure as hell wasn't expecting to be blown away by the story, the writing, the characters, the world, the love, the pain, or the loss.Holy Crap!The book was so powerful that for the first time in 20 years with my partner I put down the law and told her she had to read and finish this book.  I loved it cover to cover (excepting that first bit of explanatory nonsense at the beginning).  I loved all the stuff after the epilogue even.  Right now I'm catching my breath and trying to decide if I go back an listen to the audio version or push on with Harrow.  I honestly don't know.What I do know is that this is a special book, and I have to thank a very gifted author for sharing this story with me.  It will stay with me for a while."
"I don't know how I feel about this book. It took me forever to get through it. I found all the names and pairings to be confusing and some of them I couldn't be bothered to remember until about halfway through the book. The book starts off so slow, that I really struggled to get invested. In fact, it wasn't till I was over a hundred pages into it that I finally became semi-interested. The pacing felt off to me, which complicated the matter as well.The good stuff-I liked Gideon and I eventually came to like Harrow.I am intrigued by what comes next as the ending very much so got my attention.Great ending!Cool (sometimes perplexing) blending of genres- everything from sci-fi/fantasy to murder mystery. It was like a game of Clue in space.Not an easy book to define or put labels on.I loved the magic/science behind the necromancy."
"What in the sam hell did Amazon ever recommend this for as humorous, I don’t have a clue. Dark, black, comedy MAYBE. Very small maybe.I can compare it to a train wreck I couldn’t look away from.Since I flipping paid for it I read the whole damn thing. I kept hoping it would make sense. No.It’s dark, it’s macabre, characters spout idioms that belong to current times while they (exist?) in a world that is some twisted futuristic graveyard.I read the whole thing and I’m still not sure what I’ve read.I’m now going to go find something light-hearted and attempt to scrub my brain of any knowledge of this book. Yuck."
"I tried to think of some sort of bone pun for the title but it's late in the evening so I won't.Anyways, what a great book. This was not at all what I expected which is probably almost always a good thing. The setting felt SO unique as well as the houses and the magic. I loved so many of the chracters and the events that unfolded really hurt. The banter of Gideon, her relationship with Harrow, the mystery of the test, the various partnerships of the other houses. Wow! Such a fun read untangling all of it.One note: curious how more ""space"" and ""sci-fi"" will look here since this did not feel particularly sci-fi of a novel.This did not have the same highs as red rising but definitely gave off similar vibes from a setting standpoint (kids-ish trapped in an area as a test and things go bad) and, similarly, I'm curious if the rest of the trilogy will have a similar expanded scope."
"I was looking for a new series and saw that the third book to this series on lots of ""Watch for"" lists for 2021 (actually now it is slate for 22 I think). I am fully willing to try a new author even if I stop reading the book a few chapters in because it sucks so bad or for some fantasy books seems to cater to much to a younger audience. I am in my 40s and don't need to have all the violence and sex of a series like Game of Thrones, but also don't enjoy watching teen fantasy shows or books in that genre. Anyway, Gideon is young, but she's a badass with a great, adult sense of humor. This book, even with it's epic, sci-fi fantasy context read more like a murder mystery. I don't usually go for that genre, but this one is great, with rich dialogue. The reader knows more than most characters, but the author does not give us everything, which makes it much more exciting. I don't think I have ever read a book marketed as ""lesbian romance"" before. The sexual tension is there and makes for more real, vivid characters, but the core genre here is thriller even more than sci-fi. Plus there is some horror and noir thrown in too. The sci-fi aspects are much more central to the second book, Harrow, which was a bit difficult for me to get through because I did not like the new characters as much and Harrow is a bit of a bore compared to Gideon. But the last third of Harrow is awesome and I am looking forward to the third book whenever it comes out."
"""Gideon the Ninth"" is one of this year's nominees for the Nebula award, given annually for the best science fiction/fantasy. Spoilers ahead. I would classify it as science fiction, but much of it has the feel of fantasy. Science fantasy maybe? It's imaginative, very well executed, very well evoked, very nicely written -- in many ways brilliant. I admire the book greatly. But it is somewhat too bleak for my present mood(*). I've been craving stories of kindness, of people helping each other, and this book is not abundant in acts of kindness.I note that, for me, one of the few missteps was a phrase on the first page: ""like a chocolate in a fancy hotel.""  The rest of that page, and indeed the bulk of the novel, conjures a world far from ours, so the phrase seems discordantly contemporary. I also note that I found some of the action sequences a tad longwinded, but, again, that may be because I'm not presently in the mood for descriptions of gruesome fights.(*) If you're wondering why I read this anyhow, despite hankering for a different type of book, it is so that I can responsibly cast my vote for this year's Nebula awards.About my reviews: I try to review every book I read, including those that I don't end up enjoying. The reviews are not scholarly, but just indicate my reaction as a reader, reading being my addiction. I am miserly with 5-star reviews; 4 stars means I liked a book very much; 3 stars means I liked it; 2 stars means I didn't like it (though often the 2-star books are very popular with other readers and/or are by authors whose other work I've loved)."
"This is a really fine book. I loved the narrative voice and the evolution of feeling between Gideon and Harrow. The mystery is real and tension builds effectively. The writing is a delight.Flaws? I’m not sure I believe Gideon would act as she does ultimately. I also guessed a big chunk of the resolution about 2/3 of the way in.Biggest flaw: the stupid marketing copy! I think it belittles the high quality characterization, the great dialogue, and the strong plot. Gideon comes across as a real person, with real anguish and anger and affection.I eagerly await the sequel."
"This book is phenomenal.I was a little hesitant at first, to even read the book because necromancy ooks me out a bit. I'm so glad I got over that. Necromancy is a HUGE part of this book, but it never really bothered me. I was much, much more interested in the main character and how she navigated the world.Gideon is a foul-mouthed, sassy little goblin of a character and I love her so freaking much. She's quick with a quip, and uses humor to mask her problems. She's a soldier, a kind of body guard for her necromancer, buuuuuut the thing is... she HATES her necromancer. That spicy relationship was really neat to see play out, and the development between them was very satisfying.I didn't expect to laugh as much as I did while reading a book about necromancy, but here we are.The magic, the descriptions of battles, all of it is just plain awesome.The plot is a little wishy-washy, a kind of Hunger Games-esque trial to become the next elite, but the MYSTERY surrounding it all is what hooked me. There's a big question mark right in the middle of the book, and once you get (some of) the answers, it's like getting hit with a train. The ending will leave you downright gobsmacked.I can't wait to read the next book."
"I bow before the writing greatness of T. Muir.  Why was this book so amazing? Let me count the ways -1) the writing itself, the sentences, the descriptions - just a level of writing beauty that I do not see in most fantasy2) The characters - the characters truly do jump off the page - just read the opening scene and see how well Gideon and Crusk come across- completely unique and real and alive and friggin beautiful!!3) The dialogue - the best dialogue I've read in a fantasy book - original and so much fun4) the evolution of relationships - Gideon and Harrow's evolution -  I don't have words to describe it5) It's a fun story and absolutely uniqueHat's off to the author and a myriad of thanks to her !! I stand in amazement!!!!"
"I swear I've been hearing about this book for a year before it was released. I was promised it would be weird, dark, hilarious, utterly awesome and unlike anything I had read before. I've been unreasonably excited for it.And you know what? It totally lived up to the hype! The wait for the sequel is already too long! Liberty Hardy warned that this would be my new obsession and, boy, was she right. I think I'll just be rereading this for the next couple of months.By the way, the Audible version is magnificent! Moira Quirk is a goddess among narrators and she totally nailed it. Highly recommended!"
"What even is this book? Besides amazing? It's so many things that I'm just kind of scratching my head going ""what just happened here?""So, imagine The Princess Bride mixed with House on Haunted Hill. Got it? Now add Clue. Yeah, that doesn't do it justice.Okay, we have a disaster lesbian forced to work for the necromancer princess she hates.That do it for you?This book is a space fantasy that feels too technical to be fantasy but at the same time firmly grounded in science.It's one of the most romantic books I've ever read but not at all a romance.I'm in awe of how brilliant this book is."
"So, the humor is supposed to be sophomoric.  It's a deliberate affectation.  However, it still comes across as the prose of a 19 year old (albeit a talented 19 year old) who is writing, for the first time, without fear of an adult admonishment.  Bravado born of unnecessary vulgarity.  I'm actually fine with vulgarity, but here it seemed gratuitous and nearly forced.  That said, it's a good read.  Neat idea.  The story's structure is a little convoluted at times, and there are parts of the story which have no ultimate, endgame payoff.  Furthermore the tertiary characters are a bit difficult to keep track of as they aren't well fleshed-out.  BUT, it's lesbian space necromancers.  How often do you get that?"
"As the title says, a miss for me. This in fact became one of the rare DNR books in my life. I had such high hopes from all the other reviews I read, but I just couldn't get behind it. Now don't get me wrong, the idea and plot sound AMAZING, and there is NOTHING wrong with that. Its HOW its handled. The writing is very verb crazy in spots, like the author is paid by the word. The main character, I just couldn't stand. They were so agitating I was hoping they would die off. Because of those two put together, it became a book I didn't care what happened, and I had to put it down after making it only a third of the way through.For some I am sure its great, for me it was just a miss."
"My only critique is that sometimes the characterizations falter here and there till the author finds her voice again. Also the transition from Frenemies to Friends is kinda awkward and stilted.That said, this book is good. It's fun. It's a great romp, Space Opera mixed with Dying Earth and a dash of Lovecraft. It does what it exactly sets out to do, with enough mystery, turns, and twists, making you desire to see the outcome."
"I absolutely loved this novel, and finished it off faster than any book I have in quite a while. The setting is an odd blend of science fiction and fantasy, with a wonderful, creepy goth feel to it. There's a thread of incredible dark humor throughout all of it and a lot of gore. The plot's rather too complex to sum up simply, but essentially involves a contest amongst necromancers and their sword-wielding protectors to become a god of sorts. Of course, when you hate your necromancer's guts, that complicates matters. The novel is an adult fantasy, with a grimdark level of blood and murder. The pace and violence don't leave much room for romance, but the main characters are lesbians, and there are some light romantic elements. There's a good deal of cursing, and no significant sex at all. Highly recommended for fantasy readers who like it dark and very, very strange."
"- You may love or hate the dialogue -- Gideon talks like a millennial and the novel is set in some far off impossible place so you'd be expecting folks to be speaking that bygone-ese you hear in fantasy novels, a stilted too-formal approximation of Shakespeare rendered in prose. It's exceptionally playful, and there was a minute in the beginning where I thought I might not want to continue on with the book as I was worried the dialogue would eventually grate or veer into an almost unintentional satire. Fortunately it was a passing feeling, and Muir has an excellent sense for story pacing and dialogue in service of the plot. There are plenty of puns and modern-day colloquialisms, if that is your sort of thing. I would call it less funny than that it doesn't take it's dialogue as deathly serious as other fantasy/sci-fi novels.- There is a will-they won't they dynamic between leads Harrow, the Ninth House necromancer, and Gideon, her cavalier or sworn sword, but there is nothing overly sexual about this novel despite the lesbian lead. It's a hallmark of how far the genre has come in a short 50 years to normalize this type of main character, to have her sexuality only be a minor facet of her character. It's refreshing to have come so far.- There are times where I struggled with the action being depicted, lost in who was doing what. The first time I really noticed it was when Gideon was fighting a large skeletal construct at the behest of her necromancer, Harrow. I got the gist of the action and sort of made up my own pacing, as you could tell the scene would end with the construct deconstructed. The action scenes are balletic, Gideon wielding a rapier in defense while Harrow conjures, and this is difficult to depict narratively.- It really is a great example of world-building. There is so much detail under the surface of this world, and the way your understanding of it unfolded with the narrative was a real joy. Great science fiction and fantasy series are as much about their worlds as they are their characters or their plots -- if the world is interesting enough, you could pace some automatons getting coffee and you'd have a compelling read.- This novel is chock-full of references to the Bible, classic literature, history, or countless other topics. Everything was chosen with purpose and double meaning. I'd recommend reading the ""A Little Explanation of the Naming System"" at the end before Act 2 for pronunciation help. I didn't, and I wasn't even close. Hermy-one, anyone?- I will certainly be reading the rest of this series, as Muir lays out enough thread to tease a very compelling tetralogy (it's up to 4 books now with Alecto being announced as the penultimate book after Harrow the Ninth and before Nina the Ninth, which tickles me with a through-line of the Grecian furies being subtext).- Most of the novel takes place in the falling-apart Canaan House (not sure what the importance of Canaan is in the name other than as an ethnic group that crops up from time to time in the Bible), but this very much feels like a Gothic Novel trope, harkening back to Northanger Abbey or Fall of the House of Usher. It's a cross between Clue and an escape house."
"I often find there’s a direct correlation between how much I enjoy a book and my willingness to suspend disbelief over its weirder aspects.  Because, really, this book is out there.  A teenaged lesbian swordswoman pledged to protect a teenaged necromancer who makes Wednesday Addams look like little miss sunshine?  I mean, sure, why not?  And yet this book was an absolute joy to read.  The writing is so good, so flowing, and Ms. Muir’s characters are so well drawn, you end up caring about everyone, especially Harrowhark, the aforementioned necromancer, whose relationship with Gideon Nav is fascinating.  Speaking of Gideon, I fell in love with her.  This is from a 65-year-old white male nerd with a preference for sci-fi and horror.I really can’t say enough good things about this book.  Tamsyn Muir is a major literary talent and I hope she has a long, productive career."
"It's an immensely fun read marred only by a few missing details in the worldbuilding. I found the religion/houses aspect in this world hard to parse. The purposes of the houses didn't seem to get much attention until they were needed to answer questions. Most of the chapters were captivating, but I found some characters a bit less memorable. For a good third of the book, I had to refer back to the beginning to recall who was who. But once I got used to the names, it became much easier to keep track of people. And as the suspense kicked in, I was generally having too much fun to notice the parts I wish were better explained. I'm told the second book explains the worldbuilding better, so I'm very much looking forward to it."
"So I heard discussion of this book on Twitter, and was immediately intrigued by the ""necromancers in space"" tagline. It sounded like a great idea for a genre mashup, plus it came highly recommended by people whose taste in entertainment I've come to trust, so I knew I had to give it a try. Within pages I was hooked. Gideon Nav is a fantastic protagonist. She's funny, angry, skillful and a little bit stupid. She manages that extremely rare feat of being a protagonist who is relatable without being contemptible. The plot itself manages to walk the wire of mixing murder mystery, SF, horror, and grimdark fantasy with just enough humor and affection to ground it. On top of that, Tamsyn Muir's prose is a thing of beauty. Much like her concept, her prose manages to strike a perfect balance of florid and biting. One can only imagine that if she decided to really let loose with profanity, she could give even the legendary David Simon a run for his money. Overall, this is a great book, and you would do yourself a great disservice not to read it."
"I read all the good reviews and oh, how I wanted to delve into a new fantasy/SciFi book.  I wanted to like it...but after trudging through fifty-some odd pages, I finally gave it a toss.  Life is too short to read schlock.  This book is utterly unremarkable and it cannot hold my attention on any level."
"Not every author wins a Hugo nomination for her debut novel, but Tamsyn Muir makes it look easy. She keeps an impressive number of balls in the air – ingenious worldbuilding, twenty speaking parts (half of whom deserve their own spinoff novellas), and a plot that shifts seamlessly from Gothic Horror to British Baking Show for Necromancers, to Agatha Christie, to something else entirely. The only flaw, if it is one, is a tendency to take “show, not tell” too far. Act I, with the co-protagonists in their native habitat, is such an unremittingly grim, almost comic-book horror show that it took me three tries to get past it to the real story. And the climactic battle scene makes us feel how exhausting it is to the participants by clocking in at 33 pages, about 30 too many for me. But if you press on to the reveals in Act V, you’ll be rewarded with a satisfying conclusion, and an intense desire to get on to the sequel."
"When I first started reading this book, I found it difficult to get into.  It was loud and brash in a way that shouted, ""I'm a badass book and extreme""  It was offputting at first, but then the book forced a lid on its antagonistic protagonist, it hit its stride in tempo and storytelling.The story is of Gideon, a fighter for the ninth house, hence the title. She is not a welcome guest in the ninth house, and her benefactor Harrowhark makes that clear early in the novel. Much of the first section is there loud and insulting quarrels.As it turns out, Harrowhawk must visit the House of the First, the emperor's house, and is without a cavalier. In the structure of the houses of the necromantic empire, each must have a Necromancer and a Cavalier, which proves important later in the story.  So, of course the two people who hate each other the most must team up and go to the first house with representatives from each house.  You get a guide of whose who at the beginning of the novel, to guide you through confusing conversations later in the book.The majority of the novel focuses on Canaan House, the decrepit and decaying home of the first where one can learn the ultimate power of everlasting life, if you can survive the deadly tests and treachery of the other houses.  This part of the novel tones down the pace, almost to a crawl, as we meet our characters.Then suddenly a shot rings out and someone screams,  well not literally, but the novel becomes a mystery novel, akin to Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None. The novel hits its stride here, with new relationships formed under duress and our two protagonists forced to reconcile differences.What's best in the novel is not the action,which is imaginative, exhilarating, and tense.  The best part are the characters from each house, each with distinctive personalities and dysfunctions.  Gideon learns quickly that her own house may not be the most dysfunctional of the bunch.  The characters fill each scene with their personalities and make it worth reviewing the cast list so you know who said what.I found that the initial struggle with the book broke through to a novel I really loved reading, where I became invested in the travails of Gideon and Harrowhawk, even if I knew, in general, which way the story was going.  It was ultimately a fun ride and I look forward to the next story in Muir's trilogy."
"I read this because it was the Sword & Laser February pick. I’m more of a Sci-fi guy. Sure, there are spaceships, but they could have just as easily been horse-drawn carriages.[getting very slightly spoilery form here on]There is a “Chekhov’s gun” placed firmly on the mantle piece in the first few pages. Waiting for it to be used kinda took me out of the story.I don’t mind magic as long as the rules are established early and then followed. It seems to me too many characters discovered new ways to use their magic just in time to resolve a situation.I know that this is the first of a series, but without giving anything away, I didn’t much like the ending."
"As a writer myself I realize after reading Gideon the Ninth that I need to step up my game.  This was a very interesting cocktail of science fiction, fantasy, mystery with a slight dash or horror.  The main character is fun and you very much grow to care about what happens to her.  The character dynamic between the main and her direct antagonist is well thought out and plays well through the story.I loved this book and I'm looking forward to continuing the series.  I will offer up one small cautionary critique I have for the book is that there are a few ""misleading"" inferences that the book is a heavy lesbian centered story.  I'm only commenting on this to prepare readers who are going into this book thinking it is Lesbian Romance.The book is rated as #2 out of 100 in the LGBT Sci-Fi, and #6 in Lesbian Romance.  The review on the front of the book states ""Lesbian Necromancers explore a haunted gothic palace...""  and the book is listed under LGBT Lesbian Science Fiction.  The main character is as far as the story describes a lesbian and there are a few allusions to other characters in the book being as such too, but there is a very superficial air of romance in the book that hardly rates this as a lesbian romance novel."
"I have been warned. I have been warned that this is something totally different. And it is. In a good way. The language is so beautiful and poetic at times and really witty and humorus at other times. This made it hard for me to progress (as English is not my mother-tongue), but it totally worth it. I really liked the Universe and looking forward for another adventure in it. The world-building is the most special thing for me in this one. It is so unique and strange but somehow really believable.Solid 5-start. Recommended to both sci-fi and fantasy fans as this felt somewhere in between the two genres for me."
"Reading about a dark bleak world during the late 2020 spring, might not seem like a great idea, but Gideon makes it worth the drama, the attitude and the utter despair.While it does say “book one”, it feels enough of a complete arc to fill the void (oooh), and while I’ll definitely pick up the next volume it feels like an open choice for the reader.So. Necromancy. In space. Not your regular cup of tea, unless maybe you dabble in the darker parts of Warhammer 40k. And while all that is great world building and mind blowing  concepts, the core of the book is about struggle, trust and relationships. In space. With a rapier."
"My Word.. i almost didnt finish this book several times (But im glad i didnt put it down. Btw its best to ignore anyone who gave a review w/o finishing ""this"" book.) SO much ""Excessive Description""  i like to know where my characters are and whats going on around them... but there is a point as of.. ""Too Much Detail"".  (Brandon Sanderson, Simon R Green, Miles Cameron, Johnathon Moeller etc are some of my commonly read authors and i prefer character development over world building/pretty scenes)- Anyways this book was just mediocre w/ a few ""Ohh! i wonder what killed them!""  moments... But when the Stuff Hits the Fan and its GO TIME. Thats when this book truly came together revealing all the characters sins and secrets for a most Astounding Conclusion!If you dont read the whole thing you're missing out... its like Eating your veggies so you can have your Cake but once the veggies are cleared you give up and put your fork down... missing out on the part that is actually  considered ""ENJOYABLE""."
"This is an amazing book. Just all-across-the-board amazing. Gideon as a protagonist has a specific and authentic voice to her; she comes across strongly as a unique and individual and specific person, unlike far too many protagonists who feel sort of bland or generic in pursuit of (one presumes) being easily identifiable with for the reader. But one does not have to BE Gideon Nav to enjoy accompanying her on her adventure; she is herself, not a reader-insert, in a way that enriches the story. Harrow as well has an excellent specific presence, her characterization revealed and deepened over the course of the story. The narration is informal, irreverent, and very Gideon, granting the reader an intimacy to its protagonist similar to that of those particularly well-written first-person stories where the narrator is talking directly to the reader, in a third-person narrative that places the story directly in front of the reader the way third-person narrative is best at.The story itself is an engaging, unfolding mystery, well-paced, striking an excellent balance between enough reveal to be satisfying and enough concealment to provide for oncoming surprises. The emotional interactions between characters, and the slowly deepening introductions of them, are are pleasing to read, well-timed and satisfying; relationships, be they hostile or benign, formal or friendly, distant or intimate, are authentic and plausible and, in all their variants, strike one reading them as perfectly reasonable behavior for a gathering of noble-born death magicians collected into a promotion test turned self-run murder mystery in an abandoned palace run by skeletons.Without spoiling too much of the story, the approximate state of affairs is as follows: Gideon, indentured to the Ninth House and engaged in a lifelong mutual rivalry with its heir and effective ruler Harrow, finds her latest attempt to get out and join the military interrupted by an imperial summons: the Emperor invites the heirs of all the nine Houses to attempt to attain the mysterious rank of Lyctor, a high honor. The attempt requires the service of a cavalier, a sort of squire/assistant/companion role into which, for lack of any better options, Gideon is placed.Most of the book follows Gideon as she follows Harrow around an abandoned palace on an abandoned planet (when Harrow is available), and follows her own curiosity, temper, and sex drive around interactions with the contingents of the other Houses the rest of the time. None of the necromancers of the Houses are given much information or direction to work with on what a Lyctor is or how to become one, and as Gideon is not a necromancer, the goal Harrow is after remains shrouded in mystery for most of the story; to this is added a growing number of deaths that appear to be caused by something other than the rigors of the challenges set for them. The reveal, and the climax, and the ending, all leave one breathlessly waiting for the sequel."
"Based on the cover I never would have picked this book for myself. However the author Robin Sloan raved about it in his newsletter, so I had to give it a read. Really glad I did. In general I don't like horror at all, but this is horror in the way that Zombieland or Shaun of the Dead are horror. There are lots of horror elements, but it doesn't come across as terrifying - just generally creepy to set the tone. Gideon is a snarky protagonist which I loved. Wasn't sure how the book would end until the very end. It was a good ending and sets itself up well for the sequel, which I've already pre-ordered."
"Atmospheric, inventive ... a book with soul. I love it. Avoid plot summaries (and in the unlikely event that the author ever reads this, ditch all the notes; they're pretentious and unnecessary) because the story is all you need and anything else just dilutes it. Wonderful characters; some you'll love and some you'll hate and some you'll change your mind about part way through. That's the whole point, isn't it?I just picked this up again, idly glancing through the first couple of pages. Before I knew it, I was half-way through for the second time, and the other couple of books I had been reading are now just unwanted distractions. This is such a good book; even better on the second time through. It’s dark and funny and exciting and sensitive and I can’t say enough good things about it. Awesome."
"As the title says, this plot moved way too slow for me.  I almost put it down unfinished but i finally made it to the end.  There are many great reviews out there but this just didn't work for me, and i won't be finishing off the trilogy.  Most of the characters seemed to go by many different names or titles, and it was difficult to keep them all straight.  About half way through i realized that i didn't really care enough to try to keep track anymore, so i skimmed to the end."
"Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir is a great book. That's the most important thing is this review.The story is... hard to describe. It follows Gideon Nav, a young woman who excel with swords, and wants to leave a crummy planet inhabited mostly be skeletons. All her escape attempts are foiled by her nemesis and excellent necromancer, Reverend Daughter Harrowhark Nonagesimus. Until Harrowhark needs her so badly, that Gideon is offered her freedom. All she has to do is to act as a cavalier, a sword wielding sidekick to necromancers, while Harrowkhark tries to become immortal to help the Emperor. And that journey is complicated.This book is quite hyped up. It's named the best book of 2019 at multiple sites and it has glowing reviews and endorsements from many different places.And in the first part of the book I couldn't see why. I was weirded out by this mishmash of solar empire and planets, but no guns or lasers. Swords of steel and skeletons, but with dirty magazines and space shuttles, but no dragons or other mystical creatures.Then it hit me. Suddenly every chapter compelled me to read just one more, and the story and setting was a wonderful work of wellwowen variety. It got traces of so many different things, and it works so beautifully. There's scifi and fantasy, humor and tragedy, beauty and horror. I don't know how Muir did it, but she did and it's hard to explain.This book deserves that you read a couple of chapters, and I hope that you'll like it as much as I do."
"The book in some ways resembles a video game (characters explore a dimly lit, abandoned laboratory in search of mysterious keys and once they've all been retrieved they face the Boss at the end), but it's a fun story, and the characters are engaging. I wish there was a little more worldbuilding.My biggest complaint isn't about the story: it's about the physical book itself. For a $20 hardcover, the paper feels very cheap -- like a trade paperback that's going to start yellowing any day now. I wish the printing had been on slightly more premium paper. When I buy a hardcover it's typically because I intend to keep it."
I learned about this series from a website listing important fantasy books coming out in August 2020. There was a mention about Harrowhark the Ninth which of course lead to looking at the rest of the series.I can understand why it was an award winner fro both the intertwined stories and characters putting on a complex show for the theater of the mind. This is *not* a simple book that you can read with half attention.My only complaint is that parts of the appendix info like the intelligence dossier and terminology was moved to the front of the book instead of being presented at the end of the book.
"So glad to have gotten this recommendation from someone I trust. What a wild ride. this is exactly the kind of book I love, where you have to just keep going, hoping you figure it out by the end. And now I can't wait for the next and the next in the series! It has everything that a person could love wrapped up in a single book. Court intrigue, fighting, weirdness of every stripe, fast-pace, love & hate, puzzles, power plays, deep history, planetary travel, subtlety, humor . . . I loved it! Do yourself a favor. Get a copy and find the time to enjoy it. Does a body good."
"This book is mad. Well, I thought it was mad before I read the sequel, and then I realized this first book is actually entirely normal and sane.This book series is mad. Gloriously, deliriously, ferociously deranged. Like taking acid, then falling down a very long flight of stairs made entirely of human flesh and bone, while God plays Yakety Sax on an pipe organ in the background. They're LONG books, too, so you have plenty of time to savor the crazy.Very mild spoiler alert, here.Gideon the Ninth is a very angry young woman with a whole laundry list of very good reasons to be that way. Normally the, ""teenage girl is angry because her life is hard,"" trope leaves me entirely cold, but seriously, Gideon has very good reasons to be angry. So she is trying to run away. Only her worst enemy refuses to let her go, and she has an army of skeletons and a deeply messed-up cult to back that up. Gideon's enemy is one of the worst people I have ever encountered in a book before- I immediately wanted to set her on fire- which makes for neck-snapping values dissonance when you realize she is the other main protagonist.Then the two of them go to an abandoned planet, where a truly immense rotting castle full of horrors holds the secret to them becoming gods, if they can survive that long.This is how the story starts.After that, things get weird.Read this book. Read the undead hell out of this book, and know that I envy you for getting to experience it for the first time."
"It was even better than i had hoped for like a blend of genres with Utena’s duels and Caitlin r Kiernan’s gothic diction in between modern twitter-esque idioms.  remarkably unique world building i cannot wait for the sequel.  Completely immersive read and at about 42% I had to stop and read it in daylightDon’t let the reviews complaining that there are too many names stop you.  Trying not to spoil but this is no GOT / LOTR name hell - it’s a tight cast of characters and TM doesnt expect you to remember everything about them after the initial intros - Gideon’s inner dialogue repeats pertinent info and descriptions while giving most people nicknames as she interacts with them more.***There are characters that are named in the beginning that are just name dropped to set up the household order on the ninth planet but you only see maybe five (gideon’s sword instructor, the butlerish person, maybe the aunts, and the two people that are introduced and almost immediately out of scene) that interact with Gideon before she leaves with Harrowhark.In the rest of the acts, there’s the 7 other partnerships (reference at the beginning of the book), the named character in charge of the palace, and two more people.  Harrowhark’s parents are 2 more.So maybe all in all, around 20-25 characters that are memorable.  To reference a recent f/f book, the start is not as clunky with the world building as Priory."
"Usually, it doesn't take long to get a sense for the general shape of the story and a feel for the characters, but here, it took me until I was about a third of the way through the book to really grok it. Then it took off, and I was glad I stuck with it.One of the delights of this story (and there are many) is, of course, Gideon, who gives it its heart and soul. One of the other delights is the fact that Gideon - a loveable lunk and horndog whose main preoccupations throughout the story are when she'll next get to fight, eat, or gawk at a pretty girl - is treated by many other characters as a brooding hero when she's really anything but. The story is complicated, and I certainly took a while to get all the Houses straight in my head, but it both weaves together and then, all at once, unravels in a way that's enjoyable not just for the story but for the craftsmanship that went into it.I'll try not to spoil, but Gideon and her story and the story of her House have stuck with me in the months since I read it, and I'm looking forward to the next chapters. (Also, thanks to Gideon, the words 'nasty drawer bread' are now a permanent part of my personal lexicon.)"
"This book started a bit slow. The vocabulary was a little over my had. The British spellings of words confused me a bit. And I never did totally get into the author's writing style. In short the book was hard for me to read. However, I'm glad I stuck with it. This book was great. Once the book got going I couldn't put it down. And when i did put it down, I couldn't wait to pick it back up. More than once the book made me gasp, in awe. I highly recommend this tale of love and friendship between the magical princess and her loyal knight, with a dark undead twist."
"I wasn't expecting too much when I purchased this - I needed something and this seemed interesting.  What I liked is that this book takes a slightly different approach to your typical scifi story and isn't afraid paint everyone with a little bit of villainy.  I very much enjoyed the depth of story and was continuously drawn along by the hard-earned successes of Gideon as she slowly unravels the secrets and mysteries behind the invitation to attend a conclave of peers from accompanying houses.  When I finished, I was disappointed that the sequel is not yet available.  If I had to compare to other works, there is a bit of Simon Green here in terms of world-building, as well as some Lovecraftian and dystopian future elements with a dash of 'doing horrible things to others for all the right reasons'.  Eagerly awaiting the next installment!"
"It's not perfect by any means, and some of the pacing feels a bit weird, but I found the book very compelling, especially as told through our flawed protagonist, Gideon Nav. Her snarky commentary on the events that unfold throughout the novel had me laughing and feeling deeply for her, despite how wildly different her life is from my own. I definitely laughed more than I expected to, and found the last third of the book impossible to put down."
"It started slow for me, but that didn't last long. I finished the last 2/3rds of the book in a couple of sessions. I don't normally do that. The mix of genre is wow. Fantasy, Science Fiction, locked room mystery, love story, post apocalyptic WTF. Science fiction is currently swimming in wonderful badass female protagonists, but Gideon .... Gideon is the baddest ass of all the badasses."
"This was really fun! I listened to the audible version of this and I one hundred percent recommend that medium if you're able to. The narrator did such an amazing job of capturing all the voices plus the mood of the story. Fantastic! The story felt original, heartfelt, suspenseful, mysterious, and I loved the small pockets of humour. I wasn't expecting the level of death in this and I loved how surprising it all was! Wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone looking for something that plays like a haunted mansion/cool cluedo/ horror book."
"I read this entire book in one day. I picked it up and just kept going. The narrative, the characters, the mystery, it's all just so compelling. This book drips charisma, from its sarcastic swordswoman protag to the crumbling mansion filled with skeletons, rivals, and puzzles that she's exploring.And as hilarious as some of the prose can be, as Gideon comments on some of the more absurd aspects of the premise (a bunch of necromancers and warriors trapped in a haunted mansion), this book has some devastatingly beautiful moments. It's an excellent ride that perfectly pays off in the end."
"I think my expectations were to high for this one. Without a doubt, it was a good book. Gideon is such a fun character. But the setting and plot was kind of a drag to get through. I expected more character interactions and dialogue, mostly because everyone advertises this as necromantic lesbians. I still love the development of Harrow and honestly found her to be the most interesting one there. With the ending, I have definite feeling that this book was merely set up for what’s coming next. Lot’s of potential for the next one."
"For the most part this was a really great read. Gideon started off quite annoying with so much snark, but as the snark lessened, she began to grow on me. The world building is magnificent and so detailed which is why the use of modern-day slang was so off-putting. To have such a richly developed non-Earth world then have the use of such slang as douche-bag and ""that's what she said"" remarks in the mix really jerked me out of the experience. It just didn't fit with the rest of the story. Other than that, I enjoyed the rather unique story and would read the sequel."
"I really wanted to like this more based off the description and overall vibe I entered the novel with. But I think that the story didn’t find its hooks in me and although I carried through to the end, the finale left a hollow feeling.Despite not being an avid fantasy reader, I initially enjoyed the premise of Gideon the Ninth. Then the prose hit and I found myself struggling to keep up with the language. I felt like I needed a fantasy glossary and a character list open at my side for the amount of times I ran into a medieval word or a character I had forgotten. The names in this story, while fitting to the setting, absolutely murdered me with their length and complexity. The lore of the world was immense and while it started gradual, by the time the plot kicks off, the text drowns in already confusing worldbuilding.Coupled with the fact that the main plot of the story turned out to be much simpler than I realized, and I ended up wholly confused as the story trudged on. What kept me going was the relationship between the two leads, Harrow and Gideon, but even that faded near the ending. I found it hard to care about what was happening to the world of Gideon the Ninth because, like the characters, I didn’t know the full picture. Once I was able to figure out where the story was going, I lost interest.Overall, I didn’t hate the book, but it confused me on multiple fronts and seemed to drag itself along at times. Despite being faster paced fantasy than some of the other stuff I’ve read recently, it failed to connect with me in the end."
"I looked into this book after hearing of the LGBT representation it had and the good reviews.This book starts off super confusing. It does start to get better midway through, but many times I had to re-read what the author wrote to grasp what the characters were doing. The verbiage got too much at times.I liked the main character, she could be pretty sassy, but the author never seemed to flesh her out completely in the story and something felt off. There are also many loose ends by the time you finish the book and it leaves you just as confused as you started.This may also be a personal opinion, but after reading this novel I found myself left with the feeling of being queer baited. Sure, a female character casually crushes on a girl for a little bit. But it goes nowhere, is never discussed besides occasional teasing from some, and is lost in the scramble of all the action and puzzles characters face throughout the book.Postive notes - great horror feel, action scenes are interesting if you grasp them the first read, and Camilla was awesome. There are many kicka** women in this story.Overall, read this book if you like the paranormal, horror genre, and being kept on edge. Do not read for the LGBT representation it bragged about on the cover or romance because there is basically none."
"This is more of a gothic horror meets sword and sorcery than it is science fiction. Sure, it's set in the future, but it doesn't really need to be. I really, really liked Gideon's voice, I also enjoyed the writer's humour and the underlying murder mystery was fun. But I just don't go in for magic and horror, leaning more towards space opera and military science fiction. The fact that I finished the book speaks volumes for it, given my limited interest in the grotesque or magic. So sadly, I'm ain't lining up for the sequel."
"The setting of this book reminds me of the Risen Empire series by Scott Westerfeld , but with a small mixture of Dune and Warhammer owing to the mixture of both space age and archaic technologies. The author has a wickedly funny sense of humor and I love her style of prose. At the same time, she is able to deftly mix humor with sentimentality and even a bit of fear.This was, to me, an excellent mixture of science fiction and fantasy and very different. If you are looking for something different from the same old tropes, I recommend this book."
"I don't even know where to start. What hit me hardest were the moments when I got all caught up in Gideon being a badass, and then trip over a little reminder that she's an 18 year old girl who grew up in a tomb, only ever knowing one person who was less than 17 years apart from her in age. She's one of the best sword fighters in the galaxy, but she's never had a salad or a dessert in her life. My heart breaks for her over and over again, but she just keeps on going.Another thing I was particularly impressed by is how well so many of the later plot points are set up. I vaguely remembered a few of those bits, but nonetheless felt compelled, upon finishing it, to immediately scroll back to the start and read it again. Only a handful of things have ever made me do that before, and I can't think of a higher recommendation."
"There isn’t much I can say without giving away any of the twists and turns that this book takes. I mean, the characters are incredible- they scheme, they laugh, they love, they grow... they feel like real people.The world-building unfolds slowly, but not so slowly that I ever felt way over my head. And it’s so *unique*. I’ve never been much for gothic horror or fantasy necromancers, but the magic system here is thoughtful and nuanced and intriguing.The book is just... a constant surprise. Secrets cover secrets cover yet more secrets; the plot flows smoothly in one direction right before ambushing you and throwing you off of a cliff; nothing is as it seems, but everything makes sense without feeling contrived.And I cannot say more without giving everything away. It’s definitely worth a read."
"If you’re anything like me, here’s the one sentence review that will get you to buy this book:Tamsyn Muir somehow managed to write a space wizards story that is nothing like Star Wars or Jedi.If you need more than that, here’s a few more sentences. Yes, lesbians in space but also in a gothic castle is accurate. It’s also funny. It took me a minute to get used to the very contemporary slangy narration from Gideon but once I did, I flew through the book.We meet a collection of strange nobles and learn about the empire they live in little by little. At first it seems too strange to ever make sense but I came to love all the intricacies and politics of the characters. Muir does a great job of building our understanding of the world and letting us live in the strangeness just long enough to feel that horror fiction anxiety before she gives us explanations that make it seem more grounded and logical. It really is a perfect horror-science fiction-fantasy blend.I worry sometimes about these hyped up books that they won’t be as enjoyable as I hope but that’s almost never the case. This was my first Summer Read of 2020 and it was a blast. Pick it up. You’ll enjoy it. I’m going to go preorder Book 2 now."
"**A spoiler or two**And for didn't disappoint. The story was well written, I enjoyed it. There's a few parts that make you pause and wonder why X reacts to Y situation like they did. But the ending reminds me of that one TV trope where the gay character always dies at the end. While I enjoyed the book, the ending killed my interest in the second book. I know it was only one of them. But it did and I doubt I'll read this book again or buy the second."
WOW! I am much more of a high fantasy / historical novel type of girl but HOLY COW! I bought the book on a complete whim (mostly because of the amazing absurdity of the review I read about it and party because I really just liked the look of it and wanted it on my bookshelf 🤷‍♀️) After finishing the final book in Robin Hobb's Realm of the Elderlings (definitely my favorite finished world hands down)  I was having a really hard time getting into reading something else. I bought this book at the end of July and cracked it open two days ago. Well. I ordered the next book when I was 2/3 through the book and it still didn't get here in time.... I can't stop thinking about it and I can't wait to start in on Harrow the Ninth when it gets here today!
"Decided to look for a newish sci-fi/fantasy book to read so picked this up after noting it was nominated for both Nebula and Hugo awards, so entered with a certain level of expectation.  Read through book within two days as it maintained my interest pretty well and I did enjoy it.  Overall it is a good book but not great.  I don't read to many new books so I am not sure what current award-worthy books read like but if someone had told me this was a Japanese light novel or anime adaptation instead, I would have believed it.  I felt the world building was a little weak (possibly it would have been more impressive if I read the appendixes first) and some of the character arcs felt questionable.  The author does choose to flex her vocabulary occasionally, which is always nice, but her dialogue choices are often more hipster and high-schoolish.  This is of course most notable in the main character and caused me to disbelieve her origin and setting somewhat.  That being said the set-up for the next book seems interesting, so I plan to read it eventually."
"The only reason I am giving this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the fact that there were too many characters in the story to keep track of. There were parts of the book where I got slightly bored because of long conversations between people who I couldn't remember their role. It was character overload. Yes there is a reference in the front of the book with the names and houses listed, but I don't like to constantly be checking a reference guide while I'm reading.HOWEVER, that aside, I absolutely loved the book! I loved Gideon's character so much. You most definitely need to read with a completely open mind so you can embrace the craziness and enjoy it."
"The book is set in a multiplanet society governed by necromancers. This is the first book I've encountered where necromancers are the main players, but at it's core, it's really a well-crafted plot driven murder mystery with a bit of an odd couple lesbian love story on the side. As a straight white male with fairly traditional tastes in SF it didn't sound too promising, but it was a well recommended book by a new author so I gave it a try anyway and found myself liking it. I'll definitely be reading the sequel."
"The author has a fresh style, the mixture of a futuristic tale that feels Victorian and often uses colloquially current vernacular is unique without being distracting. The author strikes a great balance of a compelling story told in a compelling way, without pretense. For a middle-aged man, it read a bit like a guilty pleasure as we are assuredly not the target audience, which is why I gave it four stars. There were parts that lacked a certain level of maturity, but not enough to stop me from finishing. We’ll done."
"Sometimes a book is difficult and demands a lot more than I can give at a time. Such was the case with Gideon. First 2/3s it kept reeling me but I wasn't there and kept saying no after a page. And then we clicked and I stayed up half the night to finish it.I took a femur to the head, I have a Muir concussion and I'll never look at necromancers again the same way even in my console games.A wicked book for persistent readers.Definitely recommending."
"I really liked this book as a fan of fantasy/sci-fi, but I just didn’t love it.  The story was interesting but some of the language the main character used I found grating (I think it was supposed to make her seem cool, like she doesn’t care or something) and the twist at the end when the main character and her antagonist / frenemy fell in love was too abrupt and didn’t feel earned.  Overall a good book, I enjoyed it and I’ll buy the sequel, but a little straddling the YA line in some of the writing."
"Gideon the Ninth is an amazing ride. From the first few pages, we are dropped into a fantastical sci-fi world of Houses and Intrigue that are reminiscent of some of the real-world historical politics of the middle ages. Ruling classes, seconds in command, birthright lineages, and intrigue grab your attention in the first chapter!Not to be forced into following the same dynamics of the dynastic houses of history, Tamsyn Muir steps outside those historical norms and embraces and empowers LGBTQ character representation in her main character Gideon. There is so much going on in this first book (easily establishing the universe the characters are in) that it teases the reader into wanting more.This is a great story, with great characters, and a fantastic theme for a modern audience."
"I don't think I had a vocabulary large enough to properly enjoy this. But I did enjoy it, at the end enormously. Especially when the action had picked up and there was less specialized and/or archaic words.It was lovely, lovely puzzle box (or locked door?) mystery, and lovelier still at the end the revelation chased after revelation, all culminating in one really tense sequence. And Gideon was marvelous character, funny and sometimes thoughtless, but not irritating at all, which is big plus in ""brawl over brain"" type of characters. The rest of the cast were also much more than what they appeared at first.I didn't believe in mc's love, but I did believe in Gideon goodness, which was rarer."
"Based on their relationship, the level of sacrifice that Gideon makes at the end doesn't add up at ALL. 0% believability. The physical gesture at the end has a 0% chance of believability as well. NOPE. Within the framework of a world and social constructs etc....even if it's fantasy, it has to make sense. Maybe there were just too many pages and it could have been narrowed down (Harrowed down---get it? That joke is better than a lot of what I had to flip through to get to the good stuff)."
"The most fun you'll ever have with necromancy and multiple murders... The world building is really good, but the characters are terrifically original. The best part, though, is the language -- amazingly clever, playful wordsmithing that just adds so much to the story (think of an millenia-old galactic empire hingeing on a ""And Then There Were None"" sort of mystery) and characters. And, like all good mysteries, the author ""plays fair"" with the reader -- there were hints dropped throughout, which makes it far more fun to piece back together in hindsight.Can't wait for the sequel!"
"Absolutely brilliant prose, and the best protagonist I think I've ever read, nearly every page made me go wow, this person can write! Mind-shattering ending was also amazing. My only complaint is the fairly unnecessary trials in the house they're in, you could cut them all out and it wouldn't make any difference to the story. It's frustrating because you spend so much time trying to remember clues and keep up and it's kind of disappointing that you don't get a prize."
"Normally I would be weary of any novel combining gothic fantasy, space sci-fi, murder mystery, and modern millennial dialogue BUT, somewhat miraculously, Gideon the Ninth makes this odd combination work. The first chapter can be a bit of a shock, as the author certainly does not believe in a lot of exposition, but once you’re in it, you really don’t want to leave. I read this bad boy in two days (despite having minimal down time) and thought of nothing else until I’d finished.Who am I kidding? I’m still thinking of hardly anything else. Sword-wielding, Necromancy-performing, disaster lesbians are hard to shake off.So anyway, buy this book and prepare to laugh at the sass, ponder at the puzzles, fall in love with the characters, and get your heart destroyed in a beautiful way."
"Wow. That was insanely good and fun.There is something about this book that very much reminded me of the Skulduggery Pleasant series (perhaps all the skeletons, cringe jokes, memorable characters and ridiculous names?) which helped me keep with it during the slow start, and I'm glad for it.It starts picking up around the 20% mark and then never stops and I found myself flying through the pages, and continually thinking about it when I wasn't busy reading. The plot twists and mystery was excellent and just when you think you know what's happening, Muir rips the carpet out from under you.Can't wait to dive into the next one."
"I really enjoyed this book. The humor was a bit base at times, but honestlythat made me like it better. The story ended up not being what I expected, instead of just pitting necromancer and fighters against each other in some arena brawl, it was more like a creepy puzzle/murder mystery. It did have some parts that were a little difficult to follow at times, but overall the story was good, the world building was well done, and the characters decently fleshed out. I'm looking forward to the next book."
"A very good book. If I had one critique it would be for the pacing, the first third of the book did feel like 'bad things happen to Gideon and it sucks' for kind of a long time and I can't fault reviewers who gave up before the plot turned from there, and I can't fault them for coming away with a bad impression from that point.HOWEVER.This book is worth it. There are memes and dad jokes that break into the tragedy and science fiction intrigue but rather than destroy my immersion they acted like palate cleansers, a small break that enhanced my enjoyment of the rest of the masterpiece being served up by t.muir. Read the thing.Also everyone talks about the lesbian necromancers in space but forgets to mention the SWORDFIGHTING, which is excellent and fun.I love this book with my whole heart. Just read it."
"I generally don't buy books from advertisements, but the headline of Gideon the Ninth and the synopsis caught me. I am so glad I bought it because I devoured this book. The voice is awesome, Muir's worldbuilding is spectacular, and the characters are amazing. The lore and backstory of this adventure is so well crafted that I wanted to know more. I wish there was an encyclopedia or something just about this universe. Well done and I can't wait for the next one."
"First, this is not a lesbian romance in space. No idea why it's marketed as such. The characters are in space for maybe two chapters...it takes place primarily planet side. It's also not a lesbian romance. Two women find a love and appreciation for each other but there are many ways to love another person. There's nothing romantic about it. It's a murder mystery. This book and world plays by its own rules. As new facts are revealed to the reader, none of it is something you can guess based on anything you've read so far. If that's your style, have at it."
"Every bloody-lipped necromancer and trash-talking cavalier in Muir's extensive cast is distinctive, interesting, and complicated. Characters only deepen as the story progresses, secrets slipping out and alliances shifting.The worldbuilding alone is worth the price of admission. Muir's necromancy is a branching, multi-disciplined system with eight different traditions, each with their own talents, histories, and philosophies.The main character, Gideon Nav, is ruthlessly funny, but her wit is also a shield against a lifetime of pain and confusion. When we see Gideon fight another cavalier for the first time, Muir's writing will stop your breath.I love Gideon the Ninth more than I can say. My skeleton wants to climb out of my skin with love for this book. I can't stop thinking about it. I want to ash and hood my face, clack my knuckle bones in prayer, beg that the locked tomb never open. I want to write fan fiction, and play tabletop in this setting, and tell everyone I know to stop what they are doing and read it right now.This book swallowed me up. Gideon the Ninth is everything stories should be."
Because I would then get to read it for the first time again! I stumbled across this book and saw the score and read some reviews so I took a chance. A real page burner. I so much enjoyed this book for so many reasons in addition to the quirky humor imbedded throughout. Great plot with a mystery theme. Fell in love with the main character. And what an ending! I was looking for something to read that was a bit ‘lighter’ than my last dozen or so books and this one hit the jackpot! Will definitely buy the sequel!
"I was not expecting to live this book as much as I did. I heard so much about it for months before picking it up myself and am mad I waited so long. Probably the most original and creative literature I have read in ages. The characters and world build are amazing. I may have been a bit confused in the beginning with some things, but as the story progressed, my confusion waned. I was not expecting that ending...okay, I was, but I was hoping I was wrong. My emotions. All of my Emotions!!!! Looking forward to the next book."
"A wonderfully imaginative novel full of complex characters, original scenarios, and clever plot devices.It’s a terse and suspenseful gothic novel meets Agatha Christie style murder mystery, while also being a pulp fiction style swords and sorcery novel, but set in outer space in the future.  Muir blends these disparate genres seamlessly into something wholly fresh and original.  It manages to be eerily moody without lapsing into being needlessly “grimdark”.  The pacing is fantastic, the puzzles devious, and the central mysteries will keep you hanging on until the very end!Muir’s debut novel is not just shallow genre blending that relies on fantasticism for it’s character; she writes with a level of depth, precision and clarity seen in the finest novelists."
"It's short for space lesbians. It's what sold me on this book, and it's about fifth on the list of reasons I love it. It's not a romance. It's an adventure, and it happens to involve queer women. Magic and science and cussing and swords and spaceships and ancient undying dynasties. It's good.And, honestly, you could probably set it down after reading the first book. It ends in a satisfying way, unlike many first-in-a-trilogy novels. I really appreciate that."
"I was a little worried by some of the lower reviews and the criticisms here, but I went with my gut to purchase the book and I’m so glad I did. Gideon the Ninth is so unique, thrilling, devastating, and fun - I stayed up for two nights to finish it (day job be damned).I remember seeing in the reviews something about a relationship forming between Gideon and Harrowhark, and 30 minutes into the book I had to put it down and pull the reviews back up to quickly to check that I had gotten the names correctly, because damn, how was the author going to make THAT happen? But she did!I don’t want to spoil anything (in fact, I wish I had read the book without reading any reviews at all) but I will say that I had no icky feelings about whatever ends up transpiring between Gideon and Harrowhark. Things are more nuanced than I let one reviewer lead me to believe - and now as I reread their review, it appears they hadn’t even finished the book yet. C’mon.Anyway, if you were worried about that part of it, don’t be. As for the rest of the book, others have already sung its praise far better than I will be able to. Gideon is a character I will not be able to get out of my head for a long time. I’m eagerly looking forward to the the next one."
"Imagine if the weasley twins were the same person, and a girl, and also DAMN good with a sword....and their prefect older brother was merged with Bellatrix Lestrange and was a necromancer princess and they were tasked with exploring an empty castle full of ghosts as part of a Agatha Christie dinner invitation. All of that packed into a novel that unashamedly uses titles and phrases like ""Sepulchreous Maiden of Doom""This is a bad description of the book but a good description of my mood after reading it.  One of the few books I immediately wanted to go back and reread immediately.  Eagerly awaiting the next one."
Most interesting book I e read in awhile. And no it’s not a book about lesbians. It’s a book about necromancers and their cavaliers some of whom are heterosexual and some of whom are not. Idk why they felt they had to sensationalize the intro by trying to make out like it’s all about lesbians. Who cares as long as the story is great and it is!Though if I were a lesbian I’d follow Gideon anywhere!
"Not your typical necromancers from the gloomy, dark corners of a Clark Aston Smith / Jack Vance realm. It is more of an 'I am Legend' twist where most everyone is a necromancer and/or already dead. Throw in some silliness from one of Robert E Howard's Red Sonja books and let the fun begin. This is a good starting point for the trilogy, I will keep reading; but, they could go either way... would prefer the dark / edgy to the mushy / silly."
"The first half of this book is a two-star read for me. I had to force myself to keep reading it because it somehow had too much detail and not enough worldbuilding explanation. The second half is more of a four-star read, where I could actually finish it in 1-2 sittings. It's not the amazing book a lot of authors I read promoted, but it was okay. I might consider giving this author a second shot for a much cheaper price."
"Loved the premise of the book, but it just seemed to ramble on. Never gave you a good backstory for the actual necromancer houses, and just never got enough character development that you feel much empathy for the characters. It was like the author thought you already knew the characters and universes backstory.All that said its a nice mindless read, you can put it down and come back later ."
"I won’t revisit the wise critical comments of others, but although I found the premise to be promising, the relatively interchangeable and unlikeable characters inhabiting a distant future (a fact which has almost no bearing on the plot) exchanging tired turn of the 20th century idioms (“slow your roll!” is certain to be maintained for millennia to come) never grabbed me as I had hoped. For all the positive reviews, this boils down to a convoluted mystery story propped up by a remarkably implausible system of magic. Most surprises come from the author introducing increasingly bizarre ways to harness the power of bones. But hey if you like when people from the future banter using modern slang and do wildly improbable things with skeletons then go for it."
"I loved this book. The snark and sheer determination of the characters, the overwhelming sense of age and despair of the universe. It all feels suitably gothic and inscruitable, fitting the plot of the book which resolves around gaining immortality. But seeing as these people utilize necromancy as much or more than technology this get deliciously gruesome in short order.The main character is clearly attracted to women but this is by no means a romance, so don't go into it expecting that."
"This book starts like a rollercoaster at Disney World. There might be a few bumps along the way, but look at this cool and funny protagonist! With her around, everything's going to be, if not fine, than humorously so. Suddenly, you realize that your metaphor is off the track. Actually, you're stuck in a car speeding down a creepy mountain road. You can't slow down the car, and the protagonist can't either, but she's definitely going to employ gallows humor all the way down.I'm going to be thinking about that ending for days. Days! I do not know how Tamsyn Muir could possibly follow this up but I sure would like to see her try."
"It was definitely difficult to follow.The biggest issue I had were conversations. They were hard to follow. Half of the time I had to reread certain paragraphs because I got lost as to who was being referred to or was speaking. That is why I gave the book only 4 stars. Oh yeah...and uh...w/out spoiling anything yeah...can't give it away. The ending? Kinda. But it makes sense. But still. : (With that being said:The story is unique and nonchalant gay, ahahahaha. Even with the book being a hard read the story kept me engaged. I wanted to know what happened! I couldn't just skip a chapter or two ahead because I'd be completely lost. So no cheating for me, lol. The ending is GOOD, considering the grand scheme of things. It does make sense. I just didn't want it to happen. It's worth the read tho!I pre purchased the 2nd book in the trilogy...Harrow the Ninth.I can't wait!"
"The quality of the physical product was as expected, I always appreciate a hard back copy. I took a chance on a whim with this book and now I'm groveling in the wait for the 3rd book to tie off the trilogy. It might not be for everyone (some people just aren't into the grim), but I found this to be an exceptionally thrilling read. Despite what the cover notes would have you believe, there is fairly minimal emphasis on ""Lesbian Necromancers in Space"". The only important bit is the ""Necromancers"", which I believe is how this sort of subject should be handled, given the focus of the book being on the actual events and not waifu picking. The author has shown a wonderfully interesting version of death magic (among others), and the possibilities it brings are supremely intriguing, leaving my head spinning with ideas. I might borrow a few of them for my pen and paper games! Bicep contests aside, I eagerly await the next installment, and I'm sure you will too."
"It's hard to put into words what this book is like. I will say Muir's writing is FANTASTIC. These books are extremely funny, and the mysteries they encompass are quite unique - very fun to read! The characters and their dynamics are endlessly amusing. This book is very queer (lgbt), but in an understated sort of way, in my opinion - many of the the characters, including the main two, just happen to be queer. Overall, this book is a delight."
"I love this book. A lot. Definitely one of my favorite reads this year, and now in my top 10. Also a perfect spooky season read.Gideon is an amazing character. Crass and, frankly, hysterical as well as quotable, Gideon's character growth throughout the novel is masterfully written. Clever and funny, this book shows what's possible within narrative. Perfect for fans of VE Schwab and Kendare Blake."
Why am I just reading this boom now?! Because I am an idiot and don’t know what’s good for me...this was such an excellent book and I loved Gideon Nav so much and I loved the very weird relationship that she and Harrowhawk had. This is definitely one of the best books I’ve read this year and I’m slightly kicking myself that it took me this long to get to it. Now onto Harrow the Ninth!
"this book is alright. a fun, quick read that is in turns funny, tense, heartwarming, intriguing.it should be billed as a young adult novel - the primary characters are between 14-25 years old, and figuring themselves out.many of the plot points are a little too convenient with no explanation.that said, it kept me hooked for hours at a time."
"Do not let the stupid reviews of others prevent you from reading this book. It is wonderful. I haven’t been so riveted to a book in a long time. On the cover, Charles Stross (whoever he is) says “lesbian necromancers explore a haunted gothic castle in space”. That is the worst synopsis of the plot I can imagine. Another reviewer said that he couldn’t stomach how horrible Harrowhawk was. That person clearly did not finish the book. My daughter convinced me to read this. I’m so glad she did. Great book!"
"The first 100 pages or so you might think, what is this? You might be tempted to put it down. Don't. This is the real deal. Easily the freshest and most imaginative sci-fi/fantasy mashup since the Broken Earth trilogy, no it's better and weirder. This is the good stuff, the second book only expands and blows up everything. I have been reading fantasy and sci fi since like the 80's and these two books have blown my mind in the best way. Buy this book, become a convert."
"I really enjoyed the snark, leering, and general mayhem of this book. Very interesting and inventive world building that gets fit into a “family gathers in haunted rich uncle’s mansion and people start dying” framework (and I loved that). While at times I laughed out loud, other times I was grimacing at the visceral violence. Very happy I picked this book up, thrilled I could not put it down."
"What an enjoyable read. Neither sophisticated nor refined, smooth nor consistent. Nonetheless the dialogue kept me laughing throughout the story. Found it a bit difficult to follow 18 main and semi main characters. Definitely recommend.Interested to see how the follow-on corrects or builds to these shortfalls to make the read even more enjoyable."
"Gideon the Ninth is a charming, entertaining, and frankly heart breaking book. The relationship between the two main characters - Gideon and Harrowhark - is magnificently drawn. I adored the worldbuilding, fell in love with the characters, and hung off every new development in the plot. I also laughed my ass off, as Gideon is genuinely hilarious. The action scenes were also very well done - I often get bored during action scenes, but these kept me on the edge of my seat. I cannot recommend this book highly enough!"
"I have enjoyed this book. Gideon herself is a delight to be with, her sarcasms are hilarious, and how she makes the best out of the worse case scenarios are high-octane. The book is a definite slowburn. There are plenty of characters to meet and each one are fleshed out just enough for the story. When the action kicks in, it really rolls. Also, lesbian necromancers in space? What's not to like?"
"Wonderful and thought-provoking sword-and-sorcery/sci-fi/horror/gothic neo-modern/romantic/swashbuckling/murder mystery novel. Set in a solar system suspiciously like our own in a galaxy at once futuristic and medieval with well-developed characters, snappy dialogue and truly original (or at least remixed and reimagined in original ways) concepts and situations."
"A deeply convincing and genuinely funny, emotionally captivating action-filled space-romp with lesbian necromancers and lots of bones.It's a bit like Terry Pratchett meets grimdark and gothic horror, which, as it turns out, makes it one of the most convincing depictions of a human protagonist in hard circumstances I've read in a long time.Definite recommendation."
"I liked the way the main two characters were written and how they evolved. I didn’t like and couldn’t really visualize the world ,the main plot and characters were confusing and until almost the end did I get a grasp of everything. I would have loved more from Gideon. I gave three stars , I didn’t hate it and I might read the next in the series."
"Great book, interesting characters, horror/sci-fi,  engaging story. Couldn't put it down. My only gripe is the dialogue and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Some of the characters speak like a young adult would today and that can completely take you out of the moment. This book is about an entire empire built on necromancy in space but you get the equivalent of ""yo mama"" jokes in the dialogue sometimes."
"One of the most original and heart wrenching books I have read in a long time.Confusing terms and secrets and necromancy specifics are only learned over the whole book because the main view character Gideon Nav is confused and doesn't really give a shirt about the details of necromancy. Now swords, yup! Gives a shirt about them.But the exploration of Nav's and Harrow's relationship is beautiful.that's all I'll say. Read it. 5/5 Skulls💀😀😍💀😀😁💀💀😨😰😮😍🥰💀🤯💀😱😭💀💀💀👍💀💀💀💀💀/💀💀💀💀💀"
"This book is unequivocally one of the best I've ever read, and I recommend it to everyone I can with 0 prompting on their part. Its tagline really says all you need to know to want to read it, but even that doesn't convey just how fantastic and entertaining Tamsyn Muir's style is. I love Gideon and Harrow and want all the good things for them, and you should read this book so we can commiserate on how great they are."
"So, I loved this book and look forward to many more by the author Tamsyn Muir. It is one of the most original I have ever read and I have read very many. I looked at some of the poor reviews and I have no idea what their problems were with this book. I know you can’t please everyone but I’m sort of flummoxed.Ms. Muir’s characters were unique, I was surprised time and again (which in of itself was delightful) and the story universe was well developed. I highly recommend it."
"This is unlike anything I have read before. This is sci-fi, fantasy, a mystery a horror and so much more. You would think with that description that it would be a clunky mess but it really isn't. It had such great world building that I really do think (hope) to see this as a movie one day. Really looking forward to the next two books"
"Whoever described this as ""lesbian necromancers in space"" did the author a thorough disservice.  Read this astonishingly inventive book for the characters, the society in which they live and the locked room mystery which takes up most of the novel.  The layer by layer reveal of history and elements of the characters' back story is a favourite of mine, rather than pages and pages of explanation of how things work; something is mentioned in the book and later more details are revealed which cast light on the motivations and actions of the character.  A lot is left hinted at and unexplained but, for me, that adds to the quality of the novel."
"I really wanted to love this book. And I do like it. Many times I did love Gideon, who is definitely the star. Many passages are beautiful. But I was lost for almost the whole book. I had a hard time keeping up with all of the characters and the different names for them and their different house histories, etc.I am interested in the continuation of the story with Harrow, whose book comes out later this year."
"In a world of necromancers and cavaliers , Harrow and Gideon are a stand-out pair and not just because they're from the Ninth House. They're not only an iconic pair but so vivid and lovable on their own. Harrow definitely takes some time to love, but when you come around to her and watch her deal with the challenges before her there is so much complexity and depth. And who can't adore Gideon Nav? The remaining cast are all equally complex and lovable. I am desperately excited for the next book!"
"Generally, when I pick up a book that Warren Ellis has recommended I know I’m going to enjoy it and this book is no exception.  Loved it!  Smartly written with crackling dialogue and some original world building.  There aren’t that many books I’ve read more than once (just too many books out there) but this one joined the club and in fact, became the first book I’ve ever read a second time immediately after reading it for the first time.  Great stuff.  Can’t wait for Harrow the Ninth!"
"If you want to get invested in the story of a badass character (Gideon) and then have the author take a massive dump all over her, read this book.It was well-written. The action scenes were well-executed, cinematic. I love a good thriller and murder mystery, so I was hooked. I'm just not sure what the author was trying to accomplish by romanticizing the manipulation and horrible treatment of the main character. Gideon may have had stockholm-syndrome, but I did not. The ending fell completely flat, for me."
"Probably not, but I will. Gideon the Ninth takes the best parts of scifi, mixes it with sword and sorcery, tosses in a healthy dash of horror, and adds some of the best characters I’ve read in year placed in an amazing plot. I was so happy to find out that this was the first book in a trilogy. I was devastated when I learned that the other two books have not been published yet.Bone witches. Cavaliers. Political intrigue. Mystery. Death. I can not describe this well enough. Just go get the book! You’ll thank me."
"Never have I laughed so hard during an epic fantasy read! The contemporary language left me occasional head scratching (eg. a girl worrying about “pizza face”, which left me thinking “wait they have pizza in this space opera? IS THERE SPACE PIZZA?”) but truly a super fun read, despite having a cast of a thousand characters (my literary Achilles heel)."
"I wasn’t sure about this book at first — Was it supposed to be funny? Are you allowed to have a spaceship in proximity to a gothic castle? Why are there skeletons? — but I read on because it was well reviewed and even had a blurb from one of my favorite writers, Martha Wells (Murderbot Diaries). And thank goodness I did because I am totally, wildly, uncomfortably obsessed. This book is bonkers. It is so unique and fun and full of slow (and then very fast!) burning mysteries that I haven’t stopped thinking about it for weeks. If you like stories that are twisty and sweet and bloody and gut-punchingly, heart-wrenchingly one-of-a-kind, then this book is for you. I could relay the plot, but I don’t want to. Just trust me (and Martha)."
"I don't add books to my top 5 often, but this book is NUTS. It gets a little over my head at times, but I never minded because it was irresistibly funny and irredeemably dark. The characters were so rich and the swearing so impressive. This woman uses adverbs like blades. Amazing. Already bought the two sequels!"
"This book was an amazing journey where you don't understand what's happening but you love it.  As you learn and experience the story, it just gets richer and more interesting. The twists and turns are wonderful. You will love this book. Now for the only sad news - stop here. There is another book in this series, but it's awful. Stop hear and love this book."
"The author sets up what could be a very interesting universe. I wanted to like it. However, there was no discernible backstory, and the characters were really really hard to like. Their motivations were unclear, and without context. I got a few chapters in but just couldn't find a reason to care about the characters."
"The book is so well written the existence of Necromancers and their individual powers is believable. As with any good novel, however, the character development carries the book. At the beginning I couldn't keep the characters straight. By the end each house and individual was unforgettably etched in my mind."
"I bought this book ""new"" but it's covered in gunk and something crusty on the spine and it's all beat up. This is one of my all-time favorite books and I'm pretty upset that it arrived in this condition.That being said, I'm still going to read it cover to cover again and make my friends read it too."
"Over halfway through the book and I felt compelled to share my wide eyed enthusiasm.  This is a breath of fresh air, albeit with the perceived stench of Necromancy about it.  Some new authors fall into the trap of over-explanation or ham fisted world building, not here.  Easy to follow, with wonderful ""visuals"" and fast paced ""fights"".  I would love to see this world expanded on and woven together like the Culture books of Iian M Banks.In the modern world of remakes, reboots and sequels, this is a rare treat that feels new and fresh."
"No bones about it, this is a rip roaring good tale that suckered me in and held me on the edge of my seat right up until the final pages. I wish there was more to read - the protagonist is brilliant, the world building is like Chronicles of Riddick on speed with a hefty bit of Book of the New Sun thrown in for good measure, and a dollop of Clue. I laughed, I cried.It isn't a masterpiece of science fiction that will change how you view the world, a la Children of Time, but it is really good, stupid fun. Amazingly good, stupid fun."
"I am always looking for great writers. Writers who know what flow is, writers that have read enough books to know writing 'he said and she said' too much, breaks the flow and makes us feel you think we are too stupid that you need to CONSTANTLY remind us who is speaking. Here you only get epic fights, intelligent mystery, lots of flow. I am so happy I found another great. Will follow."
"It's close to 9AM. I haven't slept. It's because of this book.This is not as coherent as it should be for obvious reasons, but you should read this book. It has swords, puzzles, romance, necromancy, and something resembling dungeon crawling. It is a thing of beauty. You should read this book."
I think the author does a great job and making you feel invested in the characters . The plot is something new and intriguing. The reason I give it 3 stars is I feel like they give you a lot of questions about Gideon but fail to answer them and that is the part that really stopped me from loving this book.  It could be just me but I felt it was hard to keep track the other characters and I never really felt invested in them. Also didn't help that I wasn't to impressed by the ending.
"I went into Gideon the Ninth knowing I would love it, and it did not fail me. The scenery is lush, the characters are sharp, the lore is deep, and the pacing is spot on. There were gorgeous twists and turns and a lot of heart to this story.It is not feel-good by any means, but deals with complex and morbid topics without being heavy-handed or melodramatic. There is a lot of body horror for enthusiasts of such, and the queer characters are wonderfully handled. (And also plural in their number!)I loved it, it made me cry, and I am very excited for the upcoming sequel."
"The tag line was an easy sell, but the author weaves a deep, character-driven story of relationships, shared hardship, and complicated personal history. The shift from fantasy to suspense holds together along a macabre thread that provides a wonderful aesthetic. I cannot wait to read the next entry in the series."
"Nothing I can say can possibly do this madcap adventure justice.I suspect that everyone who reads this will either love it like it's their first kiss, or hate it with a burning passion, with nothing in between. This was one of the most flamboyant, cartoonish, genre-smashing roller-coaster rides I've been on in a while. Just incredible.I've literally marked the release date for book two on my calendar. That's a first for me."
"The story does a great bit of world building in the first half that struggles to find a way, but kicks it up in the second half. While some of the dialogue is choppy at times it can be attributed to the main characters immaturity. Overall, a book I can recommend if you can keep focus on a bit of a slow burn."
"I haven't devoured a book in one day in ages, but that's what happened with Gideon the Ninth. A laugh-out-loud funny and sob-quietly tragic story that combines a luxurious gothic sensibility with horror, parlor room murder mysteries, sci-fi and space epics. My highest possible recommendation."
"And you’ll need to. I fell in love with Gideon and her graceless, spiky manner immediately, and wandered confusedly with her through a gorgeously detailed world that is hinted at in flickers behind the story like shadows on a cave wall. Then, having raced breathlessly to the climax I started all over again, this time with UNDERSTANDING of all the tiny clues Tamsyn Muir wove into a seamless tapestry of story.Who knew a book about the dead, the dying and the undying would be so much FUN?Who knew that lesbian necromancers in space would break my heart?There is so much more I need to know about the Nine Houses and their Emperor. Cannot wait for the sequel."
"post-apocalyptic fantasy sci-fi in a totally unique world with totally unique magic system.  Really great writing, and REALLY awesome characters.  Amazom suggested this forever before I read it and I am so glad I finally did. It is gory to an extent, just to warn you, but the characters are SO WORTH it."
I really enjoyed reading this. While in one sense this could be seen as a dungeon puzzle story it’s actually very different. The merger of necromancy and science fiction makes for a delicious mix of world building and unusual characters. Can’t wait to read the next one.
This was a fun read even though there was some pretty intense events happening in the lives of the characters.  The world these characters live in is brutal and death is just a regular common part of it.  Really enjoyed how the author expanded the scope of the novel as it progressed.  Looking forward to reading the next novel to see where the story goes from here.
"Amazing writing, in depth character development and plenty of action. Fight scenes are really well done and the dialog is extremely engaging. Gideons humor alone would make me rate highly. I was halfway through this book and i preordered the next book. I will forever read anything by this author."
"Favorite book of the year, maybe of the decade.  The world is entrancing, the characters are delightful, the writing is both deeply poetic and hilarious, and the material itself is skin-crawling.  As someone with a short attention span, the density of characters and verbiage was sometimes hard to digest, but that didn’t ever affect my love for the book or my desire to keep reading.  I finished the book in two days, and after a day or two of digesting, will be returning to it to pick up the details that my brain skipped over the first time.  Extremely satisfying, poetic, charming, gruesome, and lovable.  I can’t wait to re-read this book again and again."
"Slow to start but worth it if you hang in there. The story grew on me and by the end I found it worthy to pre order the next in the series. Gritty, Dark, Angsty and interesting character abilities. This isn’t a typical story with typical characters. Recommended."
This book was great for the first few chapters. I loved the dynamic of Gideon paired with Harrowhawk. Then the author decided to separate Gideon from everyone and make her wander aimlessly for most of the middle of the book. A huge chunk of this book was the main character not knowing what was going on and being sworn to silence (her sharp tongue was her most intriguing aspect and that was taken from her). This book never redeemed itself after that.  I forced myself to finish it and then questioned whether I actually enjoy reading (I do).
"Interesting metaphors and characters, but disjointed serial events, not integrated into an understandable story line.  Dialog frequently unattributable.  Too many characters.  Reads like a monster video game.  Struggled to finish and connect the events."
"Gideon the Ninth is a truly original and engaging fantasy novel, perhaps the best I have read in a long time. Set in a strange, dark world filled with necromancers and skeletons, this book somehow manages to be a perfect blend of action, humor, horror, and human emotion. I laughed out loud, became absolutely invested in the plot, and came close to crying all through the course of this book. This is a very strange book, nothing like what I've ever read before, that somehow manages to be a highly engaging and satisfying experience."
"The author did a wonderful job building a complex, believable, yet completely fresh world. More impressively, they did so with some of the most fully sketched, believably imperfect, relatable characters I can remember in F/SF. Highly recommended!"
"A brilliant fantasia of necromantic slaughter, eldritch diplomacy, and spine-tingling campfire tales, written in blood with bone-splinter pens. Author Muir lends her fey genius to this story so effectively that it rises from the dead earth like a horrific skeleton bent on revenge.I loved it to death."
"This is a helluva book!!! There isn’t one aspect of the story, characters, settings, dialogues, or even weird food descriptions I would change. So so beautifully written and a really fascinating world the author created. I am going to buy book 2 right now."
"Absolutely phenomenal book - the contrast between the stark, grim world and Gideon's absolute irreverence is amazing. The worldbuilding, although it's never very explicitly explained, is incredibly unique, and the relationship between Gideon and Harrow is masterfully developed."
"Is a mix of sci fi, magic fantasy and murder mystery stories, with romantic novel between girls. The Muir's style is very rich, with an excentric sense of humor and crispy descriptions and narratives, but maybe is a style for youngsters and I am too old for this."
"I considered putting this book down during the first several chapters, but I'm glad I didn't! It won't be added to any favorites list, but I definitely enjoyed the story and uniqueness of it and am glad I persisted through the slow start up."
"Read this wonderful novel over the weekend.  It kept me up late and had me up early on a Sunday to finish it.This book has something for everybody.  Comedy, romance, horror and all the makings of a grand space opera series.I highly recommend you give this book a chance."
"Great twists and turns, sometimes cryptic and well paced from start to finish. This feels like a book you could reread a second time and pick up so many ah-ha's along the way. Strong recommend for anyone who is a fan of sword, sorcery, space and skeletons!"
Had high hopes; they were well-met.  Imaginative and deftly described world with huge pantheon potential.  Plus any book successfully employing penumbrous gets bonus points🙂Looking forward to the rest of the trilogy!
"Read this book! Its maudlin and hilarious.  Sisters, who despise each other,work together to solve puzzles at an ancient haunted house.  This book also has thrilling sword fights and necromancer battles.  I am waiting excitedly for the next installment!"
"The buzz gave high hopes, but the execution of plot and characters left a lot to be desired.  I wasn't buying the world she was creating.  I wanted to believe, but not happening here."
"Put down everything you are doing and read this book! It’s incredible! mystery, romance, magic, action, horror, friendship all combined and I’m sure I missed a few notes. This book is a joy to read so much so I’ve read it twice and love finding all the foreshadowing and clues throughout the book. Really a joy to experience."
"Gideon the Ninth is an irreverent mashup of Sci-Fi, Fantasy and murder mystery. Lots of unexpected twists and monsters and intense action. Dialogue is sometimes salty, but spot-on for the characters and refreshingly amusing. I listened on Audible and thoroughly enjoyed the narration. The characters are very engaging, and Tamsyn Muir lands a surprising and gratifying ending."
"When I started this book I was concerned it would turn into a trashy, silly horror story. I had no idea it would evolve into a beautifully written escapade of imaginative fiction. I’ll definitely be reading the next book in the series."
"Not quite finished, but have been in heaven reading thus far. Love the prose, originality,  and story. So happy I purchased the hardback. At a time when I am editing my possessions this book will hold pride of place on a shelf."
"This has been one of the best books I've read this year. I've recommended it to all my friends. The character development is spot-on. I was able to connect with Gideon and wander my way through the story perfectly. The story is super-fantastic, too. Great space opera."
"It has lots of interesting characters.  Spaceships, computers, and Magic... but swords are the predominant weapon...?!?There seem to be some large logical issues that are required to drive the plot...  but if your suspension of disbelief muscle is ready, there is a decent story here."
The content was interesting because it was very diffrent.Spoiler.Main character of the series is not who you think it is. And the ending pretty much sucks.  I doubt I will read the next two books.
"First of all, I need to come clean. I already wrote a review having read about 30% of the book and got bored with it. Afterwards I simply decided to keep on reading and learned never to stop reading unless absolutely necessary. Yes, this is weird. Swords and cavaliers with necromancy is Space. Yes it's not for everyone. But it keeps getting better as you get to know the characters, lore and intrigue. It's not an easy read, and it's certainly not for everyone (30% in, it wasn't for me) but I admit my mistakes. Definitely a world to delve into."
"It's rare to find an original author..someone that creates a new world that draws you in 100%. The book Gideon the Ninth was such a book. It impressed me so much I pre-ordered the 2nd book in the series. Please read it,, you will impressed to..I garentee it."
This book got such great reviews.  I was hoping for more.  I didn’t care about any of the characters and what happened to them.  It took so long for it to tell it’s story. Not sure how this book is up for a Hugo.
"This is mainly a fantasy book with some small, at this point in the series, science fiction/space aspects tossed into the mix. I found it somewhat challenging to figure out what was happening and just went along for a marvelous ride."
"Gideon the Ninth is one rare and special f’en book. Easily the best thing I have read in years. It’s funny, exciting, heartbreaking, crass, dark, scary and above all a fun as all hell read. One of those books one comes back to reread over and over again.Can’t wait for more"
"This book is so amazing. Hands down one of the most interesting books I've read in a long time. The characters are interesting, the world and universe are immersive, and the plotline is full of unexpected twists. Plus, the writing style is unique--blending a sophisticated voice with hilariously crude elements and exclamations. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a gripping read with action, comedy, and mystery. To top it all off, this is one of my favorite representations of a lesbian character I've seen in a novel. Excellent!"
"Fast paced, this book is a murder mystery gone wrong with an enemies to friends to maybe something more? added in. At times hilarious, I was kept guessing and trying to figure out what the heck was going on. Definitely a lot of fun."
"I haven't been this unwilling to put a book down, or this excited to be able to pick it up again, in a long time. Highly recommended. Now I'm going to wait impatiently for the second book in June."
"...and its so much better the second time through. I freaking adore this book. It's so unusual and not like anything I've read in ages. Sick of all the time worn tropes in other fantasy and sci fi? Please read this glorious, flawed but ultimately awesome mash up."
Interesting beginning with a middle that was drawn out a bit to much with a satisfying ending. Wasn’t hard to get through but it wasn’t demanding my attention like other books I’ve read.
"While I love this book and well worth the the read, and up to par with other fantasy novels I've read(malazan book of the fallen, etc etc) The ending was quite shocking and a bit bittersweet"
"This is my favourite book I’ve read this year. It’s hilarious, engaging, active and fun. I love Gideon; she’s impossible not to fall for. Can’t wait to find out what happens in the next book."
"I read it, then read it again back to back to enjoy the craftswomanship and worldbuilding.A rare gem of storytelling that reminds me of Iain M. Banks where snippets and glimpses baked into the story build a multifaceted whole of surprising depth.Great character building and a delightful, almost deceptively easy prose help maintain  momentum all the way to the grand finale.I'm thoroughly looking forward to the second installment."
It said that all the first edition of the book will be black sprayed edges but main is not
"This book is truly a masterpiece. It's brutal, and sad, and happy, and a lot of other things I'm not emotionally prepared to process so soon after having read it. Stop reading this and buy this book."
"I don’t think I could have conceived of being intrigued and absorbed into a story about necromancy, but the author has created just such a work. On to book two and hoping it stays so."
"I adored the heck out of this book. I laughed out loud, I gasped, and I finally cried. Gideon is hilarious and heartbreaking, and the perfect book to end my 2019 reading challenge on. Can’t wait for Harrow the Ninth!"
"I absolutely LOVED this book!The dialogue is hilarious, rude and delightful. Gideon is such a fun breath of fresh air.Super fun and going on my best of 2019 list."
"I loved the blend of genres. A magical castle, a puzzle, a haunted laboratory and sixteen strangers desperately trying to solve a “who-dunn-it” murder before it’s too late. The plot was like a well produced pop song and I didn’t want it to end."
This has to be one of the strangest book I've ever read.It move you along but all isn't clear as to how it may fit until the end and then maybe not.Could be fun
"This was amazing.  I started it in that restless state where I couldn’t really lose myself in a book... until this one.  I got totally sucked in and stayed up late to finish it.  It has the right mix of everything, and anything else would be a spoiler."
Interesting world the author is building with characters that have a little more edge than Harry Potter. More Underworld. Read it now because this will definitely be a movie soon and you can casually say you “liked the book better”.
Great character development. Exciting story. Dry wry humor. I found myself laughing out loud throughout the book. Bought a copy for a friend so they could enjoy it too.
"I really enjoyed this book. I loved her writing style with its dabs of sarcasm. I definitely learned some new vocabulary, and the depths of each character were awesome. This was a different breath of fresh air from the usual style of books I see."
"This is an amazingly well done book.  The characters make sense in their universe, the plot is well done.  I'm looking forward to the next installment.This author has a great voice."
"Enjoyable for it majesty and tragedy, this book has intrigue, unreliable narrators, romance, action, and delight. Do recommend.First book I’ve read with dialog written in the format of the “very online” tribe who posts on tumblr or the like. Enjoyed."
"I literally couldn't put this down and lost sleep finishing it. One of a kind storytelling, very cool universe, and main character is a trip. Preordered the sequel."
I heard great things about this story and had high expectations and it indeed exceeded those expectations and I’m happy to say is now a fave book of mine.
"I absolutely love it. Muir is brilliant. Don't miss it, get it now.Can't wait to read the final book to see if this is a great series or just a great first book."
"I had to put this book down while reading it; I didn't have time to read it straight through.  That was so hard to do.People are foolish, people have hidden agendas, people are malign and good and just trying to survive, and you can feel it with them.  This was a great debut and I am waiting so eagerly for the sequel..."
"Great book. Difficult to read, sure. But hard to read doesn't mean bad. I was intimidated at first, but hooked all the same, even though I barely had any idea about the plot or characters. I've finished it in a couple of days and immediately wanted more. It's hard to write original sci-fi/fantasy these days, and this author managed it very well."
"I found the book crude, confusing and grossI didn’t like the characters or the world building and could not get past the first three chapters."
This is an incredibly entertaining book. As always with any good book one there are lots of answers I am still looking for… but fingers crossed I’ll get those in the next! My only complaint is that each character seems to have at least 5 different forms of names so at time it can get difficult to keep control of which character Is speaking since they will be identified as 2-3 different names in the same conversation… oh well! I am still reading on!
"Too many names for my brain, but absolutely excellent story all the same. Lesbian space necromancer planet adventure. What more could you possibly want?"
Where are my girls???
This was a fun and sassy romp through a decrepit sci-fi manor. Gideon and Harrow have chemistry that makes Sparks fly and sets just about everything on fire. The supporting cast are just as amazing and the mystery leaves the reader gasping.New favorite on my shelves.
"Paint your face, ladies and skeletons and bow before the undying greatness that is this book. If you are looking for a book to fill your heart, rip it out and still leave it beating joyously outside your chest: this is that book. If you are looking for characters that will make you love, hate, laugh and ugly cry on the train home: this is that book. This book is a triumph of a rare and wonderful kind."
"This is an amazing read, but I docked it a point because I hate the ending.  It partakes of so many of the icons of fantastical lit, but it is completely its own thing.  Tamsyn Muir might be a genius."
"If you like murder mysteries, women with swords, necromancy, and gays in space, you’ll like this book. 10/10, I will 100% be rereading until the sequel comes out."
"I purchased this on a whim when it went on sale. It turned out to be well worth it. It had a little bit more of a 'Warhammer-y' vibe than I normally like, but this was offset by the characters having a sense of humor. When the sequels come out I'll actually cough up the full price for them."
"When someone describeed it as ""swordfighting lesbian necromancer in space"" I thought it sounded like a joke.  While it may be accurate in the description, it was very well written and far deeper than I assumed.  Campy fun reading that was so much fun I went and instantly got the second book."
"I don't want to gush too much about how I adore this book, but it's got it all. Adventure! Comedy! Tragedy! Horror! Mystery! Romance!Gideon the lovable meathead with a heart of gold... Harrow the prickly pain in the ass with a hidden sentimentality... The dynamics between the two leads are perfect blend of enemies to lovers, knight/lord, nerd/jock! And it's only the first entry in the trilogy!Smashed that preorder button for Harrow the Ninth right after completion because I require more death juice!"
"Fun characterizations, bone magic, swords, and battles. The food pretty much sucked and everybody died. Yep, a fine ending. I might even be #2."
"I read and listen to a lot of books.  It's not often, I finish one and am truly awestuck by the entirety of it all. This is one such book.I mean... the cover art for starters!And...""Lesbian necromancers explore a haunted gothic palace in space! Decadent nobles vie to serve the fearless emperor! Skeletons!""” —Charles Stross"
A new universe to read about.  Magic and bones and blood to serve an undying ruler.  A competition involving different factions.  Great characters and a novel story line.  I will be reading the next.
"I really enjoyed Gideon and the world she inhabits. ""Magic space lesbians"", has been used as a common descriptor. The absolutely are that, but its super well written and has great characters, a compelling world, it's really good."
"Couldn't really get into this,maybe for a younger audience.Not badly done but just couldn't get into it.And not interested."
The story is so strange and unusual but it also Grand you and carries you along. I cannot wait for the next book. Highly trimmed
"This book starts very very slowly. There's  a lot of characters to keep track of, but MAN  does this book combine some cool ideas. Part Hitchcock murder mystery, part school for dark arts, part science fiction space fantasy/opera. Absolutely  well done and a great cliffhanger ending. Will be buying the second and third"
The story was going well...then for a good number of pages... I became restless and somewhat... tired of Gideon... BUT there was some redemption towards the end. This book was an almost perfect 5... wish I could give it a 4.5.
"While the mystery failed to interest me at first and I had trouble remembering all the characters, the later half of the book and Gideon and Harrows interactions kept me hooked. Gideon was a very fun character and Harrow's development left me interested in where she goes next."
Look forward to the next in the trilogy by this author.  Good action and interesting world.  Curious if Gideon will make a repeat appearance.
Enjoyed the author’s wry humor from time to time.....but I found the plot too arcane and hard to follow.  The Big Reveal at the end left as many questions as it answered.
☠️☠️☠️☠️ me. Astounding.Clueless + Chronicles of Amber + Ten Little Indians = the best sci-fi/fantasy novel I've read in a decade.
This book had been recommended in Time (I think). It just wasn’t that interesting unless you are really into necromancy (which I am not)
Interesting characters and a good mystery as well.  A page turner and will definitely read the second book.  Well done!
I deeply enjoyed this and thought the world building and universe writ large created therein begs further exploration. I also was endeared by the protagonists’ relationship and look forward to it being expanded upon. Ultimately though? It turns out I take a great deal of pleasure in a necromancy space  operatic story with smart arse anti-heroic heroine.
I just can't even deal with this book. Gideon and Harrow are the best duo. And this very quickly became my new favorite book
"In Gideon the Ninth, Tamsyn Muir has created a compulsively moreish novel. I loved the protagonist, loved every word, and anxiously await future installments."
"It's like a brilliant mashup of sci-fi, fantasy, and an Agatha Christie who-done-it. I don't know how, but it works.It's unlike anything I've ever read, but I loved it."
"Finally something different! I love a book with a strong female protagonist, dark humor and sass. The plot twists were great and I didn’t expect the element of mystery. I thought the dynamic between the main characters was great and the world building was rich and immersive. I laughed a lot, and stayed up way to late. 100% recommended, and I’ll definitely be checking the other works from this author."
"And strange characters with a plot as wierd as any I've read in 50 years of reading strange,  strange fiction!A monumental creation... highly recommended!"
"How dare you write a book this good. I’m bloody exhausted, I can’t read the next one until I get some damn sleep and that is too long."
This was a hell of a ride and I am in love with Gideon and her necromancer.  It was rollicking and suspenseful and feathering and grand.  Can't wait for the next book!
"Best book I have read all year and thats saying quite a lot, considerig I have read at least 140 books last year. I can't wait to see the movie and if there isn't one THERE SHOULD BE."
"Horror, mystery, hate.This book is pretty damn good. I'm off to wait for the next book, hope it comes soon."
Tas will make you laugh and then punch you in the gut so you're not sure if your tears are from the meme-y goodness or the crazy world building or the amazing characters. One of my favorite books in YEARS.
"I loved everything about this book.  The setting, characters, story and writing are all fantastic.  Definitely one of the best books I read in 2019."
Despite the desire to market this as 'Necromantic Lesbians in Space' this triumph of world building and character development leaves you in tatters over the idea of sacrifice for your greatest enemy and the love of the same. Ignore the obvious and embrace the weird as you travel down the paths of a rotten empire fouler than thebone and corpses which are the hallmark of the ninth.
"Just finished reading Gideon the Ninth. It's a very odd book about necromancers, sword fighting bodyguards, and a decaying empire set in the far future. It held more then just a hint of the grim dark found in the Warhammer 40k universe. The characters were very engaging. I quite enjoyed it."
"I expected to love it, but gave up on trying to slog through the uninteresting mess about a quarter of the way in. Perhaps it gets vastly better halfway through, but life’s too short to have to force yourself to finish reading this."
"Bought the book, started to read it. Then got the audiobook so I could listen to it while I worked cause I couldnt wait til I got home. Then I would go home and continue reading. Then went back and read the parts I listened to, and then listened to the parts I read. The world building, characters, and prose were just such fun to read and dive deep into. A wonderfully built world and magic system. The characters are so enjoyably snarky. The  Visual descriptions were a delight to read and for an illustrator it was a visual candy store full of cinematic descriptions and delightfully sassy sentences."
"I bought and gifted this to my Niece -- I think it's the first e-Book I've ever done that with. It reads like a Lore-rich, Necromantic Video game and thus, I've fervently recommended to all my friends who would appreciate such a well-crafted construct.  :-)"
"No wonder this won the Hugo.  It was fun and kept my attention non stop, which few books can do."
I can't say enough good things about this book. I tore through it on my plane ride to Europe. My only disappointment was finding out the next book in the series isn't out yet!
"Gideon the Ninth blends fantasy, sci-fi, horror, locked-room-mystery, and more into an amazingly entertaining ride following snarky, sarcastic, irreverent swordswoman Gideon and her necromancer, queen of her adoptive House, and sorta-kinda horrific younger sister Harrowhark.  Mayhem ensues.  Adventures are had.  Tragedies occur.  Looking forward to the next book in this series!"
"So far great book, bought with two other items and wasn’t exactly thrilled to find the packaging was excessive in size and had nothing to protect the items from bouncing around on each other."
"This is possibly the funniest fantasy book I’ve ever read. The story and characters were fantastic as well. My only complaint is the cast was fairly large and it was hard to keep them all straight, but overall I loved this book."
"Gideon The Ninth becomes the Cavalier of Harrow and enters a world of deceit, death, and dark romance."
"I savored this obsessively for two months, not letting myself read too much of it. Now that I’m done with it, I can’t stop myself from reading it again. I await a sequel like a rabid animal waiting for the chance to inflict senseless violence. my friends have no idea what i’m talking about anymore. All my thoughts and dreams are bones now. It’s perfect."
"As it turns out, I like a protagonist who is more than a bit of a smart ass, and I adored the voice of Gideon. Also, the aghast mewling of the teens made me laugh. This is a heck of a story, and so good."
"Concept is interesting,  writing is somewhat long winded and arduous.  A plethora of characters are foisted onto you with no character building or windup.  Therefore, you are forced to jugle all these random names in you head with the convoluted story in mind.  It was a bit of a drag to read as well."
This book was such a great read. I had never read this author’s books. I can’t wait to read the next book!
"The most enjoyable and ultimately compelling book I’ve read in the last few years. It’s generally paced well, and the character interactions are a delight.Risks: there are a lot of names. It was not frequently unclear, but there were a few places where I lost track. The style is specific. I loved it, but you’ll probably know within the first chapter if it isn’t for you."
"Just a fantastic story with great setting, charters and plot and even it it had none of that the author's writing alone makes it a fun read."
Really enjoyed this book. Cool setting and atmosphere for a sci-fi/fantasy-esque who done it.
Great imagination and cool story. At first all the characters were confusing but when I had them sorted out the story was awesome
"This was straight up awesome, so glad I tripped over an (appropriately glowing) review for this. Adventurous gore, well-developed characters, a badass world, humor and feels, what more can you ask for? I freaking adore Gideon's brand of endearing snark, and Hark grew on me too. A+++ would wince/laugh/snort at again. Heading to the sequel!"
"I enjoyed the book, however, I found it difficult to keep the other Houses and their Necro/cavalier combos straight. I liked the idea of the book, just not its execution."
"4.5 The story is a little messy sometimes and hard to follow but really who cares? It’s really interesting and I wanted to know more about the world and characters and since I came for the lesbians with swords and it really did not disappoint! It is very gay, very soft and funny. Lots of meme references which I loved."
"Fantastic read. Very funny, like snort in public while everyone states kinda thing. The entire story pulled me in and kept me rapt till the end. Very much looking forward to the next book."
"If that interests you just buy this already. If not, it's still some excellent haunted house fiction."
"This is the sci-fi of the future. The writing is fresh and hilarious, the characters are incredibly drawn, and the worldbuilding is unique and substantial. Immediately hit my top-five books of the year, probably will remain in my top-five books of all time. Can't wait for the sequel."
"This story is amazing. Gorgeously-crafted, amazing world, and just the right mix of gallows humor. One of the best books I've read this year. Great for fans of dark and/or sarcastic scifi/fantasy like Nevernight and The Library at Mount Char."
Someone turn this series into an Anime PLEASE! I couldn't put it down and can't wait for the next book to come out.
"Too many irrelevant characters in the beggining just piled on to each other. Story if you had the patience to keep going then became very interesting  but no real emotional connection to most of the characters from the other others. Finally as Gideon had been revealed to be a "" special child"" among the other children in the ninth order was disappointed in the ending."
"This book is amazing! It's tropey, hilarious, and like nothing I've ever read before."
"A thrill of a ride, easy to lose yourself in the world building and with the characters, the author truly makes you care about what happens and the twists and turns are a lot of fun."
"Books great so far! Super excited for the second installment of this series to come out. However, the physical book itself came in messed up. The cover wrapping was bent in all kinds of places, and has a... weird slimy fingerprint trail on it.. I fixed the cover wrapping to the best of my ability but the odd slime spot won’t come off T_T why amazon"
cuz theres bones my guy.  a whole soup pot of em.  bones all over the place like a sweepstakes jackpot in dog heaven.  i am shaking metacarpals out of my underpants and theres a tarsal in stuck in my ear.also all the skeletons are gay.  they're making out whenever they're not in scene.  the clacking sound is atrocious.
"Inventive beyond belief, internally consistent, well-written, likeable, frightening, funny, doesn't condescend and assume the reader is a near-illiterate or stupid"
"I don’t know how to describe this book, it’s like nothing I’ve read before. Sci-fi, horror, hilarious banter, a mystery, I loved all of it."
"1) this book is hilarious2)the plot is incredible, subtle, complex and so mysterious!3) space-faring sword fighting lesbian necromancers4) DID I MENTION THE SPACE-FARING SWORD FIGHTING LESBIAN NECROMANCERS?That is all.Just incredible."
"Very intriguing opening sequence, and Gideon Nav is a very enjoyable narrator to read with her irreverent take on situations."
"Beautifully crafted spec fic mystery in a world totally unlike what we're used to. Get ready for a roller coaster, 'cause this one is clanking up that first hill..."
"LOVED this book, love the hardcover art. Perfect"
"Highly recommended if you think you’d be into a big weird fantasy sci-fi locked room mystery sort of thing with a lot of necromancy and lesbian yearning. It reminded me a bit of Zelazny in its pacing, tone, and scope and Gideon herself reminded me a bit of Corwin - and of Wells’ Murderbot. At least, I think they’d have fun together."
"The character development and story line were superb. I loved the protagonist and there were plenty of laugh out loud moments. Hands down, one of my best reads of '20."
"Not only is this the best book I've read this year, but may be my new favorite of all time. A perfect Science Fantasy full of humor, mystery, heartbreak, and BONES. So many bones. I can't wait for the next one."
"A stunning novel, with more twists and turns than I expected, even knowing it would have them. I can't wait to read it again, which is my highest recommendation."
"Lively characters, good dialogue, and great world building, what more could I want!  Enjoyed the book from beginning to end."
I loved this book! Well written and the storyline is great! Highly recommend this book! Looking forward to reading the next two!!
"Totally different, irreverent, funny, unique, inventive, extraordinary!  You will be taken in with the first page and won't want to put the book down."
"This book owns so hard, I may never recover. Funny, thrilling, mysterious, full of puns and dirty jokes. I loved it."
It’s not to my liking. I’m not sure why all the great reviews. I’m a couple chapters in and am considering returning it.
"The plot is great, reminds me of Murder on the Orient Express and Ten Little Indians. I would have kept reading just to find out whodunit. But what I love most is the author's deft, literary, intelligent, poetic use of language. So many gorgeous phrases!"
"The writing is rich and descriptive, the dialogue is sharp and hilarious, and all the characters are precious and very human.  Also, there's skeletons, swords, lesbians, skeletons, conspiracies, spaceships, sick fights, skeletons, bones, and skeletons!"
"Found the second book being ""advertised"" on imgur and thought it sounded interesting. This story is wonderfully told and, at points, I didn't want to put the book down so I could keep trying to figure it all out. The characters are beautifully written and I will love Gideon Nav's personality until I die."
"I've enjoyed this new book so far, can't wait for the rest to come out.  New and promising author for me!"
"The world that is built is refreshing and keeps you wanting to learn more and more about these space necromancers. The writing is has moments that pull me out of the narrative to wonder why someone would throw in random curse words or odd fitting slang. Overall would recommend, great read. Slow start though."
"What an awesome story. It kept me up reading because I could not put it down until I finished. I can't possibly explain all what happens, but trust me, READ THIS BOOK."
"Honestly,  the most fun read of the year. A perfect blend of snarky humor, rebellion, action and interesting characters."
"I loved the book, but I can see how it can be hit or miss with the prose and voice. I found the book hilarious and the magic system fantastic. Overall very like able characters. Can't wait to see more"
Great read. Hard to put down. Magic and mystery and tunnels and action. An easy 5 star fantasy. Do not hesitate to dive in.
"This book is funny on a scale and level that was not expected, but done so well that even the serious parts make you laugh. Super proud that the author is a kiwi and that both characters have kiwi-ism's that shine through all that bone. Cannot wait for book 2 or anything else from her."
Who knew I needed a book about necromancers in space? This was amazing from beginning to end and the next one can't come soon enough!
This book was a lot of fun. I enjoyed the characters and the situations. I look forward to the next book in the series.
"Wayyy different, weird, dark, funny, a book you cant put down. It is also mind expanding as it is so different than anything you've ever read."
"My friend forced me to read Gideon, and glad he did.  While I agree with other reviews that the names are confusing, at least the last names are linked to their house number so that helped.  I loved everything about this book and can't wait for the second one."
Do not read if you are pretentious and/or allergic to a good time.  It’s very weird which you will enjoy.
Did not want to put it down which is my ultimate criteria.
"The decrepit world of death and decay presented here is wonderfully contrasting of the vitality of the main character. Original, gripping, and always visceral."
I don't know what to think about the ending still. I do know I wish the next book was out now.
"It’s a fantasy set in the future in space, with a snarky main character and a plot out of Agatha Christie. What more could you want?"
Staggeringly original story and gorgeous prose combine and I was unable to put this book down.  Be sure to have a lot of free time so you can read this cover to cover in one sitting.
nice
The plot and setting is fantasy meets sci fi. But the language and tone is like a Tarantino movie. Great stuff.
"Was worried it's gonna be yet another teen movie. But it was so much more than that. Gritty, sensitive, badass, inteligent, full of secrets and innuendo. Loved it. Thank you Tamsin Muir."
"Weird premise aside, this book has great characterization and it got me to care about its characters. I finished this book in one night because of the fast-paced action and suspense. Can't say I was looking for a book exactly like this, but I enjoyed it nonetheless."
"Very fun story. Mystery, adventure, mixed with sci-fi, fantasy, and magic. Good bit of humor and interesting characters. Though written a couple years ago, perfect book to help you forget how terrible 2020 is for a bit."
I've seen this book in different stores and was really liked the summary for it as well as the book design with the black pages and was kinda disappointed when this arrived in the mail and the pages weren't black like I had seen. Other than that can't wait to read.
"At times frantic, anxiety-inducing, badass, and emotional, this book is a masterclass in world-building. Highly recommend to anyone, whether you're a genre reader or not."
One of the best books I’ve read in a long time!
"Just frikking amazing. Every word, every person, every scene. I loved it from start to finish. (I usually hate horror)"
"Witty, entertaining, great characters! It is a mystery that had me reading until 4 in the morning. Highly recommended!"
One of the strangest things ive read.
"If your looking for a fantasy book about lesbians, necromancy and space. Then this is the book.Also, the book has no sign of damage which is something I’m thankful.I highly recommend this book to everyone!"
"Reread both novels. Really a new perspective of the making of gods. Will be interested to read book three., soon"
"A very interesting ""mystery"" sort of novel.  It plays around with some classic fantasy and magic tropes while also inserting a lot of modern tones.  There's a lot of little easter eggs in the writing.  Definitely worth the read"
"Gideon the Ninth is blessed with a highly original setting and protagonists voice. It is gripping, fast-paced and extremely funny."
"Hilarious, irreverent, rich in world building, and absolutely emotionally enthralling. I laughed, I cried, I bought the next book immediately."
"Great book. I'd give it a 4 of 5, but this review is about the physical product not the content within. I ordered it new, but there is some unidentified substance on the spine and staining some of the pages within."
"The world of the Locked Tomb is wonderfully built.  The characters are fun to read, and there is a real sense of history and past throughout.  I'm very much looking forwards to the next installment, to see what happens to our heroine."
Loved the story!
I've bought this book 4 times so far b/c I keep sending it to people. Worth it.
I immensely enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes high fantasy stories. I just finished it and am there for still processing it but I already want to re-read and can not wait for the sequel in June 2020.
LOVED THE BOOK. It was so great! Definitely recommend. It is full of witty things that make no sense at all but at the same time make so much sense. Wonderful characters!
I bought this book the day it came out after waiting for months and then read it in one go. Excellent excellent excellent but left me anxious...for the sequel!
Book is in new condition. Received in 2 days.
Fantastically written. Gideon is easily one of my most favorite characters to come along in quite some time. Such an interesting concept how the different worlds work. Kept me reading non stop.
"I literally could not put this down - chewed through the whole book in less than a day and am getting ready to start the sequel. I cannot recommend this book enough, and I eagerly await the third installment of the trilogy!"
"I’m obsessed with this book. I’m always looking for sapphic scifi/fantasy and this is one of my favorites EVER. If you’re at all interested by the concept, buy it. You won’t be disappointed."
"Loved this book more than anything I've read. Wonderful writing style, and the jokes are had me laughing. The story left me thinking about it long after I finished the book"
Daughter loves this collection
"I now wish I could go back and retroactively change all my 5 star reviews to four stars, or that I could somehow give it six. It's a good book."
"I normally read light books. Ones you skim. This one was heavy, weighty and well worth the slog.  It will be hard to find its peer."
"Happy it arrived so soon but a bit disappointed when the book arrived damaged. It isn't a terrible amount of damage, but it was noticeable enough to warrant 3 stars."
"Gideon the Ninth was a delightful and truly unique read.  I'm excited to read more about the world, and looking forward to the next book!"
"“She lifted Harrow’s arm with the hilt clutched in it. Her fingers, rough and strong and sure, moved Harrow’s other hand into place above the pommel.”"
Remarkable book - you should read it now.
"I had fun reading this one.  Good detail, great action, interesting storyline and world building."
"So I told my wife ""there is a book about necromancer. It's sci-fi. There are so many skulls and lesbians."" ""Oh my,"" said my wife. ""Can I read it as well?"" I said, ""God you better, or else."""
Slow. Beautiful imagery and concepts.
Very fun unique read! I loved the magic and the mystery. Overall I really enjoyed it and look forward to the next one.
Believe the hype. Excellent start to what is sure to be a great trilogy. A great ride with wonderful characters and an intriguing setting.
A bit of a murder mystery in a very different setting with sci-fi necromancers in space.  An unusual but enjoyable story.
YES YES YES! SOMETHING NEW AND EXCITING! I HAD TO KEEP READING AND IM BUYING THE NEXT BOOK ASAP!
Well written and enjoyable!!
Do not read unless you like tragedies. You have been warned.
Loved this book so much. It commits to the almost cheesy Warhammer 40k aesthetic in all the best ways and the characters and story are fun and engaging. Probably my favourite book this year.
"The only book I haven't been able to put down in a LONG time. Funny, clever, and dark, this is a nearly the perfect debut novel."
It was a bit all over the place and seemed to set up a bunch of one liners. The one liners were fun though. The relationship did not seem super fleshed out. Action was hard to follow
From start to finish very entertaining.  Can't wait for the 3rd and final installment
Surprising given the story - incredibly funny.Couldn't put it down
Absolutely entertaining story. Definitely recommend it for the  wonderful snark and the wonderful character that is Gideon. Worth a look for anyone.
"Gideon is an action/adventure heroine rudely dropped into a inescapable horror retelling of ""And Then There Were None"" but with necromancy and blood everywhere."
This book is entertaining and wonderful. It keeps it's secrets until the last moments. Excellent read.
Best book Best Book - This is my second read thru and I will never get over how much I love this book!
This was easily the best book I have read in quite a while. It demanded to be read. I am really looking forward to the next one.
That’s how a friend got be hooked into reading this book and I was not disappointed. It’s an amazing Sci fi/fantasy/horror and I cannot wait for the next one.
I loved this book. The atmosphere and setting was beautifully horrifying. The characters were memorable and the dialog was cunning and sharp. I just wish it was longer.
A damn good read.
A gripping and dramatic story with slashes of Ninth humor. Muir’s dark and detailed world entraps you until the last page.
Absolutely amazing book with a gut-wrenching ending. It ripped my heart out and stopped on it. 10/10 would recommend.
"Screaming at what a ride this whole adventure is. It's gothic, it's mysterious. It has lots of swordplay. I enjoyed reading this."
Wow! Lesbians. Very good very enjoyable liked it a lot. Loved the worldbuilding and I loved the characters. Loved the mystery Clue house vibe.
"So I wrote something, but it requires 16 more words. Now ten more words just to rate this here book."
"It was interesting haunted mansion. And I definitely did not guess the ending, which is always nice."
Lesbian necromancers in space with ample swordfighting and puns. If you don’t want that I can’t possibly imagine what you want
Excellent  rip-roaring adventure! Engaging and intelligent writing. Total page turner. “Gideon the Ninth” hits on all science fiction/fantasy cylinders.
"A wrything horror of anger, love,  and death.  Perfect new world of darkness and decay with a fierce heroine to match."
An honest to goodness page Turner.  The twists were very well written and executed.  Cant wait for the next one.
I stayed up well past my bedtime to finish it because I had to know what happened.
"The characters and writing are very good, and the audiobook reader makes it even better!  Looking forward to the rest of the series."
Love yourself and trust me. Buy this. Read it. Read it again.
"necromancers, skeletons, and bad attitudes in space. need I say more?"
Makes you care for the weird characters. I like Gideon and Harrow and their world is interesting and horrible.
I should have figured that out from the burb. Too much gleeful depravity for me.
"Great read and an amazing story, can’t wait for book 2! Defiantly a page turner, and love the plot too!"
"I absolutely loved this book. If you like Sci-Fi, Fantasy or Necromancers, this is the book for you."
Quite possibly the best book I have read this year!! I even loved it enough to write a review.
Plenty of the fantastic and a great story with twists and turns.  I am glad I gave it a chance.
Bought it on a recommendation from a friend. Weak story not for me
"i don't usually write reviews, but this is just... superb."
Amazing book! Really interesting and worth the read.
"Shipped quickly- this book is amazing, I highly recommend it"
"Loved the internal dialogue of Gideon, she's a real bad ass!!!"
"Loved the characters, especially their ‘voice’!"
"You had me at ""lesbian necromancers in space"""
One of my favorite books!
Cant wait for alecto
A must read
"Great characters, witty laugh-out-loud dialogue, lots of twists (it's a mystery thriller at its core). Highly recommended."
"I am going to preface this by saying that I actually went to wikipedia to look up the author as I thought she might be a special person but she is not... so how is this 5 stars and a best seller? i don't know.so i could not really get thru the horrendous writing in the first few pages, and I have a few pretty random examples of what i mean.""... and checked them too, blinded by the glare, feeling blindly behind the metal housing, ..."" - i am blinded by the blinding incompetence.""she parked herself on one of the destroyed humps of rubble..."" - what is a destroyed hump of rubble? also and this is a real nitpick but i don't think parked is the right word here""Crux spat on her. That was disgusting, but whatever."" - i mean if it is whatever don't mention it? i think everyone is aware that being spat on is disgusting.""Gideon rewarded herself with a small bag of porridge. It tasted gorgeously grey and horrible."" - i mean i can get grey taste but gorgeously gray, just no, it is so stupid."
"So, I'm really torn on this book. I loved it until the end, but it was hard for me to get into at first. For some reason I thought this was going to be a book about an adult taking a job... It's about teenagers. One who's a slave, and the other the spoiled heir. There's a couple adults in here, but yeah, 80% of the characters are under the age of 20, or most of them act that way, if they're older it doesn't show (except Fifth House, who celebrate their 11th anniversary together in the story. And I think one of the creeps from Eighth is older). But it's actually a bully trapping the mc into going with her to do a quest, with the promise of her freedom at the end. And lesbian necromancers... well, no. Gideon lusts after every attractive female in the story, but she isn't the necromancer. Harrow is, and as far as I can tell she has no interest in anything but her work/house. (And I never warmed to Harrow, even at the end.) But that's pretty much all of it, there's no romance or anything, and they are not in space. There's a brief ride in a space ship, and a weird juxtaposition of technology, magic, and post apocalyptic setting. Which leads me to the biggest disappointment of the whole book. The tragic ending. Yep, tragic orphaned lesbian sacrifices herself tragically for her... well, they're not friends. Not lovers (not even close). More like Stockholm syndrome with a good heaping of relying on what you've known your whole life. Even if she forgives Harrow at the end, I never did. And the next book will be about Harrow. I'll read it, because I'm invested now (I preordered the Subterranean Press edition before this was even released), but the high hopes I had for this have been crushed upon the rocks of predictability. (I could have thrown the book at the end, but it's a library copy. )I did like the world building, and I love Gideon (that cover is so kicka$$). I loved her snark, her stubbornness, and even her crudeness. She is what kept me reading. Without that, I doubt I'll enjoy the next book at all. There are a lot of loose ends about Gideon's parentage and such, and I don't know if they'll get answered. Or if I'm going to care without Gideon around."
"This book is absolutely unlike anything I've read before.  Even the writing itself is unpredictable and this author has such a unique voice which really made this book even more fantastic. The plot is so complex and mysterious. It was filled with action, grit, and a world of necromancers that I was completely in awe of.This book started out a little slow and the writing style takes a bit to get used to, but if you stick with it, you can be easily swept up in the story. You have to pay attention to every word because nothing is over explained and the readers are intentionally kept in the dark most of the time, so you better be paying attention, which I love.  It is hard to write a review without giving anything away, because this book was the least predictable and most full of secrets I've read in a while.This magic world was ingenious and confusing and I NEED MORE OF IT.  I loved all the bone and necromancer science. I love how it was picked apart in different ways, how the different necromancers specialized in different things, and how things could be interpreted and put back together in insane ways.Gideon! Gideon is amazing.  She is sassy, but isn't a one dimensional snark machine with a sword. She has real emotions, she wants to have a meaningful life and make friends. She wants 8 hours of sleep and dessert. She is a dangerous swordswoman but is kind to strangers. I want to be her friend instantly.  She and Harrowhark together are an amazing pair and their interactions and development were some of my favorite aspects of this story.The characters were wild and interesting and I loved how individual they were.  At first so many will be throw at your at once and it's a bit overwhelming to remember who everyone in (and I used the character list in the front as a life saver).  But as the story progressed, each character came into their own and shone as a part of this mismatched group.  They had amazing and ingenious character names - I found myself frequently saying them out loud just to hear how wonderful they sounded.The ending killed me and I don't know how I will move on.Whenever I wasn’t reading this book I was still thinking about it.  Finishing this book hurt because I didn't want to close the book and I already can't wait to re-read it.  This book will stay with me for a long time.Thank you to the publisher for a free copy of this book. I was happy to give my honest thoughts."
"More like 2.5 starsGideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir is the first in The Locked Tomb trilogy. Having been a fan of necromancers in video games and stories ever since I could remember, it’s nice to see a series with characters solely featured and revolving around them. Who doesn’t like the prospect of exploring death, reanimation, soul siphoning and building a skeleton army to do your bidding?! I hardly knew anything about Gideon the Ninth prior other than that it was on many reading recommendation lists. What I got in the end was a pretty big disappointment. As usual, I feel like I’m in the minority here but having read other reviews, I can’t shake the feeling that a lot readers nowadays are confusing popularity, hype and using whatever is trendy on social media with actual quality.To start off, I have no problems with the author jumping on the current LGBT trend. I could tell though that she was however treading very lightly as if testing the waters first with her audience to see how well received it would be. For the curious, no, there are no hardcore sexual scenes of any kind. In fact, there is hardly any romance at all, which keeps in touch with the darker setting of the book. Basically, Gideon just seems to prefer women and calls them ‘hot’. That’s about as LGBT as it got as far as I’m concerned.Gideon is a very snarky character due to her predicaments in being stuck on a planet and place that she has no love for. Combine this with being forced to team up with her necromancer partner, Harrowhark, whom she absolutely despises of and vice-versa, allows for some pretty hilarious moments and dialogue. Be warned that Gideon has a pretty foul mouth so if language is of your concerns, you’ve been warned. The one big issue I saw immediately is the author giving really horrible names to the large cast of characters. There are multiple houses with 2-3 characters from each. Sometimes the characters are referenced by their house number, first name, nick name and/or roles. Add to this how the majority of the characters are forgettable and you can see where this is going. My trick is to subconsciously replace multiple names for one character with just one. For example, every time I see Harrowhark being addressed as ‘Nonagesimus’ in a conversation, I just supplant that with “Harrow” in my mind and be done with it.To be honest, I was very close to having call it quits on this book. The beginning is very slow and it takes a while to get used to the writing style. I stuck with it only due to my love for necromancers in stories. The story doesn’t really begin until around the 35%-40% mark. Prior to this, you’ll probably get extremely bored. The author also in my opinion does a bad job of describing and painting certain sceneries. It seems like she wants to give the readers a vivid picture of certain surroundings but does it in a way that is very bland. Experienced authors can get away with this but here you can tell the author has a long way to go. Part of the problem I believe is that there just isn’t that much fascinating things to describe in a huge mansion that is sparsely populated. She obviously tries but it can be tiresome to read and is what drove me to wanting to quit in the beginning.The author also doesn’t seem to know what this story wants to be. Calling this a space travel/opera is incorrect as there is very minimal of that being done here. Maybe the second book will have more of this otherwise it would have been a missed opportunity. Is it a story that revolves around necromancy itself? There are some highlights here and there to support this. What about action wise? The story is very slow paced throughout and it felt like the author suddenly realized this towards the end and you could already guess what she did to ‘remedy’ this. What about focusing on world building and history? Well, there’s definitely many questions left unanswered about this universe, especially surrounding the houses themselves as well as the Emperor Lord and of past events. Is it a classic who done it mystery with some dark necromancy voodoo sprinkled in? I would say that this would be the most accurate description and something I honestly least expected.  You’d most likely have already guessed and narrowed one or two characters prior to the ‘reveal’ but just not the reason. I initially envisioned the story to revolve around powerful necromancers and sorcerers dueling it out in different universes and planes of existence with treacherous characters backstabbing one another to unlock the darkest and most powerful spells. Yes, I stereotype.At the moment, I am about 25% in favor of reading the next book. My review is mainly negative but some part of me do want to see how well the author will improve. I honestly think that if the majority of the story was not solely focused and revolving within one giant mansion that the story could have been better. All that explanation and description of ‘twisting hallways and locked doors’ can get tiring after a while. Also, if so many characters are involved, even if briefly, they should be at least semi-interesting and not just seem like cannon fodder. I would have been happy if the author spent a little more time on building up her characters than on other things that seemed pretty meaningless. I did get a kick out of some pretty funny moments from Gideon but that was about it."
"Rating: ★★★☆☆+Thanks to the publisher and author for an advance reading copy of Gideon the Ninth (The Ninth House #1) in exchange for an honest review. Receiving this ARC did not influence my thoughts or opinions on the novel.First off, I decided to hold a buddy read for this one in anticipation of its release, deciding to start mid-August and end September 4th. Gideon was one of the most anticipated and hyped books coming into September, let alone 2019 as a whole, and having some blogger friends join me sounded like a fantastic idea. While it was an absolute blast as these are some of my favorite people in the book community, it ended up being quite a different experience than I anticipated. Some highs, more lows, and tons of confused middle ground led to the hype train finding some broken pieces of track along the way. You can check out their reviews at your leisure:Caitlin @ Realms of My MindHolly @ The GrimdragonMogsy @The BibliosanctumTammy @ Books, Bones & BuffyWith gorgeous cover art by Tommy Arnold, blurbs by some of the biggest names in publishing like V.E. Schwab, and a synopsis that would make any fantasy lover drool, Gideon the Ninth (The Ninth House #1) had all the pre-requisites of a match made in heaven. Unfortunately, a clunky beginning filled with a tough-pill-to-swallow writing style mixed with a protagonist who was, for the most part, insanely difficult to get along with, almost pushed me to set this one aside and move on to other things. Lucky for me, I had other bloggers lifting me up out of the muck and assuring me that there was a significant experience change halfway through.It almost feels like this book was written at two (2) different times. A first-half that I slogged through was worth the wait for a second-half that I thoroughly enjoyed. I don’t want to say Muir couldn’t decide how she wanted this journey to start off because I am positive it is what she envisioned, but it is like she finally got her bearings around the 40% mark and the book absolutely took off. A protagonist in Gideon that I could not STAND became bearable and enjoyable to watch, though I have to say the focus of my attention was on Harrow for pretty much the entirety of the novel. The swordplay is enamoring, the never-ending hallways, thruways, and corridors of the First House led to constant intrigue, and the fact that this book is chok-full of necromancers had me wanting to love this book all the way through. (Note: if you cannot tell, necromancers are my jam. Just ask Michael R. Fletcher).The most difficult part, aside from the writing style, was the amount of names you are given very early on. First off, there are nine (9) houses. Each house sends representatives to the First for the competition, and each plays an important role in the story so you are slightly required to know who is who. Lucky for you, there is a list at the beginning of the book but will lead to a bit of frustration if you are reading via ebook. Names aren’t always an issue, but when each one is a mouthful, and then there are secondary names or nicknames associated to them as well, it can become chaos. It is nice when a few are killed off and the list begins to shrink, letting your head settle a bit.Gideon is sort of an odd book to sum up. While there were a few issues that laid heavy on my heart throughout, there was this consistent feeling that there is so much more to come. It is a book has so much going for it if you can just get past some of the intricacies of the prose and can handle the snarkiness of the protagonist. Muir has written a very interesting story that is highly original and just begs for a Kindle Worlds treatment. I could see a group of eight (8) authors writing stories about the other houses, maybe as prequels, and culminating to become this trilogy."
"The only thing good about this thing is Gideon the main character. The world around is full of disjointed information with that  makes following what is going on very difficulty. Most characters are forgetable due to little time introducing them and distinguishing them from one another. The book has a lot of moraly wrong behaviours that are somehow being justified. *major spoiler warning from here* Firstly main character is a de facto slave to a sadistic psychopath but somehow they fall in love over the  course of several days? Please that is pushing suspension of disbelief too much. 2 of the side characters are raised to be child soldiers and surprise, surprise they get kiled of in most gruesome of ways. Then there is the issue of  using your cavaliers (bodyguards) like they are a some sort of tools that their necromancers can do what they like with. But the most irksome thing is that the book ends with only the sadist Harrow making out alive while Gideon one of the few not shitty characters in this book being subjecte to the infamous ""Bury your gays trope""."
"If that’s not enough to hook you, I don’t know what is.Gideon the Ninth was one of the most unique, fun, and imaginative tales I’ve read in a long time. I started with the ebook, proceeded to become engrossed to the point I could accomplish absolutely nothing besides reading it, then decided to spend an Audible credit on the audiobook so that I didn’t completely wreck my GPA and could instead listen to the novel while working on graphic design homework. Then, as soon as I'd finished listening, I immediately ordered the hardback, because this is definitely a book I'll want to reread again and again!I don’t buy many audiobooks, but Gideon the Ninth, narrated by Moira Quirk, was hands down the best one I’ve ever listened to! Quirk gives an amazing performance and really makes Muir’s words come to life. I’ve seen other reviewers say that they found Gideon to be dense and confusing for the first bit, but I honestly feel like listening to the book instead of reading it outright helped me circumvent that issue. It’s a lot easier to avoid getting bogged down by the spelling and pronunciations of complicated, fantastical names when someone else pronounces them for you.That aside, I loved Gideon the Ninth to absolute (bone fragment) pieces. This imaginative tale fused two of my favorite genres (fantasy & sci-fi, aka “science fantasy”), and checked all of my boxes – lesbians, necromancy, political intrigue, witty repartee, enemies to lovers subtext, and sword play! There wasn’t a single thing about this novel that I didn’t like.In closing: GO READ GIDEON THE NINTH!!! I don’t care who you are, or what sort of books you usually read – this is not one you want to miss. Though Gideon does include horror aspects, it isn’t particularly scary. Definitely creepy, but more fun than terrifying. This is important for me, as I’m generally not a fan of ‘scary’ books, because I’m kind of a giant weenie. So I would encourage my fellow weenies to give Gideon the Ninth a shot, because it’s seriously worth it.Note: if you’ve already read Gideon the Ninth and, like me, are chomping at the bit for Harrow the Ninth (The Locked Tomb #2) to come out later this year, Tor has your back! You can download the entire first act of Harrow the Ninth from their website!"
"The characters are too talky and quite frankly dumb, especially Gideon who spends the first 60 pages in the book trying to get away, but not really. This has too many angsty characters who talk too much with little action and don't seem to know what they want to do (teenagers!), which led me to wonder why I am reading this junvenile, going nowhere book. Ah, it had good reviews. So I went back to Amazon to find out why. Some people love it. Some people hate it. Some people stopped after reading much more than 60 pages. I quit while I'm ahead at 60."
"Confession.  I don’t really read adult fantasy.  I don’t know why.  I have some on my TBR, but when I pick up an adult book, it tends to be a mystery/thriller.  This is a hard book for me to review because I liked it a lot, but it took me forever to read.  I felt like a failure at times.  I’m 41.  Why was I struggling with an adult book when I’ve been reading adult books since I was 11?  I really think it’s the genre.  It can take me awhile with YA fantasy and sci fi at times, too.I struggled early on to really understand what was going on and who everyone was.  I’m sure this would be easier with the physical book because I can flip back and forth to the character guide.  I was afraid I was doing to dnf.  The first half of the book was a 3 star book for me, but the last 30% or so was closer to 5 stars.  So I’m glad I stuck with it.One of the things I loved was Gideon.  She has a sarcastic potty mouth, which is my kind of person.  She made me laugh.  Her relationship with Harrowhark was odd for me.  I know I should have hated Harrow for the way she treated Gideon growing up.  But I loved their banter and was hoping for a hate to love romance.  That probably wasn’t what I should have wished for considering their beginning, but I couldn’t help it.I also loved the mystery in this.  That “who done it” type of story.  I  never knew who was going to die (there was a lot) and struggled to figure out who did it.  I had my thoughts which were sort of right, but I didn’t quite expect the twist.  The magic was pretty incredible.  I loved the world that Tamsyn created with the necromancers, magic, and the fighting.  It was dark and gory.  That’s everything I like in a book.  Plus the lgbtqiap+ rep was good even though romance was in the background of the book.As I mentioned above, where I struggled was trying to keep all the characters straight.  I found myself having the issue throughout the book.  The stand out characters were easy, but it was all the others.  Each house had multiple people and I confused them at times.  I also felt that the story was a bit slow at times, while fast paced at other times.  People I liked died, which always sucks.  I enjoyed the puzzles/challenges that were found with each key.  The skeletons were pretty hardcore and creepy.I’m hoping that the next book will be a bit easier for me to follow.  The ending of this wasn’t my favorite, but I’m hoping that there will be some surprises in book two.  I really enjoyed the world, even when I struggled with it.My review probably doesn’t give you much about the book, but I didn’t really want to get into the story too much.  There are fights, twists, and backstabbing.  I find it best to go into those things sort of blindly.  If you like dark fantasy with sci fi elements with super flawed characters, this is the book for you.I ended up rating this 4 stars.  Once the pace picked up, I ended up loving it, even with my struggles.  Thank you to the publisher and Edelweiss for my copy for review.  I am looking forward to reading the next book.  I’m also looking forward to my finished copy so I can study the people and the houses a bit more.Warnings:  This is an adult book, not YA.  Some of the characters are teens, but the book is dark with a lot of swearing.  There wasn’t any sex, so you can use your judgement on who can read this.  For me personally, I would have read it in high school easily, but there are other teens that aren’t ready for something this dark.  There was servitude, a lot of deaths and sacrifices, gore, blood magic (cutting), terminal illness, swearing, and some lewd comments.  I’m probably missing some since I didn’t really note them while reading."
"What on earth did others read to give this a good review, because it wasn’t the book I read. Maybe others find crass humor excessively funny when it really isn’t even clever (using “balls” and “@ss” in a descriptive way doesn’t equal hilarity). There’s waaay more to truly clever humor than tossing crude and quite juvenile insults around. I’m puzzled. I’m as much a fan of the “s*cks b@lls” kind of funny as anyone else, but it needs to actually try to be a joke or it’s just there for the shock value for pearl-clutchers and for insta-laughs for people with no grasp of actual humor. Also, there kinda needs to be a point to scenes in a book and not so rambling and uneventful that they do nothing much to advance the plot. I think this was supposed to be edgy and unique but IMO it flopped massively. There was nothing groundbreaking about the writing and while it obviously managed to shock and amuse a whole lot of people who aren’t accustomed to it, it was truly just boring and uninspired."
Read the sample. I'm amazed that this actually has a publishing house and I'm pretty sure the editor never looked at this book because the author tries and fails multiple literary tricks and has very poor word choice. She also uses extremely obscure language which would be forgivable if the context made it easy to get the word across but they it didn't (this is coming from someone who has a sizable vocabulary).On top of that the story is fairly overrated. The characters are excessive and over the top. I realize this is supposed to be a romance book but I would expect at least some effort in making the story compelling or intriguing enough to keep me coming back for the story. The core concept for the book is really good and the subplot for the ninths head family is ripe to make a very interesting story but the main character just makes it not worth it because she's obnoxious and bland.It should be noted also that the Craig alanson books I love are about 5 to 7 bucks compared to 10 to 13 for this.Did I mention this also has a freaking publishing house behind it? Because it does and that publishing house should probably shut down for its own honor because it fails fully and frantically.
"The characters, setting, and prose are all great, lovingly crafted and bursting with vivid imagery and irreverent energy. “Lesbian necromancers in space” sort of gives the wrong idea—it’s a story with many characters, several of whom are apparently women who like other women in that sort of way, but it’s very short on romance and sex and so I don’t really think said characters’ preferences would be tagline-worthy if we, the reading public, hadn’t spent our whole lives being beaten over the head with implicit heteronormativity.That said, it’s an attention-grabbing tagline for sure, and if it gets more people to read this great book then that’s great.I do feel like the plot gets a little convoluted, and at the end we are left with some questions unanswered and others answered in ways that don’t feel very significant. But it kept me turning the pages, and it served as a fine vehicle for developing compelling relationship(s) between the characters and building toward the finale, so I can’t complain too much. I ordered the second book around the halfway mark, and I can’t wait to read it."
"The writing here is top-notch. Its bantering, profane tone, as seen through the eyes of the sharp-tongued protagonist Gideon, may be off-putting for some, but it drew me in and never let me go for a second.I love that although this feels like a fully developed world, there's none of the usual hundreds of pages of ""world-building"" that makes most SF books I read lately such a terrible slog to get through. Don't expect anything that the characters aren't looking at, thinking about, or talking about to ever be revealed. This writing is tightly focused on its main character, and she would roll her eyes and says ""balls!"" to a momentum-killing step back for exposition.The narration by Moira Quirk is absolutely fabulous. The only reader I can think of who's in her class is Kobna Holdbrook-Smith, who reads the Rivers of London series. Quirk is an amazing voice actor just as at home in action, comedy, and pathos, all of which are present in huge amounts here.I can't recommend the audio book strongly enough, and I rrrrrreally hope Moira Quirk will be back for the next book."
"Picked this up due to the buzz about the ""hilarious lesbian necromancer book"" and the kick-ass cover art. Ended it underwhelmed and uninspired to read the next two in the trilogy. To be sure, there's a lot to like about this space fantasy -- but it's incredibly disjointed. The backstory isn't super-clear, but I think the gist of it is that humanity on Earth was destroyed (or nearly destroyed), and some kind of emperor/deity saved humanity (or maybe just resurrected us?), and established an empire based on nine factions of necromantic ""houses"", each with a powerful necromancer at its head, accompanied by a personal bodyguard/duelist called a ""cavalier."" I think each of these houses is based on a separate planet, but that's not entirely clear.In any event, the book opens in the Ninth House, which is the grimmest and darkest of them all. There we meet Gideon, a sassy teenage slave who's training hard to join what sounds like the imperial army and is in the midst of her latest attempt to escape and enlist. The Ninth House is ruled by Harrow, another female teenager, just more acid-tongued and cruel. The two have some kind of complicated backstory, but essentially hate each other, which makes for wacky times when they have to team up and respond to a summons from the emperor for some mysterious conclave of all the houses. Emissaries from all the houses arrive at this weird old castle/facility thing on an island, and then all the transport is dumped in the ocean, trapping them. They are told that there's a mystery to solve and that whomever can solve it will be transformed into an immortal companion of the emperor (yay!). Ergo, the bulk of the book is essentially a locked-house murder mystery of the Agatha Christie variety (think ""Then Little Indians"" aka ""And Then There Were None"") as various people start to get killed. This is not super-successful when there are something like 16 characters, each with a name but also titles, and then in some cases nicknames. There's just not enough time and space to flesh them out, and it's not until deep into the book that some of them start to become familiar. Unfortunately, the pacing isn't great, and there are large swathes that are a slog to get through. The proceedings are somewhat enlivened by the verbal repartee (Gideon's snark dial, in particular, is set to 11), and some excellently-written fight scenes (there's a ton of swordplay -- although why people use swords instead of guns is never explained). But on the whole, the stakes, geography of the place, and character dynamics were just all too unclear for me to find it an enjoyable read.(Oh yeah -- the whole lesbian thing is totally overblown. It's basically just that Gideon is attracted to other women, and casts admiring eyes at their forms. There is a friendship/relationship that develops, but that has more than whiff of Stockholm syndrome about it, so it's likely some readers will find it problematic.)"
"There was a mix of good and bad with this book, so I'll break it down.Neutral (things worth mentioning, but aren't necessarily good or bad):-This story definitely puts the focus on the characters over the world-building/lore, action, or overall story.What I liked:-The overall premise of the story (galaxy-wide space necromancy) was super interesting and has huge potential to be interesting and unique. The galaxy being split into nine different houses, each with a different focus/ability related to necromancy, allows for some variation within the world and magic system. There is a lot of open space (pun heavily intended) to add lore and a really deep level of history to the universe.-The characters (particularly Gideon and Harrow) are well-written, in my opinion, and their character arcs were satisfying and mostly believable.-The combat was satisfyingly detailed and incorporated both the necromancy magic and swordplay very well (with one exception that I'll mention later).-While visible from miles away, both aspects of the ending were satisfying and have me ready for the next book.-The lesbian aspect of the book wasn't the focal point of the book/story. I was afraid that the LGBT aspect would be the focus and the rest of the book would be ignored. Instead, it's never outright stated that the MC(s) are lesbian and is just heavily implied through descriptions of how the characters see other females. By doing this, it successfully had an LGBT element without seeming like it was screaming, ""LOOK, I HAVE A LESBIAN CHARACTER! I'M WOKE TOO! EVERYONE LOOK, A LESBIAN CHARACTER!"" which was nice. To be clear, I have no issues with LGBT characters in books, but outside of romance, it's boring to have sexuality overshadow the story.What I didn't like:-The prose of the book was really weird at times. There were some spots that I'm 90% sure were grammatically incorrect (and these sections weren't dialogue), but I never bothered to check. There were also several other spots where, while grammatically correct, the sentenced seemed to be designed to make it as difficult as possible to read and understand. There were also a lot of parentheses, which I hate in books because it pulls me out of the story.-Parts of the book were really slow and didn't advance the story at all. There was a large chunk of the book where Gideon just aimlessly roamed the halls of the house that everyone was in while Harrow was off doing undescribed investigations. It almost felt as if the author wasn't sure how to start the main part of the story and make the characters discover that the house they were in was basically a giant puzzle. So, instead, we got pages and pages of Gideon doing pushups and roaming the hallways until suddenly Harrow shows up and says ~""I've discovered a puzzle in the house and it requires necromancy to solve.""-The overall world-building was lackluster and didn't really feel like a sci-fi fantasy; it felt almost purely like a fantasy. Outside of the brushed over idea of space and the meagerly mention space-shuttles there were almost not sci-fi elements. I said that he story focused mainly on the characters, so it would be expected that the world might not be as flushed out as a story whose focus was on the that world, but we really needed a lot more. Basically, we are told that the universe almost died (or humanity was almost extinct) and the Undying Emperor saved it and brought everyone back. We are never told what this thing was, but I suspect it'll have a large part in the sequels. The whole Gideon-wandering-halls-while-Harrow-investigates-the-house thing would've been a great opportunity to add to the world-building.-Also, (and this ties in with the world-building problem) the magic was presented poorly. Like I said, the magic was cool and described well, when in action, but it was explained poorly. Basically, we weren't told anything about the magic until that aspect of the magic system became relevant in the book. This created two problems. 1: Every time a new method of necromancy was used (and thus, its existence just now mentioned us) it felt to me more ""plot convenience"" than intricate and complicated magic system. 2: A lot and I mean A LOT of the time a new aspect of the necromancy was introduced to us, it was also at the same time that we were being told that very rule of necromancy isn't actual a rule and can be broken. I never felt any wonder at the magic because I was never told that this is the magic and this is how it works before I was told it actually doesn't work like that. It was more of a ""They did this thing"" and I'd be like ""Yeah, so?"" and then the story would be like ""That's impossible, you shouldn't be able to do that."" See the problem? There was no interest or significance to the fact that a ""rule"" of the necromancy was being broken.-There are a couple of logistical issues in the story that I'm going to mention in this last point.  1-Everyone uses swords. Why? They have space-shuttles, but they use swords? At one point the main character even finds some old guns, so we know they exist, but why don't they use them? I'm all for swords, I love swords, but there needs to be an in-universe explanation for their use when more advanced and more effective weapons exist.  2-Cavaliers (bodyguards for necromancers) traditionally carry rapiers. Since they're guarding necromancers, one would think they might being fighting other necromancers and I can't think of any sword worse for fighting reanimated skeletons that can only be killed by smashing them more than a rapier. The book even addresses the fact that a longsword (and in another case, duel broader-bladed, curved swords) are better for killing them, but it never states why they still choose the rapier over weapons that are obviously far more effective.TL;DRGideon The Ninth had some issues, but nothing so bad that I couldn't read it or enjoy it. If you can turn your brain off to some of the logistical issues, then I'd by all means recommend it. It's certainly an enjoyable read. Hopefully, some of the logistical concerns will be addressed in the second book since I plan on reading the sequel when it comes out. I'm really excited to see where the story goes in a universe with so much potential."
"4 STARS“One flesh, one end.”Gideon Nav means to get out from under the thumb of the Ninth, and make her own way in the universe. She definitely does not mean to become the cavalier of necromancer Harrowhark Nonagesimus, Reverend Daughter of the Ninth. But, as things tend to go, one thing leads to another, and these two, who despise one another, must work together anyway, or die trying.It’s a dynamic I absolutely love, to tell the truth, and it makes for a story that relies on your connection to the characters to keep your interest. Are Gideon and Harrow necessarily people you’d want to root for? Oh, definitely not. They’re crass and sharp and in it for self-interested reasons. But as characters, they’re outstanding on their own and in a group dynamic, complicating expectations and complicating each other.Plus, they’re such polar opposites that it’s fun to watch them learn to rely on each other. They’re so long-suffering and it’s a delight.Gideon the Ninth is a bit of a genre-blender.In addition to the excellent characterization (it takes some hard work to make me root for people who are arguably complete jerks!), Gideon the Ninth does some ambitious work with genre blending. What initially feels like sci-fi, set in deep space with shuttles between planets and hints of a broader universe, takes on the flavor of fantasy the second Harrow first raises a slew of skeletons from the ground beneath her. Then, just when you’re comfortable with the notion of necromancers in space, the advanced tech is shifted to a different arena, and a mystery slides to the forefront, complete with murder and betrayal. It makes it terribly difficult to slot the novel into just one category, and makes the approach to the plot even more interesting. I am a sucker for mysteries, and blending it with this sci-fi/fantasy approach is a win in my heart.That said, all this genre blending does mean that character takes the forefront, and plot falls to the back seat. That’s not to say there’s a lack of plot, but that it’s on the slow side. In fact, I docked a star in my rating for this, because with all the questions established, so very few felt like they were answered, and the clues piled up faster than answers rolled in.It’s effective in making me want to read the second book in the trilogy, Harrow the Ninth (which, incidentally, is told in second person, one hell of a feat), and it keeps me guessing since I enjoy trying to solve mysteries with whatever limited information the author has given me so far. Nevertheless, the ending and its lack of answers did frustrate me a little bit, and I wish a few more things had been included in the reveals, just to close a few more doors, or open new ones to ponder over.Now, if you’re looking for an f/f romance, this is not the place.Sure, the blurb on the front cover advertises the book as lesbian necromancers in space. It’s not wholly wrong, either. No labels are used in the text, but it’s pretty clear that Gideon has an interest in women. And her relationship with Harrowhark? It’s some of the sharpest enemies to almost lovers I’ve read, full of snark and complicated history.But it’s not a romance. This is not about two ladies falling in love. It’s about solving murders using brute strength and the undead. It’s about reconciling who we thought we’re supposed to be with who we’ve become. And while I have no doubts that Gideon’s relationship with Harrowhark is on the enemies to lovers track (that pool scene alone? raise your hand if you know what I’m talking about, because wow), they don’t kiss, and they don’t say they’re in love.Then again, I think if your characters have to kiss and say “I love you” to prove to the reader they’re in love, they’re probably not in love. At least not on a convincing, satisfying level, which means this? This was outstanding.Truthfully, I’m reminded a little of Catra and Adora from She-Ra and the Princesses of Power. They manage to hate each other and care about each other at the same time, and the tension is unreal. Would direct rep be nice? Sure would, but in this book? It’s an adult novel, and I think its intended audience should be able to connect the dots without spelling everything out in blinking lights.I can’t wait to see the fallout in Harrow the Ninth.Gideon the Ninth is a fantastic example of what you can do with genre blending. Not only that, but it presents wonderfully flawed, complex characters trapped in situations they can’t walk away from. Maybe the plot moves a little slowly, maybe not enough reaches a complete conclusion this time around, but damn if I couldn’t look away all the same.I’ll be waiting eagerly for Harrow the Ninth. With the promise of an entire chunk of the book in second person, the writer in me wants to sink their teeth into the technical elements of the novel. And with the promise of Harrow’s POV working out the events of Gideon the Ninth, the reader in me desperately wants to see how these plot threads move along and resolve.If you can stand a slightly slower plot that boosts its characters up, Gideon the Ninth may be worth a try for you. And if you like exciting fight scenes and necromancy, this may also be a sign you should give it a try. I went in skeptical because of polarized reviews, admittedly. People seem to either love it or hate it.But I’m here until the next book. I’m here to find out exactly how deep into space these necromancers are going to go.And if they have more conversations about their feelings, dammit.CW: violence, gore, suicide, loss of a loved one, child death, child abuse, body horrorI cannot understate the amount of bones, blood, and guts flying around this book. The final fight scene is particularly gory, featuring a good deal of body horror adjacent content. It goes hand in hand with necromancy, but some folks would understandably not want to touch that. Keep that in mind before you read, if gore is a sticking point for you."
"I started out not very into this book, but I got more into it by the end.I was confused about a lot in relation to the world and plot. It could've been just me having trouble focusing and struggling to absorb all the info, but I've seen some other reviewers also say they were confused. It was a world entirely different from ours (perhaps it was somewhere in our galaxy or something, but that's beside the point), with magic and a bunch of different planets out in space, and they did things differently, but it wasn't explained, you just had to figure things out from context throughout the book. It was also hard to keep track of characters because there were so many, many of them had long Ancient Greek/Latin names that were difficult to remember at first, and they were constantly being referred to in different ways (sometimes by first name, sometimes last name, sometimes House number, sometimes position) which meant even more you had to figure out and remember and keep track of. That's especially hard for me to do with audiobooks. There's a sort of index at the front of the book you can use if you have a text copy, at least. I eventually managed to grasp and remember and keep track of most things, I think, but still not all.I got more into the story when they started kind of solving puzzles and mysteries because at that point it became more like a murder mystery competition with The Westing Game vibes (albeit much bloodier and with necromancy), and I had a better handle on things and some plot to grasp onto to. Things got super twisty and mysterious and tense, and it was fun when we did finally get some answers and saw how certain things all added up.I never felt that invested in the main characters, but I will say the author did a good job of taking a large group of characters and making them all unique with their own personalities, strengths, and motivations.Gideon had her humorous moments. She was, in many ways, a simple person. She liked food and fighting and pretty girls and just wanted her freedom. She also showed compassion to some of her fellow contestants and even Harrow.I was most interested in Palamedes though. Ahhhhh, PALAMEDES. I freaking love this man. I think I might be in love with this man? He was quiet and reserved when we met him, but behind that was a well of strength and conviction. He was steadfast in the lines he drew and would absolutely speak up and fight for what he believed in when it was called for. There was so much confidence and absoluteness behind his words and actions. And when he busted out with those angry, impassioned speeches, I swear it was one of the sexiest things I’ve ever read about. He was incredibly smart, incredibly loyal, incredibly passionate about what mattered to him, and incredibly kind toward people who deserved it. The more I learned about him, the more I liked his character and the more I wanted to know about him.There was possibly an enemies-to-lovers romance hinted at, but I'm not 100% sure. At first I thought, ""No way, everything Harrow has done to Gideon is too awful,"" but eh, I was able to change my mind and accept the possibility by the end.I listened to the audiobook for this, and narration by Moira Quirk was great. She was good at doing lots of different voices and accents to differentiate characters, though some did veer into cartoony territory. Voices for male characters were decent enough (maybe didn't exactly sound male, but they weren't bad to listen to either). She had an English accent, and some side characters had other European accents. She brought the book to life in a good way. It takes a talented narrator to handle this many characters so well.There were things about this book I really liked, and others I didn't. It was confusing, but the murder mystery element was fun, and I at least got to enjoy all the twistiness in the end. I wasn't sure if I cared enough to continue, but after seeking out spoilers about something, I decided it was worth continuing onto the next book.*Rating: 3.5 Stars // Read Date: 2020 // Format: Audiobook*Original Review @ Metaphors and Moonlight (link in profile)"
"I don’t know where to begin with this book. I was unprepared in the best way possible. You see all these blurbs and quotes about lesbian necromancers in space and you think “that sounds neat”, and then you meet Gideon Nav of the Ninth House and her necromancer, Harrowhark and see them try to kill each other in like, the first two chapters and then get summoned by the Undying Emperor to earn a place at his side, and Gideon smuggles sunglasses to this undying party, and suddenly, the things I thought I knew going into this story were decimated by Gideon’s glorious biceps. I was utterly blown away by this book, and the incredible writing. Seriously, everything about this novel is goals.I do find it funny that so much is made of the “lesbian necromancers in space” tagline because there is no real romance in this book. It’s no secret that Gideon loves the ladies, but it’s not really a focal point in anyway, it’s just… Gideon, and that’s amazing. The story isn’t about Gideon in that regard, but how much Gideon wants to forge her own path away from The Ninth House and why, and why her and Harrow are such bitter enemies starting well before this particular story begins. And while they do travel through space to get from the Ninth to the First House, this book isn’t about them being in space, either. That’s not to say I was disappointed; I wasn’t in the slightest! But we can put this down as one (two?) of the reasons why I was unprepared going into this book. That being said, this was probably one of the snarkiest, sarcastic, and most fun books I’ve ever read. The way Muir captured Gideon’s voice throughout the novel was simply perfection.I loved Gideon’s humor, how even her hate of the Ninth House and Harrow always felt a bit playful; like Gideon will flip the bird and do a cartwheel as she struts away, kind of a deal. Gideon’s humor and unapologetically ridiculousness was a perfect contrast to Harrow’s somber dedication to her House and her cool anger. Gideon loves the thrill of mayhem, she’s a fighter and revels in it, and will make absolutely no apologies for wanting to be an action-hero-badass, but she’s also a big softie. When she cares, she cares deeply and it’s beautiful. She trusts so easily even with her trauma and it really shows the power and beauty of asking for consent, and the art and meaning of simply ASKING. The way Gideon and Harrow’s relationship evolves was stunning and I absolutely loved it. The way Muir brings the twists and reveals about the girls’ pasts and what they want for their future was so impactful. I could not possibly love Gideon more and would have given her all the dirty magazines in the world just to have Gideon Nav as my cavalier.Of course, as I sit back and think more about the book after the euphoria of the story ebbs, as that glorious gut punch of an ending fades, it becomes easier to see some of the book’s faults. Yes, the book is dense at times and I had to reread a few paragraphs every now and again to make sure I understood everything, or didn’t miss something. Yes, sometimes the other 8 Houses got a bit hard to remember in terms of what their necromancer’s specialties were, or why they needed to do certain things or why certain Houses behaved in a certain way (being vague to avoid those spoilers, as one does). Yes, this book is disturbingly dark sometimes when showing what these necromancers are truly capable of. But the story was such a delight, it was so funny and didn’t take itself seriously even with such a morbid story-line, that I had too much fun while reading. I don’t really get book hangovers necessarily, but Gideon the Ninth has certainly made it difficult for the next book I read to capture the whole of my attention and heart the way this book has. It gets all 5 stars from me, and I am honestly so excited and nervous about the sequel that I’m not sure how long I will be able to resist coming back to this exciting, bone filled world."
"Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir is the first book in The Locked Tomb trilogy, and follows a swordswoman serving a necromancer, vying for eternal life. Ms. Muir is an author from New Zealand, who has been nominated for several awards in the horror / fantasy / science-fiction genres.Gideon, an orphan, was brought up by a bunch of brutal nuns in what we would call a cult. We meet Gideon when she’s planning an escape but is topped by Harrowhark, her childhood bully, who is now ruler of the Ninth House and the best bone witch in the galaxy.As it turned out Harrowhark has been invited by The Emperor to a tournament, the prize is immortality, becoming an all-powerful servant of the Resurrection. Each necromancer must bring their own cavalier to fight with / for them.Gideon is an indentured servant (that’s what she’s called, but she’s actually a slave) to the Ninth house (nine out of nine houses). Being trained as a swordswoman her whole life, Gideon Nav who is forced to team up with her necromancer, Harrowhark Nonagesimus, Reverend Daughter of the Ninth House, that wants to become a god’s bodyguard and also save the Ninth House from extinction.Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir is an insane book, in a good way. This is a Kill Bill in book form, a bunch of cool “scenes” put together through a tight narrative. Funny, with great chorography of sword fighting, cinematic and a tight, wonderful narrative to put it all together.We’re shown Gideon as a character who is thrown into a world she doesn’t understand, growing up in, for all intents and purposes, an abusive death cult. All Gideon knows is a world of pain, and that pain doesn’t end if you die, but you simply resurrected as a servant to continue another lifetime, or many lifetimes, of suffering.Gideon is a snarky, violent, woman, but when she starts interacting with other characters she starts to develop. We also get to know Gideon through how people react to her, not only how she reacts. In the first quarter of the book, both the reader and Gideon have a hard time understanding what’s going on. If it’s on purpose, it’s brilliant, if not it still works but frankly that part of no one knows what’s going on is too long.The one character which is enigmatic is Harrowhark, who is the cult leader of the Ninth. As a leader she does not merit any loyalty and treats her people like garbage. I didn’t understand why Gideon is staying true to her until the ending. Harrowhark is the last member of the royal family, yet she takes Gideon with her with absolutely no clue what to do, how to act as a security chief, or even a bodyguard. Each “house” lives on their own planet, we don’t know which solar system, but I assumed it was our solar system from little clues in the writing (which I could have easily misunderstood).I liked that Gideon is using big swords, they’re cool and effective and make sense for a weapon of swordswoman. Big, long swords are an offensive weapon, I understand that the short, slender swords are easier to wield, but they are mostly for unarmed single combat, at best, or just for show. I’m glad that the author understood that.I loved the names, meaningful and help the reader know who the author is talking about without memorizing a large cast of characters, reminded of several books by Neil Gaiman who uses these types of meaningful names. The author can write women, and a great narrative, but the men in this book are all jerks, asses, and cowards. I understand this is supposed to be a women centric novel, but there is no reason to make the men weak, in order to make the women strong.This book is very unique, I enjoyed the dark humor, even though it took the book a bit to get going the story flowed smoothly. The world the author builds is dense and complex, which means the reader needs a little patience for the world building – but it’s worth the wait."
"Born into servitude in the dreariest, most dismal of the great necromantic houses; raised by a coven of wizened old nuns possessing all the warmth of a frozen grave; surrounded by decrepit, unfeeling retainers; harangued by countless skeletons (Don’t forget the skeletons!); and shunned by just about everyone she knows, Gideon Nav hates her life.The only thing going in her favor is the fact that she’s an accomplished swordswoman. Not that anybody cares. So, she risks everything by launching the latest in a string of daring escape attempts with the aim of running away and joining the military.Of course, things don’t go as planned, and she is foiled at the last second by her greatest rival, Harrowhark Nonagesimus, the Reverend Daughter of the Ninth House, and bone witch extraordinaire, who demands Gideon stay and do the Ninth House one last service – a service that will guarantee Gideon the freedom to pursue her dreams.The catch? (Because you know, there’s just gotta be one)A call has been issued by none other than the Emperor – Necrolord Prime and King of the Nine Renewals – for new postulants willing to submit themselves for the position of Lyctor, (all-powerful immortal servants of the everlasting resurrection), to help him fight against the empire’s greatest foes.Okay . . . but what’s the actual catch?Well, no necromancer can ascend to lyctorhood without their cavalier – a sword-wielding champion – by their side. For the trials require them to act as one, brain and brawn together, to stand a chance of succeeding. And the Ninth’s cavalier is not only unwilling to accept the challenge, he’s next to useless anyway. Thus Harrowhark’s ultimatum. If Gideon is willing to serve as her sword-hand throughout the trials, she’ll be released from servitude forevermore, with full honors.You KNOW there’s still a catch, don’t you?And it’s rather delicious . . . (Don’t worry – NO SPOILERS).Gideon and Harrowhark end up on a decaying world in a mazelike facility run by ancient wardens. Once there, they are required to complete a baffling series of complex, mind-bending, life-threatening tests, while fending off the murderous shenanigans of the representatives of the other houses. As if that wasn’t bad enough, Gideon also has to contend with her hate/hate relationship with Harrowhark, one based on manipulation and betrayal which has come to blows in the past.Oh the joy of skeletons in the closet making things more complicated.And they do – because those skeletons I mentioned are everywhere, and neither woman can hope to survive unless they trust one another enough to cooperate fully.Do they?You’ll find out, it what I can honestly say is one of the most subtly appealing stories I’ve read in a long time. That it’s moody, macabre and gothic goes without saying. You only have to get a look at the cover to receive a hint of what’s coming. But it’s what’s inside those dark uncomfortable pages that will haunt you. For it whispers in your ear, enticing you; it spellbinds you to accept the unbalanced and the bizarre as normal; it keeps you on a knife-edge and at a distance, so that when the hooks do eventually sink in, you’ll willingly let yourself be drawn to the other side and immersed in a miscreation of woe.It’s a grim world the author, Tamsyn Muir has painted. As psychologically draining as it is harsh; as unforgiving as it is hostile. But gritty humor and incisor-sharp dialogue help the narrative along at a bone-jarring pace. And therein lies its balance and appeal.And the weird thing is, it’s not until the end – during the emotionally charged, action packed, blood & guts climax – that the full power of this story truly hits you.Wow! I loved it. A movie in the making if ever there was one.(Disclaimer: I brought this book from Amazon UK, but adored the story so much, felt it only fair to share here too.)"
"Charles Stross memorably described Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir thusly: “Lesbian necromancers explore a haunted gothic palace in space!” It makes a great blurb for some folks, I’m sure, but it put me off reading the novel for months. It was only after Gary Wolfe and Jonathan Strahan recommended it on the Coode Street Podcast that I finally picked it up.The very beginning, however, once again almost kept me from going any further. It opens with the title character, Gideon Nav, who is not particularly sympathetic despite the fact that she is seeking an escape from indentured servitude, normally a situation that would bring forth all kinds of good feelings from readers. Gideon seems like a shallow brat, more interested in her dirty magazines than anything else. Shortly, however, she is involved in a negotiation with her mortal enemy, Lady Harrowhark Nonagesimus, the Reverend Daughter of the Ninth House, which she more or less loses, thus setting the plot in motion. Hang in there: by Chapter 7, a little more than 50 pages in, Harrow and Gideon, who are both just teenagers, arrive at the House of the First for a competition between Houses Two through Nine to become lyctors, immortal companions to the Emperor. The competition is to uncover the best necromancer and cavalier pairs, and Harrow, a gifted necromancer, needs Gideon, a gifted fighter, to be her cavalier.The Nine Houses appear to be an artifact of a once-spacefaring civilization, each representing a different planet or habitat. Everything is strange about the House of the First — the Emperor’s House — and the necromancer/cavalier pairs who each represent one of the other houses. It is beautifully weird and mesmerizing for the reader. The necromancers and their cavaliers begin working on solving problems set for them, dangerous problems that usually pose a mortal threat for one or the other or the both of them. And suddenly, contestants start turning up dead. And one begins to wonder exactly what “winning” means for this contest, and whether the battle is worth the prize.As these contests proceed, and Harrow and Gideon find an awkward way of working with one another, their characters fill out — not always likable, but always fascinating. We learn some mysteries about how the world works, the houses, and especially the Ninth House — mysteries that seem likely to show up in later books in this series.From the time the characters gather at the House of the First to the end of Gideon the Ninth, I was barely able to stop reading. I had to know what was going to happen next. This combination of science fiction, fantasy, mystery and thriller was amazingly rich in character, setting, plot and especially world building. I agree with Jana that the dialogue is as sharp as can be, with plenty of snark that kept me smiling even as the corpses piled up high.It is often difficult to tell the players without a scorecard, simply because there are so many of them, and they all seem to have at least two names; do take advantage of the Dramatis Personae at the front of the book to tell who is who. But with that resource at hand, there is nothing but enjoyment to be had here. I loved Gideon the Ninth so much that I put it on my Hugo ballot this spring, and I’m delighted that it’s been nominated for both the Nebula and the Hugo Awards. It’s gaspingly original and pure fun to read."
"Some things, you should be prepared for right off the bat with this book: it requires a bit of work and patience. If you read a fair amount of sci-fi, you're probably used to it when learning the setting. The author hits the ground running, in order to tell the tale in a way that doesn't bog you down with exposition (you do get it; it's just spread out). You also get a list of dramatis personae to start with, and while at times I felt overwhelmed by the cast, that, like the meat of the world itself, is something which is brewed long-term like a good soup.That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The protagonist balances being dramatically compelling with being a snarky memelord, and somehow, it works. It works great! There are plenty of references to pick up, though none of them stick out in a way that disrupts reading or enjoyment. The story is rich with feeling and mysteries great and small, and, generally speaking, you don't get left holding the bag on them. The setting is, like everything else in this book, wonderfully and enjoyably weird.So, to whom would I recommend this book? You read the blurb, took one look at ""lesbian necromancers explore a haunted palace in space! Skeletons!!"", and made a tiny wish in your heart that anything could be as good as something like that promises-- it is and this book is for you. You like your characters full of muddled feelings and deep-seated inner conflict. You want something unapologetically and over-the-top goth, so goth that it erupts into a party of cursed bats, skeletons, and viscera. You like lesbian and bi representation and focus in the media. You love a long mystery and uncovering bits of the setting piece-by-piece, some things spoken, and others inferred. You appreciate a good stealth meme.To whom would I not recommend this book? Imagine that instead of reading Tolkien describing trees from pages, the trees are now bones and blood and cursed ashes. If this isn't your cup of tea, maybe back up, because you're not ready to crank the gothmeter over 8, let alone over ten. If you're looking for something fluffy, for some heartwarming, remotely normal romance, this probably isn't your style. If you want a casual read, or if you think you'll get too frustrated by having unfamiliar concepts flung at you as sci-fi sometimes does, I would save this for another time. If you get impatient about getting answers, or, if you want all of the answers in a single book alone, it may be too much waiting for you.tl;dr: If you liked the blurb and you like sci-fi, I think you'll like the book. I realize that's incredibly broad, but it's that good. I absolutely suggest you give it a shot.Sidenote: although the reviews for Harrow seem closed for now through Amazon (which is a bit odd), I finished that book as well. Some of the reviews make some claims that show me they didn't actually read the whole book. If you do end up reading Gideon, and you like it, I whole-heartedly recommend Harrow. The genre is a bit different, but the things that matter are still excellent. Trust in the author and persist, and everything will be clear. Also, afterward, if you bought the kindle ver, read the appendix on the paperback version through Amazon's look feature. There's a bonus story there. Search for ""cohort intelligence."""
"Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir is bloody and dark. I felt like it was kind of the Tri-wizards tournament from Harry Potter with a lot more death and necromancy. Nine houses are all assembled with the best necromancer and the best sword fighter, it looks like the necromancers and sword fighters duke it out in a tournament, but when keys are found and murder committed, the game becomes a fight for survival. There's a lot of creative world building and puts a fresh spin to necromancy and dark magic. This is a novel I found really frustrating at the beginning, because we are thrown into this book, with no backstory, no since of how worlds and magic are set up, but then we get the backstory and I was blown away by how clearly all the strife between the two main characters of Gideon and Harrow was explained and made sense for all the hatred. The one thing in my TBR that really got me to check out this book was the lesbian necromancy. The book delivers very solidly on the necromancy, but the lesbianism is really lacking thee's looks, there's hand holding, and maybe barely a thought, and that's it. So is there a lesbian necromancer? yes there's more questioning and slight longing, and representation does matter but be warned you could be disappointed.The Plot: Gideon is on her 87th escape from the ninth world, she has secrets that will not stop her from getting out. She faces challenges from some, but she is determined. Gideon is almost at the ship that will take her off world when she is met by the world's ruler Harrowhawk or just Harrow. She makes her a deal she can leave or she can and hear a proposal. Harrow sweetens the deal if she lays a blade on her she will give her coin and send her on the way, but if she loses then she has to hear the proposal. Gideon agrees and Harrow unleashes hundreds of skeletons from the ground, Gideon gets close and manages to take a glove off to reveal a dirty hand. Gideon can't believe she lost when it is revealed that Harrow spent all night burying one to set up this trap. Harrow and Gideon hate each other to the core, but a proposal has them working together, with Gideon getting her wish to go off world as Harrow's caviler and Harrow get's a her world to get recognized and a chance to save the dying world by becoming the emperor's hand. Gideon agrees and leaves with Harrow her first order is don't talk to a soul, Gideon saves a girl from the seventh house only to have her caviler put a sword to her throat. This is a lesson to Gideon that she is playing a dangerous game. A tournament is set up amongst caviler's and necromancers. Gideon does okay but soon learns she is out of her element. Harrow goes missing as a pair of bodies from one house show up and a set of hidden keys. It is quickly realized that the hidden keys are the goal and the secrets they unlock. Gideon and Harrow who are mortal enemies must work together to win and for their lives.What I Liked: Necromancy in the form of Dark magic is really well thought out, and I liked that each house had a different speciality. The big reveal on why Gideon and Harrow hate each other was so well thought out, it worked for the plot and it made sense emotionally how those actions can lead to hate. The forty page climax is intense, I will complain that is was sometime hard to follow, but what I could picture was excellent. The scene where skeletons are created using the necromancer's own bones was really cool and terrifying. The Gideon and Harrow relationship was special, and the highlight of the book about trusting someone you hate. My favorite side character was Sextus his morality and trust were great to see in such a warrior. Gideon's one liners, didn't always land but the couple times they did I laughed. I loved the Sex Pal line the best. Such a haunting cover that demands the reader to check it out.What I Disliked: The first part of the book takes a little bit to get going because you are so in the dark to how their world and magic work. I did have a little trouble always picturing the action. The guy waited a little too long to show their full power. Keeping up with all the characters was really hard, the main ones are easy but some of the houses blend together.Recommendations: Read this truly original dark book. Gideon the Ninth is book one in a proposed trilogy called The Locked Tomb Series. I think this is one of those good hybrid of Science Fiction and Fantasy. This book say the F-word a fair amont, but I would recommend this to a mature young adult. I rated Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir 4 out of 5 stars. Gideon the Ninth was pretty close to a five star for me, I already put a hold on Harrow the Ninth, and am looking forward to where this series goes."
"Lesbian necromancers in space. How can you not want to read a book with a hook like that? Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir is the first book in the Locked Tomb Trilogy. Gideon hates her life as part of the Ninth House. She hates everything about the nuns, the gloomy atmosphere and especially her nemesis Harrow, the Reverend Daughter of the Ninth House. The only things she enjoys are her dirty magazines and her sword, with which she is quite skilled.After her latest attempt to escape the planet fails, Gideon reluctantly agrees to accompany Harrow, a skilled bone witch, as her cavalier. They journey off-planet to Canaan house, the home of the emperor, where he has invited each of the houses to appear for a trial of wits and skill. Gideon and Harrow do not care for each other but their skills do complement one another.Canaan house is staffed by odd caretakers and is a bit of a maze. Solving the secrets and trials of the house is the test for each of the representatives from the various houses to solve in order to become a Lyctor; a powerful necromancer who would serve at the right hand of the emperor. Secrets and mysteries abound both among the representatives from each of the houses and between Gideon and Harrow and the history of their own house. The story is propelled forward by trying to solve these mysteries while at the same time learning more about each of the characters and their relationships, especially the relationship between Gideon and Harrow. They start out as simple rivals who need each other but interestingly developed a far more complicated and nuanced relationship.Tension is displayed throughout the story both by the shifting relationships between the characters as well as the gradually uncovered history of Canaan house itself and the motivations of the emperor who brought them there.The one thing that didn't work for me in this book was the world-building. Both the house from which Gideon and Harrow came and Canaan house felt more like buildings than worlds. I have no sense of the planet surrounding these buildings nor their part of the universe. It was a little disconcerting.Gideon the Ninth is an inventive and entertaining book. It is filled with fascinating, complicated characters. The challenges the characters must compete in reveal much about themselves as well as the history of the house.The narration by Moira Quirk is excellent. Her voice characterization captures both the humble upbringing and rebelliousness of Gideon as well as the haughty privilege of Harrow and the subtle distinctions between all the other characters. She does an impressive job with the pacing and the tone of the story.Anyone looking for something new and different in their science fiction or science fantasy would be well served to check out Gideon the Ninth.I was provided a copy of this audiobook by the publisher."
"Wow, what a wild ride of a book!  This is definitely genre-bending on the next level.  It has the modern sarcasm, humor, and sly references that I expect from Urban Fantasy, which it definitely isn't.  It has a far future setting with space travel - which we spend zero time on at all, so it's not what I'd call sci-fi despite the future setting.  Instead it turns out to be a locked manor mystery, but with necromancy.  Also, some body horror moments.  So I guess we'll put it in fantasy... kind of?All that being said, it was an awful lot of fun to read.  I know many reviewers have said it really took until halfway through the book for them to warm up to it or for the author to hit her stride.  I'm going to disagree.  I loved the snark and humor and characters from the start.  I actually didn't enjoy the turn in the mood of the book about 60% of the way through when it suddenly became a bit more horror-centric.  I still enjoyed the conclusion of the book, but honestly the change in tone is what cost this book the final star from my review.The characters, as always, are what make or break a book for me.  I don't care how cool your concept is, if you don't have good characters, it's wasted on me.  This book's main two characters - Gideon, Cavalier of the Ninth House and Harrowhark (who I really wanted to read as Harrowhawk the whole time), the Necromancer and sacred Daughter of the Ninth House are great fun.  The house system is a bit mysterious, as is the whole decaying empire vibe, and it's never really explained.There are basically two characters from each of the houses represented in the locked manor mystery.  I strongly encourage referring to the cast of characters at the front of the book on a regular basis, though the author was nice enough to give them names suggestive of their houses.If you like the frenemies dynamic, think fantasy needs more necromantic magic, or more mystery-fantasy crossovers, this book is for you.  While there are definitely some flirtatious moments and interest, there's nothing explicit in this book - and also you can barely tell there was space travel, so don't put too much weight on the ""lesbian necromancers in spaaaaaace"" tagline.  Though it is a good tagline - it's just not particularly representative of the actual book.A good read and I'm definitely planning to continue with the sequel, Harrow the Ninth."
"I don’t even know where to begin with this review. “Gideon the Ninth” is intense and so outside my normal genre of contemporary romance that I don’t feel like I can really say much. I liked it a lot but I didn’t love it, which isn’t really surprising as I said, it isn’t my usual genre.I had this in three different formats, I got the hardback copy from the library and then the next day, Overdrive let me know the e-book version was available. I read Carrie’s review about the audio version and I actually listened to I think the first two acts with that (via Scribd.) It helped me out a lot with the names and such, and the narrator was really awesome. I loved all her different voices for the characters. This was also the first time I used the audio version, so that was fun. I soon went back to reading because it’s a lot faster for me than listening.Let me start with the negative. There are so many characters…which leads to a lot of names…who also have numbers from whichever House they’re from. And they all referred to each other as their title, the number, the surname, the first name, a nickname, and/or some combination of it all. I kept having to go back to the list of houses and the names to figure out who was who for over half the book. I eventually got it but it was really annoying for a while.I also spent quite a bit of time googling words, although AFTER I finished reading the book, I noticed the e-book version has a glossary and an introduction to the characters which I found to be very helpful…after the fact. (I kept wondering why the kindle version was 50 pages longer than the hardback) So, if you haven’t read this yet, and you have the e-book version, go read that first.I think the favorite thing about this book to me was the snark. And Gideon…she is just a sweet little idiot. Like, I don’t think she has any kind of common sense, although, how she was raised may be part of the reason for that. And Harrowhark…she keeps so much hidden and to herself that by the end I just wanted to hug her. The way their relationship evolved was just so fun and entertaining and also kind of beautiful. I can’t wait to read the next book to see what happens.I recommend this to fans of action/fantasy/horror…and the like. lol"
"I liked it, but not ecstaticallyI haven’t read all the reviews but my impression is that people adore this book. I like some aspects very much, but others not.Yes:  The writing is consistently witty, funny, breezy, and very enjoyable.Yes:  Our hero, Gideon, is excellent. All the good attributes of the writing, and with a very specific and dark viewpoint of her own.  Some of the other characters are also quite well done.Confusing, but maybe that’s just me:  Too many characters. Some are well-delineated, but overall I could not keep track.Could have been good, but Not so much:  The framework is a wild mashup of horror story, black fantasy, and locked-house who-done-it.  (It’s also sort of a science-fiction tale, but the SF elements are almost entirely superfluous in my opinion.). Also kind of a romance.  I like the notion of a mashup of so many genres, but I don’t think it’s that well done.No:  for me, the problem with some genres is the very tired formulaic tropes they often use. And Muir is guilty. Once you recognize the genres that she is using, you will start recognizing a mass of over-used and overly predictable tropes.For example, I tend to avoid fantasy because the author gets to make up ridiculous magical rules and events as she goes along.  This is fine, IF the fantasy rules are consistent and sufficiently outlined that we can grasp them.  That’s not the case here.  The necromancers’ abilities keep popping up out of nowhere, and the necromancers themselves keep saying oh that’s not possible! Except of course it is.  Please.SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT:  a specific example:  As in formula WDI’s for at least the last century, you should be most suspicious of the person who seems least suspicious.  Give me a break.Yes, sort of:  The ending did surprise me. It was fitting but distressing.I have wavered between three and four stars. I gave it four because enjoyable writing and good characterization are worth a lot. But I very much hope that Muir will become less dependent on the over-used tropes of her source genres."
"Title: Gideon the NinthAuthor: Tamsyn MuirAge Group: AdultGenre: Horror/Science FictionSeries: The Locked Tomb, book oneStar Rating: 4 out of 5 Stars  I borrowed this book from my local library and reviewed it.  This book came to my attention when some of my favorite bloggers on Book Riot and other websites began talking about it, and I just couldn’t resist ordering it from my local library. I mean: lesbian necromancers! In space! That’s honestly all I needed to hear. This book is Tamsyn Muir’s first, and I’m so excited for the next book in The Locked Tomb series! Strange, bloody, darkly hilarious and unique, I loved this scary, creepy series debut; I will never forget Gideon of the Ninth House, nor her necromancer partner/enemy/best friend. I just finished this book two days ago, and I’m still stunned; I needed some time to sit with my thoughts to get them in order. This book is unlike anything I’ve ever read; I’m still not quite sure how to define it. Nonetheless, despite an extensive cast of characters, I loved it; I was alternately laughing, crying, screaming, and tearing my hair out! I can’t wait for the next book!  Gideon Nav is an orphan, a foundling taken in by the Ninth House of the Undead Lord and God King. She’s stuck with a prickly, dour necromancer for whom she has nourished a secret hatred her whole life. When she is thrust into the spotlight after the untimely departure of her house’s cavalier, Gideon and her charge are pushed into a deadly contest, and she must use all of her wits and strength to make it through the deadly court of the Undead alive. But when fellow competitors begin turning up dead, she begins to dig, and realizes that some secrets are better left buried…  This book was unlike any other I’ve ever read before; I didn’t really know what to make of it at first. I mean, lesbian necromancers in space?! Honestly, that was all I needed to hear. The pacing was great, and I was immediately sucked in. Unfortunately, at times it was hard to picture the setting, just because it was so extensive, and the list of characters was so vast that it got confusing, really quickly; I was constantly referring back to the dramatis personae at the beginning of the book. Nonetheless, this book had all the things I loved: enemies to lovers romance, wonderful worldbuilding, dark magic, political intrigue, heart and humor and twists and turns galore! Despite the little flaws of this book, I’m fully invested in this series, and I cannot wait for the sequel! Gideon is a fantastic antihero, full of bite, spite, and spunk, and I loved her relationship with the other characters, especially her necromancer, who she’s known since childhood. And that ending! Oh, my goodness, I need the next book, right now! The bottom line: A rich, creepy science fiction horror mashup, I loved Gideon the Ninth, and I can’t wait for the next book in this wonderful series! Next on deck: Wayward Son by Rainbow Rowell!"
"An empire's survival relies upon its necromancers, and its necromancers rely upon their swordspeople in Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir.Raised surrounded by reanimated skeletons, unfriendly nuns and teachers, and a necromancer about her age who constantly needles at her, Gideon has long planned a way to escape her life of servitude to the Ninth House, in both life and after death. In a compromise with Harrowhawk, the Ninth's necromancer, in a bid for her potential future freedom, Gideon accompanies her lifelong tormentor as her swordswoman during the trial of wit and skills that the Emperor has called upon the heirs of his loyal Houses to join. Successful completion of the trials would lead to becoming a Lyctor, and immortality, for the necromancer with their trusty cavalier at their side, while failure would lead to death, particularly in the case of the Ninth House.An ambitious story, the world has many interesting elements and mixed technologies of interplanetary travel, necromancy, and swordplay; however, though these elements were crafted and described in a way that worked fairly well together it didn't quite feel like a cohesive whole throughout the entirety of the story, such that more advanced, less magical, technologies would be mentioned in passing and cause brief confusion about the world's logistics. The text contained plenty of moments where the mental and verbal dialogue was incredibly and crassly witty and well-suited to and fitting with the characters' personalities. The intrigue and scheming that takes place is slowly revealed through the course of the narrative and is fairly well done, though it does take quite some time before things of note actually happen; the ending of this installment is particularly arresting and it generates interest in what will come next.Overall, I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars."
"There’s a blurb on the front cover of Tamsyn Muir’s Gideon the Ninth that is so good, you think to yourself, well, there’s no way the book can live up to that. That blurb, by Charles Stross, goes like this: “Lesbian necromancers explore a haunted gothic palace in space!” And so, obviously, there’s no way the book can live up to the awesomeness promised by that blurb.Except, it turns out, Gideon the Ninth, which doesn’t just live up to that, it surpasses it and then some, delivering a book that just delighted me - it’s inventive, well-told, funny, engaging, dramatic, and just plain fun, telling a great story in a great way with great characters.Where do we start with that blurb? Well, there’s the “necromancers” part, and let me tell you, man, does Gideon the Ninth deliver on that front. I don’t just mean resurrecting the dead or speaking to ghosts either; no, we’re talking armies of skeleton servants and butlers, unholy abominations, erupting spears of bones from graves, fused spirits, and so much more. This isn’t just necromancy as some ring belief system or an isolated practice; this is necromancy as the basis for an empire, in countless forms and variations, and in Muir’s capable hands, the possibilities are endless. This is magic of the dead in a way that I’ve never seen a book do, and every time you think you’ve got it nailed down, Muir tosses something else at you that you never saw coming.How about that “haunted gothic palace in space”? Oh, god, yes, do we get that and then some. An isolated space station where the various houses of the Emperor have come to vie for an exalted position gives us our setting, but it doesn’t take long for us to realize that something’s wrong here. Secret laboratories with unholy experiments, hidden passages, vanishing people, unsettling priests - every trapping of the genre is here, but by transposing everything into space and filling it with warring necromancers, it all takes on a fresh new life. Move this setting back a few hundred years and you’d recognize all of the elements, but again, Muir somehow takes it all and makes it feel new and inventive across the board.And, of course, there’s the “lesbian” element of the book, best personified in the titular Gideon. An orphan raised by the Ninth House, Gideon is a ball of anger and resentment. She’s constantly mocking and ridiculing her “superiors,” frequently makes efforts to escape the planet and enlist in the armed forces, and just generally hates everyone. She’s also, it must be noted, an incredible warrior, a woman for whom nothing is as much fun or pleasurable as fighting to the death - well, apart from checking out an attractive woman. In other words, Muir has given us the classic jock character…but in the form of a woman, and not a man. She’s snarky, sarcastic, wins her fights, flirts incessantly, doesn’t follow orders well, and generally is just a blast to be around.And she RULES. Gideon is our point-of-view character for the book, and that choice is a brilliant one - the equivalent of having a Han Solo character telling the story. Gideon doesn’t always understand the intrigue around her, nor the scheming nor the politics. And really, she doesn’t care about any of it - she cares about getting away from all of this, about getting into a good fight, and maybe keeping up her end of the bargain that’s going to let her do those things. She’s funny, engaging, likable, and just a great character as we plunge into this strange world.With all of those elements, Muir has enough for a great book, but along with all of that, we get a compelling, strange story - a murder mystery that feels of a piece with the gothic setting. As contenders for the position keep getting killed or disappearing, the hunt for what’s going on becomes more and more desperate. (At least, for most of the characters, Gideon’s “superior” especially. Gideon mainly just drifts along the sides, flirts with the hottest woman there, and gets into some fights along the way whenever possible.) There’s a lot going on here, and admittedly, giving us a narrator who doesn’t follow all of the story isn’t always the clearest choice. But somehow, it all works, diving into deep secrets, forbidden rituals, and genuine horror amidst everything else going on - all culminating in a genuinely surprising ending that I didn’t see coming.Gideon the Ninth does so much right - characters, setting, prose, humor, action, plotting - but what’s hardest to convey here is just how much fun it is to read. This is an over the top fantasy horror tale about necromancers in a bleak setting, but you don’t come away from Gideon the Ninth thinking about how grim it was - you think about how well it moves, and how much you want to have a drink with Gideon, and how the characters develop along the way, and so much more. I may have jumped on Gideon the Ninth because of that amazing blurb, but what I got was something just exhilarating - a bunch of familiar elements, but combined in a way I’ve never seen, and told with a style and energy that’s undeniable. There’s a follow-up to Gideon to come, but I’ll say this - if she keeps writing things even half this good, I’ll be reading Muir for years to come - and you’d do well to do the same."
"Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir is, simply put, one hell of a ride.In a planetary system far away, there are a string of planets that are home to the Nine Houses: families of followers of a necromantic God that, ten thousand years ago, ressurected the system after a cataclysmic event. In the bowels of the Ninth House lives Gideon Nav, the least faithful of the least holy House. Ready to leave behind her terrible existence in Drearburgh, she packs her nude magazines and makes ready for life beyond. But things rarely go as planned, and Gideon is forced to not only remain a citizen of the Ninth, but must place her life on the line in representation of it. What a drag. But at least she looks good doing it.Detailed and unique, Gideon the Ninth is a wild story of swordplay, necromancers, and a special kind of macabre horror that can only be expressed by those who commune and control the dead.This was a fascinating story to follow, even if at times it was difficult to do so. The writing style was convoluted, and there were times I had to read sentences slowly to try and decipher them. Ultimately, though, I am glad I took the time to try and understand everything. It was a brilliant story to behold, and at the end I was left feeling like I had experienced the story rather than simply having read it. Gideon was a marvelous character to follow; at times snarky and other times badass. The setting alone was genius and detailed. I would love to play a game of D&D set in this world.All in all, a true necromantic story unlike any other. Fans of swords and death-magic need apply."
"This is a good first effort from a young writer, but not worthy of the gushing praise it's receiving. The opening is glorious, with a setting I was dying to explore. And then she leaves. The two primary characters, Gideon and Harrow, are whisked off to a sort of space camp scavenger hunt. There are flashes of originality, but mostly it's just characters I couldn't keep straight looking for keys. There are multiple characters from other planets, even of whom have odd titles and even odder names. I kept having to page back to figure out who these people were, but, even worse, soon I stopped cargin. Quite a lot of reviewers love Gideon's voice, but her snarky, petulant teen routine wore thin quickly and seems like it was cut and pasted in from another novel. And if you've read about the gut-punch ending, and seen the title of the next novel, you can put two and two together..."
"Synopsis: Gideon is an orphan who knows little of her past. She is a foul-mouthed, brash, impudent, sword-weilding servant of the Ninth House who dreams of a life outside of her small world. When the Emperor summons Gideon and Ninth House necromancer Harrowhark Nonagesimus to enter a contest that will determine who the next Lyctor will be, Harrow accepts and forces Gideon to come with as her Cavalier and protector.To be Lyctor is to be immortal and powerful, and every one of the Nine Houses sends a representative, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, strategies, and agendas. As the contest proceeds, each team’s physical, mental, and emotional skill is tested; but, when the stakes get higher, alliances form and secrets (and blood) get spilled, leaving some to question whether or not a Lyctorship is worth the trouble.Despite their differences, Gideon and Harrowhark must work together to survive (and possibly win) the contest.Review: Gideon the Ninth has so many “wow” factors, that I almost do not know where to start. From the writing style to the setting, the characters, and the Necromancy and history… everything about this book was unique and special. This was a fun book and on my list of best reads this year.One of my favorite aspects of Gideon the Ninth was the writing. Tamsyn Muir created this incredibly unique world, set in space, and completely unlike our own; yet, the author resisted the temptation to info dump, choosing instead to work the details into the dialogue and plot and letting it unfold at its own pace. As a reader, I find this enjoyable because I am not taken out of the story by having too much information thrown at me at one time.The main conflict of the story (a contest to become a powerful and immortal Lyctor) is a great medium for plot devices. Putting the characters in a high-stress environment allows them to show off their powers and discover themselves and their partner, as well as their enemies’ strengths and weaknesses. Enemies become friends, friends become enemies, bonds are formed and torn apart, history is explained and secrets exposed (SO MANY SECRETS), the plot twists a few times, and there is even a slow-burning romance (though, I think this is overplayed in some descriptions I have read). The writing is so good, the author uses the plot (and plot devices) to keep every bit of the story interesting.In my opinion, this book is extremely character-driven. There are easily 20+ characters to keep track of: at least 2 characters represent each of 8 planets, some send more, plus there are priests and administers of the contest. In most other books I would say this is too many for the reader to remember, but it works in Gideon the Ninth. Each character is so unique, plus the Necromancers have a numerical naming system that makes the Necromancers easier to track and their Cavaliers are always with them so that connection is easy for the reader to maintain. The growth (or regression) of each of these characters is what really put the story over the top for me.I am going to be honest and say that through the first 25 pages of the book I was afraid I would dislike Gideon’s character by the end. She is kind of typical teenager: annoying, rebellious, always has a sarcastic retort. But, instead of wearing out her welcome, Gideon grows (and grows on you) throughout the story without compromising herself in the end. I found Gideon to be one of the most well-written characters of any book I read this year.Oh, and did I mention skeletons?"
"The marketing slogan for this book was “lesbian necromancers in space” so obviously the second I heard I knew this was something I had to pick up. Gideon the Ninth is Tamsyn Muir’s debut novel, the first in a series, and it is unabashedly queer, gothic, and bloody. This book absolutely slammed into the cultural consciousness of the SFF sphere, and I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that Muir changed the very landscape of the genre. Hilarious, moving, and good fun, this was easily one of my most anticipated reads and lived up to every one of my expectations.Gideon is our main character, and the Ninth is the shadowy house and planet she’s confined to. Living as an indentured servant to the Ninth, the guardians of the mysterious Locked Tomb, Gideon dreams of taking her massive sword and her porn magazines and going off to join the Emperor’s forces in the army. Her dreams and frequent escape attempts are continually dashed by the Reverend Daughter of the Ninth House, Harrowhark Nonagesimus, who is set to lead the House when her parents die and has made it her life’s mission to make Gideon’s life as miserable as possible. It’s only the fact that Gideon is in possession of Harrow’s deepest secret that keeps her alive and in the game, but when the Emperor summons the heirs of Houses two through nine, Gideon is dragged in further than she ever wanted to be. Forced to playact as Harrow’s cavalier, her protector and knight, as she goes through the Emperor’s necromantic trials to become a Lyctor, an immortal soldier in service of the Emperor, the two of them are forced to work together to earn both Harrow’s immortality and Gideon’s freedom. But when the heirs and cavaliers begin dying of mysterious causes, it becomes obvious that either the Emperor has led them all into a trap or that the quest for immortality and power has turned the heirs against one another.This book is science-fiction. It’s fantasy. It’s sword & sorcery. It’s Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes. Political intrigue, of course. Some gothic horror, as a treat. It does it all. And everything is interwoven so spectacularly! Genre-blending can be difficult and cumbersome, but everything was built into the universe so well that I thought nothing of wielding a sword on a spaceship on your way to a gothic locked-room murder mystery while your boss raises the dead in the background. Part of this I think is owed to my favorite type of worldbuilding: less is more. We are not given an extensive history of the nine worlds Gideon and Harrow inhabit, or a detailed explanation of each House and their issues. We are dropped into this world and expected to deal, and it pays off wonderfully. Every element is perfectly balanced and keeping your worldbuilding close to your chest just ensures that some of the mystique remains.Other people can probably say it more eloquently than me, but this book was funny. So often in fantasy books I feel like we get more stilted language, either modified by the baggage of a made-up language system or the difficulty of trying to replicate medieval speech patterns, but Gideon the Ninth embraces the slang and meme culture of the modern day. Gideon is not afraid to crack sex jokes, call people bizarre insults, and keep a sarcastic inner monologue up. Harrow’s speech patterns are also hilarious, switching between the formal language of a woman of her position and stature and being just as crass as Gideon. This book is sometimes shelved as YA (it’s not) and I think one of the reasons is because the writing style and dialogue is so accessible, which is a pity. Gideon is very much an adult novel, but I wish we had more adult novels that embraced regular styles of speech and thought patterns without being automatically shafted into the young adult section. Gideon keeps us engaged with her narration and her dialogue, and climatic moments are made even better because she talks like a real person.It would be remiss not to discuss the relationships in this novel. Gideon is a lesbian, but if you’re looking for a gay love story look elsewhere. Her identity is baked into the narrative in such a way that the story doesn’t need to be about her falling in love to make it clear she’s gay. This is not a love story, there is no romance. We can speculate, but I think it’s important to realize that just because a novel doesn’t focus on the identity of its main characters doesn’t mean those identities don’t exist or are meaningful. Aside from the great lesbians in this book, I was also impressed with the necromancer/cavalier system. Most necromancers in this world are bolstered by non-magical counterparts, knights and guardians who do the sword-fighting and punching while their necromancers do their specific style of magic. This led to some fantastic different type of relationships in this book: romantic, platonic, familial. The connection between necromancers and their cavaliers is based on mutual respect and trust, and it was so interesting to see how the environment and plot were shaped by these relationships, not only Gideon and Harrow but the heirs and cavaliers of the other Houses. Their partnerships were the core of the novel and played a big part of the overarching mystery. I love a book that doesn’t pin all of its character development on romance and places importance on platonic relationships like they deserve.Gideon the Ninth was a riot. Hilarious, real, and heartfelt, everything I could want from a novel was somehow packed into this little goth number. I want to emphasize that this is not young adult; there’s adult themes and content, graphic scenes of violence and numerous upsetting ideas are presented. All of this led to a book that felt stylistic and fun without sacrificing any of the maturity or complexity that I expect from my adult books. It meant a lot to me as a queer person to see myself reflected so perfectly, not only in simple appearance and representation but to see queer people as well-rounded pieces of an intricate plot, not just players in a love story. I recommend Gideon the Ninth to everyone, everyone; there’s something here for you all to love.TW/CW: child death, graphic depictions of violence, body horror, self-harm, mentions and depictions of suicide."
"This book was spectacular!  I kept reading rave reviews, but I'd been disappointed so often by other highly awarded books that I was in no rush to read this.  Finally I got off the wait-list of my local library's digital copy to read it, and I was quickly enraptured.  Its a rollicking, fun adventure with mystery, thrills, and a delightful protagonist.  The language is very 'modern', and I don't imagine it aging particularly well a few decades from now, but for the current reader its a breath of fresh air.Unlike many trilogies this book also has a proper ending, which I appreciated.  Its clearly setting the stage for the next book, but it also works well as a standalone novel.I actually don't think I have any complaints - I'm very happy I read it, and might consider buying a personal kindle copy.  I do wonder how it will hold up under a reread, given that I now 'know' some of the mysteries.  Steven Erickson's books work wonderfully as rereads, for example, as you suddenly 'get' lots of subtle hints you missed before, and they are really elevated as a result.  Even if Gideon the Ninth doesn't hold up as a reread, the initial read was wonderful enough for it to not really matter.If you at all like pulp, mystery, or just cool+exciting aesthetics and plot, then I definitely recommend Gideon the Ninth!"
"The premise for Gideon the Ninth sounded amazing - lesbian space necromancers? I was sold on those three words alone. And this book is that. But it’s also so much more.Gideon the Ninth is a space opera meets locked room murder mystery meets coming of age story. I loved the different aspects of it and how Muir executed the mystery so masterfully. Both Gideon and Harrow grew on me and I cannot wait to see where their story goes next.I also loved the world-building, it was so fresh and unique. But I wish it had been a little bit clearer, particularly the history of these people and the houses. I think there’s definitely a good chance that we’ll find out the answers to these questions in the sequel though. I had some trouble getting into this one at first just because there were so many different people, all of whom had at least two different names that were frequently used.Gideon the Ninth was so close to being a five star read for me. I will absolutely be picking up the sequel, I can’t wait to see what happens next.I’d recommend this one if you’re looking for a dark fantasy or science fiction novel! If you don’t usually read science fiction but the fantasy aspects sound good, I would still give this one a shot, I think it will surprise you.*Disclaimer: I received an advance copy of this book for free from the publisher. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review."
"3.5 starsI’ve heard so many good things about Gideon the Ninth around the internet and was excited to finally see what the hype was all about.Right away, I was drawn in by the unique world-building and protagonist herself. Gideon is snarky and hilarious, truly a well-developed, stand-out character. As the story progressed, Harrow grew on me as well. I loved the dynamic between the two girls—from enemies to reluctant allies to unexpected friends. The banter? Pure. Gold.I was a bit disappointed that no romance blossomed between the two, as I thought that was going to happen. I’d seen people call the story enemies to lovers, but lovers, they were not. Ultimately this didn’t make or break the book for me, but if you’re also expecting a sapphic love story, you might want to adjust those expectations a bit.I was also disappointed by the lack of deeper world-building. The concept of necromancers in space is unique and quite intriguing, but Muir doesn’t build much upon that. I know the story is set in a solar system of nine Houses on nine planets, ruled by some sort of immortal emperor, with each House specializing in a different type of necromancy. Beyond that, I couldn’t tell you anything, really. Gideon and Harrow come from the Ninth House—though Gideon was only raised there, whereas Harrow is the born heir—and the story takes place in the First House.Additionally, I had many questions while I read, unrelated to the plot itself, that weren’t answered. How did Gideon, at eighteen, not know what a shower was? Sure, the scene where she discovered it by getting blasted with water was comical, but it doesn’t make sense. Do people in the Ninth House not shower? How do they get clean? It’s a small detail, yes, but it caught my attention and I can’t help but focus on what it might mean.Many of my questions were related to the side characters, the members of the other Houses, Second through Eighth. I couldn’t tell you what kind of necromancy each specialized in; the only one I know is that the Ninth’s specialty was bones. It took half the book for me to figure out who was who and be able to recall them all in a timely manner. Hardly any of them had distinguishable traits, and most only appeared to either aid or oppose the protagonists.Moving past that, the story is divided into five acts. I was intrigued from the start, but not truly invested until things started going wrong around the start of act three. I believe the middle chunk of the book is the best because of the character and relationship development, as well as the constant suspense. Once I got past the second half of act four, though, things seemed to drag on unnecessarily. There was more and more fighting, and I became less and less interested. The last hundred pages probably could’ve been shortened by about thirty.And can I just say, I’m really, really not happy with the ending? ‘Cause I’m not. I don’t know why Muir made the decisions they did. Even with the slower pacing, I’d decided on a four star rating, but act five, short though it was, was enough to make me lower my rating by another half star. It also significantly lessened my interest in the sequel.I know I’ve been quite critical throughout this review, but I did enjoy some aspects of Gideon the Ninth. Both protagonists were complex and entertaining, and Gideon was especially entertaining. Her narration truly made the book more memorable. I just seriously wish that Muir had spent more time developing the rest of the characters and world they created. If the ending was changed, I’d be okay with that too. I’m still planning to read the sequel, but my expectations are much, much lower than they were for this book.Representation:-two lesbian protagonistsContent Warning: death, gore, violence, blood, body horror, terminal illness, chronic illness, physical abuse, murder, emotional abuse, self harm, child abuse, slavery, medical content, medical trauma, grief, suicide, child death, toxic relationship, cannibalism, confinement, domestic abuse, gun violence, bullying, religious bigotry, suicidal thoughts"
"Many thanks to Tor and Edelweiss for an eARC in exchange for an honest, unbiased opinion.It’s taken forever for me to write this review, because all I could do was alternate between screaming into the void and weeping in the corner. For some reason, it’s a bit hard to put that into words.I was on-board the moment I heard Gideon the Ninth pitched as lesbian necromancers in space … but it’s so much more than that. It’s sarcasm and sweet fight scenes and a murder mystery and two badass woman who have to work together without killing each other, despite their better judgment.This book wasn’t quite what I expected going in. The beginning was slow and confusing, and I felt completely lost at first, but I ended up loving it. It’s a mix of strong characters, unique necromancy skills, an everyone-for-themselves brutal trial, and a murder mystery. There’s a lot going on and a lot to love and so many twists and turns that by the end, I was just so ready for the second book.My Thoughts:- This is a world that, while not completely developed and fleshed out in this book, holds so much promise and intrigue that I can’t wait to find out more. I guess this can be both a pro and a con. If you’re into really deep, immersive world-building where you get a very clear, vivid view of the world … this book is probably going to disappoint you. For me, I just want a taste of the world. I want enough where it makes sense, where I feel involved and curious, but not where I know all the histories and folklore and heroes and legends. On that, Gideon the Ninth delivers.- I am absolutely head-over-heels in love with Gideon Nav, from her sarcasm to her begrudging sense of duty, to her bad-ass fighting skills. I think this is really what’s going to divide people about this book. Either you love Gideon and her sarcasm and voice or … you don’t. And if you don’t, you’re going to have a problem, because Gideon is 87% sarcasm, 7% fighting skill, 1% pure dumb luck, 1% wisdom, and 4% dirty magazines. Gideon is the quintessential reluctant hero, and she makes it clear, loudly and often, just how she feels about her duty. She’s crude, sarcastic, abrasive … and it’s just lovely. She’s not a character that’s necessarily intended to be liked … although, I very much did.- Enemies forced to work together is one of my favorite tropes, and watching Harrowhark and Gideon trying to work together was glorious. Both women have their own character arcs, but my favorite was the arc their relationship takes as they’re forced to rely on each other just to survive.- The real plot here is a sort of murder mystery, which has all the creepy vibes and twists and turns one might expect. There’s a bit of gore in this book, but not terribly so. The atmosphere, once this plot really got going, was deliciously eerie, and I didn’t want to put the thing down.- The necromancers all have unique powers based on their house, and there were plenty of action-packed fight scenes because of it. There are slight nuances to the power, and I thought it was so creative! There were quite a few fight scenes, and they were fast-paced, full of necromancer goodness, but also surprisingly strategic. I loved seeing the combination of magic and swords in action and seeing people working both with and against each other.Sticking Points:- There are a lot of characters (18 in the trial alone) and keeping them all straight was really difficult. I mean, there’s a handy little list of characters in the front, but I don’t know how convenient it is, since I read on my Kindle, and switching to it is really a hassle. I was forced to sometimes, though, because I was so confused with certain scenes because I just couldn’t keep the characters straight. This may not be a problem for some, but a cast can only get so big before I start going, “Who dis?” every time a character appears.- The beginning feels a bit slow and a lot like being thrown in the deep end. There’s no gentle easing into the world and figuring out how things work, where it’s set, how the society works, etc. It’s just turned all the way up from the start, and it was a bit disorienting to me, since I was just lost and confused."
"Overall, this book was a blast. I ripped through it pretty quickly, and it was a joy to do so. It was the first book in a bit where I was perpetually surprised by what page I was on. They just flew by. The voice is smart and Muir is genuinely funny.The characters, really the stars of the show, are a bit difficult to sort out at the start. There are 20 or so characters introduced in the first 100 pages, and despite a list at the start of the book (which I constantly referenced), it took me a while to get to the point where I was clear on who is who. Part of this is due to Muir's tendency towards creative but sometimes disruptive dialogue tags. I mean, I know that Coronabeth, Gideon, Harrowhark, and a few others are in the scene, but which one is the ""tall necromancer"" again? or ""the necromancer of the Third House?"" I realize this is intended to provide detail and description as we go along, but it was more cumbersome than simply using their names would have been.Muir has an impressive vocabulary, and her voice generally delights throughout, but there are times when a joke falls flat or a description doesn't quite make sense (there was one that went something like ""hung there like a cloud of cancer"" and I thought, I have no idea what that means).The plot twists come fast and furious, and overall, it is a very tightly woven narrative. It all gels well. The fights are cool, the powers both chilling and exciting. I do wish that Muir had spent more time establishing the rules of necromancy in her universe early on. Doing so would have created more shock in the reader when those rules are inevitably broken. As it is, we only learn that some necromantic marvel is truly amazing when some character informs us in the moment ""that shouldn't be possible.""None of this should dissuade a reader from diving into this skull first. It's a great time, no doubt, and I look forward to reading more."
"Lesbian necromancers in space. Exploring a haunted castle. I cannot believe you'd want MORE to throw this book on your to-read shelf.We've got a lot on our plates here: Gideon Nav and Harrowhark Nonagesimus were raised together, albeit in much different conditions. Gideon was in abject poverty as a servant of the Ninth House; Harrow is the revered daughter of the Ninth. Yet they were the only two children of their house in quite a while.Then the Ninth House (among the other Houses in the universe) receives a letter stating that they are needed in the Undying Emperor's Canaan House to compete in a series of trials. If they win, if they survive, they will be made a lyctor; losing means the Ninth House falls into oblivion.Both women will need not only their wits to survive, but the ability to put aside their own differences for the continued survival of their House. So into Canaan House they go.And I loved every bit of it. Gideon was sassy, snarky, strong, fun. Harrow was snarky, strong, fun, but their voices were unique. Usually I find that authors have a hard time pulling that off.The mystery was kinda fantastic too. So they're brought to this old decaying house where a lot of forgotten and mysterious necromancy is in use, and one by one they begin dying off. And you care. Everyone was equally weird, but cool; you didn't wanna see them die.The villain was epic. And we have to talk about the Third's actions.I need the next book, STAT. I'm dying without it"
"The short of it is this: Gideon the Ninth has some outrageously cool ideas and a fun aesthetic, but ultimately suffers due to botched execution. This books greatest flaw, for me at least, mainly comes down to this its sluggish pacing. After a time, say 200 or so pages, I found myself skimming just to get to the interesting bits. The central mystery takes much too long to get to. This book easily could've been a hundred pages shorter."
"I want this book to be made into a video game. I want to play all the houses. I want my heart in my throat while I solve puzzles and fall in love mashing buttons and unraveling skeletons. This book is a smart puzzle of sharp pointy people and bloody twists and broken hearts. Oh, and I snickered and cackled a lot.About 2/3rds of the way through, I breathed a sigh of relief and exultation (an exhalation of exultation?) that there MUST be a second book, but then with one chapter left to go, I still wasn't sure! That's how well plotted the entire book felt - unexpected, unique, and just damn fun. I wanted more even as I was stuffing myself full.There were a few idioms that jarred, things that felt out of place, but that's a conversation to be had between author and editor, and it was rare enough to be ignored. You will absolutely need to mark the page of houses and refer to it often. That's why it's there - use it.The ""world-building"" isn't really explained, but it didn't need it, and I absolutely can't wait to unwrap the next layer that might show me more. I have theories! I have thoughts! I want a book about every house! I've never had the urge to write fanfic before, but damn if this isn't the one that might push me over. Well done."
"This story is an incredible read written by a brilliant author. Some reviews complained of it being boring. I was kept fully engaged from beginning to end. Ultimately, this book about the few remaining groups of humanity deep in the future is a story of forgiveness and love. It focuses on relationship and perhaps that's why some people are complaining about wandering plot, though imo the plot was tightly woven. The idea of scattered pockets of humans on many planets gifted in various aspects of necromancy and answering the call of their god-emperor who has been fighting a continuous battle for the universe for more than 10,000 years....Well. Its a lot to take in. We have two mc's, Gideon and Harrow. Their childhood was dark and filled with conflict. They start the story as enemies. The author writes in dark, gothic tones with incredibly rich descriptions. As it should be, the necromantic world described is rotting and fetid. Humor is regularly injected with insights into Gideons sacrilegious thoughts and flippant observations and responses. Her levity and use of modern slang is the perfect antidote to the constantly somber and death filled necromantic setting. Brilliant writing from a brilliant mind. Books this original and well written are a rarity to be treasured."
"This debut novel from author Tamysn Muir is a real trip, an atmospheric and hilarious adventure of galactic sword and sorcery that dances nimbly over the line between fantasy and sci-fi. It more than lives up to its pithy blurb of 'lesbian necromancers in space,' and I love how the prose blends the traditional genre style of formal writing with a much more colloquial and vulgar approach. The sardonic protagonist has quite a lot to complain about in this story, and she employs some tremendously colorful language to do so. I imagine this won't work for every sort of reader, but I've found it a refreshingly distinctive choice.In fact, the book is nearly a five-star read from me, but I do feel that the skeleton combat scenes get a tad repetitive after a while, and I'm unhappy that -- spoiler alert -- a promising gradual enemies-to-lovers arc is curtailed by one of the women dying. There's room to argue over whether that's an instance of the ""bury your gays"" trope, both since Muir is a queer writer telling non-heteronormative speculative fiction and since death is not necessarily a permanent end in this setting, but it's certainly not the outcome that I wanted for these characters. I'll definitely be reading the two forthcoming sequels, to see if/how that plot continues and because the whole venture is morbidly entertaining in the best way.[Content warning for body horror.]"
"Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir got a lot of hype as “lesbian necromancers in space” (or maybe that’s “in spaaaaaaace”). Evidently that wasn’t enough for me. I got up to chapter 12 and stopped. I found it impossible to care about any of the characters. Gideon was simply annoying and whiny. And the “in space” setting made no sense whatsoever in terms of physical logistics. The story structure would have made much more sense as a secondary world on a single planet, maybe doing the physical isolation via islands? Instead it was “in spaaaaaaace” and didn’t work at all for me. And, although this isn’t the author’s fault at all, I’m utterly  bewildered by the publishing dynamics of which books are promoted as overtly queer and which are left to languish in hints and implications. Gideon gets it, but lots of other books with more central and more implicit queer content don’t. Some day I will give away my gorgeous first-edition, black-deckle-edged hardcover copy of Gideon the Ninth to someone who loved the book and will appreciate it properly."
"Complex, dark, powerful, evocative.Gideon The Ninth point of view is primarily from Gideon who was raised in the Ninth House. There's a total of Nine houses and Gideon wants to leave hers, of course she's tried 87 times and failed but finally gets a unique opportunity that allows her to leave into the First House. There's fighting, dark humor, profane language, sarcasm, family feuding, power struggles, and death. I enjoyed some of the unique twists of communication, such as ""Gideon get's assaulted with a series of increasingly aggressive notes."" No texting or technology in this book.I found the writing style, similar to Shakespeare in a way I was reading a text book, learning a new language. Now that's not to say this is similar or like Shakespeare at all, just the feeling I had taking in the words as I read along. Now, I love Shakespeare so that brings me to the plot. I didn't find the plot aggressively enticing me to keep reading. I kept reading only because of interest, and curiosity.Overall I enjoyed the descriptive details and Gideon's strength of never ending persistence. Definitely worth a read."
"I cannot say enough good things about this book and the audio version of it. The characters are fully fleshed out real people, who you feel you know after just a few paragraphs. The world building is fully realized, imaginative, and detailed without being tedious in backstory, and the plot moves along at such a nice pace. What I did not expect was the wit and humor- there were times as I listened or read (I got both audible and kindle versions) that I actually, physically laughed out loud, in all sincerity, which is rare for me. I look forward to many more tales from Ms Muir.What's more- the audible version of this book!!! Ms. Kirk brings the characters alive, - I can’t stop smiling at the layers she can inflect when Harrowhark calls Gideon “Griddle”- the derision, the taunting, and the underlying attachment are all implied with her read- you can almost hear the pout. Her read of the other characters is likewise full of depth. If you like audiobooks at all, or even if this is your first one- definitely pick it up.You won’t be disappointed, except when there is no more book to listen to."
"""Lesbian necromancers in space!"" the summary bellows. I really don't know why this book is pitched that way. I was worried I was headed for some kind of adolescent wish-fulfillment, but the string of awards from reputable sources like NPR, and the promise of a new system of mystical powers, pulled me in.I'm so glad I gave this book a chance; I can't wait to read the next installment. I don't like to give away plot in my reviews, so here are the reasons I liked Gideon the Ninth:- The decaying, swords-in-space, millennium-spanning-empire vibe is so perfectly handled. It doesn't feel cartoonish. It reminds me of Gene Wolf's Urth of the New Sun, which is one of my favorite books ever.- The fencing is so well described I felt like I was watching a film. Sometimes swordplay in books is very hard to follow, but this author writes captivating, well paced fights that go on for pages without becoming tedious.- The necromantic magic system introduced was very unique. I've devoured fantasy novels for decades, and frequently it feels like there is nothing new. This was easy to understand but fascinating.- Additionally, it would have been very easy for necromancy to devolve into schlock horror. The author masterfully creates an interesting system without relying on shock value and gore.- The writing, while third person, is written in very much in the style of the bitter, sarcastic protagonist, and it's hilarious. Again, credit to the author for creativity. A lesser writer in this situation would have fallen back of tired strings of profanity, but this author's insults and retorts and creative and entertaining.- Yes, there are lesbians, but they are people first, with fully developed personalities. Sexual orientation is one facet of the character, just as in real life. I was concerned from the summary that this would veer off into some ham-handed attempt at erotica, but it never does. A well-written sex scene has its place in good fiction, but in this particular story it would not have fit well.This is one of the best new series I have read in a long time!"
"Gideon finds herself trapped in the ninth house, she hates everything there is about it, specially the leader of the ninth house, Harrowhark; she tries to scape several times without luck but then Harrow offers her a chance to leave on one condition, she needs a cavalier due to extenuating circumstances so she needs her to step up, which leads us to where the fun really starts.Initially I read in the cover of the book “lesbian necromancers in space” as a highlighted phrase from a review and now that I finished it, I’m like “wow, that’s so inaccurate” this story is about much more than that, it’s about an entirely new fantasy world with it’s own intricacies which seems to be -to be honest- much complicated than what we know from the book, certainly Muir built this word with a lot more detail than what we get and I cannot wait to learn the rest of it; it’s also fun, super entertaining and pleasantly surprising.I’m only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I’m not used to the author’s writing style, I found myself confused at times and I feel like I needed a drawing of all the characters in order to keep up with what was happening.In conclusion, if you like fantasy, fights, magic or supernatural powers and mystery, don’t look further, this is the book you need."
"Not a fan of horror or gothic novels and my exposure to LGBQ+ literature is close to nil.  This book is the best novel of 2019 so far, and I have read... in excess of thirty?  Something like that.  Just a wonderfully, riotously fun adventure.  A bit Gormenghast, a bit of an isolated manor murder mystery, and an awful lot of joyous fun.  I did appreciate the low-key way the author showed familiarity with actual HEMA swordplay.  Not many do, and it's a kind of hidden grace note.  For those not familiar, in the last decade or so, there has been an upsurge in people studying and practicing fencing from actual medieval fencing manuals.  Sports fencing this ain't.  The author does not beat the reader over the head with it, but she does show that she really gets how these swords were supposed to be used.  Just an example- why rapiers are a weird choice of sidearm for unarmored combatants, especially ones who can expect to fight a lot of skeletons.So many gothic (and just goth) tropes get ticked off here, ranging from the Byronic to, necro-gods help us, sports goth.  Wonderfully, colorfully written, beautiful character development, and a plot that moves along with a sneaky speed, for such a long book.  Plus the hardback edition looks quite gorgeous and different.  I would cheerfully buy a print of the cover illustration if the publisher were to make one available.  Buy this book."
"Nine ruling houses with a pecking order - with the emperor's first house at the top and the hero and antihero at the bottom (heroine and antiheroine if you prefer). The scions of the houses and their cavaliers (mostly female - and in one case a set of twins) are brought the first house for an in-house quest for a holy grail that is of course theurgic power and eternal life - because the last generation of eternals have died off.  Of course it is not long before the nine little necromancers and their knights begin to fall – but without the mystery, suspense and tension of an Agatha Christie.In terms of the characters, the antiheroines must work together and protect each other although they have hated each other all their life, and have a ruler-slave relationship and worse: Gideon would like nothing better than to take Harrow's life; it has been her life long dream. Will she take any of the many opportunities? Or will she show the integrity that marks the true hero and is not shared by her antithetical charge?I got this book due to its Hugo nomination, but fail to understand how it could have been nominated - and I guess it also tells me something about the other awards the book has received.From the very start, I was put off by the awkward, out of place anachronistic language of the opening pages, the immature and unrealistic behaviour of the chief protagonist and her antagonists. Even the skull logos representing the nine houses seemed childish, especially as it seems only the ninth house applies the facepaint to suit. I left it to last of the Hugo-nominated novels and then came back to it to give it another chance.The idea behind the book (the trilogy) is not bad - and a well crafted story could have been really good. But the settings and sketchy and don't draw you into the the environment, the (around twenty) characters are so ill-defined that they are hard to keep track of, even if they have names (when given in full) that tell you (in latlish or english) what house they are from and whether they are necromancer or cavalier. And every time you start to get into the story, you are wrenched back to reality by an unfortunate turn of phrase or an inappropriate or anachronistic cliche or an uncharacteristic twist of the poorly characterized characters.The eponymous cavalier of the ninth house, Gideon, whose point of view we follow does not really ring true, does not portray consistently, does not win my heart - her counterpart in the sixth house, Camilla, comes closer and finding out more about her would be my only reason for continuing the book.But I gave up in the end about three-quarters of the way through, and was glad to have done so when I came here to write a review and found that it was only the first in a trilogy and that the antiheroine was the heroine of the sequel.Don't waste your time - it is hard to find one redeeming feature of this book. I tried, but could find no way of putting any positive spin on this - who would like this book? From the number of positive reviews and accolades, some do so I will let them speak for themselves."
"Gideon Nav, whose plan is and always has been to get away from the barren dead rock and dark, secretive House she grew up in, finds herself on a whole new adventure when the Emperor calls necromancers from all the Houses to the almost abandoned, ancient and rotting First House to try to win immortality. She’s not happy with the circumstance, but it may be the best way to win her freedom. All she has to do is accompany Harrowhark, the necromancer of the Ninth House, and make it through whatever the Emperor has in store for them – even if the challenges the First House hold for the gathered necromancers and their cavaliers is darker and more dangerous than anything any of them could have imagined.Gideon the Ninth is going to go down as one of my favorite reads of 2019. I loved so much about this book – the characters, the world-building, the dialogue, the descriptions. There were some bobbles here and there, but absolutely nothing could take away my sheer pleasure at reading this incredibly intense fantasy/science fiction adventure. Gideon herself stole the show, of course, and her show is simply magnificent. It’s hard to find a way to describe how much I enjoyed this book, but aspects like the relationship between Gideon and Harrow, Gideon’s growth as a person, the mystery that is explored in the story, the little romantic asides, the necromantic details, all of it was just engrossing. I would have read this story in one sitting if I’d had the time. To be fair, the tale is dark, and it’s the first in a trilogy, so if you’re one of those who gets annoyed waiting for future books to release you may want to wait a bit to pick up the story, but I would whole-heartedly, without hesitation, recommend this book to any fantasy/science fiction reader. It’s a fabulous story and I absolutely cannot wait to read Harrow the Ninth!"
"When I read print books, I have a process about how I decide whether or not to read a book. I read the first few pages and the last few pages. Had I done that with this, I would have put it back on the shelf. But I didn't read the end first. I heard people say good things about, and just started reading. I was slowly drawn in to the fascinating characters, the morbid world, Gideon's hilarious, dark, and somehow lovable voice and at some point, something clicked while I reading. I figured out how it was going to end, at least partially, and at that moment, I regretted my decision to pick up the book. I was past the point of no return. I grew to love the characters even more before I came to the point I was dreading and cried when I got there.And now I'm going to have to read book 2.Even though this had the kind of ending I would've rather avoided, I loved everything else about this book and want to read more about these characters."
"A lot of people say this is ""lesbian necromancers in space"" which is true, but kind of misleading. Yes, the eponymous Gideon is attracted to women, but this isn't a romance. So we get just enough of her attraction to women to get that part of her while she focuses on her non-lesbian adventure. That isn't a bad thing. It's basically a locked room mystery, which really takes off after the second half of the book when there's suddenly very little down time between adventures. But that first half does drag a bit.The book's biggest weakness, I think, is its worldbuilding. Even by the end, I'm not sure about the nature of the empire or the scope of the nine houses. For a good portion of the time, I almost got the sense that the author didn't think those things were important. But they kind of are.You will want to bookmark the section in the beginning that lists all of the characters. They're kind of thrown at you in the narrative and it's not clear who is important until people start dying and you've already forgotten their names."
"Do you like goth lesbian necromancers solving locked-room murder mysteries in space? Great! Gideon the Ninth is the book for you. Gideon Nav is an orphan in the death-worshipping Ninth House, and her nemesis is the Reverend Daughter of the Ninth House, the skilled necromancer Harrowhark Nonagesimus. But when the Emperor issues an invitation for the heirs of all the houses to come prove their worth and become Lyctors of the realm, Gideon—one of the few young and strong people left in the Ninth House—ends up having to serve as Harrow’s cavalier. This book has the trappings of a fantasy novel, but it’s also really funny and crass. And then, just when you think you’re in for a rollicking good time, it punches you in the stomach with sorrow. I adored it. Already put the second book in the trilogy on hold at the library.Please note that I originally published this review in my blog."
"Gideon and Harrow have been rivals since childhood. Going neck to neck and fighting whenever the opportunity presented itself. But now as Harrow is called to take one of the ultimate tests of necromancy, she needs Gideon’s sword arm to watch her back. Promised with her freedom if Harrow succeeds, Gideon agrees to take up her sword. But as they begin to unravel the mysteries of the Lyctors, necromancers who have gone beyond a simple raising of bones and spirit, they will find that not everything is as it seems. While death is nothing new to necromancers, are they willing to make the necessary sacrifices?Spaceships and necromancy are two elements I never thought I would see combined in a story. They just shouldn’t work together. Well, Gideon the Ninth smashed that thought. Not only is there a healthy dose of dark magic and battle, but there is also betrayal, mystery, and plenty of death to go around. The perfect mix to keep me reading!Gideon walks the fine line between friend and foe, love and hate between the characters she meets. This atmosphere creates an abundance of conflict and action. Reading this novel is like experiencing a twisted and dark version of Clue. People are dying, and fingers are being pointed in all directions. But of course, dying is the art of the necromancers, yet even they are left to scramble to put the pieces back together. Sometimes quite literally.I do admit there were certain areas where the necromancers would start talking and my mind would fog over. I didn’t understand the different types or the way it worked, but the main character Gideon didn’t either. I want to think this was done on purpose, but I also wanted to understand what was going on. I had to reference the various houses and their powers multiple times to try and grasp what each one was doing. This is definitely a book for readers who do not mind hitting the ground running and trying to absorb as much information as possible to work out their own understanding.Given the description of the book, I did expect more dark humor. Gideon carried the humor with her sarcastic remarks, but it wasn’t enough to lighten the mood. Do not approach this book thinking it will be light reading. This is a book steeped in taboo and dealing with the darker parts of humanity. Then again, with necromancers involved, it is assumed that the content will be rather macabre. Dark fantasy to the core, this is a great read. I cannot wait for the next book to be released!"
"Gideon The Ninth is among the best books I've ever read. Yes, it really is that good. I'll go as far as to say it's revelatory.I tend to stay far away from anything resembling horror. While it was out of my comfort zone (I'm generally anti-gore, animated skeletons, and blood sweat), the premise had me all kinds of intrigued so I decided to give it a go. It was bloody and bone-laden and it freaked me out in places but I could not get enough of the story. I really, truly loved it. If you're like me and you tend to stay away from scary things, you’ll probably be okay. The perfect comedic timing breaks up some of the scarier elements. It really helped to have some levity. And the snark and clever sense of humor really doesn’t quit throughout the story. I laughed hard and often!This was described to me as “lesbian necromancers in space” and it’s kind of true and kind of not. It is brilliantly queer but it's not a romance, nor is there an overt love story. Gideon isn’t a necromancer; she’s a cavalier. Harrowhawk is the necromancer. They loathe one another and have fought each other fiercely for years. But now they have to somewhat work together as the Ninth House team. The way they spar, either verbally or physically, was breathtaking. Muir really plays with the thin line between love and hate and I was never entirely sure what they thought or felt about one another. I couldn’t get enough of it!Regardless, they are both stunning characters in their own right, as is the supporting cast. There are a ton of side characters and it can be hard to keep them all straight. While there’s so much I could say about them, it’s best for you to learn about them as you read. I do not want to spoil one part of this story. The plot whipped forward at an intense and fast pace and the world-building was dense with information. There’s not much time to figure out who’s who or whether this thread means something because we’re already coming around the bend of the next big action. But my questions were eventually answered and answered well, even while pointing toward larger possibilities for the series as a whole. I’ve never read anything like this before and I’m in awe of what Muir set in motion.I cannot even begin to imagine where the next book will go because this one was such a wild ride. So many twists and turns I didn't see coming. Muir made bold choices and they paid off. THAT ENDING. I still haven’t recovered and I can’t stop talking about it. What a marvel of a book!CW: fatal blood disorder, past mass murder of children, human sacrifice, murder, violence, gore, grief, death of a loved one, jokes about and discussion of suicide"
"Gideon Nav has spent her life as the servant of the cult of death known as the Ninth House, locked in battle with the daughter of that house. Harrowhark. Despised, outcast, her entire existence is an affront to the Ninth. When circumstances wind her up in a complicated plot to elevate Harrow to God's side as one of his personal necromancers, Gideon finds herself in the awkward position as Harrow's protector.In the depths of a laboratory filled with horror, Gideon learns the truth about everything.This book marched forward inexorably, full of violence and death but also full of strength and, ultimately, hope. Muir's Gideon is a vulgar, straight-talking jerk and I loved her with all my heart. She and Harrow's story unfolds in multiple surprising labyrinthine twists and turn for a dark, death-filled story that was a damn good read.I can't wait for Harrow the Ninth to come out next summer."
"I'm really surprised to find out this is her first novel, it is exceptional and a very unique and fresh take on both Necromancers and the buddy adventure.  Though I would not call it YA, it is definitely very accessible for teens as well as adults.The voice of the book immediately grabbed me and held me til the end, that has only happened a few times for me that last author that did that for me was Patrick Rothfuss and I found Gideon to be just as charming and captivating as Name of the Wind and Wise Man's Fear.The banter and combative relationship between Gideon and Harrow is real and genuine, as is how that relationship evolves throughout the book to a very satisfying and believable conclusion.Have also turned both my daughters on to the series (22 and 24) looking forward to seeing if they enjoy them as much as I did."
"Let's start with the good. The characters and magic are great. The plot is fun.The bad, the first third of the book could of sped up a little. We spend a lot of time getting to the planet where the story takes place. This time is basically spent reminding you over and over of Gideon's relationship with Harrow. A thing which they will do constantly any time they get a chance for the rest of the book anyway so spending 1/3 of the page count souly on it seems pointless.The rest of the book is pretty good with a large cast of interesting characters which are clearly the focus. This book is more a drama than an action or magic piece and that is fine. The only shame is that many of those other elements would be really interesting if they got a little more focus. The exam room concept for example could have been explored more but that's a tiny grip. Overall this is a fun book to spend a weekend on."
I really enjoyed this book. I loved the originality of it.I will admit at times I was confused about what was going on. Sometimes I had to go back to reread a passage or paragraph to see if I overlooked something. Other than that it’s a really good book.Gideon was such a fun character to read. Between her witty banter and the need to be free and loved. I couldn’t get enough of her. She made this story and her counterparts made it even better.I have to say I never read a book about characters who were bone and those of flesh and bone. That sounds funny doesn’t it since we’re all made of bones and flesh? Lol  The fighting of skeletons had my imagination going wild especially with Gideon narrating it. I haven’t laughed so much during a book for a few months. It was refreshing. I can’t wait to read Harrow the Ninth!
"Gideon the Ninth, the first book in the Locked Tomb Trilogy, has a lot going for it, but some challenges as well. The title character, Gideon is a fearless swordswoman, probably the best one her home planet of Drearburh has ever seen. However, she's had enough of a life of servitude and has made plans to escape Drearburh. Unfortunately they're are foiled by her nemesis, Necromancer Harrowhark Nonagesimus, and she's forced to serve as Harrowhark's Cavilier and accompany her offworld where they will compete against 7 other Necromancer/Cavilier pairs in the hopes of attaining immortality--and all the power that goes with it.There's a lot to like here: interesting characters, great worldbuilding, and a lot of action sequences which are well described without being overblown. The story is generally well paced, although a few sections drag.What doesn't work as well is that there are 18 characters to keep track of and each has two names, which the author uses interchangeably. Keeping track of them might be easier in the print edition, but as an audio book this was kind of a nightmare. I ended up getting a character list off the web and making myself a cheat sheet until I was familiar enough with everyone not to need it. This really detracts from getting oriented and enjoying the beginning of the book.Many of the characters here are also teens. Gideon is 17 and some of the other characters are younger. And while there are also some adult teams as well, this creates a bit of an uneven mix. Gideon's vocabulary seems to be at times limited to F-bombs, which might offend some readers.All in all, though, it's a fun read with some twists I didn't see coming.Overall, the narrator is quite expressive and this helped to separate the different characters."
"This book is cracked. Completely crazy, full of tough characters and blood and bones regenerating and locked room puzzles and blood and skin shields and horrific tragedy.The blurb  does not do it justice. Its actually a bit misleading (I'm looking at you ""lesbian necromancers"") because Gideon the Ninth immerses you instantly in a universe where there are nine houses of different specialty necromancers, dry-as-bones humor, confusing naming and amidst the hubbub and mess of this is Gideon herself: a two-handed longsword warrior who hates the bone necromancer, Harrow, who leads her house and is desperate to get off world.Harrow more or less forces her to go to another planet as her 'cavalier' or special warrior to the main necromancer of a house. The Emperor has called all the main necromancers and their cavaliers to a rotting mansion and given them the task of becoming an immortal saint-- but not told them how (enter a whole locked room mystery with murders, monsters, and puzzles based on manipulation of living and the dead).Gideon is awesome. She's unapologetically strong, mouthy, and draws a weapon at the slightest hint of danger. And the strength of this book (if you can get through the slow opening and confusing plethora of names, rooms, and cavaliers) is on her emotional attachments to the other characters. (also the strength is just the straight up imaginative whackiness and horror of the various monsters and magicks)But the beginning of this book (until Gideon and Harrow make it to the mansion of death) is a slow slog, I won't lie. The first part of the book I wondered why this book was getting all the hype. If you make it through the first part, then you have nine pairs of necromancer-cavaliers to keep straight, as well as the author's tendency to just attribute everything to ""she said"" when there's like a dozen female characters in the room and for characters to change names three or four times within a page (like one of the necromancers can be called ""Pal"" or ""Palademus"" or ""the warden"" or ""Sextus"" etc.) which makes it even MORE confusing. I constantly had to reread paragraphs to figure out who was saying what about whom. I wish Muir's editor had been a bit more strict with her about how many names each characters was allowed.But dang if this book doesn't rival Gormenghast for gothic horror whilst bringing on some nice, believable hand to hand combat, and really cool characters.So if your fantasy or horror palate is jaded, this will be a lovely amuse bouche to keep your taste for the genres-- it's definitely not like anything I've read in the past decade, but not recommended for the unwary or those who faint at the sight of blood. There's lots of blood and bones and skin blistering and wounds and slime and bone dust. And you definitely can't be a weak-willed reader running away at the slightest hint of confusing naming. It's worth hanging on, though for the horrific revelations of the last third of the book.You'll be devastated by the ending, but just as certain to read the next in the series as i am. Just don't be devastated by the lack of actual necromantic lesbians-- it's more people having crushes on people than actual relationships-- and the main emotional focus is the honor/love/hate/duty relationships between Cavalier and Necromancer."
"HOLY GOSH THIS BOOK WAS SO GOOD. Charles Stross's blurb is fun (Skeletons!), but it makes the book sound gimmickier than it is. Going in I was like ""this sounds like it could be interesting, I'll give it a shot."" Going out I was like ""WHEN CAN I PRE-ORDER THE SEQUEL, IS IT NOW, I'M PRE-ORDERING IT RIGHT NOW THEN"".The one thing I'll say is that the tone... evolves, during the course of the book. You've got to read to at least the start of Act III to get a feel of what the book really is. And even then, you may very well not see the end coming in the slightest. I certainly didn't. I would say more stuff about what I loved but I can't decide what counts as spoilers, and this book is definitely better without spoilers in my opinion.Honestly. Why are you even still looking at this when you could be buying this book. GO. BUY IT NOW."
"Absolutely loved it. It's just as weird, dark, fun and totally engrossing as all the hype. In fact, I could tell only two chapters in that I wanted to drag it out to make it last longer. I could have swallowed it whole in a few days of reading, but instead I only let myself read one or two chapters at a time. I haven't done this -- making a book into a treat; a thing I only get to read as a reward for doing crap I don't want to do --since I was a teenager and it made it SO MUCH FUN.Gideon is an epic character. A real dirtbag with a smart-ass mouth, but she's packed solid with inner strength, physical power, wit and charisma. At one point when anxiety is high and other necromancers are planning their next move as danger lurks everywhere, Gideon quips that another character has ""Sex"" and ""Pal"" in his name. A comment that's met with silence. Loved that stupid humor breaking up the tension SO MUCH.Harrowhark, a tiny master necromancer with a rock-hard, cold demeanor ended up leaving me in tears. I won't spoiler the ending but the thing that struck me was how much I disliked her (OK, 'hated the b*tch') in the beginning, but as little chips of her personality flew out at me and grew into fully-formed characterizations like knucklebones-into-skeleton constructs... I fell for her big time. I think the very unique and haunting chemistry between Harrow and Gideon isn't going to leave me any time soon.The one issue I ran into was remembering who was part of of which House, so about a third of the way through the novel I made an index card cheatsheet bookmark to keep track. So if you read it, be prepared that there are a lot of characters to keep track of, and they often have subtitles like Warden or something... so don't lose hope if you get a little lost. Just steal my trick. Heh.I totally get that this is NOT a book for everyone. It's set in a dark, very foreign, gothic-space setting and lots of characters are killed. Often brutally. The world-building takes lots of suspension of disbelief and as I mentioned above, there are lots of Houses to keep track of... plus, not EVERY mystery is explained away and there are still lots of questions burning in my brain.But the growing friendship-turned-budding-relationship between the two primary characters was so well-done and I admired the author's ability to take her sweet time drawing them closer. Especially since they started off totally HATING one another's guts. All their lives they hated one another. Until... they needed one another, both for the tasks in Canaan House, and to have a soulful connection to another person. And then... Well... My heart can't take it, and I just suggest you read it at this point. I can't say anything else because spoilers.As an author, I am so psyched I read this book. It inspires me to go all the way out there as far as I want to with telling my stories! I mean, if you want to use swear words because the character would use them, USE THEM. If you want to have your character who's currently in some far, distant future on some other world in possibly another galaxy find and wear a pair of aviator sunglasses with her cloak and skull face paint, HAVE HER DO IT. Who cares?! Have ALL THE FUN.I could go on and on, but I won't. Just read it.***""We do bones, motherf*cker."""
"'Gideon the Ninth' is 400 pages of enemies-to-lovers, wrapped up in a plot about necromancers, space empires, and trials of occult science; I was up until 3am last night finishing it because I didn't want to stop reading. Gideon is sarcastic and great and gay, constantly struck by the beauty of the other necromancers, while never quite being able to escape her obsession with the lady she serves and has been mortal enemies with since childhood. There's mysteries (murder and otherwise), confessions, long buried secrets, and fast-paced action that kept me wanting to see what was coming next; it's also creepy without being scary, which was very good thing given my late-night reading. I was delighted to discover after the final climax that we can look forward to a sequel, and now I'm going to have to spend some time pushing this book on everyone I know. :)"
"I found the dialogue and prose fairly awkward -- the main character is meant to be ""sassy,"" but their lines fell flat for me. Most of the appeal others have found seems to be in Gideon's personality and wit, so I would guess you could probably just get the sample and have a good idea of whether you'd enjoy the rest of the book or not. If you don't like it right away, it seems unlikely that you'll like it any more later.That said, the overall premise is interesting. Necromancers in space! However, very little attention is paid to world building of the ""how"" and ""why"" and ""what even happened here?"" variety, so that angle never really goes anywhere except as a backdrop. All in all, not my cup of tea, but I'm glad others seem to have enjoyed it."
"This is my first experience with this author and the reviews that I read made this book sound like something I would really enjoy.  And I did, sort of.  It was very well written, had no editing errors, and a plot that finally got around to sort of being explained about halfway through.  I am an avid sci-fi, fantasy, alternate universe, etc. reader.  But this setting and customs really confused me.  This is probably my fault.  I just could not quite figure out who was what, who was doing what to whom, that the laws/rules were, etc.  So many characters, referred to as numbers, names, nicknames, etc., added to my confusion.  This is a confusing time, and I think it just overflowed my brain!  I may get back to it.  If you enjoy REALLY DIFFERENT settings, this is for you."
"Ahhhh this book is just so epically, spectacularly FUN. I cannot wait for Book 2!I knew this book would be very goth, and I knew it would be horror-inflected, and neither of those things usually appeal to me. But I wasn't expecting just how hilarious it would be, or how hard I would fall for so very many of the characters in this vivid world. It moves at a recklessly joyous pace, full of skeletons and swordfighting (THE BEST swordfighting!) and banter and a haunted house, with SO MUCH soul-mate energy (despite the lack of an out-and-out romance plot), and I loved every single ferocious moment of it.In other worlds: if you're an adult who loves swordfighting and humor and great characters and vivid, fabulous worldbuilding, grab it NOW, whether or not it sounds like your kind of thing. I loved it!"
"This is a work of magnificent beauty, if necromancy, decaying civilizations/technology, hate-filled lesbians, innumerable skeletons, and foul-mouthed sworn knights are beautiful, which they very much are in the deft hands of Tamsyn Muir. I haven't read a more surprising book in a very long time. It's laugh-out-loud funny on almost every page, tear-jerkingly moving on many occasions, and so utterly kickass that I actually shouted out in sheer joy once or twice. I could not predict this book despite it's absolutely perfect story arc, and that plus the vivid characters, intricate worldbuilding, and explosive plot make it *chef's kiss*. What else can I say? Did I mention how incredibly funny it is? How surprisingly often it made me cry? How simply damned *cool* it is? Long story short, this is my new favorite book and Gideon is my all-time favorite character. You have to read this, and it is AGONY that I have to wait another year for the sequel. I'll just be ossifying over here."
"This was definitely a weird book for me. I didn’t even want to read it at first. I’d heard about Harrow the Ninth (the sequel) using second-person narration and I wanted to check that out. Only problem was I needed to read the first installment first. In my reviews I try to stick to only one negative and focus on the positives, however, a disclaimer must be made here.Gideon is a polarizing protagonist. She is irreverent, swears constantly, and doesn’t take much seriously. I wanted to DNF this book many times in the first few chapters because I just couldn’t stand her. For some reason this type of personality doesn’t click with me. I didn’t enjoy Deadpool at all, I just found him annoying and edgy for the sake of being edgy. Plus, this world takes place in the far future, possibly ten thousand years from now. Almost every character talks in a somewhat archaic, stilted style, but Gideon goes around saying “that’s what she said” like she was plucked from the 21st century.Your love of this story will strongly hinge upon your love of Gideon. If your love of her personality can allow you to suspend your disbelief that a character like her could even exist, then I think you will have the time of your life with this story.Positives:-I loved Harrow. Pretty much from the first moment she was on the page, I was fascinated by her. As a Sailor Moon, Evangelion, and She-ra fan, I’m very familiar with the Tsundere trope, and I knew Harrow would eventually fit this mold by the time the story ended. However, Muir isn’t lazy with Harrow. Over and over Muir shows signs of Harrow’s vulnerability and humanity. She is not an easy character to like, but I found myself begging to see more cracks in her tough, abrasive façade. I can’t wait to read the sequel.-Muir is a wordsmith. This might only appeal to fellow writers, but you cannot deny that she is able to wield an extensive vocabulary and employ it in unusual ways. That doesn’t mean her description and worldbuilding is always easy to follow. And sometimes her sentences can be overwritten and hard to understand. But wow, she definitely knows how to write and there are a lot of brilliant passages here.-I didn’t like Gideon, but I cannot deny that this story has a unique voice. Gideon’s voice is slathered (I think Gideon would appreciate that verb) all over every single page. This is not some generic sci-fi adventure told from a stoic protagonist. Gideon, for better or worse, is not a boring narrator. And there were even times when I genuinely laughed out loud.-Muir’s world and her magic system are so expansive and deep. They literally stretch across the galaxy. I don’t think Muir ever fully scratched the surface of the world she presented, but she gave enough of a glimpse that I’m interested to see more. I want to see all of the different worlds and the different types of necromancy in more depth.-I’m not sure I fully bought all the backstory and motivations of Gideon and Harrow. But their relationship, a kind of Master/Slave – Master/Servant – Enemies to Friends(lovers?) dynamic was engrossing all the way to the final pages.Negative:-I was going to give this book 3 stars, but I had to downgrade it to 2. It’s not because of Gideon. She mellowed out a lot in the latter half of the novel. The reason why I ultimately didn’t like this novel is because this is not Gideon’s story. Gideon is the narrator, we follow her throughout the story, we are told to sympathize and empathize with her plight, and I did. But this is Harrow’s story. Harrow is the character that has the agency to move the plot. Harrow is the character that is in direct competition with the other necromancers. Harrow is the detective. Harrow is the only person who can defeat the villain. Harrow is the character the story ends with.I get why Gideon was the narrator. Harrow’s treatment of Gideon would be very hard to stomach if she were the protagonist. It’s easier to sympathize with Gideon when we see her as a victim of Harrow’s abuse. And Gideon does make a choice that helps Harrow to overcome the villain and save the day. But too many times we are forced to focus on Gideon wandering around and looking for the plot while Harrow is living the real plot. At one point in the story, Gideon abruptly runs away from Harrow just so that she can be in a position to see the reveal of the big bad. It’s convoluted because Gideon is the Samwise to Harrow’s Frodo.I ended this book still excited to read the sequel, but also disappointed because I felt robbed. This was Harrow’s story and I barely got to see it."
"This reminded me the tiniest bit of Six Wakes by Mur Lafferty but, like, with a bunch of necromancers and cavaliers on a decaying and weird haunted laboratory island rather than with clones on a spaceship. Anyway, it's great and funny and SO GORY and gross and extremely emotionally compromising. I am bereft that it's over. I can't believe the next book doesn't come out until summer. Waiting is terrible.If you like stories where disparate people get thrown together and then bad things happen to some of them and the rest of them try to figure out what's going on while maybe making friends and losing friends along the way you should read this. Or if you just want to read about awesome lesbians fighting bad things with swords and the risen dead. Both are good."
"I usually don’t write reviews, especially not after just downloading the kindle sample... but seeing all the glowing reviews on this, I just had to try and add some balance.This is not good sci fi or fantasy. This is not good writing , period. I’m supposed to believe this is in a far away galaxy? In a society of necromancers? Within the first few pages we have references to chocolates on hotel pillows and porn mag titles like “Titties of the Ninth”. And these aren’t anachronisms that serve a purpose.. it’s just lazy, unimaginative writing.I haven’t read a novel this well reviewed and this poorly written in a long time. I can only imagine that it required some enormous marketing campaign spend to get all the attention it did. Someone wants this optioned off to Netflix or the CW. I can see the dollar bills in some executives eyes “lesbian necromancers in space, we’ll make a killing!”And narrating everything... telling versus showing... there’s no imagination. There’s no creation of a world or setting that the reader can be drawn to. Not to mention the lack of sophistication or depth to any of the characters. I get that the main character is supposed to be young... but it’s like the worst set of steroetypes just all jumbled together. It’s clearly being forced to be edgy. Let’s have skulls, and “dark” imagery. “It’s sooo edgy!!”The author comes across as someone who simply hasnt experienced life, and instead has gorged on reality TV and teen soaps as a substitute for living.I can’t blame her for making some dime off this, because clearly there’s an appetite for this stuff... it’s just a shame reviewers are making this out to be something it clearly isn’t.If you want an annoying teen character, that actually has depth.. a world and setting that takes your mind to new places... a plot that keeps you on edge... characters that you’ll remember for a lifetime... and most importantly, a book that actually explores human nature but is also a blast to read... try Dune instead."
"Primarily a well-written ""spooky old house"" murder mystery, set in a grimdark far future. Overlaid on top of this is a video gamey Challenge, reminiscent of the game 999. And overlaid on top of that, is a lot of social drama.Jarringly, The main character speaks entirely in ""your mom"" jokes and modern culture references, which are fun but very out of place with the rest of the setting, And feel more than anything like an RPG character whose player Isn't taking the game seriously.Further complicating the story, every one of the 16 characters has at least 4 different names, And many of their names are similar to other characters names. In with the glossary at the end of the book Is a section of spoiler-free, in-universe profiles of all of the main characters, which I recommend reading as soon as they arrive at the spooky old house.Overall entertaining and well written, and a fun fluffy light read."
"I really had a fun time with this book, which may seem kinda strange when you figure it's about murders, creepy constructs, necromancers and skeletons. The characters interaction and the mystery of the murders, made it all worthwhile when you're plunged into a huge jigsaw puzzle of ""What's the hecks going on?"" At least that was the feeling I had when all these pairs of representatives get dropped inside a seemingly haunted mansion in a game of one-upmanship. Some act like they know exactly what to do, while others like me find themselves trapped in a riddle of locked doors, dead bodies and dubious characters. That synopsis, along with the combination of Gideon and Harrow's quirky sense of humor made this a very entertaining read.Moira Quirk does a fine job with the delivery and majority of the voices. She did have to grow on me a bit, but that was a short process."
"I loved it. One of my favorite books I've read lately. Gideon's voice is vivid, unmistakable, hilarous, and incongruous all at once. The author does a great job of balancing humor and tension. I laughed out loud, but also found myself rooting for the main characters, and scared for them. In fact the book kept me up a couple of nights from the horror elements. Yes, I am a wuss. It's not nearly as pulpy as the ""lesbian necromancers in space"" tagline makes it sound, but it is a little bit. Mostly it's just a vividly imagined, engaging book.Some of it didn't make a lot of sense. There's no explanation for why Gideon talks the way she does, some of the writer's description is more creative than logical, and I'm still not sure how the Ninth House subsists on leeks. But the good stuff more than made up for all that, and on the whole the language is beautiful.This book is so gay, and I really appreciate that. I mean, really gay, by which I mean lesbian. No straight person could write like this. The flirting is exquisite and the double entendres are exquisitely stupid. It made my week."
"Give this book a try. It deserves, at the very least, a hard try from you.Find whatever captivates you to this book from one of these many reviews and use it to push through a good portion. I did and I’m so thankful even if what initially drew me to buy it wasn’t 100% accurate. This book can also be very funny at times.Unlike the other lengthy, positive reviews I’ve read about this book, I’m not at a loss of words. I can, however, validate the feeling of affection and satisfaction that others have confessed about Gideon the Ninth.I haven’t had the time to engross myself in a book for over three years and this book was my attempt at a comeback. Perhaps this played a role in my captivation by the first half of the book that lots of reviews have claimed to be hard to read; I had little to no expectations except to read a romance and I’m thrilled to be slightly disappointed. I’ll do my best to be quick because many other reviews have expressed my admiration for the book in perfect ways.Muir created a world with substance and meaning. The plot is stimulating. For those that are okay with not understanding everything at first, you should be fine. If you aren’t, make sure to do some light research on parts you don’t understand the second you get confused and overwhelmed because you’ll enjoy this story a lot more, as I did.Every character has purpose. The type of plot switches a couple of times, which I was delighted by because of the numerous small plot twists. What drew me to this book was the hope of a rare, beautifully crafted lesbian romance with some action and while that isn’t exactly what this book is, this description is not a lie and if it’s enough to get you to buy this novel and burry your nose in it, by all means, keep hoping for that because this story is most definitely worth the try.I sincerely hope you read this book. I spent ten minutes rereading a page at around 90% because I was terrified of finishing it and having to face the 6 month wait time until the release of the sequel. I then spent another 2 hours researching books and combing through reviews and recommendation lists just to find something that can survive under the expectations I now hold for anything I read after this book.Tamsyn Muir, I hope you never stop writing."
"I can honestly say, I have never read anything quite like this before. Gideon the Ninth is a dark and twisted tale of necromancers and cavaliers in a fight to become immortal and all-powerful.There are nine houses in total, and each one puts forth their best necromancer and cavalier to duel. Harrowhark is the necromancer for the ninth house, and though she lacks the formal training, Gideon comes as her cavalier.These two have a love hate relationship stemming from childhood, and they both find it hard to trust the other. But when people start dying, and the rules go out the window, they turn to each other.So many twists and turns and things I didn’t expect in this book. It kept me eager to read on. Gideon is such a straight up person who leans towards humour a lot, while Harrow is more broody and less of a talker.At times I struggled to follow what was going on, and had to really concentrate - outside distractions had to be minimised! But all in all, I really enjoyed this twisted tale of darkness."
Could someone explain the importance of having Lesbian necromancers? Is this important to the story? Or is this a ploy to get more readership? I never see other novels that go out of the way to promote straight characters. Not sure why it would matter. Again if I’m missing something I’d love to be enlightened.
"I'll be honest, I didn't pick up this book because of the lesbian necromancers, but I did keep an eye out for them the entire time.  The only unambiguously lesbian character in the book is not a necromancer (in fact, in some ways she's the opposite of a necromancer), and while there's some hinting about a couple necromancers, we ultimately don't see anything.And that's good, honestly: because this is not a book about sex or romance.  This is definitely a book about relationships and love, but it's about the relationships and love between friends, and especially between family.The book starts up very light-hearted but gets gradually more serious as things progress, eventually turning into something of a mystery story.  Not all of the characters are immediately likable, but they're all very human, and you understand why all of them do the things that they do - even the terrible things.Why didn't I give this 5 stars?  I found Gideon's dialogue a little immersion-breaking.  Yes, I get that she's irreverent and it helps emphasize a class divide, but it still feels out of place.  That, and another thing that I can't talk about because it's major spoilers for the end of the book, bothered me enough to knock off a star.But all in all, a book I would recommend to almost anyone.  I'm eagerly awaiting the sequel, even though it'll necessarily be completely different."
"✨4/5✨I feel absolutely heartbroken yet hopeful.In the beginning you see Dracula as someone who loves Constanta to no end and just wants the “best” for her. Who shuts her in for “protection”. The abuse that was in this book was so perfectly written and drawn out. I loved Dracula all the way until the end, even when I shouldn’t have. The control he had was sick, the manipulation was sick, everything about him was terrible. And I KNEW this. I was so angry with him and with Constanta/Magdalena for not standing up for themselves. But, when those little loving and happy moments he shared with Constanta, Magdalena, and Alexi came, he sucked you right back in on his side. While reading I thought, “He still loves them, he just shows it in terrible ways at times. He’s doing this all because he loves them.” But that’s it isn’t it? Maybe it’s because I can relate to the abuse from past experiences, but the author was able to transport your mind into this relationship the characters had in such a perfect way. Where I was even making excuses for Dracula’s behavior during the book, and I was SAD at the end (Ew, right?). Hopeful, of course, but just emotionally drained and sad.The whole book to me was just heartbreaking and absolutely beautiful at the same time. It had everything.(((((((SPOILER BELOW)))))))) I think what makes it so beautiful at the end is the bravery of the characters. They didn’t just let the abuse go on even longer, and that’s the hardest thing they could have done. The hardest and bravest thing for anyone to do in that situation really; What was best for them. Whether it be leaving (...or slaying Dracula), they chose happiness and freedom.🦇⚔️🦇⚔️🦇"
"""I loved you too much, my lord. I craved you like maidens crave the grave, the way Death burns for human touch: inconsolably, unrelentingly, aching for annihilation in your kiss. I had no practice saying no to you.""Constanta was found broken and bleeding and was resurrected by Dracula. We follow Constanta over hundreds of years as Dracula's bride. They travel as companions and as lovers. This book highlights the toxicity of their relationship and the codependency. Constanta does not know how to exist without him.This book follows several cycles of abuse as Dracula takes on more companions and as they travel through Europe. We see a love the devours and then a love that is mercilessly controlling where boundaries do not exist. This book is different in that it highlights abusive relationships, but it does not glorify them. It shows the cycles of each of his companions over the course of their relationship.There is some female/female relations in here, but that was only part of the book. It had a mixture of both female/female relationships, male/female relationships and a male/male relationship was hinted at.This was written really well in a lyrical and poetic way. It felt like it had the classiness of Dracula by Bram Stoker, but with a more explicit and updated feel. This book was so well done and I loved it."
"The premise of this book was great. Who wouldn't want to know the history of Dracula's brides? Unfortunately, it didn't serve to its fullest potential. The characters are not as well defined as I would have liked as a reader. What motivated them? What was their backstory? The vampires in this story lived with each other for hundreds of years. There would be very little mystery between all of them. The central character would know why Dracula acted the way he did within two hundred years.I also wanted Dracula to be more of a villain. He was in this book, but in the original Bram Stoker novel, he was extremely evil. Speaking of the original story, the events that took place were mentioned in passing.The writing was good (great voice), the pacing was excellent. I just needed more to the story. It seemed too mild."
"Saint has truly written a masterpiece filled with vivid emotion and elegant prose. A Dowry of Blood is such a rich and incredible, gothic story of love and how those who love us most can be the very monsters we fear. Not only that, but it shows us the way love and loneliness can make us into such things, wrapped in delicate fashions and pretty promises.Saint explores the the dark truths of tumultuous and dangerous love, the ugly of it, and ultimately shows the reader how it is possible to heal and to hope and to forgive one's self.A delicious 5 star review for the brides, for Saint, and for everyone who needed this story most. ❤"
"I have to say, I have never read a novel quite like this. This is the best vampire story I have ever read, and I have read most of them. Seamlessly written, sensual, fascinating. I was drawn in from the first word til the last, I literally couldnt put it down. How does that go...I laughed, I cried, I was swept away on a wave of pure ambiance lol. But seriously, if you love a great story well told, get this book. It's one of those novellas that you feel will stay with you forever, because experiencing it has changed you--it is that good. This book is pure poetry."
"""How can I blame you for wanting her, my lord, when I wanted her so badly myself?""This book is for you if... you love paranormal romance and lyrical writing.I was pleasantly surprised by A Dowry of Blood, I'm not usually one for paranormal romance so this was really good for my standards of paranormal romance. But even still I was pretty bored though most of the book, there were beautiful moments that I loved but overall I was just going though the book waiting for more moments that I enjoyed.I did find the way the relationship was written very interesting, it was definitely an abusive relationship, and I could see where if you are affected by those types of relationships I would say don't read this. The writing type of S.T. Gibson was really what pulled me into the book and the reason I finished it, the lyrical style was just perfect for this type of book and I'm definitely interested in reading more.I don't have much to say on this book, I didn't connect to any of the characters except maybe Alexi but he was brought in so close to the ending. I really was surprised by this and I think that if this book is something you think you'll like, definitely pick it up for a read.CAWPILE Rating: 6.86/10Stars: 3/5 StarsI liked this more than I expected"
"I’ve had my eye on this book for a while finally took the plunge to read it. I finished it in one sitting and by the end, I felt as if I’d lived an entire life in a matter of hours. This book is so poetic and tragically beautiful. You feel every emotion as you follow Constanta’s narration of her life alongside Dracula, Magdalena and Alexi. You hurt for her, hope for her, and cheer for her in the end, watching her grow through centuries of love, obsession, loss and victory. This has taken its place as one of my absolute favorites and I know I’ll be thinking of it years from now. Now that I’ve finished it, my heart feels so heavy, as if I’ve lived through all that she’s been through. 10/10 I adored this book."
"A gorgeously written vampire story that examines love, violence, power, belonging, and what we do (or don't) owe to the ones who love us. Also, very queer! Definitely a top read for me this year!"
"This is beautifully written. So emotional. I loved the narrator. Everything she said was simultaneously matter of fact and poetic. Loved the story, which is inspired so I suppose not original, but the author's take is quite lovely. Excellent quick read."
"As a survivor of Narcisstic Abuse, and a lover of poetry... this book blew me away. I felt so attached to the characters within and their hardship in dealing with their absuer. This book will always hold a special place in my heart ❤Thank you."
"I absolutely loved this. Equal parts horror and erotica, it weaves the complications of loving an awful man with the love and strength you find outside of him."
"I absolutely love vampire stories, so when this came up on my radar I was excited to pick it up and give it a shot. I wasn't disappointed with my choice. I finished this in one afternoon, but it left me breathless with its impactful emotion and lyrical writing. Highly recommend this to anyone who is even a little bit curious about Dracula's brides, like intricate emotions and relationships, or simply want to see justice be delivered."
This is the most beautifully written book I’ve ever read! Gibsons writing is so poetic and lyrical. It’s such a short read but I can see this becoming a classic. This is a queer Dracula retelling told by one of his brides. I can’t wait to read this over and over again for spooky season. I have to own all of Saint Gibsons work!
"Dark and entertaining read. A great example of a good story written in the 2nd person use of ""you"" which I think is hard to do."
"One of my favorite books of all time. Thank you for the representation, S.T. Gibson"
"Such beautiful writing!! I fell in love with everything about this book - from its presentation to its style of storytelling. It was such a different, capturing, lyrical retelling. So much emotion in so little pages, it was a quick but memorable read!"
True love is this book. I’ve never adored a piece of writing as much as this.
I enjoyed this read! It was compelling and fast paced. I  expected more smut honestly but it took a very different turn than I expected
"This book is phenomenal. The best vampire book I've read in ages. A fresh treatment of Dracula and one that never once speaks his name, but is fully suffused with his splendor and menace."
"I literally could not put this book down. It had all of my favorite elements, was incredibly well written, and was fast paced without being short or shallow. I couldn’t read it fast enough. I absolutely love the author’s writing, as well as the world that was created."
"This is the most beautifully written book I have ever read. The story was great, I soaked in every word."
I don't think I've ever read anything quite like this. It is so beautifully written with a dreamy quality to it that I absolutely loved.
One of the most beautiful books I’ve ever read.
I had been wanting to read a new vampire story for a while and stumbled upon this one.  Needless to say it satiated my thirst well!
I loved this book. It was stunning and beautifully written. I will always recommend any book by ST. Gibson.
"How do you begin reviewing a book written so beautifully? This is what I've struggled with since I finished reading A Dowry of Blood by S.T. Gibson.I feel like whatever I say won't do this book justice. Do I share quotes? Do I enumerate the things loved the most about it? Do I just tell you what it's about?Let's start with the last one. A Dowry of Blood is a queer retelling of Dracula's brides. Frankly, I wasn't familiar with Dracula's story, apart from the obvious (he's a vampire). I didn't know he had brides. But apparently he does and here, he has three—Constanta, Magdalena, and Alexi.The book is told through one long letter, from Constanta to Dracula though he wasn't named here. She chronicled everything that happened in her life with him, from the tumultuous beginning to the triumphant end.This style of storytelling is one of the things I loved about this book. It's unique and immersive, as Constanta constantly refers to Dracula as ""you"".Couple that with the beautiful writing and I was helpless against the pull of this story. I feel like I've highlighted the whole book. I mentioned this before, but I'll say it again: the prose is to die for.One of my many favorite beautiful lines from this book is this:""I knew then I would chase your tiny moments of weakness all the way into hell and back. What is more lovely, after all, than a monster undone with want?""I think it's best to dive into this book without knowing much about it. So I'm just gonna say that it's only January but I've already read what's guaranteed to be a contender for my best read of the year. Go read this dark and beautiful book."
"I received an ARC copy of this book from NetGalleyA Dracula retelling with sapphic main characters? Sign me up! I was so into this that I read it in a single day, and while it's not a super long book it still took a couple hours but once I picked it up I didn't want to put it down. Does a really good job representing an incredibly controlling and abusive relationship and it was nice to see Dracula's brides take center stage in a way that is actually about them and their feelings and not just like ~lady vampires hot~ [although lady vampires are indeed, pretty hot ;)] One thing I did find a little bit weird was the writing style which was in first person but addressing Dracula as 'you' throughout the whole thing, as if the narrator was saying all of this to him afterwards. A bit weird but overall the language is very compelling and I quickly got used to this quirk."
"Holy moly! Get me a fainting couch, Batman! A DOWRY OF BLOOD is proper swoon material. Absolutely beautiful, lyrical, and the story. Holy crap. I’m at a loss for words.Initially I was a bit hesitant about the voice. It’s not within my usual repertoire, but that lasted about a page before I properly fell down the rabbit hole of this story. It’s so beautiful and so enticing and so erotic and so bloody. It’s everything a Dracula’s Brides story should be. And I love the queerness of it, where love knew no gender and was not confined to a mere two individuals. It actually really annoys me when authors of vampire stories, especially with male vampires (and MATES ^%&*&T&ybiu&*$%*), so steadfastly insist that they’re straight that they’re basically punching it down your throat. Like, yeah? Dude has access to an immortal buffet of life and he’s going to eat nothing but mashed potatoes for eternity? Whatever you say.This is one of those [rare] reviews where I have no idea what to say because I have no criticisms to offer. I LOVED A DOWRY OF BLOOD. Unequivocally. Unabashedly. Wholeheartedly. It encapsulated everything raw and dangerous and sexy about Dracula while hilariously brushing aside THE story of Dracula (yeah, those Harkers were dicks, man, forget them). Although I totally would have been interested to see how Constanta and crew would have responded to Mina, but I’m perfectly okay not knowing. Although I guess Constanta’s response to the Harkers (pretty much was I wrote above) says it all.It’s freakin’ beautiful. I don’t know, man. Buy the book. It will swallow you whole and you’ll be begging for more.5I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."
"""This is my last love letter to you, though some would call it a confession. I suppose both are a sort of gentle violence, putting down in ink what scorches the air when spoken aloud.If you can still hear me wherever you are, my love, my tormentor, hear this:It was never my intention to murder you.Not in the beginning, anyway.""I hadn't intended on starting my readthrough of this so soon, but as I stole peeks at the dedication page and then that gloriously dark and fascinating first chapter, I found I couldn't stop. I read and read until I was finished—and oh my god was this an unexpected delight of a book.At less than 250 pages (50K words), I think perhaps this is slightly too long to be called a novella—I like to think of it as more of a concise novel, lean, but its length is perfectly suited to the storytelling and style of the work. Anything longer and it risks feeling as if it drags. This is absolutely a character-driven story—which, those naturally pace slower anyway, so the brevity is perfectly suited for this particular story.We are given one POV, Constanta's, and believe me when I say that it reads as an achingly intimate farewell letter to an unnamed Dracula. That's right—this entire work is written to Dracula in the second person, which was a spectacular treat for me personally.At its soul, A Dowry of Blood is a really, really shrewd examination of a centuries-spanning toxic relationship of the highest order—abuse, physical and emotional; manipulation; greed; lust; dominance; masterfully crafted scenes of gaslighting... This book was an excellent character study on what goes through the thoughts and behaviors of a victim when they find themselves in an abusive situation.Marketed as a loose reimagining of Dracula, A Dowry of Blood balances what a complex M/F/F/M polyamorous relationship would be like given the circumstances and gothic setting while highlighting interesting bits of history and glimpses of Stoker's original. Exceptionally well done.If you enjoy lush, lyrical prose, brooding vistas, and a good character study, you might want to read this one. It also contains violence, sex, and head games, and you can read it in one sitting. I'm glad I picked this one up as it was one of my anticipated new releases on my booktube channel.""Love is violence, my darling, it is a thunderstorm that tears apart your world. More often than not, love ends in tragedy, but we go on loving in the hopes that this time, it will be different. This time, the beloved will understand us. They will not try to flee from our embrace, or become discontent with us."""
"A captivating, haunting reimagining of Dracula's brides with a centuries long quest for self-determination. The beautiful writing draws you into this world so completely that it is hard to put the book down until you reach the final words. It is a story of power, control, trust. fear, loneliness, self-worth, choice and also of love that knows no gender boundaries. The story begins as a young girls village is attacked and she lay mortally wounded, when a man finds her and tells her he can help her. So begins her life as Constanta, the bride of an immortal. taught by him, loved by him and chained by him. As the centuries pass and they move through the world, other brides are brought into the fold, Magdalena and Alexei. Each addition to the family brings love, tension and a growing sense that it may all come apart at any moment, as it has in the past. Finding the secrets he has hidden from them allows Constanta and the others to begin to dream of the freedom that each craves.I loved how this story works on so many levels, from being just a wonderful story of vampires and how they lived their lives to an empowering story of finding your way through doubt and fear to a place where you can determine the life that you want to live. The ebbs and flows of the relationships and the sudden turns keep the tension throughout, and the flow of the story will keep you hooked all the way to the powerful ending. This is a wonderful novel for fans of vampire/gothic stories, just please be aware of the content warnings."
"""We've waltzed through a hundred tiny apocalypses, you and I, walked unharmed through the ash of countless crumbling regimes. We feast on the ruin of empires, Constanta. Their destruction is our feast day.""I received an advanced copy of this book from NetGalley. All views/pinions expressed are my own.trigger warnings: domestic abuse, spousal abuse, emotional abuse (just lots of abuse, but I promise it is not romanticized in any way)This was a fascinating, heartbreaking read that I read over the span of a few hours; I simply couldn't look away from it and its tragedy. From my understanding, this is a retelling of Dracula (but, as I have not read that text, I am not sure how similar it is to the original). It at least has the similarity of being somewhat epistolary as the original Dracula was, but rather than written in letters it is as though the whole book is addressed to ""You""--the Dracula character, whom the narrator chooses not to name. Considering he renamed her after siring her, she had every right to erase his name from history.This is one of the best vampire stories I have ever read. It was a perfect mix of lyrical paragraphs and gut-wrenching truths. This was a narrator (named Constanta by her sire, her husband) who had lived hundreds of years by someone's side--seeing their cruelty and command, and still being unable to escape the cycle of abuse. For, while the fantastical element of vampirism is at the heart of this book, it stands side-by-side with surviving an abusive relationship; it is especially hard for Constanta to stand up for herself and her husband's other spouses when he never physically hurt them, when he manipulated them to think his abuses were for their own good.I was completely enraptured by this novel, and I highly recommend it. Not only is it a Dracula retelling, but there is queer and polyamorous rep as well (though the latter seems to be an attempted Sister Wives scenario). Seeing history through Constanta's eyes was incredible, but seeing her own life was something more. My heart broke every time Constanta convinced herself that it wasn't abuse, since it felt so real and accurate; she was stuck and hindered for years, and the whole book I couldn't stop rooting for her to break free."
"Disclaimer: Thank you to Nyx Publishing for providing me an e-ARC of this book in exchange for my honest review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.Left for dead by the soldiers who pillaged her village, a peasant girl is given the gift of eternal life by consuming the blood of a stranger. Raised from near death and renamed Constanta, she becomes the bride of an immortal king, the unnamed Dracula.In the ensuing centuries together, Constanta becomes jaded and bored with their life as aristocrats. Tired of all of the time alone while her husband studies both the living and undead for answers to their very being. Traipsing throughout Europe and fleeing wars, he seeks to add more brides to their relationship, the beautiful aristocrat Magdalena and the gorgeous and fiery Alexei, much to the initial dismay of Constanta. What starts out as anger and jealousy, quickly turns to love and passion and a sense of family between the four characters.Still not sated with his brides, the never named Dracula becomes increasingly violent and cruel to those he professes to love. That cruelty creates consequences that force Constanta to chose between love and devotion to her husband or to protect lives of those who she has also grown to love.The novel is told in first person point of view from Constanta's viewpoint. It is clear that the story itself is being told to the never-named Dracula.This is a gorgeous piece of gothic horror- it is dark, tortured, blood drenched, and has steamy sex scenes between all four characters. Each character was well fleshed out and interesting in their own right. I would love to read this story from the point of view of the other characters.  A lush retelling of the brides of Dracula story with a polyamorous relationship, A Dowry of Blood is the spiritual successor to Anne Rice's Vampire series, in my opinion.With the blessing of the author, I am adding the trigger warnings that she included for the novel. A Dowry of Blood contains depictions of  and/or references to: emotional, verbal, and physical intimate partner abuse, gaslighting, war, famine, and plague, blood and gore, consensual sexual content, sadomasochism, self harm, body horror, violence and murder, alcohol use, depression and mania, sexual assault, drug use, and drowning."
"I received a copy of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.I honestly do not think there has been a single day since this book’s release that I have not seen something positive about it posted on Goodreads or Twitter. The author said it is like a dark and sexy retelling of Dracula’s brides, which just sounded so cool to me. I did try to read Dracula before this, but I ended up marking it as dnf because I could not get into it. Knowing that this book would have similar vibes but with a fresh and unique take on the classic, I was super excited to dive into this book. I was immediately interested by the fact that it would feature an all bisexual cast, a m/f/f/m poly relationship, and sapphic yearning at the opera.S.T. Gibson’s A Dowry of Blood is an open letter to Dracula from one of his bride’s named Constanta. He rescues her from the brink of death, but she soon learns that he has a lot of secrets and is capable of cruel and evil things. However, she is stuck between this reality and her love for her husband. The two spend their lives together traveling before they invite Magdalena and Alexi into their marriage. They all have their own struggles with their husband that eventually become too much to bear, but in the end, Constanta is torn between love, freedom, and protecting herself along with her other partners.I cannot even begin to sum up how much I loved Gibson’s writing. The whole book felt atmospheric, lyrical, and dark. At times, I found the writing style to be very poetic. I really enjoy books that follow an epistolary style too. It can be very unique and focuses the story more sometimes. I also find that they have a very personal and stream of consciousness vibe. Constanta’s story is a very good example of this. It is like being let into someone’s life and seeing their past and secrets laid out. It is almost so personal that you feel like you are invading a space that is not meant for you.I found myself really drawn to the main cast of characters, obviously excluding Dracula. Constanta is an incredibly intriguing character. I appreciated the choice Gibson made in having Constanta be the narrator. This gave her power and a voice to use against her husband, which is why she decides to leave him unnamed. I enjoyed seeing her development and growth throughout the story as well. Constanta, Magdalena, and Alexi all complimented one another very well. Their relationships were all very complex and complicated at times. At first, it is like they are rivals competing for love and attention. In reality, they build something so beautiful together. Their interactions were one of my favorite parts of the whole book. I really did not want their story to end.Gibson ultimately crafts a powerful narrative about toxic relationships and overcoming abuse. She explores how love can morph into control, abuse, and fear. It can be very difficult to leave this kind of situation. I think Constanta’s internal struggle about this is very well done because it shows the depth of this type of relationship. The different reactions Constanta, Magdalena, and Alexi have to their husband’s rage and abuse are very unique to show how some people manage and navigate toxic relationships. This all felt so honest and raw.A Dowry of Blood was a perfect read for me. I truly loved everything about it. Gibson’s writing and the story itself are both very enthralling. This book honestly deserves all the hype and positive reviews I have seen for it. I was incredibly lucky to get a copy from NetGalley but had to immediately buy one for myself because I know it is something I will want to collect and revisit.*Content warning: depictions of emotional, verbal, and physical intimate partner abuse, gaslighting, war, famine, plague, blood, gore, consensual sexual content, sadomasochism, self harm, body horror, violence, murder, alcohol use, depression, mania, brief references to sexual assault (not directed at any named character), drug use, drowning*Thank you to the publisher, Nyx Publishing, and NetGalley for giving me the opportunity to read and review this book."
"Thank you to NetGalley and NYX Press for the ARC of this book. All opinions are my own.I wish I could put into plain words how enamored by this book I was. From the first paragraph to the very last, it was like pulling teeth when I had to put this book down. It’s been a long time since a book was so different from what I normally read, but was still able to catch, hold and keep my attention until I finished. What a twist on a retelling! A dang good one I might add.From Constanta, Magdalena, Alexi to the ever looming “you” figure, each character was complex, well rounded and so intriguing. I loved Constanta and her growth, her resolve and her ability to stand on her own. The relationship between Magdalena and Constanta was probably my favorite. The way they knew but continued to develop between themselves was a complete joy to read. I loved every second of it.This book is flowing, lyrical genius & I don’t think I’ll be able to stop thinking about it anytime soon!"
"I went into this book expecting it to be a lush, indulgent, romantic, polyamorous story about rising up against an abuser, all through the lens of vampire main characters -- which is to say, I thought it would be a really fun read that felt deep and capital-R Romantic.  And it did not let me down!  I had a blast reading this book over the course of the last couple days.  It definitely reads very quickly, despite covering hundreds of years, but since it's a novella, I think that's to be expected.  I could easily have enjoyed getting deeper into these characters' lives, but I thought the format of a long letter did work well to carry me through the story as it was presented.My one big wish for the story was that it feel more rooted in its various times.  I suppose it's possible that the author wanted to wash all of the times covered by the story in a sort of vagueness in order to show the way that the characters' years sort of slipped away from them as they were trapped in this relationship (and I think that, in general, that aspect is one of the book's greatest strengths, evoking that sense of feeling trapped and losing the outside world because of the control the abuser had over the other characters), but it felt lacking to me in that way.On a related note, most of the language had a very historical feel to it, which was often beautiful and gave me the feeling of indulgence I was hoping for, but sometimes the language would turn suddenly modern and feel anachronistic to me.  If it only happened once or twice, I may not have noticed, but it happened pretty often, even sometimes in the dialogue between characters, and it pulled me out of the story sometimes (there were also some moments of cliché in the language that stood out to me too).For the most part, I felt that A DOWRY OF BLOOD delivered on every front.  It was a lovely read, with a nuanced look at this complex relationship between four people.  Given the short span of time allowed by a novella, I thought Gibson did a great job of giving each of the character's distinct traits so that I felt connected to them despite the shorter length.  It's an impressive achievement and I deeply enjoyed the story and the writing.  I can see myself returning to this book often in the future."
"A short but engaging read, A Dowry of Blood interrogates a long tradition of vampire myths and romances. ""This is my last love letter to you, though some would call it a confession. I suppose both are a sort of gentle violence, putting down in ink what scorches the air when spoken aloud,"" Constanta addresses the husband she has murdered after a centuries-long relationship, an ancient and powerful vampire who saves her from death. ""You did not let me keep my name, so I will strip you of yours,"" she promises him. Though unnamed, it is impossible not to read her husband as a Dracula analogue, or perhaps an amalgam of the many sexy, dangerous, (old), and controlling vampire lovers found in fiction. Refreshingly, Constanta's long letter turns the tables on the typical vampire romance by prefacing the inevitable heady lust and affection with the clarity of hindsight. ""I think, my lord, that this is when you loved me best. When I was freshly made, and still as malleable as wet clay in your hands."" Such annotations, peppered throughout, make clear the insidious way that power and love (and yes, supernatural vampiric lust) can trap someone in a controlling relationship that leaves them unable to live life (especially an immortal, undying one) on their own terms.Though we know from the opening pages that she will murder her husband, that their polyamorous family will grow to include two accomplices to the act, Magdalena and Alexi, Constanta's gothic tale remains engaging from the start, and provides glimpses of her life in various European cities and towns throughout the centuries. I would have enjoyed a more thorough dive into some of these moments and the people in them, as the epistolary format and the overwhelming emphasis on the relationship dynamics of the principle romantic pairings were prioritized at the expense of fleshing out any side characters or historical settings. My only other small quibble was the repeated misuse of ""I"" as an object pronoun (e.g. ""he looked at Magdalena and I""), which was distracting and out of keeping with the otherwise clear prose.Overall, an enjoyable and atmospheric reworking of vampiric romance tropes and a compelling story of the struggle to free oneself from an abusive relationship, rounded out by a hopeful ending. I look forward to reading more from this author.ARC provided by Xpresso Book Tours through NetGalley."
"A Dowry of Blood by S. T. Gibson is the tale of one of Dracula's wives. Like Dracula, it is written in an epistolary fashion. Constanta is the narrator. From her introduction to Dracula to his death, she tries to unsuccessfully protect herself. She also protects her co-wives. She grows and learns and wants her half-life to end. Abby Craden does a wonderful job of narrating. A Dowry of  Blood is the view of Dracula we have never had. I received a copy of A Dowry of Blood from Tantor Audio in exchange for an honest review."
"I decided to read A Dowry of Blood on a whim and I'm so glad I did! The writing was so lyrical and beautiful. I devoured every word. The letter format the author used worked perfectly for this story. I also loved all of the characters and the casual queer representation.  This book ultimately examines the toxic and abusive relationship between Dracula and his brides. I appreciated that this was never glorified and handled very tactfully. The biggest thing holding me back from giving this 5 stars is that I wanted more relationship building between the characters. Overall, I really enjoyed this book and want more people to pick this one up."
"I devoured this book and I know I will read it again.As someone who has survived and escaped a deeply emotionally abusive relationship, this book felt like a love letter. I feel seen, raw with emotion, and buoyed with hope. It had been a long road out of my abuse and all the lasting trauma that has come with it, but freedom is always a possibility."
"This book is gorgeous, so we'll written. Beautiful prose and characters. I wish it were longer in length!"
"So fun, dark and sexy!"
I looooooved this book! It was really good! I loved the characters snd the writing is so beautiful. Only critique I have is that it mentions the Harkers like from the original Dracula but I sort of wished we got to see a bit more from them. I do like that they were mentioned though.
"I adored this book! It's a dark story that explores an abusive relationship between Dracula and his brides through letters written by Constanta, our protagonist, as she lives with Dracula for centuries. I really enjoyed this format because it gives the story a more magical feel that pulls you into the story and makes you want to keep reading about her life. Her growth throughout the years is one borne out of love for the other brides that are part of this polyamourous relationship. I thought it was such a beautiful tale with a very atmospheric writing that made it easy to imagine the different settings of the story.It's an amazing short book that I highly recommend if you want a story about a woman learning different types of love and losing herself throughout the years to a man that loves too much."
"Highlights~not even a little bit Stoker’s Dracula~vampires being hella queer~Venetian Carnivale with your sister-wife~pretty boys are for rescuing~let’s be honest, we all like a little blood-playOrnate. Delicious. Hedonistic. Bloodied and bejewelled. This isn’t a book; this is a feast.Take a moment to savour the title. Just the title. Dowry of Blood. Doesn’t it conjure to mind rich velvets and ancient secrets, gowns and jewels and intoxicating danger? Doesn’t it make you think of lips parted as if for a kiss, or a snarl? Power, yearning, darkly delicious sensuality. Bloodstained loving and loving bloodshed.I’m here to assure you that Dowry has all those things and more.And yet, from the start this book subverts your expectations. To start with, Gibson has taken characters who had no voice at all – Dracula’s wives – and decided to tell their story, to give them the stage for once. So even the premise of the book flips the narrative around, bares sharp, bloody teeth at the establishment that thinks this is a man’s story.And then, we have this–)I never dreamed it would end like this, my lord: your blood splashing hot flecks onto my nightgown and pouring in rivulets onto our bedchamber floor.(This is the first line of the book. That lord, whose name is inextricably tied to the idea of vampire, who defined the modern mythology of the monster? The great and powerful vampire prince who struck terror into generations of those who learned his story?Oh, he’s dead.Constanta, our narrator – her story begins where the stories of so many women have ended throughout history; beaten down in the dirt, her loved ones dead, her village afire. And when offered the choice, she chooses what women, what good girls are not supposed to choose: to become a monster rather than die quietly. She wreaks her vengeance on the men who destroyed her human life with a fiercely joyful savagery, as if she has become the avatar of female rage, acting for all the women who have ever been unable to fight back.)I wanted to break them, even more slowly and painfully than they had broken me, leave them bleeding out and begging for mercy.(It’s a powerful moment.But Constanta doesn’t quite hold on to her power. Once her almost-murderers are dead she surrenders, happily, to the man who made her a vampire.)In that moment, my life was not my own any longer. I felt it slipping away from me the way girlhoods must slip from women who are given proper church marriages and cups of communion wine, not bruising kisses and battlefields full of blood.(And maybe that would give the book a very different feel – if we didn’t already know that she is writing this story after having murdered him.But we do know.So.)In this world, you are what I say you are, and I say you are a ghost, a long night’s fever dream that I have finally woken up from. I say you are the smoke-wisp memory of a flame, thawing ice suffering under an early spring sun, a chalk ledger of debts being wiped clean.I say you do not have a name.(The story Constanta tells us paints her as someone to be pitied; a young woman who was swept up into a toxic relationship, too naive to know better. A victim. And she is a victim – or was – but reading about how her lord manipulates her, gaslights her, emotionally abuses her – all along, we know how it ends. We know she doesn’t stay this way. We know the tables are going to turn.)My lord. My liege. Beloved. King. My darling. My defender.I had so many names for you in those days, my cup of devotion overflowing with titles worthy of your station.(But those days are over, and the reader knows it.That knowing colours the ‘main’ story; the recounting, the record of what has passed. We can feel immense sympathy for Constanta; we can despise what her husband does to her; but we cannot see her as weak. And really, we shouldn’t need to know that she overcomes him to believe in her strength; in a perfect world, we wouldn’t attach any kind of stigma to victimhood. We would understand that surviving is strength, too. And I think that’s what Gibson manages to get across, manages to teach us without ever once putting it into words; we read Constanta’s story knowing that she will pay back everything done to her, and therefore we see her strength even during her victimhood, her abuse. On a quiet, unconscious level, we absorb the fact that being a victim does not make you weak. Because we know she survived – and survived to turn the tables.I hope I’m putting this into words well.This makes Dowry of Blood sound terribly depressing and grim, which misrepresents it terribly. It’s not depressing. It’s the opposite of depressing; it’s full of the hunger for life, for experiences, for living. It is jewel-tones, it is velvet, it is opera music and gloried-in sexuality and stringing the cities of the world on a string like pearls. It’s monstrous. It’s glorious.)You taught us to never feel guilty, to revel when the world demands mourning.(Dowry of Blood is not a polite, conventional vampire story. This isn’t a book where a dewy-eyed virgin makes a man out of a monster, taming and gentling him as she might a heraldic unicorn. It is not a human fantasy, the oft-repeated, slightly illicit daydream of being adored so wholly that a monster will give up monstrousness for you.This is a fantasy for those who want to be the monster. It’s a dream for those who hunger. Every page is imbued in a rich, dark sensuality that hearkens back to an older generation of the vampire mythos – and celebrates something fanged and fierce and primal within ourselves.)“Water your mother’s flowers with their blood.”(I nodded, my breath coming shallow and hot. “Yes, my lord.”Better essayists than I have written at length about how the myth of the vampire is all tangled up with human sexuality, and sexual freedom is definitely one of the many ways in which Gibson’s vampires are free – no longer human, no longer bound by human laws, so does Constanta’s lord encourage her to also cast off human convention. Constanta blithely tells the reader of the human lovers – at least some of whom likely didn’t survive the experience – she and her husband share over the centuries, and there’s no drama about the fact that plenty of them are women. Constanta’s queerness is treated so blithely by her own narrative that a reader who only skims could be forgiven for missing it – at least until Constanta’s husband takes another wife, one who immediately becomes wife and lover to Constanta too.A lesser writer could easily have made a sordid mess out of all of this, or at least left the reader with the impression that the polyamory is a manifestation of the vampires’ monstrousness, not something good and decent people should ever seriously consider. But Gibson is better than that; even as other aspects of their lives break down or are made questionable, the love at the heart of the novel shines darkly and perfect. Constanta’s husband is controlling and emotionally abusive, but the love is still very real, as is the love Constanta and her sister-wife feel for each other. If the marriage breaks down, it’s not because there’s something intrinsically flawed in the idea of a polyamorous relationship; it’s because one member of it is intrinsically flawed as a person. Gibson never leaves the reader in any doubt about that.)I craved you like maidens crave the grave, the way Death burns for human touch: inconsolably, unrelentingly, aching for the annihilation in your kiss.(And as must be clear from all the quotes I’ve included in this review, Gibson’s prose is simply breathtaking. The passion and exhilaration emanates from every page like physical heat, and the joys and sorrows alike make the reader’s heart ache. I can’t imagine anyone else doing this tale justice; nor have I ever seen the complex and yet primally simple motivations and emotions and story of it all executed so well. Gibson wields her pen like a sword and runs you through with it – but oh, you’ll thank her for it.Constanta’s story is not one of redemption, because she doesn’t need it. Instead, Dowry of Blood is a story about claiming, embracing, and celebrating your own power, your own strength. It’s about the beauty that can be found everywhere, even when things get very dark indeed. It’s about how small we can make ourselves before we break. It’s about choosing to be monstrous rather than be made less, and in that, it’s a story for so many of us.Dowry of Blood is unique in being a story no one else would think to tell – or tell so well – but it’s also unique in who it’s being told to. This is a book for those of us who have monsters inside us; for those of us who need or want to let those monsters out… And it’s a book that is a celebration of those parts of us.If you embrace those shadows inside you, this is the book for you. And if you are searching for a way to step out of a different kind of shadow and into your own strength, Dowry of Blood is for you too.Or if you’re just looking for an exquisitely beautiful story about queer vampires. That’s more than reason enough to pick up this book."
"“You could have kissed me or slit my throat and either would have made as much sense.”I loved the way this was written in second person in the form of a letter to a former abuser. Constanta never names him and I felt that was such a powerful move. Watching her go back to the start and showing how she slowly woke up to the situation she was truly in had me in awe. The strength she had to stand up to her abuser was inspiring and I feel so many will relate to her situation. I am happy it starts off with her finally free and writing this letter because I was able to look forward to the abuser’s downfall. It made it all the more satisfying.Now I want to get into the other brides. I absolutely loved Magdalena and Alexei! They turned Constanta’s relationship into a polyamorous one. I really enjoyed how smart and witty Magdalena was. She was always glowing when she was fully herself. Alexei was so creative and social. The definition of charismatic. I loved seeing how quickly the loved and protected each other, especially against the abusive one. My favourite moments were the time the three of them spent together. I really wish we got to see more once they were finally free.“You did not let me keep my name, so I will strip you of yours. In this world, you are what I say you are, and I say you are a ghost, a long night’s fever dream that I have finally woken up from. I say you are the smoke-wisp memory of a flame, thawing ice suffering under an early spring sun, a chalk ledger of debts being wiped clean. I say you do not have a name.”I respected Constanta by not naming her abuser, but I will now mention him as part of my review. Obviously, this is Dracula. I really liked that he wasn’t romanticized and stayed true to the manipulative character we learned about from Stoker. It was refreshing to see him as the abusive person he is and to not even give him a perspective. I liked that this was all about his brides and his downfall. Honestly iconic.If you have always been interested in Dracula’s brides and love polyamorous relationships with hot badass vampires, please read this beautiful novella with its stunning prose! Also if you love Deathless, definitely give this a read! I plan to read more from this author."
"Gorgeous retelling of Dracula’s Brides - so many emotions reading this. It is character-driven with lush, incisive prose, gorgeously lyrical turns of phrase and very few minor historically anachronistic things which didn’t detract from the story.The relationships are so beautifully sketched and realised. I love how Dracula has been robbed of his name in this novella in the way he robbed the protagonist Constanta of hers at the very start, and the 2nd person narrative told in written fragments is the way in which Constanta reclaims her agency and voice after hundreds of years. It is just the right length for this to work, and the narrative’s pace and dance through the years is both believable and ideal for the kaleidoscope of history it presents through the lens of the central relationships and character arcs.I really loved it!"
"This is a darkly lush and blood-soaked gothic novella about a heroine who embraces monstrosity, written like a final love letter addressed to her abuser who she murders. It is stunningly written and shows how abusive relationships masquerade as love, and also contains a well-developed polyam relationship.If you've been considering reading Dowry, I urge you to nab yourself a copy and treat yourself. It's a beautifully queer novel with an important lesson at its dark, beating heart."
"I'm speechless, In my search for lovely fantasy, how this book is filled with fear, lust, longing and a deep need to see them freed catches the breath in your throat. Truly remarkable and beautiful queer."
really enjoyed this book from start to finish. i loved the emotion shown in the main character nd was saddened when it ended .
"Loved that the main character doesn’t completely lose herself despite being under his thumb. She’s a good vampire but not in an annoying way, you know? Loved the whole thing"
"Lush, lust and heartbreak and everything in-between. Can never look at Dracula the same ever again. The prose are to die for. Highly, highly recommend! Support indie publishing! XXxx"
"An unforgettable and heartwrenching book with a triumphant ending. I love Constanta, Alexi and Magdalena. This is the sequel to Dracula I never knew I needed. Amazing, resilient, charming characters and stunning prose make this book one of the best books I've read ever, not just for 2021. Trigger warning: violence, sexual references, abuse, character deaths, gaslighting."
"This was one of the most intense and gothic novels I have read. It was so romantic in a dark way, and the charecters were all so great. I loved the main charecter Constanta. This book is very queer and has a poly relationship. The relationship itself is very toxic (because of Dracula) but the love between the other three people  in the ralationship is wondeful. The book is written like a love letter. The plot was simply splendid. I HIGHLY recomend this book for a historical queer fantasy (even though there wasnt that much fantasy, just vampires) inthusiast !"
"Thank you NetGalley and Nyx publishing for this ARC in exchange for an honest review.“You did not let me keep my name, so I will strip you of yours. In this world, you are what I say you are, and I say you are a ghost, a long night’s fever dream that I have finally woken up from”A Dowry of Blood is a modern retelling of Dracula’s Brides, told by Constanta to her nameless lover and sire.Filled with some of the lushest most swoon worthy writing I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading, truly a lyrical masterpiece, my inadequate words do not do justice to how fantastic this book was. I wanted to savour ever word and let them sink into my soul.“We’ve waltzed through a hundred tiny apocalypses, you and I, walked unharmed through the ash of countless crumbling regimes. We feast on the ruin of empires,“This was the vampiric tale of desire, obsession, and strength I have always wanted and with polyamory added in!Ugh I loved this so hard, I’m off to go buy myself a copy."
"I'm nearly finished this book, and it's so utterly heartbreaking and engaging.We follow one Constanta, her life being forever changed while she lay dying after her village is ravaged and an Unnamed savior changes her life forever. We see the world, the painful duality of love through her eyes in her own recounting of events that pull us through the blurred centuries of her life.The writing is lush, Constanta's voice hanging on every word and it's quite immersive- even with the power of hindsight."
"No complaints as such, but I expected a more...polished book in comparison to the one I recieved. The cover art is exquisite, but the book itself, with regard to the binding, font, printing and page formatting, is poorer than an elementary school book. The printing is sometimes only on one side, and it continues that way for some time, when it suddenly changes to double sided printing. Really upset with this purchase :( would advice against it.."
"I do not usually write reviews, but I was shocked to see this book had under 200 reviews. I did not read anything about the author before going into this, but I'm not in the least bit surprised that she's a poet. This book is so lyrical, you almost get carried away into the writing. The storyline holds an important message and I love how it's told through the viewpoint of the survivor, not even mentioning the abuser by name. And as a dark fantasy lover I enjoyed the added layer of gothic/ supernatural elements. I will most definitely reread this book in the future. Not suitable for minors though."
"4 Stars.Brilliant! Loved the lyrical writing style, complex character development and exploration of emotional themes. Planning to reread again soon to soak up more nuance."
"The pros in this book are incredible.  I feel like it’s the perfect length and I clung to every word.  I leant it to a friend and even if it isn’t her usual type of book, she loved it as well.  This is one of the best books that I’ve ever read."
"This is such a gorgeous story. The writing is so lyrical, I could highlight every single line. It was so emotional and intense"
"First of all, it is beautifully written. Very nice word choice and structure. I don't read a lot of fantasy but this was an amazing book!Recommend~"
"If you enjoy found family and non-traditional love stories, you should give this book a shot. Good to read while on the go as well."
"Talia Hibbert has done it again with the second book in her series about the Brown sisters. I loved this book so flippin' much!Take A Hint, Dani Brown is everything I love about contemporary romance. First of all, the steam. THE STEAM! I think my kindle was smoking at times during this book and my cheeks were definitely flushed! Dani and Zaf have some smokin' hot chemistry and I loved every page of it.The characters in this book are multi-faceted, complex, and truly unique within the romance genre, maybe even across all book genres. Dani is a black, bisexual, curvaceous woman and proud of it. She is fiery, gutsy, focused, ambitious, and passionate about life. In contrast to her bold exterior, she has a vulnerable core and struggles with self doubt and her measure of self worth. She's been hurt by love and relationships in the past and has set up a system of rules to protect herself for being hurt again. I related to Dani on so many levels and really adored her story. And then there's Zaf. I've never read a hero like Zaf. He's a big, brooding former Rugby player who's now working as a university security guard. He's the strong silent type. He's also Pakistani-British, sexy, a beast between the sheets, sweet, supportive, and emotionally intelligent. Are you swooning yet? Because you should be!After accidentally starring in a viral video and earning their own ship name, Dani and Zaf decide to fake a relationship while they each benefit from this moment of stardom. And did I mention that these two are quite opposite each other on the personality spectrum? So we've got opposites attract and fake relationship -- two of my all time favorite tropes! This book was destined to be a winner for me!I really enjoyed the first book in this series, Get A Life, Chloe Brown, but I really, REALLY enjoyed the second book. This was a brilliant 5 star read for me. I feel like I can't stop talking about this one and I just might not!🔥🔥🔥🔥/5 steam ratingThank you @avonbooks @this_is_edelweiss for an ARC of this title!"
"I believe what I'm enjoying the most is the wittiness amongst the sisters and Gigi. I love the sisterhood and friendship shown in both books. This second series was just as enjoyable as the first. I love the fact we have this huge man that is Zafir, all physical qualities screams MAN and ALPHA, but he is a huge romanticizing marshmallow. In terms of Dani he is understanding and appreciative of her person. That is so important in a relationship, especially for someone with the insecurities Dani has. She knows who she is yet feels like her personality hinders her from finding love. I can personally relate to that. But when you find a person who loves you, your mind, quirkiness, ""faults"" & your insecurities, that is a person who sees you. I truly enjoyed their HEA and Dani realization of her capabilities of expressing her love for Zafir.I think the Brown sisters suffer from lack of social skills, emotional vomit and a lack of social cues...lol,  I see a little bit of myself in them. I just wish I was as cheeky and witty as them. Can't wait for Eve's story."
"5 STARSI received a review copy from Edelweiss in exchange for an honest reviewHave you ever started a book, and just known from the beginning that this was going to be a new favorite? Because that’s what happened with me and this book. I read Get a Life, Chloe Brown in the beginning of the year, and immediately added Take a Hint, Dani Brown to my TBR without even reading the synopsis. I loved Chloe Brown enough that just by seeing the cover of Dani Brown I was sure I was going to love it. And I was right!Before I give some more details about what this book is about, let me just say that this book is perfect for all the trope lovers out there. Because essentially this book has friends to lovers and fake dating all wrapped with some steamy times. It follows Dani Brown who asks the universe for a sign to point her in the direction of her next friend-with-benefits. When a video goes viral of her super hot security friend, Zafir, rescuing her from a building, they decide to pretend to date to help Zafir get more publicity for the organization he runs that uses rugby to get boys to tap into their emotions in order to help dismantle toxic masculinity. Of course, things don’t stay platonic for long!Now one of the first things that I noticed about this book was that it’s laugh out loud funny! I received an e-ARC from Edelweiss, and 10% in I was enjoying myself so much that I pre-ordered a physical copy for myself right then and there! I think I knew even then that this book would be a favorite.One of the things I loved most about this book was definitely the characters. Let me start by talking about the love interest, Zafir. My heart! I love this man. He reads romance novels, and as I mentioned in the synopsis part, he runs a rugby program dedicated to teaching young boys how to get in touch with their emotions in order to fight back against toxic masculinity. Zafir has been through a lot, but he’s such a sweetie and a hopeless romantic. He is the textbook definition of someone who looks all big, scary, and grumpy, but is actually a smol cinnamon roll that would do anything for those he loves.Zafir also struggles with grief and anxiety throughout the book, and it was handled excellently! There was one paragraph in particular that just struck a chord with me as someone who has suffered from mental health issues for many years. It was so nice to see Zafir talk about his progress and his coping mechanisms, and to see him surrounded by such a wonderful support system.As for Dani, well, she’s fantastic! She’s motivated and determined, she’s blunt and she’s confident, but she also protects her heart at all costs. She values her success in her academic field, and it was so wonderful getting to read about someone who so obviously loved what they did, and was not ashamed to put their focus on their work rather than other places.The relationship between the two characters was just perfection! Dani’s bluntness, and Zafir’s emotional intelligence ensure that there’s frequent communication between these two. Even when there is inevitably some drama towards the end, it made sense, and was resolved pretty quickly, because these characters talked through things instead of just acting like idiots. Not only that, but each one took responsibility for their portion of the drama, as opposed to what you usually see, which is one person groveling for forgiveness even if the other party had some hand in their altercation.There’s also this wonderful conversation about the difference between changing yourself for someone else and someone encouraging you to grow and become a better version of yourself. This is such an important distinction and I was so glad to see it discussed in a romance book, where many times the characters feel the need to change themselves to be with their love interest, which should not be the case!I think my love for this book knows no bounds because every aspect of this book was exactly what I wanted and what I needed from a romance! As an overview, this book has great friendship, romance, mental health, discussions about emotions, discussions about grief and anxiety, minimal but realistic drama and more.I have so much more that I love about this book but I’m struggling to be coherent about all the little details that made this book so wonderful! I think the best advice I can give is for you to read this book!In case you couldn’t already tell, this was a five star read for me! Everything about it is perfection, it immediately was added to my favorites shelf on Goodreads, and I would like anyone reading this review to go and pick up a copy for yourself this very moment!"
"Talia Hibbert is a brilliant young author! I have fallen in love with the two older Brown Sisters, Red, Zaf, and Gigi.  I have been reading Ms. Hibbert's work for the last couple of years; she never disappoints.  All of her works introduce the world into the world of those who feel slightly odd and left out; looking at the world from the sidelines.  She addresses those things that are spoken about in whispers and in the shadows.  She surrounds these hard topics with humor that makes you laugh out loud; say 'I felt just like that at times'.  She allows the reader to fall in love with these every day working folks; people just trying to live their best lives with few bumps along the way to love.  'Take a Hint, Dani Brown: A Novel' is the story of Zaf and Dani falling in love and discovering what makes them them. The development of their relationship is a lovely thing to read about as it grows.  It is wonderful how their desires, fears, and anxieties are revealed. How they both learn that it is okay not to be okay.  To acknowledge your brokenness and be okay with it; also how it is good thing to let someone else help pick those broken pieces up.  I recommend this read. You will laugh out loud, smile until your face hurts, and possible tear up because it is so sad and sweet that you cannot help it."
"The queen of writing witty banter is back again to tell the fake relationship-into-lovers story of Chloe’s younger sister. She’s a badass PhD student who doesn’t believe in relationships, who after a viral video moment, agrees to fake one with the hot security guard who’s hoping to raise the profile of his mental health/sports charity. ⁣⁣𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜 𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲𝗱:⁣⁣I was obsessed with Dani less than 10 pages in. She’s hilarious but also her confidence in certain aspects of her life and insecurity in other aspects is something I really relate to. She and Zaf were just so effortlessly witty, the banter is fun but not over the top, a thin line to walk that many authors cross for me. There’s also a fair amount of steam but not as much as in Chloe Brown.⁣⁣Hibbert also does a great job depicting Zaf’s backstory and the discussions around mental health, as well as Dani’s conflict with being successful in her field versus allowing herself to find joy in other aspects of her life. And of course I love the representation of a Black bisexual woman and a Muslim man without making it central to the storyline—it’s just who they are as we watch them fall for each other.⁣⁣I’m also really excited for the next book which you get a sneak preview of at the end. The youngest sister Eve seems like a treat and a half and what I’m assuming is her romantic lead Jacob seems like an absolute sarcastic GEM of a human. Also pretty please can we get a Sorcha book too? The one thing I felt like I missed was more development in the secondary characters but I won’t mind if they get their own story!⁣⁣I laughed, I cried. Loved it."
"I absolutely loved every single word, paragraph, page and scene of ""Take A Hint, Dani Brown"".I was immediately immersed, the characters I cared about instantly and the story was so masterfully-crafted that I was torn between wanting to slowly savor every moment and yet wanting to speed through the whole fun, fast,  romantic adventure.Dani is a brilliant, adorable, book-nerdy snark. And Zaf is the epitome of a gentle giant with his own brand of blunt charm. They are the most perfect couple ever!There are loads of hilarious scenes in this book. Especially the one about the perils of listening to audio books at work. In addition to the humor, it's got all the feels too.The chemistry between Zaf and Dani is totally on point and steamy. And their family and friends are fun chaos added to an already entertaining tale. Just a pure joy to read. It's my new all time favorite book.  Ever!"
"Take A Hint, Dani Brown by Talia Hibbert has officially joined the ranks of my favorite books this year. I loved and raved about the Get a Life, Chloe Brown and honestly, I loved this one just as much.Many authors can master writing sexy, blush inducing heroes and spunky, intelligent and driven heroines but very few of them can pair this with a story that brilliant in its depth of emotion and knowledge of human emotions. The basis of the story is a wealth of my favorite tropes; friends to lovers + opposites attract + fake relationship tropesserious catnip for me. It’s an absolute treat to read about Zafir and Dani navigating the pressures of a fake relationship while maintaining their friendship and diving into real romance.I can’t eloquently enough express my love for Zafir. I need to know where I can find a tall, dark and incredibly sexy Pakistani-British man who is not only funny and intelligent but reads romance novels and has self-awareness regarding his emotional and mental well-being? This takes him to Unicorn status. His experience with anxiety after a major incident in his life has shaken up his world but my favorite part of the book is watching him deal with it. He not only got his life back on track but he continues to take care of himself to control it and helps young men learn about mental health and seek proper channels to deal with it.I love reading about intelligent and career driven women and Dani embodies a determined and thoroughly capable woman perfectly. Her passion and wit are infectious and I laughed out loud more than once while I devoured this book. I acutely felt her accomplishments and fears.Finally, I have to give kudos to Talia Hibbert for so effortless writing about a culture that is not her own. It is mine however, and I couldn’t have done a better job myself with the incorporation of language, food and cultural norms. It’s a brilliant read and you don’t even have to read the first book in the series to enjoy (although I HIGHLY recommend it)."
"Ok so I didn’t really like this book at first as it touches on some themes that aren’t my comfort zone. The language is also quite vulgar which is fine and normal for many people, but makes me think the author should expand her vocabulary.  F words and sexually explicit content aside, this book is has some cute moments. I laughed out loud several times and thought the ending was quite nice. The ending was so good that it saved the book for me.Danika Brown doesn’t do relationships or commitment. But she does beg the universe for a “friend with benefits” to keep her entertained. She is very involved with her work and school and just wants the be able to have a regular sexual tussle without all of the “feelings” involved. So when her friend Zaf rescues her from an elevator and they are mistaken fir a couple, she doesn’t immediately reject the idea of Zaf being her fake boyfriend - you know for publicity for him... Anyway Zaf can’t hide his feelings for Danika and tries his best to follow her silly rules, but you can’t always control the heart."
"I’ve been waiting for this book since I read Chloe Brown last year, which ended up being in my top 5 reads of 2019. And I must say the wait is totally worth it, and I believe Dani Brown will make my list this year ❤️. It’s fake relationship with adorableness overload, witty banter, and sweetness that could give you toothache 🥰. It’s also portraying mental health issues and how our beloved MCs have learned to cope with them with the support from their family and friends, and from each other...Meet Zafir Ansari: The grumpy, growly former rugby player who gives out supervillain energy 😂! But don’t let that vibe fool you, because he’s a hopeless romantic who reads romance novels and knows how to cook!!! If that’s not convincing enough, he pines after her so much that I bet you can smell a whole 🌲 forest! And I’m trash for pining heroes 🙈!Danika Brown is bold, motivated, intelligent, and passionate about her PhD research work. She would strive to achieve her goals no matter what. After being emotionally scarred from previous relationship failures, Dani decides to avoid romance, stay away from commitment, and shut off her feelings. An incident on campus pushes them to arrange a fake relationship while being friends with benefits 😂. But the lines start to blur fast, and Zaf’s love for Dani is getting so intense that you could feel it leap out of the page 🥰. How does Dani take all of these feelings and deal with hers at the same time?I absolutely adore their love story! It’s so real and beautiful that you feel like you know Dani and Zaf in real life. You feel their pain and struggles and sympathize for them! Witnessing Zaf coping with his anxiety and Dani dealing with her panic just gets me emotional 🥺. And I love that they’re there for each other to provide support and comfort 🥰... Ms Hibbert’s writing is so exquisite that it’ll make you laugh, swoon, fan yourself, teary-eyed, and then sigh contently at the end! She carefully depicts mental health issues and treat them with respect and sensitivity. If you’re looking for a well-developed, light-hearted, romantic story with all the feels, I HIGHLY recommend this book! ❤️"
"But it took forever. This is the second in the Brown sisters books. Dani is a PhD student/ teacher. Zafir is the grumpy, hot security guy who comes to her rescue. They have been work friends several months but the previously mentioned rescue was recorded and goes viral. Which leads to fake dating for his non profit. Read it. I LOVED Zaf. He and his family went through so much tragedy but he’s come through.My only issue is with Dani. She’s smart, accomplished, driven, but emotionally stunted because of failed relationships. And I understood but she saw things only one way for sooo long. I would get frustrated. She wasn’t self aware and sometimes people aren’t. But why not believe in the positive responses from the people who care.It does happen but I didn’t feel the emotional connection to him as much as his love for her.Anyway it’s good and I look forward to the third book."
"Dani Brown is the sister of Chloe from book one. I'm learning the author writes about smart, sharp women who are more interesting / different from mainstream romance leads. For example, in the beginning of this book, we see that Dani has just ended a relationship with a woman, but the entirety of this book is about her being with a man. And it's just there, not belabored. Very good approach.Anyway, Dani is  a PhD candidate on women's issues, as well as a professor. At the university, a former rugby star and now-security guard (because he's protective as hell) has been in love with Dani for a long time. Dani is super smart, and so driven she often forgets to eat, so Zack feeds her. When they agree to pretend to be a couple, for the benefit of his charity, the inevitable occurs and they fall in love and have a HEA.Similar to book one, in Hint, the male lead is a caregiver. Also, Zack's charity is about how to guide young men to deal with toxic masculinity. Hello, this is a romance. Aren't the men's shoulders supposed to get stuck going through doors? I loved Zack. Dani was prickly, but she was real. Also a rulebreaker, she kept her hair cut very short and dyed it colors relating to her moods. Her issue was to let down her guard and trust, to be more sensitive. Hibbert writes unique characters. They're complex, lusty, and smart. I totally enjoyed this book."
"Take a Hint, Dani Brown was absolutely wonderful with an amazing romance and delightful characters.Danika Brown knows what she wants out of life and love is absolutely not on that list. But a friend-with benefits? That’s right up her alley, so Dani asks the universe for the perfect person and she’s led to security guard Zafir Ansari. But before Dani can work on seducing him, a video of Zaf rescuing Dani during a fire drill gone wrong goes viral. With the publicity working wonders for Zaf’s sports charity, he begs Dani to play along and pretend to date him. Dani agrees with the hope of seducing Zaf in the meantime, but her potential friend-with-benefits turns out to be a hopeless romantic. Suddenly her plan just got a lot harder and when Zaf begins to work his way into her heart, Dani wonders what exactly the universe had in mind when it sent her Zaf?Dani is a confident woman who knows what she wants out of life and intends to get it. I loved that Dani knew her own mind and wasn’t willing to settle for anything less than what she wanted. Dani does have a poor outlook on love as it’s never worked out for her in the past. After learning Dani’s history, her reaction to love made sense and I could see why she avoids it. Dani is a bit of a workaholic and her dedication to her work definitely led to her personal life suffering. Her family is fantastic and I love the relationship she has with her sisters. Dani, Chloe, and Eve are all so wonderfully supportive of each other and I love it.Zaf is quite possibly one of my favorite romance heroes of all time. He’s swoony, believes in true love, and is an absolute cinnamon roll. The fact that he reads and loves romance novels makes him all the better. After the death of his father and brother several years prior to the story, Zaf developed anxiety that he still deals with in present day. The author’s descriptions of Zaf’s anxiety were so incredibly spot on with some of my own dealings with it and made Zaf easy to connect with. Zaf’s relationship with his family is fantastic and I loved how open he was with them about everything.Fake dating is one of my favorite tropes, so I knew I would love Dani and Zaf’s romance. The friendship the two develop is fantastic and I love how close they get over the course of the book. The chemistry between them is phenomenal and I loved their teasing banter. The sexy scenes in this book are incredibly steamy and so well done. It definitely takes a while before Dani and Zaf’s relationship moves forward as Dani’s insistence she’s not looking for love slows things down. I liked that Zaf was supportive of what Dani wanted while being open with what he wanted even if it was the opposite of Dani. When Dani finally accepts that she loves Zaf, it’s incredibly sweet and I loved the scene where she opens up to him. Overall their romance was wonderful and it’s definitely one that’s equal parts steamy and swoony.Take a Hint, Dani Brown was just as fantastic as Get a Life, Chloe Brown and I’m looking forward to the third book, Act Your Age, Eve Brown, releasing next year. I highly recommend this series to anyone looking for swoony, contemporary romances."
"Instead of doing a proper review of this book (which was fab!), I’m going to let the book speak for itself with a ridiculously long quote from the hero Zaf on why he reads romance:“At the time, it was romance novels that reminded me. Since you’ve never read one, that probably sounds weird. But it’s about emotion, Dan–the whole thing, the whole story, the whole point. Just book after book about people facing their issues head on, and handling it, and never, ever failing–at least, not for good. I felt like my world had already ended unhappily, but every book I read about someone who’d been through the worst and found happiness anyway seemed to say the opposite. Like my story didn’t need to be over if I didn’t want it to. Like, if I could just be strong enough to reclaim my emotions, and to work through them, maybe I’d be okay again. That’s kind of what inspired me to, er, keep going. To make good choices, even when feeling better seemed impossible.”It’s not…ever that I get to read a book where the main character shares my name and is perhaps being served up life and love lessons that I also need to hear. I took the hint, Universe."
"Danika Dani Brown is on her way up. She's working towards her Ph.D, but she's seeking help from Oshun. She needs a playmate that won't catch feelings. Zafir, the tall, dark and handsome security guard she flirts with daily waits for her to show up. She brings him coffee and he gives her protein bars because she forgets to eat at times. Classes are in full swing at the University and the security team scheduled a drill. All the personnel received it but Dani must have overlooked it. Flustered by the fact she'll be on a panel with her idol she takes the lift instead of the stairs and gets stuck during the drill. David and George clear the building but he doesn't see Dani in the crowd. He runs back in and finds her stuck in the lift. He rescues her and unnecessarily carries her out like he saved her from a burning building. #DrRugbae is born when someone records and posts the rescue. When Zafir's niece tags his non profit with the # Zafir's hard work gets the attention it already deserves, but puts Dani and Zafir in a fake relationship. How can you have a fake relationship when you already have feelings for the person, you get intimate, initiate rules, and say no feelings ok??  This book was hilarious and it gave you the feels too. The chemistry between Dani and Zafir was electric and you could feel it radiate from the pages."
"Loved. This. Book. Loved It. Probably my favorite contemporary romance of the year. So swoony, so hot, so smart, so bantery, so lovely. Dani is life goals, so fiercely intelligent and focused, and Zafir is a total sweetheart giant cinnamon roll of a man.Most of the funniest quotes from this book are Not Safe for Public Posting, but rest assured that if you read the available excerpt you will get to sample the delight that's in store for you, including chapter 2, an instant classic featuring Dani as the world's coolest English professor. Honestly, reading the sample in all its glory will convince you much better than anything I write could. Seriously, stop reading the reviews and just scroll up, you will One-Click probably before you've even finished the excerpt.I will share one thing that gave me heart-eyes, and sums up the book's delightfulness well (this is from Zafir's POV): ""If you had to stumble your way through a fake relationship with a woman you were actually crushing on, that woman being inhumanly calm and scarily smart and a little bit bossy made things a thousand times easier."""
"This was a great comfort read! I'm especially impressed by Talia Hibbert's ability to write light-hearted stories while still dealing with one's struggles. I enjoyed the tenderness, the witty remarks and the friendship that Dani and Zaf formed with each other. Anxiety and depression are the main themes of this novel. We come to understand that anxiety isn't the same for everyone; our characters deal with the fear of loss and control in very different ways. Also, I adore reading academic driven women in romance books!!! Zafir was so understanding and patient with Dani's drive for work. It was great to read of a soft romantic man who took care of his girlfriend when she fell into her work, rather than criticising her for working too much. Their dynamic was hot, fun and full of comfort.We also get snippets of Red and Chloe, who I missed so much!"
"I read Eve's book before Dani's and didn't think it could get any better, but I loved this book. I need a physical copy to hug to my chest while I twirl around in a meadow.Zafir is the ultimate cinnamon roll daddy. Danica is intelligent and so witty. Their banter made me laugh out loud. I highlighted quotes that probably don't seem funny out of context, but at the time I was laughing or clasping my hands to my chest.  This book was like the equivalent of watching puppies play. It was a pure joy. I'd kiss Talia Hibbert right on the mouth if that wasn't so weird.I'll definitely be re-reading the Brown Sisters books again.  I'd love to see these adapted like the Bridgerton series.  I can't recommend this one enough.CINNAMON ROLL DADDIES 4-EVER"
"Every time I read a Talia Hibbert book, I'm reminded why she is one of my favorite authors. The way that she is able to articulate emotions in such a way that they resonate deep within my soul and helps me to really connect with her characters in a way that makes an indelible impression on me that extends long after the last word is read. Dani and Zaf are such unique characters and I LOVED how they viewed each other and valued each other in  the exact way that the other needed - it was so beautiful. And don't even get me started on the steamy bits, the inclusion, and the banter. As much as I can 't wait for Eve's story, I also don't want this series to end - I love the Brown sisters so much! Maybe she'll bless us with grandma's story :) 5 out of 5 wine glasses."
"This is the second in a trilogy about the Brown sisters. This book focuses on Dani, and I liked both her and her story better than I did her sister Chloe and the first book. I have the same reservations about this book as I did for the Chloe book: there is too much raunchy language and the sex scenes/fantasies were too frequent and too explicit. The author seems to have no faith in the imagination of her readers and so is quite thorough in detailing each intimate encounter. However, the storyline is otherwise entertaining and the characters are likeable.  Will I read the next book featuring the third sister, Eve? Not sure. But if you’re comfortable with the bawdy language you will probably enjoy this popular series."
"I loved TAKE A HINT, DANI BROWN by Talia Hibbert! Dani and Zaf were so great together. I loved how confident, independent, and tough Dani was. Zaf is the sweetest ex-rugby player ever. I loved how soft he was for Dani and how much he just liked her so dang much. It was seriously the cutest thing.It does deal with some heavier topics, like anxiety. As someone who has an anxiety disorder, I found Hibbert’s portrayal of Zaf’s anxiety and how it manifests to be very realistic.This was a perfect balance of fun and emotional with a healthy dose of steam. I’m looking forward to book 3 in the series and Eve’s story!"
"“Feeling is always worth it.”•Read for the cutest lil romcom with the cutest characters•I enjoyed Get a Life, Chloe Brown, but I have fallen absolutely, head over heels, IN LOVE with Take a Hint, Dani Brown!In my opinion, this is a perfect romcom. The chemistry between the main characters is off the charts, the drama is minimal and believable, the side characters are lovely additions to the story, it’s genuinely laugh out loud funny, the romance is just so so sweet and relatable, and can I just say how nice it is to read sexy scenes with big girls involved!?I adored Dani Brown and related to her so much. I adore the whole Brown family, in fact. It was wonderful having scenes with Chloe and Red and I am even more excited to read Eve’s book now!I could seriously gush about this book all day! It was so good, I highly recommend"
"I don't think I took a breath after reading Get a Life, Chloe Brown, before I one-clicked this. I so wanted to stay in this world and the only thing I hate is that now I have to wait until next year for Eve's story. Oh well, I'll have to re-read the first two a few times. Dani and Zafir are golden. I loved this story. I loved Chloe but Dani is my Brown sister kindred spirit and the way Talia Hibbert dealt with this couple that seemed to want such different things, but felt drawn to each other was phenomenal. She's one of my top romance authors and she keeps getting better and better. Dani is a confident woman with a penchant for friends-with-benefits encounters and definitely no attachments. Zafir is a romantic through and through. I love that he knows what he wants and he doesn't have to be aggressive about it. Hibbert handles these characters so well, making you learn from them, laugh and cry with them and fall in love with them. If you like a good  romance that isn't predictable and is written excellently, this is the one. Kudos for Hibbert and all other authors writing diversely."
Yes Lawd this book was simply beautiful and I loved it from beginning to end. Zafir was everything and then some I loved his openness and honesty and the fact he never hid any pieces of himself and fell head over heals in love with Dani. I loved them together fake relationship or not it seemed blessedly real from the moment he became her knight in shining armor. I definitely can’t get enough of the Brown sisters. This book is definitely swoon worthy and leaves me with all the feels. I’m excited to get to the last sister in the series because I know it will be equally amazing if not more
"After finding herself locked in an elevator during a fire drill, Zaf’s heroically saving Dani gains media attention, which mistakes them for a couple. The two continue their fake relationship after Zaf’s organization gain attention. But as Zaf is trying not to fall further in love with Dani, Dani desperately tries to keep herself from catching feelings.Zaf, being a former Rugby player, is working as a security guard trying to keep his crush on Dani Brown under wraps. Due to a fire drill, Dani gets caught in an elevator and is carried out of the building by Zaf. The moment is captured on film by a bystander and is uploaded onto social media. The two are an instant hint with the public. All this newfound attention helps Zaf with his Tackle It! Organization, and the two begin fake dating.The fake relationship trope may be officially my favorite trope. At least with this book, with Dani being an overdramatic diva and Zaf having a weakness for divas, it’s hard not to like these characters."
I really enjoyed this book. I wasn’t sure how well I was going to follow it after I learned it was the second in a series. But I had no problem! Now I have to go back and read the first. And I can’t wait for the next to come out next year!This book had just the right amount of sarcasm and sappiness. I couldn’t put it down! This was a perfect happy ending.
"Dani and Zaf have such wonderful, sarcastic banter. The characters feel so real, and yet I am so jealous of how they are always able to say the perfect thing. I love getting to read neuro-diverse people just living their life, going through struggles, coping, having fun, and getting their romance on.This is a delightful read. “Get a Life Chloe Brown” delivered unique, lovable, challenging  characters, and Dani’s book is a fantastic read all on its own. The Ansari family is a wonderful addition to the Brown family."
"I had a hard time getting through this book. Although I really like that the author is creating stories about people of marginalized identities and cultural backgrounds, I felt that the story line was completely predictable and not humorous as book reviews suggest. While at the same time we need culturally responsive stories where people can see themselves reflected in the everyday. But ultimately I did not enjoy this one."
"This one was absolute perfection. I have very little words to accurately describe it, so just read it now. Okay?What I loved:-Dani’s insults and comebacks-When Zaf’s romance audiobook started playing out loud. Gah that’s what literal nightmares are made of.-the steam. Good lord, I read some of this while I was getting a pedicure, and I had to stop because I was convinced the woman next to me could read it & I felt like a perv. Also didn’t help that one of my students happened to at the salon, too."
"This book was DELIGHTFUL. Talia's prose is exquisitely crafted, hilarious and witty, pointed and sarcastic and smart as hell. Adored this romance that was also feminist, inclusive, and full of sex-positivity. As a bi woman, I loved Dani's bisexual representation - it made my heart so happy!Danika and Zafir are in my romance novel couple hall of fame now. I smiled the entire time! I am literally counting down the seconds until Eve's book!"
I definitely liked this book a lot. I also love Talia’s writing style. It’s very easy to read. This book to me was about learning about your feelings and embracing them. Not to cut yourself short because of past experiences; which I feel a lot of people tend to do after they’ve been hurt in the past…..I know I was one of those people and still can be from time to time. It’s all about healing and finding how to discuss certain feelings that can be a hard topic.
"Each Brown sister is so unique. Chloe was quirky, but I feel Danika was a little bit each one of us that has been hurt in a previous relationship. I wish we all can find a Zafir to heal our wounds as well. ""Loving you is the easiest thing I have ever done"", can Zafir be even more perfect? The narration was lovely, Ms. Butler was delightful. Can't wait to read Eve's story, even though I am sad it is the last book in the series"
"➵ 4.5 starsI'm sitting here with the biggest grin, pretty sure my face is going to hurt tomorrow, cause it's not natural to smile like this. Send help.Shoutout to my man Zafir Ansari who single-handed destroyed toxic masculinity by reading romance books and teaching boys that talking about mental health struggles does not make them less masculine. ♡I'm a #DrRugbae stan first and human second."
"I bought this story immediately after reading the first Brown Sister's novel. I was nervous that I wasn't going to like it as much as it's predecessor, and to be fair, I do still love ""Get a Life, Chloe Brown"" more. But this book is still a fantastic read! The prose is fun, engaging, and easy to understand. The story is interesting and the characters of Danica & Zafir are well-rounded and fun to follow. Their dynamic had no red flags for me, their friendship to romance was well-executed, and I do like how Zafir's past and subsequent anxieties were handled. Good representation, a great romance, and a fantastic sequel! I cannot wait to read this author's next book <3"
"I like this author and I liked the book. I really liked Zafir's character; a man who reads romance. The reason he discovered romance made sense and seemed like it could be a good coping or healing mechanism. Danika, as one of the Brown sisters, was appropriately sassy. I know women who have had similar reactions to last hurts - thinking there was something wrong with them instead of the other person. It was nice that these two slightly broken  characters were able to hold on and heal."
"I picked this up as something to read while hanging out at my boyfriend’s parents house and managed to forget where I was and who I was supposed to be paying attention to.I loved this so much more than Chloe’s book, not that I didn’t love Chloe and Red but I didn’t feel as connected to those two like I did Dani and Zaf. They’re precious, funny, and tangible. They felt real in that even their cheesy moments are replicable in real life. This doesn’t feel like a love story that’s impossibly out of reach (lookin at you, Darcy) but rather one that could happen to anyone, tomorrow.Dani is smart and capable and wholly sure of herself, until she isn’t and if that isn’t the most accurate representation of your 30s, I don’t know what could be. I want more of Dani and Zaf and I want it now."
"Amazing. I could not put this book down and I managed to sneakily read it during work. Dani and Zafir were such a great match, their differences made for dynamic chemistry. I wish the book had been longer. Can't wait for the next one!"
"I still think Talia Hibbert is a brilliant writer.Three stars, however, because the characters had changed, the issues had changes, but the story (and the sex) was the same. Apparently all three Brown sisters have absolutely no problem in the bedroom and the sex - with the perfect man, of course - is always mindblowing and earthmoving.Why the male protagonist had to be Muslim is beyond me. It did not add anything to the story."
"So great to read a love story with a character who looks like me and has complexity and intelligence. Very cute characters. And a very sweet modern love story. I love that it incorporates nerdy inside jokes, Internet commentary, memes and a few truly esoteric literary words that I had to look up. Did you know there was a word for throwing someone out of a window!?!"
"I absolutely love this authors voice. She can do no wrong with her writing style for me. I don't like the language she uses, though I also am not from the UK so maybe cursing all the time is common there. The intimate scenes are also a bit unsexy for me due to her graphic descriptions. But her turns of phrase are marvelous. I love them so much. Looking forward to the next book."
"A delight to read and a joy to escape into, Ms. Hibbert has crafted another great romance with memorable characters. It deals with serious issues such as grief and anxiety and as Dani would shudder to say, feelings, in a marvelously entertaining yet moving way. It’s got the 3 H’s (heat, heart and humor) done right. Highly recommend."
I may be prematurely writing this as I'm only 1/3 of the way through. But I love this author and I especially love this book. It's so decadent that I want to pace and savor every word I read. But my greedy hungry heart wants to just read it all in one sitting. The chemistry between these two is electric and the humor is just a balm to my soul given the turmoil in the world today. Bravo TH for writing such an incredible story.
"As I commented  in my review of the first book of this series, I am totally blown away by the beautiful character development and the delicate, tender handling of serious health issues, including in this one clinical depression and anxiety.But these are above all,  stories about LIVING, about the ongoing struggle for a happy life.I've preordered the last one..."
"I adored Chloe Brown, but I loved Dani Brown! Seriously, so much sass and brilliance. Zaf can get it. Any time. Anywhere. I also loved seeing men and women on the page who aren't described as unrealistically ripped and lean and muscular and perfect. People with curves and stretch marks and dimples are hot too!"
"Outside of the wonderful, fun, quick writing that makes this book so enjoyable, I needed this story. I needed to witness a character be loved without going through roller coaster struggle. I enjoy the steadiness of the story. I’m floored by how many turns of phrase I use that I read— like little omens— that I was supposed to be with this story. I was supposed to be with it to collect confirmation, evidence and tracking information for the possible in advance."
"I had the first book in the series for months before I read it. I loved it!! I had to buy the last 2 in the series right away. Great books and they got delivered quickly. I have been trying to support smaller bookstores as of late, so it's rare I buy books from Amazon anymore. But, I think I got these here b/c I had a gift card."
I have to say after reading “get a life chloe brown” I knew I had to get this next book.This has become one of my favorite booksI appreciate being represented as a curvier woman. I was drawn in from chapter 1.Since reading this book the first time I catch myself re-reading my favorite parts and I get butterflies everytime I read the steamy parts.Talia Hibbert has easily become one of my favorite authors.
"Satisfying romance about facing the roadblocks you place in ypur own way due to past emotional trauma and the necessity of reframing your view to move forward. Contains a lot of profanity (and of course, sex), in case that bothers you."
Talia Hibbert is one of my favorite romance authors. You can tell she really cares about her characters and the gray areas of physical and mental health in a way that comes across naturally. Her writing gets better with each book she writes. I’m looking forward to reading her next book.
"I loved this book - Talia Hibbert’s work is a little hit or miss for me but this is her at her best - sweet and sexy; convincing characters; a real emotional arc but not too angsty. Funny, too. Hits all the right spots."
Didn't quite understand the main character in this book. And don't understand the premise of this book. It seemed to me that the writing was all over the place. I had more questions than answers by the end of this book.
I love her books and I hate I have to wait a whole year for the next one. Zaf and Dani were so cute and also sexy while also humorous.  This book was just what I needed to take my mind off of the pandemic. Thank you Talia for that!
Meh. This book was meh for me. I enjoyed the fake it til we make it trope and I loved watching the chase with Zafir but at the end I found myself wondering about other things while reading.
"Talia Hibbert has done it again. Strong, beautifully flawed, and sarcastic main characters; black and brown characters who feel authentic; wonderful pacing and just enough angst to make the sweet even sweeter. Do yourself a favor and pick this up ASAP."
4.5 starsI don't have the necessary words to explain how much I adored this book!Fantastic story. Funny sexy and steamy.Perfect!Zaf is definitely a book boyfriend!
"Talia writes the best men. I adore them. The book had great pacing, plot, and sex. She does a wonderful job at giving us full and complete people individually, and them into a compatible, swoon-worthy couple."
"I love, love, LOVE this novel. The chemistry, the wit, the relatability of Talia’s stories and characters keep me coming back every time -and I am never disappointed! You won’t be either. Dani is a booked and busy gothic dream and Raf is the most lovable grump. The two are such a magnetic couple and I adore their conversations. Go, buy, read!"
Loved this book! She has continued the series and makes me want more! Can't believe there is only one more book left for me to read. I'll definitely be sad once The Brown Sisters series is over for me. Definitely plan on reading her other books after how amazing these were.
"I had recently finished ""Get a Life,  Chloe Brown"" which is why I started this one and it did not disappoint.  Dani is the perfect mix of wit, confidence, and peculiarity. I loved her evolution."
"Lawd, Zaf. Where can I get me one of him? I absolutely loved this book. I missed the characters when I had to put the book down. I recommend this series. Cannot wait for Eva's book."
Omg this was amazing! I didn’t think that the next two in the series would be as good as the first. Bc usually nothing beats the first (but maybe that’s just in movies??) but wow this book was so good! and it made me tear up just a little bit (actually I was sobbing but whatever 😂) definitely very good book. I’m obsessed with all the Brown Sister books!
"Very cute story line, steamy love scenes and humorous moments. Maybe I didn’t read enough reviews because I was a little caught off guard by the witchcraft references. Overall, It was a cute read."
"Dani is my kindred spirit. Treating love as a goal and excelling so hard in it. Love the relationship with her sisters  Eve and Chloe and happy that even though this is romance,  sibling relationship is something that Hibberts continue to explore in her books.This book is absolutely adorable btw."
"I loved, lived, and breathed this book! They're relationship is so adorable and they're struggles are really relatable! I cannot recommend this book enough!"
I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the first book in the trilogy. These women are great complex people. Their men are great. The sex scenes are great. I'm happy I discovered the Brown sisters.
"I’ve read the first book and it was good, but I absolutely loved this book. It made me smile most of the way through and I really liked both characters. I will be reading the 3rd book in this series."
"Talia Hibbert is one of my favorite modern writers and this book does not disappoint. I appreciate reading about multidimensional black women, so this book was a treat. Please keep them coming."
"Fantastic read. I loved Dani and Zaf, and their wonderful banter. I laughed out loud SO many times! Can’t wait to start reading sister Eve’s story."
"Yeah, this book genuinely makes me want to fall in love. It’s actually sick how much I relate to the Brown sisters but this one….. it took me 5 full days to finish what usually would take a night. I think I learned something about myself with this one."
"I loved Chloe's book, but the author really outdid herself on this one. The two characters were differentially charming and hurt and you just wanted to give them both a hug. Normally with the fake dating trope you want to scream at the characters to stop being dumb, but here you know too much about why they act those ways and you just want them to help each other heal. And the ending did not dissapoint. #DrRugbae for life."
"Do you want something smart, that isn't ableist or racist, but still is a romance? Something not misogynistic? SMART?!?! Yeah, you got it. Plus, the author paints a brilliant story."
I’m a sucker for fake dating and I really enjoyed this one. As with all Talia Hibbert books I got misty eyed at several very sweet moments.
I’m I loved this book so much. I connected with Dani on such a deep and fundamental level that at times it felt like my own thoughts were on the page. This has become my favorite romance book of all time.
"Picked this up after finished Get a life Chloe Brown, with some high expectations and oh man, it surpassed them. I liked this book better than the first and now I’m just longing for something similar. Can’t wait for the third book to be released next year. Loved Zafir and the complexity that Talia gave him."
"This book was awesome. It had a little bit of everything.  I enjoyed every page and hated than it had to end. The storyline felt so real and Danika and Zafir were so realistic, that if they actually existed you would want to meet them. They made you feel what they were going through. Not a boring page. Talia Hibbertt did a great job."
I am beginning to think all her books are fabulous. I am sad I have read all her books and have to wait for more.
Absolutely loved this book! Dani and Zaf are such relatable characters! Steamy in all the right ways while still being so sweet!
"I read this book in one sitting, laughing out loud the entire time. It was fab, funny, and real. The best."
"I thought the Beatles said it best, but I was wrong.  I have not felt this good about falling in love for a long time.  This book broke my dry spell."
"I have BIG LOVE for Zafir Ansari!! But I was NOT vibing with Dani Brown. I was SOOO frustrated with her whole attitude. I still love the series and I love the writing style, but she was so irritating! Going to keep going though because I love love! 💕💕💕"
"If you're new to romance or romcoms, this is THE series to start with."
Even better than the first book in this series.
I loved Dani and Zaf. I enjoyed the role reversal where Dani had trouble with her emotions and Zaf loved romance novels.  It was funny and brilliant.I can't wait for Eve's book!
"It's new, a book, great shape."
Loved this book. I can’t decide if I liked the first book better. The raunchiness was definitely turned up in this book. How about I say it was equally as good as the first book which is very difficult to do.
This book has magic in it.Talia Hibberts is an amazing writer and she really knows how to write complex diverse characters. Dani Brown is probably my favorite sister.
Highly Recommended
I expected Dani Brown to be a perfect story and it was. What more is there to say? Read it.
The brown sisters rule my heart!
So flipping good. Pure perfection. Sigh.That is all.
Another book with a strong black woman main character and currently one of my favorite romance novels with two POC characters! I relate so much to Dani’s intellect and drive for knowledge and acceptance! Zaf if definitely the ideal man!!!
"This was a witty and glorious read. I loved Zafir and Dani, they were perfect. Can't wait for Eve's book."
"Honestly, it was fantastic. And Lord so detailed. I loved every moment. Such a good book! And love the fact that mental health is addressed."
"The witty sarcasm, the Black, need lead, the romantic, Muslim man…. Just perfection. I’m a slow reader, like really slow, and still finished this in a day."
I’m so glad I gave this a chance! Very believable plot and characters! Such an endearing story! I particularly appreciated the discussions around mental health and self-care!
"Listen, any romance novel that has a causal mention of anal for an anniversary - count me in. Talia Hibbert writes amazing, realistic, nuanced characters that everyone can relate to. Oh, and the story is SUPER hot."
"Fun, easy, quick read for a short and exhilarating escape from everyday mundane reality. Cozy up with a glass of wine or tea for a gentle reprieve."
Loved this 2nd installment in the Brown Sisters series...Zaf was such a cinnamon roll and I loved the chemistry between him and Dani...can't wait for book 3!!!
First book I’ve read by Talia Hibbert and I loved it. I’ve already ordered the other two books from the Brown sisters and I can’t wait to read them!
I want to say I’ve enjoyed all three books in this series everything about this is very enjoyable and lively to read
Perfecto
Great story love the Muslim representation. 👍
I love Dani and Zaf they’re so cute and Zafir is literally the best man in this series
"This book was fun, cute, and dreamy. I'm now super invested in reading all of Talia Hibbert's novels. Read it!"
a cute story line and a lovely read
My Favorite Book of 2020.
"I'm hesitant to write this review because the majority of negative or critical reviews I have seen for this book have come from people who, in my opinion, just don't like confident, sexually proactive Black women. I PROMISE, I have no issue with any of the above - I was excited to read this specific book because I am a Black sex-positive bisexual woman eager for more representations of Black women being fun and smart and desired and vulnerable and ALL THE THINGS other characters are allowed to be while Black woman characters barely exist (especially in romance novels). I am a huge fan of Talia Hibbert - I have devoured almost all of the rest of her back catalog and loved almost every word she's written. I absolutely adored Talia's first book in this series (""Get a Life, Chloe Brown"") and really truly expected to love this book just as much (if not more). I hate using comparisons to other works to critique the quality of a book but I'm afraid I can't help it with this one - I'm disappointed to say that ""Take a Hint, Dani Brown"" was enjoyable enough and had a lot of really excellent aspects to fall in love with, but while I fell in love with Chloe Brown within a chapter of reading about her, I struggled all throughout ""Take a Hint, Dani Brown"" to warm up to Ms. Danika.On paper, Dani is everything I could hope to love in a character - she's a brilliantly smart, hysterically smart-mouthed, sexy, confident, curvy Black bisexual professor-by-day witch-by night who takes no sh*t from anyone. I fully expected to adore Dani without reserve or hesitation. Imagine my disappointment when I found her character to be absolutely frustrating and difficult to connect with. Dani is a study in contradictions - despite all her seeming confidence and bravado she read as having very low self-esteem and overcompensating to cover it. She engages in friends-with-benefits sex then proceeds to throw all the ""friend"" parts out the window (if you don't care about the emotional well-being of your friends just because you've started sleeping with them then you're a sh*tty friend, that has nothing to do with not wanting ""romance""). I have no qualms whatsoever about engaging in casual sex-only situationships - there's nothing wrong with knowing what you want and asking for it and if what you want is no-strings sex then more power to you, but I never felt like that was what Dani truly wanted. Her reasons for not engaging in romantic relationships (once finally revealed) were disappointingly paltry - here was this strong, secure feminist claiming to not care about what any man thought of her resigning herself to a life of empty emotionless entanglements all because she had one bad experience with one guy? This confident, empowered woman letting one man and his terrible behavior and cruel comments dictate the way she lived the rest of her life?? I'm sorry but she let a couple of bad dating experiences convince her that she was completely unworthy of dating! There was so much to love about Dani as a character - she was smart, fun, witty, and wonderfully crass with a lovably relatable nerd streak and drive to achieve and I was rooting for her to finally take the blinders off but it took SO long for her to finally get it, and all it took was a nice little convo with her sisters? I just didn't buy it. By the time she was running out on Zafir supposedly because she'd realized that she really couldn't hack it in a relationship, I was just done with her and her unrealistic issues.Zafir on the other hand was a complete and utter JOY. I loved him from the moment he appeared on the page. His wit and charm are undeniable and he has no problem keeping up with Dani at every turn - their banter is some of the most entertaining, charming dialogue I've ever read in a romance novel. Talia Hibbert is completely unmatched when it comes to creating effortlessly witty dialogue and she's one of my favorites when it comes to narrative voices. Every story of hers I've read has had me laughing at random asides and unexpected narrative detours and this one was no different. I found myself eager for when the story would switch back to Zafir's POV - he was endearingly grumpy yet kind, and sweet while still being bitingly clever and strong-willed. I especially appreciated his casual feelings on toxic masculinity and the way he struggled with but managed to deal with his history of depression and anxiety. Hibbert's easy yet conscientious handling of sensitive issues without making them into an afterschool special is really commendable (that's not an easy balance to manage). I was rooting for Zafir from the second I found out he listens to romance novels at work (literally the first moment we meet him) and I never stopped. He's endlessly patient with Dani (far more than I managed) and so supportive of her and all her interests and goals. Every interaction he had with his family and friends down to the kids he coached made me love him more and more. Everyone in his life adores him and it's easy to see why.Zafir and Dani's friendship-turned-relationship is actually very sweet and realistically developed (none of that instalove, which I cannot stand). They are both supportive of each other, both in their career paths and emotional health. I wish I had connected with Dani's character more because her friendship with Zafir was so satisfying, just a good, wholesome depiction of a strong foundation for a relationship. Unfortunately, Dani's weird issues and her refusal to deal with them (or even acknowledge that she had them) until practically the last third of the book made it so hard not to get frustrated with her. Zafir takes such good care of Dani and makes no demands on her, and even though we do get a few great instances of Dani taking care of Zafir in return (his panic attack in particular was a wonderfully written scene), their relationship felt so unbalanced. Zafir deserved so much better than a lot of what he got and only his big heart and profound care for Dani saved their relationship from being a complete waste of time. I enjoyed the resolution to the conflict between them and that Dani was the one who had to work for Zafir's forgiveness after what she put him through (even though he didn't see it that way). The Epilogue definitely went a long way towards reconciling my problems with Dani as a character but, unfortunately, it was too little too late.I'm going to reread this book in a couple of weeks to see if I like Dani a bit better on a second pass - maybe my expectations worked against her. I hate to put my entire disappointment for this book squarely on Dani's shoulders, especially when there really was so much to like about her, but so much of what I didn't enjoy about the book was connected to Dani's weird complex stemming from one dckhead ex-boyfriend. Compared to Chloe's reasons for avoiding relationships (yes, unfair to compare, I know), Dani's issues seemed small potatoes and compared to Zafir's issues (we're talking TRAUMA here), I just couldn't forgive Dani for her refusal to just GET OVER IT."
"Alright, so I listened to Get a Life, Chloe Brown earlier this year, which was a solid four star read for me. I enjoyed the enemies to lovers story love and Chloe and Red’s banter. That being said, Talia with Take a Hint, Dani Brown, Talia Hibbert knocked it out of the park (Note: this book can be read as a standalone!).27 year old Danika ‘Dani’ Brown is a highly ambitious academic whose sole focus is her career. Both a Black and bisexual female, Dani doesn’t have time for romantic entanglements. She appreciates the orgasms, but everything else takes a backseat to her career goals.Zafir ‘Zaf’ Ansari is a former professional rugby player who is now a security guard at the University that Dani teaches at. Zaf is your typical standoffish and brooding male who has clipped interactions with Dani…or so we think. Little does Dani know that Zaf is actual a huge romantic who is addicted to romance novels and dreams of happily ever after.After a social media misunderstanding, Dani and Zaf find themselves at the center of attention. They realize this would be the perfect opportunity to get free publicity for Zaf’s charity, but the caveat is that they actually need to be a couple. That’s cool. They can fake it. But what happens when the sexual tension finally boils over? Can these two just be friends with benefits or will they inevitability catch feelings?Before I get into straight gushing, I want to comment on both Dani’s and Zaf’s characters. I love that Dani is upfront and honest about her sexuality. She makes no excuses and could care less what anything thinks. Dani also knows the struggles of academia and refuses to let academia beat her down, which happens to females (especially Black females) too often. Zaf. Oh my heart didn’t realize how much I needed a male character like him. He has this rough exterior but he’s anything but. He is a true romantic at heart. He battles with both anxiety and depression, and Hibbert does a phenomenal job of addressing both of those with grace.In terms of plot, the reason why I connected with this one so much more than Chloe was because there is a level of trust and respect between Dani and Zaf even if it’s not acknowledged at first. Of course there are still jabs and banter, but you can tell how much these two meant to each other just from their work interactions before the whole fake dating even started. I mean come one, Dani brings Zaf coffee every day and Zaf always has a protein bar for her to make sure she eats (if that’s not love I don’t know what is).Now, y’all already know that there was going to be steam in this book. Hibbert has already proved that to us in Chloe. While I felt like most of the time, Chloe and Red had anger sex due to their initial hatred of one another, Dani and Zaf just felt natural. The sex wasn’t gratuitous. Honestly, I just can’t get enough of those two.Overall, if you didn’t read any of the above, just pick up this book. It’s incredible, and I promise you it’s worth it.Thank you to Avon Books for providing a review copy. This did not influence my review. All opinions are my own."
"Danika Brown is driven. Driven to succeed. Driven to be herself. Driven to begging her goddess for an orgasm or six. She needs a sexual partner, not a romantic one. Or at least that's what she thinks. But when a safety drill ends up leaving her trapped in an elegant who comes to her rescue but the romance reading hunky security guard, Zafir. Unfortunately his rescue is captured on film and the two go viral as couple goals. The problem, they're not a couple.Zafir is a romantic. Believes in happily ever after school. And has the biggest crush on Dani Brown. A former pro rugby player he gave up fame and disappeared after a traumatic loss. And not the sports kind but the family kind. Now years later his charity to help boys confront their feelings rather than succumbing to toxic masculinity is floundering. He needs a boost. And the boat comes in the form of that viral video.Now he just needs Dani to pretend to be his girlfriend without falling in love with her...Oops.---This is a really lovely read.  I found myself relating to both Dani and Zaf throughout the story. The internal monologue is done just right so it never becomes navel gazing, but it's also super on point.I loved the portrayal of paganism/Wicca in this story and also that there are differing shades of practice for all religions.  Zafir is a beautiful wonderful beta romance hero... And we could all use some Zafir in out lives.  I also loved that the core of the book featured two real truisms... 1. Find someone who loves you for who you are... Warts and all.  And 2. Happy endings are what you make of them and they look different for different people.In all this was a lovely book that I am happy to give...Five Stars"
"I absolutely loved this book! It was hilarious, heartfelt, and oh so sexy. Zaf was everything I love in a book boyfriend. Loyal, sweet, kind hearted, thoughtful, and that perfect amount of possessive alpha (who’s actually a giant teddy bear). He is definitely going into my book boyfriend hall of fame.Watching Dani and Zaf’s friendship evolve and grow was wonderful. The fake dating trope is always a fun one and this played out perfectly. I loved Zaf and Dani’s chemistry and the build up was so delicious. There was a little predictable drama at the end, but it still felt true to the characters and I appreciated that it was resolved just as quickly as it began.I both listened and read this one and the narration by Ione Butler was fantastic! She truly elevated the story to a whole other level. She gave such an emotional performance, but also had perfect comedic timing. Talia Hibbert’s writing is phenomenal and I can’t wait for Eve’s story next!Audiobook ReviewOverall 5 starsPerformance 5 starsStory 5 stars"
"My Thoughts:Take a Hint, Dani Brown by Talia Hibbert brought old fashioned romance and swooning to a modern day love story.  Danika Brown is an independent, intelligent, strong, fierce, scholar and professor.  She is an intellectual who thrives on her career, and this is her top priority.  Dani doesn't think she is cut out for romance, as it doesn't come natural to her, and her past relationships have ended in disaster.  She wishes for a partner where she can have a purely physical relationship without any romantic or emotional entanglements.Zafir works as a security guard at the same university where Dani teaches.  They are friends that bring each other breakfast, have fun exchanging pleasantries, and think highly of one another.  Underneath their friendship is a sizzling chemistry that they both have never addressed.  When Zafir rescues Dani during a practice fire drill, and carries her out of the building, their image with the romantic and adoring way they are looking at each other, goes viral with the #DrRugbae.This is when Dani learns that Zafir use to be a professional rugby player, and has started his own sports charity where he teaches rugby as well as positive mental health strategies to adolescents.  He asks Dani if she will participate in a fake relationship with him, as the publicity of them going viral has already started helping his charity exponentially.  She agrees, because what would be the harm in helping her good friend with a great cause; and she can might be able to convince Zaf to indulge in a fun friends with benefits arrangement while they're at it...I loved the characters in this story!  Dani was unconventional, brilliant, fun, quirky, and endearing.  She had challenges with tapping into her emotions, but in no way did this take away from my love of her character.  She was kind hearted, and thoughtful.  I enjoyed her interactions with her sisters Chloe and Eve, as well as her best friend Sorcha.  They were such a tight-knit group, and I felt like they were my friends too.  The characters felt real, because they were so wonderfully flawed and human.Zaf stole my heart!  I adored him.  He was so sweet, kind, and romantic.  The way he treated Dani took my breath away.  He was a modern day ""prince charming.""  I was shipping #DrRugbae from the very beginning of this story.  It was clear that Dani and Zaf were meant to be, and I enjoyed every moment of their love story!If you are looking for a story that will entertain, delight, and make you feel like you are falling in love right beside the characters, check out, Take a Hint, Dani  Brown!"
"This book is so freaking good I can't believe how much I fell in love with not only the romance but both Dani and Zaf! This book gave me ALL the feels.Zaf is literally book boyfriend material. There were so many times while reading this book that I found myself thinking ""god if you send me a man like Zaf I promise I won't run away and I will gladly give him my heart"". He is so freaking perfect in a way that is so human that even his imperfections make him perfect. I loved his family, his past and how strong he was despite everything. I also loved how he's this stoic, grumpy big guy who loves to read romance books and has zero shame in it too.Dani is a character that I related to a lot. She keeps her heart sheltered and is not about that romance life at all. She's someone who is so afraid of being hurt that she's really missing out on so many opportunities in life. She's smart, beautiful, incredibly kind and has such a warm heart. And even though she's incredibly confident she is also very insecure when it comes to emotions and feelings and it's left her stunted. Even as I found myself getting irritated with Dani for a few seconds here and there, I couldn't hate her because I understand where every action was coming from. I just kept hoping that she'd take a chance and I'd get the opportunity to see what her character development could look like...and I got both.The romance is...*dreamy sigh*. Fake dating is such a fun trope and this book gave me a new found adoration of it. It's not a trope I actively search for but it was so well done here and the trope was used well in adding to their development and carrying the plot along while also leaving room for secondary plots as well. Their chemistry was also off the charts hot but I think that was in large thanks to how devoted Zaf was to Dani. You could feel the emotion and just intensity of every touch on the pages...argh I just can't explain it but they are AMAZING TOGETHER AND I LOVE THEM SO MUCH.I cannot thank fate enough that I ended up winning this book in a Goodreads giveaway! This book took me by surprise and with fate playing a role in this book, I can't help but feel like it was a sign that I also won this book when I almost didn't even sign up to begin with. This is definitely a favorite read of 2020 and I can't wait to read Eve's book next year (but also I'd love a book for Sorcha thank you very much)!"
"3.5 starsThis second entry in the Brown Sisters books can easily be read as a standalone. Danika Brown is a strong heroine - confident, sexy, scary smart and seemingly very sure of herself. She has a little daily mini-flirt going on with campus security officer Zafir. Unbeknownst to her, Zaf is a former famous rugby player who experienced a personal tragedy and sort of dropped from sight.When he impulsively carries her out of a building during a disaster drill, it makes a big splash on social media. Zaf is trying to fundraise for a charity he started so the publicity is good news. He and Dani teasingly agree to faux date each other for a month to kick up more interest in Zaf's charity..Zaf is almost too good to be true -- handsome, muscular, sensitive, loyal and very family centric. He struggled with depression and the book delves into his coping mechanisms a bit.There is great sexual chemistry between the two from the get-go. But Dani has been burned and refuses to consider getting involved with anyone on anything other than a purely physical level.Zaf on the other hand, reads romance novels because he wants to affirm that life can have happy endings. How can they reconcile their vastly different expectations?Thanks to the publisher and to Net Galley for providing me with an ARC in exchange for my honest review."
"Fake relationship?•I’m trying to squeeze in all my other buddy reads this month besides all the vampire books. I was really excited that the #gingerkingdombuddyread this month was a book, not only on my TBR, but one that I could finally get as a digital borrow. I loved the first book in this series, Get a Life, Chloe Brown, and I knew I was in for another fun, and steamy ride with Take a Hint, Dani Brown.•I did love this romantic and fast paced read, but it had something missing for me. I am a huge fan of the fake relationship trope, but in this story, both the characters have already been lusting and falling for each other for quite some time. I wanted more of the awkward tension of pretending while the characters fall for each other. I also had a little bit of a hard time believing that Dani was so intelligent and perceptive but was so oblivious to her own romantic sensibilities. Also, that she was so close to her family but no one noticed how broken she was, the two didn’t seem to go together.•Even with these little issues, Dani Brown is still a fun rom com with a swoon worthy love interest and plenty of steam. I’m excited for the next Brown sister’s story.•Do you enjoy the fake relationship trope?•Clean rating: 🧼1/2 for so much sex and dirty talk. It’s graphic and constant. Also, language.•"
"THIS BOOK WAS JUST MAGIC!!! OMG I loved it so much, it's crazy. I laughed, I cried, I swooned forever over Zaf, and crossed my fingers that Dani would figure out her own emotions. I cannot recommend this one highly enough!!Danika Brown is the middle of 3 sisters, and she's a bit of a control freak. Also, after a terrible heartbreak in college, she decided romance just isn't for her. She's had a series of friends with benefits, or similar short-term ""situationships"", and that's all she has time for. She's dedicated to her PhD studies, and her goals of professorship, and she has no time for a boyfriend, or a girlfriend. But, she's become friendly with the security guard at the campus building she teaches in, and though he's HOT, a little flirty banter and exchange of snacks is as far as it's gone. Until the emergency drill gone wrong.Zafir Ansari is a former pro rugby player, who gave up his career due to a depression and anxiety overload after the sudden deaths of his father and older brother in an accident. Now, he works security at the university, and on the side he runs a non-profit he started, where he teaches teenagers rugby, and emotional maturity, and coping skills. He's wanted Dani Brown since the first day he saw her, but they've become friends, and she's never expressed any interest in taking things further. But, they ARE friends, and after he saves her during the drill, and a video of him carrying her out of the building goes viral, with their own hashtag, he's getting a lot more attention on his charity. He asks if she'd consider having a fake relationship for a while, to take advantage of the attention for as long as possible.Zaf and Dani's chemistry was wildly hot, and I loved their flirty, funny banter. They really did care for each other as friends, so as they opened up even more about their lives, and their pasts, they came to care even more. It was so beautiful watching them fall in love, without even realizing it, and then when they each DID realize it?? BOOM. It was amazing. Zaf was so in touch with his emotions, and was a total romantic, while still being everything else you want in a romance hero. I mean, a hero who reads romance novels?!? Yes, please! Dani was about the opposite of that. She buried everything deep until she couldn't any more. She acted like she didn't really have any feelings at all, which of course never works in the long run. She was happy to admit friendship love, and love for her family, but beyond that she was a fortress, until Zaf sneaked under her skin.Zaf's family and best friend were so lovely, and Dani's best friend Sorcha was hilarious. The other Brown sisters, and grandmother, were amazing again, and getting a peek in on Chloe & Red from book 1 was delightful as well. The side characters here were so fleshed out, and added so much to the plot. They really helped the main characters come to terms with their issues, and figure out plans to correct their wrongdoings. I can't wait to get the final, youngest, Brown sister's book next!Truly, this book was something so special, and I recommend everyone read it immediately! I loved Get a Life, Chloe Brown so much, but I adored this one even more. It was seriously THE. BEST!"
"4.5 stars — I think I’ve found a new favourite author.  There’s just something about the quirky characters that Ms. Hibbert creates, and the kind of romance that just gets to my heart…mixed in with amazing depth, and it just works for me.I will say, no matter how delightful I find Ione Butler’s voice and accent, I finally had to accept that her narration wasn’t a good fit for me.  I LOVED listening to her say all the words, and her emotions were good.  But her pacing was just off for me.  There would be pauses where I wouldn’t expect pauses…and no pauses where I *really* needed them to understand a change in speaker, or something else.  Combine that with not that distinctive voices, and I finally had to accept that I was avoiding the book, no matter how much the characters and plot were sucking me in.  I bought the ebook and switched to it around 60%, and suddenly I was motoring through it.  Ah well, lessons learned.ZAFIR!!!!  Zafir my ginormous sexy cinnamon roll hero!!  He was a cupcake of a man mixed with a dirty dirty mind, and the combination just about killed me.  He’s most definitely going on the book boyfriend list.  I can’t wait to reread this book in the future so I can highlight a bunch of stuff from the first half.  Don’t get me wrong, the boy had his own issues to work through…but he made me swoon many many times along the way.  I LOVED his romance novel addiction.  I loved how open he was.  I loved learning about everything he had gone through, and what he struggled with in his mental health.  It may be weird to say, but I appreciated seeing him make so many strides, but still falter along the way at times…because that’s the reality with anxiety.  I ADORED what he was trying to do with Tackle It, and I cheered when (with the help of Dani) he figured out how to go that extra step.  And holy wow that boy was sexy as sin, with a dirty mind, and fabulous sarcastic comebacks.Dani…well Dani could be frustrating.  But you know what?  I still fell in love with her.  God, her wit just had me in stitches at times.  And I loved how smart she was, and how that juxtaposed with her struggles in emotional areas.  I even appreciated how strongly she held on to the beliefs she had about herself, because I think it’s so realistic.  She was hella stubborn.  It made it so emotional when she finally broke through.And GOD, the two of them together?  I mean, I was in from the first moments of banter.  And their chemistry just jumped from friendship to steaminess without a misstep.  And they still had fun and teased!  I love fun and teasing during steamy scenes!  It’s my jam.  They just fit one another, and I loved seeing them each blossom because of knowing one another.SOOOOO many great secondary characters.  It really felt like a romance in real life, b/c the family and friends were there along the way.So yeah.  I have a feeling if I’d read the whole thing, I would be rounding up.  But since I’m likely going to put this review under the audio, I’m rounding down for that aspect only."
"Dani wants a sign. Zaf checks his email. Hang on, don't think this is random. This is important.Dani Brown doesn't do relationships. It's not her thing. Not that she has time for them, anyway, as she is a PhD student and gearing up for the biggest moment of her professional life. That doesn't stop her from praying to Oshun to send her someone to, uh, keep her company. Or ogling the hot angry security guard at the building she works at.Zafir Ansari doesn't mean to look angry all the time--it's just his face. A former pro-ruby player, Zaf spends his time coaching rugby, working on his nonprofit Tackle It, and pining over gorgeous (and maybe gay?) Dani Brown. It doesn't matter. He doesn't really have time for a relationship. He just needs to focus on building Tackle It, and promoting his workshops for helping young men and boys conquer toxic masculinity.Then a drill happens in their shared building that ends with Zaf heroically carrying Dani out of the building, and then #Dr.Rugbae is all over the internet. Dani shrugs it off while Zaf freaks out as his past is revealed... but is pleasantly surprised when the internet stardom leads to an influx of donations to Tackle It--enough to fully get it off the ground. When Zaf presents the idea of fake dating for a month, Dani agrees; she can fake it for a good cause, and she likes Zaf well enough. What could possibly go wrong? And can Dani Brown finally take a hint?An amazing second book in the Brown Sisters series, ""Take a Hint, Dani Brown"" is full of laughs, sass, and fluff. So much fluff. It is a mixture of everything one loves in a romance: friends-to-lovers, fake dating, and, of course, happily ever afters. It was wonderful to return to the Brown sisters and see Chloe and Red again, but even better to get to know Dani beyond the lens of her sister's eyes.Dani is a fabulous, strong, dedicated woman and Zaf is so supportive of her! Dani wants to be her own person outside of being defined a relationship--fine and healthy!--and she goes through some serious personal growth as she figures out how to mesh her long-term goals and new things that she wants. Namely, something more than a casual relationship. And Zaf. I love Zaf! Zaf is an amazing hero, with an amazing family and best friend, and he's such a big grumpy-faced teddy bear who is an anxious mess who loves romance novels and his niece and helping people. I want a Zaf.I'm very interested to see what awaits the final Brown sister, Eve, in her book!"
"3.5/5 rounded up!Take A Hint, Dani Brown was the second book in The Brown Sisters trilogy.  Though we see a bit of Red and Chloe, this book can definitely be read as a standalone.Danika Brown is a highly intelligent, successful professor at a college.  Having been burned in the past, Dani has sworn off love and relationships.  However, Dani is a sexual being and craves passion between the sheets.  She prays to the goddesses to give her a perfect ""f*** buddy.""Zafir is an on campus security guard where Dani works.  They've taken up a friendly banter, with Dani giving Zaf a coffee in the morning for a caffeine boost and Zaf giving Dani a power bar so she remembers to eat.  After a planned drill in the building goes awry, Dani gets stuck in the elevator.  Borderline panicked (both she and Zaf), Zaf puts on his hero's cape and carries her out of the building in his arms.  His heroics don't go unnoticed and soon thereafter, Zaf and Dani are trending under the hashtag #doctorrugby.Somehow, the two friends realize the viral sensation could work in their favor, particularly for Zaf, who runs a non profit on the side.  But, to keep up the rouse, the two must pretend to be in a relationship.  Of course, one thing leads to another and the fake relationship brings out all the real feels.Tackling issues such as anxiety, grief and loss of loved ones, and infidelity, this book was a fun read but not all fluff.  I also loved that Dani is a bisexual, curvacious, black woman, however, these attributes are absolutely not her defining characteristics.  Too often in books about plus-sized women, the point is driven home so often that it no longer feels genuine.  You could feel Dani's radiance coming off the pages through her confidence, intelligence and the way in which Zaf reacted to and described her.I listened to this one on audio and really enjoyed the narrator.  She was animated and made the (many) intimate scenes steamy without being too racy (though they were pretty racy!).Playing devil's advocate, this book was certainly predictable.  Additionally, I found it incredibly unrealistic that both Chloe and Dani just happened to find two of the greatest men to have ever walked the planet, but maybe I'm just cynical :)Looking forward to Eve's story!!"
"This is the second book in The Brown Sisters series (but it can be read as a stand-alone) and it is another fun, flirty, sexy contemporary romance book by Talia Hibbert. I love her writing, and the Brown sisters are fierce women that you want as your friend.In this book we focus on middle child Danika. She is a driven academic determined to make a name for herself in her profession and can't be distracted by anything as frivolous as love. Danika asks the universe to send her a friend-with- benefits, and it answers by putting security guard and ex-rugby player Zafir in her path.Danika and Zafir had secretly been lusting after each other for months, but neither did anything about it. When Zafir ""rescues"" Danika during a fire drill and a photo of him carrying her goes viral, the ""couple"" are an instant social media hit. Because their instant fame is good PR for Zafir's charity, the pair agree to be a fake couple for one month - all for a good cause, of course. (yeah, right)As the duo spend more time together, their chemistry explodes into a breathless night of sex. But could it turn into more than just sex? Zafir, a hopeless romantic, is determined to break through Danika's walls, even though he has a few that need to come tumbling down himself. The journey to their eventual love match is cute and adorable to read.I love this author's writing style. It's effortless to read and her snark and humor is spot-on. I also appreciate the care she takes in writing about sensitive subjects such as mental health issues, grief and heartache. I think we can all relate to at least one of the issues her characters deal with in her books, and the honesty and compassion she injects into her writing is wonderful. As usual, the characters in Danika and Zafir's sphere are supportive and understanding, making it clear that none of us can make it through life without help.I love this book and highly recommend you read it, as well as the author's first book, Get a Life, Chloe Brown.I received a free copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."
"Consider me thoroughly charmed! Talia Hibbert has done it once again. By “it,” I mean create a beautiful and diverse cast of characters that make my heart squeeze with happiness. This friends to lovers // fake dating story was just what I needed. Danika Brown is the snarky, bisexual queen of my dreams, and Zafir Ansari is my new favorite grouchy cinnamon roll hero (crusty on the outside, soft and sweet on the inside).Once again, Hibbert has written a… prickly isn’t the right word, maybe tough and guarded (?) heroine. Those Brown ladies are tough nuts to crack, good thing their heroes are up for the challenge! I think the best part about watching Dani fall so, so hard is how subtly Zaf got under her skin. She made Zaf a priority in ways many people wouldn’t notice or understand. Of course, Zaf being in touch with his emotions, and Dani’s, sees the soft and kind woman under it all. He also sees the romance in the small ways Dani reaches out to him. It was a beautifully balanced romance once those two crazy kids figured it all out.One of my favorite parts of any Talia Hibbert novel is the rich cast of secondary characters that support and push the main characters in their growth. Both Dani and Zaf needed to grow individually to make their romance work. Their family and friends were the perfect catalysts for change.I did feel like there were parts of the dialogue that were pulled out way too long, and at times around the 70% mark, the plot started to drag for me. I just wanted them to get to it! Maybe that’s because I was so excited for my beloved characters to finally get their HEA. I also thought the fake dating plot point was thin, really thin. But it didn’t take away too much from my overall enjoyment of the story.Overall, this is another winner from the indomitable Hibbert! If you like charm, representation, and a hero that will make you feel swoon-y, this is the book for you!**I received an ARC of this book in order to provide an honest review**"
"I loved this a whole lot. I adored Chloe's story and didn't think this could meet my expectations but it did and then some. I love a fake dating trope. The readers know they're going to fall in love but the journey there is always full of new feelings, angst, and lots of will-they-won't-they.Typically when I read romance, I tend to like one of the main characters over the other. This is one of the rare occasions where I love both Dani and Zaf so much. Dani is such a charismatic character. She's brilliant at her work, full of life, boldly sexy, but also full of vulnerability and fears when it comes to romantic relationships. She prefers to keep things casual with friends with benefits. Then Zaf comes along and breaks down her barriers.I fell in love with Zaf. I haven't read many books where the male protagonist has anxiety. I've read plenty where they have depression but not really anxiety and panic. The fact that he runs a non-profit organization where he teaches youth about healthy emotional expression through sports. There's no room for toxic masculinity in this book! I loved how underneath the attraction, Dani and Zaf have a strong friendship where they just understand each other so well. There's one moment where Dani talks to Zaf about his anxiety and it just brought tears to my eyes. I felt like Talia Hibbert was speaking to me directly.Hibbert writes such beautiful descriptions of attraction and love. There were so many times when Zaf looks at Dani and thinks these wonderful thoughts about her. I feel like every person who desires romance deserves to find someone who loves them so unabashedly. The romance in this just made my heart feel so full and happy.In conclusion, Dani and Zaf truly are relationship goals. #DrRugBae"
"SQUUUEEEEEEE.Talia Hibbert does it AGAIN. Talia Hibbert writes real life SO well. And I know you're thinking ""but.. real life is (at the minimum) meh right now"" - WELL, you haven't been introduced to Talia Hibbert. Because Talia takes all the joy and warmth and pain and beauty and humor of being alive & human, and puts it in words that say I SEE YOU. I mean honestly, the level of DETAIL in this book.I don't know where to start. Dani is confident, snarky, smart, motivated, focused woman who knows what she wants and is unapologetic about it. Zaf is a loving caretaker with excellent RBF who reads romance novels. Their banter is A+++++. There is also a wonderful cast of secondary characters, several hilarious appearances by Chloe & Redford, and a tiny tiny subplot that made my heart explode into HEA joy.There is also twitter shade. There are 30 year olds who are not old enough to be stymied by technology and yet (*waves*). There is anxiety and depression and grief. There are jokes about Victorian orphans. There are beautiful conversations about mental health & relationships & vulnerability & success. And none of it feels forced or overwhelming. These are all parts of life that Talia includes in her book, because, well, they are a part of life.I find it very hard to imagine Dani and Zaf  & co are not walking around right now, smiling and scowling at people (respectively.) That's how full these characters are. The romance is swoon-worthy and also incredibly sexy.Honestly, this book made me cackle multiple times. Usually I would say laugh, but Dani Brown made me CACKLE. It's been 24 hours and I'm still walking around with a smile on my face so, yeah, read this.**Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for providing an ecopy in exchange for an honest review.**"
"This book captured my attention from the very first mention of the phrase 'honey on her tit' which just happened to be in the very first paragraph.  Take a Hint, Dani Brown by Talia Hibbert is a whirlwind of hot and anxious hero, bold and brilliant heroine, and adorably dorky dialogue.  Someone bottled perfection and it is this book.Danika Brown is an outspoken, full-figured, woman of color who is here to change up everything you thought you knew about romance heroines.  The way she spoke, her thought processes, her strange habits... everything about her character was either laugh out loud funny or so relatable that I was actually sitting there going, ""oh man, that's me, we're the same.""  It felt like I, as the reader, weren't sitting outside the book reading about her life, I was a part of her life. She's the kind of character you are honored to read about.Authors often think that if they're going to write an alpha hero he has to be possessive, brash, tough, and strong, both physically and mentally.  But Zaf is a example of what a man can be when they actively work against toxic masculinity (in fact, in the book he does work against it).  Zaf was a thoughtful, kind, quiet, romance-reading man (yup, you heard me right.  He's one of us!).  Whenever he opened his mouth I was positively stunned by the insightful things he had to say and, as someone who suffers from anxiety, it really meant a lot to read about a character who experienced similar symptoms.  Not to mention, it was nice that it was the hero with the disability and not the heroine like is most common.  I absolutely loved that Danika always thought she knew what was going to come out of his mouth but she was almost always wrong because Zaf was constantly blowing her expectations of the male form out of the water.Talia Hibbert has given new life to the romance genre with her characters that are both out of the box for the genre as a whole and also incredibly relatable.  These characters could be your family, coworkers, classmates, but you won't be able to put down this book without calling them your friends because they'll feel that real.  Take a Hint, Dani Brown is a pleasing, heart-warming, belly-laughing read that you'll be recommending to all your friends"
"Even though Take a Hint, Dani Brown is only the second book in The Brown Sisters series, I think it could quite possibly be my favorite comedic romance series to date!  I love the way Talia Hibbert combines sarcastic humor and swoon(y) romance seamlessly, BUT the difference between most other romantic comedy novels is the fact that there is so much depth packed into each installment!  The characters are extremely well-developed— so much so that by the end you feel like they are your friends lol!  Take a Hint, Dani Brown is a total and complete 5 star novel!  This book needs to be a the very top of your summer reading list—highly recommend!  I would like to thank the publisher for providing me this book in exchange for an honest review."
"In 2019 the first book in a new series by Talia Hibbert was released. After some trusted friends told me I needed to read it, I picked up a copy of Get a Life, Chloe Brown, and I fell in love with the Brown sisters as soon as I met them. They are all so different and have different personality quirks so I was excited when I heard the next book was Dani’s book. And I have to tell you, Take a Hint, Dani Brown was so much more than I expected. It was truly and amazing book.Take a Hint, Dani Brown is about middle Brown sister, Dani. Dani has a one track mind, and that track is her career. She has been completely focused on getting her PhD and furthering herself. But when she is caught in a compromising position with security guard and friend Zafir and people mistake them as a couple, Dani’s priorities slightly shift. Zafir could use her help. If they pretend to be a couple for a little while his business can get some of the exposure it needs. And if their fake coupledom comes with some benefits who are they to deny that? But what starts out as a fake relationship quickly becomes something more, something that causes both of these flawed characters to let their walls down. But is Dani to let those walls down or will Zafir be like everyone else and disappoint her?There was something I simply adored about Take a Hint, Dani Brown. I don’t know it is was Dani or Zafir or Dani and Zafir combined but the whole book just worked for me and had a magical romance feel. Dani and Zaf had the kind of relationship I love to read in a romance. They pushed each other and complimented each other at the same time. They were both hiding behind walls of their past for different reasons but they were also their to support one another when they were willing to break down those walls. Did I want to shake Dani a few times? Definitely, but I also understood she was just scared to not be enough and no one would make her understand that unless she was ready.It is really hard to explain what I loved about Take a Hint, Dani Brown. While I enjoyed Get a Life, Chloe Brown, Dani’s story was something I truly just loved. Everything just worked in this story for me and I think it will work for you. I highly recommend adding this book, this series to your TBR. You won’t be sorry once you meet the Brown sisters and their love interests."
"This book was sooooooooo good. This series is so good!Something huge about this series is that the classic romance novel gender roles are nowhere to be found. The men are the more sensitive and romantic while the women are a bit more abrasive and take a while to crack. It’s so good to see men portrayed who are willing to work around their partners’ quirks and take care of them as they are rather than “fix” them. It’s good to see a man find himself in an independent woman’s space and find ways to improve things for her instead of expecting her to bend to meet him. It’s just lovely representation of a different kind of relationship, and seeing it represented is so nice.The banter in this book is so, so funny. There are so many characters and they all interact so well. The Brown sisters and their grandmother all talk so similarly and it’s funny to see the family resemblance. And that’s the thing about this book - I was a little worried Dani’s narration would be identical to Chloe’s, but it just feels like family resemblance between the books. The humor and intelligence from the first book are still there, but Dani is definitely her own person.And..... the sex scenes?????!!!!! The SEX SCENES??? You will definitely be fanning yourself during this one. There is so much detail, it’s a little criminal. But it’s not done in a way that’s cringy or stiff (well, something is stiff, but it’s not the writing) so if you like realistic smut in books look NO further!!The plot can feel a little silly, with a fake dating plot, but the fourth wall kind of gets broken about that, which makes it feel like an inside joke.There’s also emphasis on anxiety in this story, especially in men, and the way that it’s brushed aside more easily for them at times. Zaf lives with a lot of anxiety and grief and with his nonprofit organization, he teaches young athletes how to manage their own mental health productively. It’s just a really sweet addition to a fun and sexy story. Same with Dani’s personal growth from someone who only likes casual sex to someone madly in love.This is such a good story with so much to enjoy!! Can’t wait for Eve Brown’s love story next year!!"
"I loved Get a Life, Chloe Brown so hard that I absolutely could not wait to read Take a Hint, Dani Brown! I had high expectations going into this book not only from loving the first one in the series so much, but I became even more hyped for it every time I saw a teaser or heard someone praise it. I had no doubts that it was going to be good and Ms. Hibbert so did not let me down. I just adored Take a Hint, Dani Brown, it was positively marvelous!I loved Dani’s story even more than I did Chloe’s, though I have to say that it mostly all due to Zafir. Don’t get me wrong, I love Dani too, she’s funny and we both think emotions are gross, so we totally clicked, but there’s just something about Zaf. I have been so excited to meet him because I love me a grumpy hero, like a lot and oh, Zafir was just perfect! He’s all gruff and scowly, but he’s just the swooniest, sweeetest, most lovely man ever — I loved and couldn’t get enough of him! Zaf is wonderful and brave and he completely and utterly stole my heart — I’m a total goner for him and I could gush about him forever!Get a Life, Chloe Brown made me fall in love with it while I was reading it and that happened with Take a Hint, Dani Brown too. It made me feel all giddy and warm and it made me melt. I laughed, I cried, there was no part of me that was disengaged with Zafir and Dani. They were just the most adorable couple ever and I wanted nothing more for them to get their happily-ever-after. Not only is Take a Hint, Dani Brown one of my favorite reads of the year, but I think Zafir is my favorite hero of the year — so read this book because it is AMAZING!"
"Dani doesn't do relationships but could really use a decent friend with some added benefits. Zaf doesn't do no-strings sexual relationships but when Dani and he end up going viral as ""couple goals"" - Zaf can't help but think that maybe Dani has more feelings for him than she wants to admit when she goes above and beyond the call of duty for a fake girlfriend.Between fake dating, going viral, and an openly romantic romance hero - how could I not love this book? Dani is highly relatable, logical, at times cynical, and always absolutely brilliant - and I love her. (BONUS: a bisexual heroine who doesn't need to prove her sexuality to anyone!) And I love watching her be utterly clueless as she fell for Zaf -  Hibbert is so talented that it felt unrelentingly consistent with her characterization, to boot! Zaf is literally a cinnamon roll with extra frosting and a gooey middle (plus a nice RBF) - and he destroyed me. (In the best way!) Not to mention he definitely loves Beverly Jenkins.There are a bunch of awesome themes as I have come to enjoy and expect from the brilliant Ms. Hibbert - including grief (and how it doesn't necessarily end); mental health and anxiety (and what living with that can really feel like); broken and beautiful families (that don't have to be formed with blood relations); being a supportive friend or partner (like being unbelievably proud and excited for their excitement!); striking a work/life balance (if that isn't pertinent in 2020...);One more thing - this is the best friends to lovers book I have ever read. They genuinely communicate, respect each other's boundaries, and never really try to hide their feelings!"
"Take a Hint, Dani Brown is another smash by Talia Hibbert for me. It's snarky and funny and sharp, and I just adore her characters.One of the best things about Hibbert's M/F romances is that they aren't the stereotypical weak woman needing to be rescued by the domineering man who never treats her as an equal. Dani and Zaf are on equal footing here. They both have issues to overcome, but they never--not once--treat the other as inferior or with little respect.Their snarky banter disguised as flirting is so damn adorable. One part that was particularly poignant for me was when Zaf and Dani are discussing Zaf's affinity for romance novels:""...I'll buy you a copy. No spoilers""""Except for the happy ending.""He laughed.. ""That's not a spoiler. That's a safety net.""And safety net it is. We all know, generally speaking, that the main characters in a romance story will find their happily ever after. It's the journey to that HEA and compelling characters that keep the reader interested. Hibbert hits all the marks here.Another thing I love about Tibbert's stories is the rep you may not normally see in traditional romance novels. Take a Hint has bi rep, person of color rep, anxiety rep, to name a few.I really do love the Brown sisters, their family, and their friends. I'm definitely looking forward to Eve's story.To end my review, I leave you with one of my favorite lines form the book:Faces were for sitting on, not for kissing.Oh, Dani! You are too much!"
"I really enjoyed Get a Life, Chloe Brown when I read it a few weeks ago and was excited to dive into this, as I’d heard it was even better. I can confirm that that is correct. Take a Hint, Dani Brown is such a fun read from cover to cover; I sped through it in just a few hours. Hibbert expertly writes complex characters, top notch banter, snarky but loving sisters, and delightfully sweet and passionate romance. I also appreciate that they write books with plot alongside the steamy scenes—I’m new to the romance genre and frankly not interested in all sex all the time. That’s not an issue here.I can easily say that this is one of the best books I’ve read in 2020, and that it’s a surprise favorite. Even though I openly call myself a hopeless romantic, I didn’t expect to enjoy something like this, that’s so far out of my literary comfort zone. But it had everything I love in contemporary stories, and I’m glad I took a chance. I can’t wait to read the final Brown Sisters book, and I can definitely see myself rereading the first two while I wait.Representation-fat Black bisexual protagonist-Muslim Pakistani-British love interest with anxiety-sapphic side character-Muslim side characters-side characters of color (ft Black and Pakistani rep)Content Warning: sexual content, mental illness, panic attacks, death, grief, emotional abuse, islamophobia, violence, depression, toxic relationship"
"First of all, the writing style is one that makes my romance-loving dirty little heart sing and dance and twirl.Dani Brown first appeared in book one, being Chloe's sister. She's getting ready to get her Ph.D. - love - so she's quite the smart gal. She loves both men and women, loves sex but doesn't believe in relationships. Having been deeply hurt in a previous relationship, she's done with them. The only things she needs in her life are her career and good sex.Enter Zafir, former Rugby player, and everything that is amazing and sweet and hot all wrapped up in one cinnamon roll character. He's also an alpha when he needs to be, mind you. And he's been crazy about Dani for months, so when the opportunity of them fake dating - oh, yes, this beloved trope can be found in this one - pops up, he doesn't say no. But things tend to get complicated, lines get blurred, as we all know - especially when really good sex is involved - so that's when the little bit of drama happens.I assure you, you will absolutely love this book if you'll read it. It definitely became a favorite of mine, one I'll be getting as a paperback to have on my shelf, so I can reread it. I also kinda want and need a Zafir. I swear, authors have got to stop writing all of these amazing characters, they ruin our expectations.Joke. Please don't stop writing them!So 5 stars, if you haven't guessed already."
"Hint: This Book is Perfection!If you’ve read Get a Life, Chloe Brown you know that, middle Brown sister, Dani isn’t known for her delicacy but she’s fierce as hell!  In Take a Hint, Dani Brown she finds herself smack in the middle of a viral moment with her friend/secret crush/would love to be bed buddies with Zaf.Zaf has fought his way out of depression,learned to control his anxiety, and is now channeling what he’s learned into a youth program. Oh, he also has the biggest crush on Dani Brown.  When #DrRugbae starts trending they see it as their opportunity to help each other and maybe get a little closer - at least physically, or at least that was the plan.I absolutely loved how Zaf and Dani see their own flaws but can only see the beauty and goodness in each other. The subtle things they do for each other and the way they commit to each other, even when they’re still “faking it” absolutely melted my heart.If you like fake dating, only this one time, and friends to lovers with a touch of grump and sunshine (they take turns being each of those - squee!) and a hero who speaks the language of romance novels THIS is the books for you!!!  And even if you don’t like those things, it’s still the book for you, it’s that good.I received a complimentary review copy of this book but all opinions are my own."
"Zaf and Danika's story was so enjoyable to read. I have to admit that I'm drawn to these books where the heroine is initially closed off to emotions or romance.Not only do I love a good role reversal, but I also appreciate reading about how the relationship dynamics differ when the woman is the one reluctant to succumb to all those pesky ""feelings"" lol. And of course, I can't forget that these books also have the most swoon-worthy heroes!Zaf was a complete sweetheart that was very much in tune with his feelings and the feelings of Danika. He understood her boundaries, and respected her need for rules in their relationship. I loved his open relationship with his family as well. Never hesitating in opening up to them or acknowledging their own feelings and going-ons as well.I do wish there was a little more page time dedicated to Tackle It though, considering it was the reason for their entering the fake relationship. I felt like it kind of fell off into the background, and we only got small looks into where that went. But luckily, it didn't feel like it was left unresolved.Danika was of course a harder character to warm up to. She was very closed off and stubborn to acknowledge her growing feelings for Zaf. But in between her bouts of being obtuse in the name of self-preservation, it was fun to see her be affected by Zaf. He completely wormed his way into her heart, despite her rules. And she slowly started to see that there were ways to make time for things and people that bring her joy. The growth she goes through in the end is totally worth reading through her stubborn ways lol.That epilogue was also a sweet look into their future, and I have to include that I loved the role that romance books played in this story as well. The reasons that Zaf gives as to why he loves romance novels were so on point and relatable to me.I'm very interested in reading Eve's book next! She seems to be all over the place, so it'll be fun to learn about who she is.*ARC provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review"
"This is the second in the Brown Sisters series, but it can absolutely be read alone. (You just get a cute glimpse of Dani's sister, Chloe and her guy, Red, from book 1, but beyond some characterization and a little tiny bit of their story thrown into a conversation, there's not really spoilers for Get a Life, Chloe Brown.)Danika (Dani) is teaching/working on her PhD and has closed herself off from ~feelings~ (except for her family and best friends) and prefers no-strings-attached dalliances with whatever gender she hooks up with. Zafir (Zaf) is a romance-reading ex-rugby player with a big heart and anxiety who's still living with grief. Zaf is also sporting a crush on Dani that he would never act on because he's all about respecting women and kind of thinks the spirited and smart-as-a-whip Dani probably isn't in to him, though they have a great friendship going as he's a security guard at the school. When a viral video leads to a fake relationship to help Zaf's sports charity, the simmering attraction between the two heats up and then boils over.There is so much to love in this book. The characters have depth and personality for days and the story is alternately fun and emotionally deep. I'm grieving a loss right now, and I really felt the parts that show Zaf dealing with his emotions while he still grieves the losses in his family. I thought Dani's sexuality and sensuality was presented so beautifully, with a perfect matter-of-factness and depth. She's unapologetically sexual and open and that is wonderful to see. Zaf's respect for her and who she is in all ways just hit so hard. All around beautifully done. They are so fun and so great together in all ways, and watching their journey, as people and as a couple, was just a joy.One of the fun things that I just have to mention is how Zaf reads romance novels. It's handled in such a fun and loving way (of course!) throughout the whole book, and it just felt like this beautiful love letter to the genre. Especially when times are tough, people turn to Romance, and to see that portrayed here just made me so happy.Having reading Book 1, I was not surprised how much I loved being in the Brown Sisters' world again. I can't imagine contemporary romance readers wouldn't flock to Talia Hibbert's books."
"After reading Chloe Brown, I knew I needed to read the rest of the Brown sisters’ stories. While this one wasn’t as good for me as the first, it was still an enjoyable read. I wasn’t sure if I was going to like Dani, as she seemed a bit cold in Get a Life, but I found quite quickly that I was wrong, I liked Dani a lot. I could really relate to her hesitation when it came to letting people in and running from emotional relationships. I loved how invested she was in her job, and that, for the most part, she had no problem stating what she wanted in her life and going for it. I also liked Zafir and his love for romance books, yet he had a gruff and sarcastic exterior, which I’m always drawn to. I do feel like the secondary characters in this book, such as Dani and Zaf’s best friends were fun but wayyy in the background, and I would have liked to have a bit more of both. ⁣⁣I had only read one fake dating trope before and DNFed because I struggled with the lack of communication between characters. While this book definitely toed the line, overall I think it did a better job. I think perhaps the real issue is that this will never be a trope that’s high on my list, though I don’t think I could have narrowed that down with only the one-book experience, so reading this did help in that regard. ⁣⁣I also lacked a bit of emotional response. Zafir has gone through something tragic that is pushing his story, but I just didn’t find myself investing in it emotionally. I’m not sure if that was the writing or me, but when Zaf would bring up his trauma my response tended to veer more on “in that sucks” rather than feeling the sadness that I usually do in books. ⁣⁣At the end of the day, I am happy I picked this one up. Even though it didn’t quite live up to Get a Life, I still think it was very good and I’ll look forward to any little glimpse we might get at Dani and Zaf when I eventually read Eve’s book."
"I really loved Zafir. He was a super cute, grumpy, gentle giant with a massive protective streak and very relatable anxiety issues.  He was swoony for sure and just so darn nice! I also loved how open he was expressing himself and got a kick out of his romance reading addiction!Danika was harder for me to get a handle on. I liked that she was brainy, sarcastic, and very goal driven. I liked how supportive she was of Zafir and how aware of him than she let on. What I didn’t like was how she hid her own emotional issues from him for as long as she did, without any true consideration for his feelings. Blind panic and all that I get, but the ending just flipped a switch too fast for me to really wrap my head around the dynamic change. I felt like I missed as much as Zafir did when all was revealed!Overall though, I really enjoyed Danika and Zafir’s story. There were lots of heavy topics addressed yet I never felt bogged down by any of it. The romance was super sexy, like holy smokes sexy, and there’s no denying the scorching chemistry with these two...but! Things are more than physical and I loved exploring the emotional nuances between Dani and Zafir.I received an advance reader copy from Netgalley/Avon and this is my honest review."
"I thought that the first novel in this series would be hard to beat but man, this book is just as good! I loved it!Along with the story being incredibly entertaining, there's so much positive representation including representation for the following topics: anxiety, bisexuality, grief/loss, and toxic masculinity.I absolutely adored both of the main characters but admittedly, I loved the main character of Zafir a wee bit more (I mean, how could you NOT?!). With that being said, I really liked and respected Dani as a character as well and share quite a few qualities with her character (not solely the most positive of qualities). I think both of these characters are not only realistic but incredibly relatable in their own way. I think it would be difficult to find someone that doesn't relate to either of them in some way.Similarly to the first novel, I can see how a lot of people may pick this novel up thinking it's an 'innocent' novel based on the illustrated cover. Well, my friends, you are about to learn today about not judging a book by the cover. This book is freaking HOT and I was all about it. You go Talia Hibbert because I'm buying what you are selling!In addition to being hot, this novel had me literally laughing out loud periodically. It was THAT funny. I love humour mixed into my romance (both in reality and fictional form) so I absolutely loved the comedic elements of this novel.Alright, count me in for a membership in the Talia Hibbert fan club. I seriously cannot wait to read more of her books and I'm certain that they will be entertaining."
"CW: Anxiety, on page panic attack, talk of death of loved ones and depression in the pastTo be honest, I knew I was gonna love this before I even started reading - not just because I’ve only seen rave reviews, but I just was expecting it after having so much fun reading Chloe Brown a few months ago. And it totally didn’t disappoint.The author is amazing at writing sassy sarcastic dialogue and banter, and it’s on full display here. I was cackling for the most part and I totally needed that in my current state of mind. But there are also moments of quiet reflection, communication, pining and absolute love - and it all tug at my heartstrings. What beautiful writing. And on top of it, she deftly mixes up my favorite friends to lovers trope with fake dating alongwith some viral social media video (which seems to be theme in many recent romance novels but I can’t say I’m a fan), and it was all just a delight to read. There is a decent amount of angst but not so much that it frustrated me (thank you very much) and the conflicts are also resolved very organically without dragging them out which I really appreciated. To top it all, I adored the use of text messages and Instagram comments interspersed throughout the story because they were so hilarious.The characters are definitely the highlight of this book. I would usually start with the female MC especially because she is the titular one here, but I want to talk about Zafir because he completely stole my heart. He is the definition of gentle giant, a retired pro rugby player who has anxiety and runs a charity to teach young boys how to take care of their mental health. He is extremely kind, compassionate, lovable and protective and just the perfect book boyfriend material. And he loves romance novels 😍😍😍. There’s one line he says in the book about how an HEA is not a spoiler but a safety net, and I related to it so much - it perfectly encapsulates my feelings about why I love this genre.Dani on the other hand is a workaholic academic who is confident and sexy and knows it, has high ambitions professionally, but is also insecure in relationships because of past experiences. I just loved how much she valued her work and worked hard to achieve her goals, but it was also nice to see her realize the importance of finding a balance.Both the characters grow a lot through their friendship, from Zaf learning to process his grief to Dani letting go of the baggage from her past relationships. Every scene of theirs together was adorable to read and I just loved their dynamic.All the side characters were also such caring and considerate people, and I loved all of them. The Brown sisters have such a fun supportive relationship that it makes me miss not having any, and both the MCs respective best friends are awesome. I particularly loved Zaf’s Pakistani family who are all sassy and lovely and again, made me miss home.To conclude, I know I’m repeating the word fun a lot but what can I say, that’s the overwhelming feeling I’m left with after finishing this book - fun and delight and joy. I highly recommend this to any romance genre lover, and in particular to anyone who wants to find an unforgettable book boyfriend."
"After reading Get a Life, Chloe Brown last year I knew that I had to read Take a Hint, Dani Brown!Dani Brown doesn't do emotional relationships. She's been burned in the past and doesn't want a repeat performance. Dani is also a practicing witch and asks the universe to send her the perfect no-string-attached partner.Zafir Ansari and Dani work at the same place and Zaf has kind of had a crush on Dani for some time now. When Zaf ends up rescuing Dani from a stalled elevator (super cute scene), they go viral with the hashtag #DrRugbae!I absolutely love a fake relationship trope and Dani and Zaf are faking it for the cameras constantly pointed at them - but how long does the faking last? I love a strong heroine and Dani Brown was amazing! She was so sure of herself - from her sexuality (bi-sexual) to her work on intersectionality in feminist literature.And Zaf...swoon! Zaf was so perfect. Not only was he a rugby player, but he also teaches kids on how to work through their anxiety. He has dealt with loss and anxiety over the years and there's no one better to teach young athletes on how to manage that. Zaf's family was also from Pakistan and I loved the Hindi/Punjabi works sprinkled throughout the book. It definitely helped me to relate to his character. Oh ... he also reads romance books!!!As always, Talia's writing was so beautiful. I have so many parts of the books highlighted that resonated with me. Whether it was the way Zaf felt about Dani or the way Dani was so passionate about her work and how was afraid of entering into a relationship. I love the chemistry between these two and was sad when the book ended!Take a Hint, Dani Brown was the perfect follow up to Get a Life, Chloe Brown and I can't wait for Eve's book next!!!I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher."
"Danika Brown knew what she wanted and what she didn't want. She was looking to become a star in her field, and though she didn't have time for feelings, she still had ""needs"". She thought Zaf would be a suitable friend-with-benefits partner, but this hopeless romantic may end up being the one, who worms his way into her heart.I fell in love with the Brown sisters, when they were first introduced in Get a Life, Chloe Brown. Each sister was so wonderful and unique, and it was such a treat getting to know Dani better this time. Watch out! Because Dani Brown is a force. I couldn't imagine how I would handle meeting Dani in person, because I was fully captivated by her on page. She was brilliant and driven, and wholly her own woman. She had a way with words, and often had me cackling.And, then, there was Zaf. My goodness! Talia Hibbert writes THE BEST heroes. On the surface, Zaf was this built-like-a-brick house former rugby star, who commonly wore a scowl. But, underneath, he was a sensitive man, dealing with anxiety and grief. He read romance books, doted on his niece, and quietly started a foundation to teach boys about mental health issues, while combating toxic masculinity.""Sweetie, are you crying?""""No,"" he said. ""I'm leaking masculine pain from my eyeballs.""The beauty of this union was that they both were so good for each other. He was supportive and encouraging of Dani's career aspirations, while she helped Zaf embrace his pain and grief. I relished those deep and tender moments, which Hibbert gave us in between the fantastic banter and steamy scenes. Zaf and Dani had an undeniable attraction and passion for each other, but they also had something that went much deeper. I had zero problems with this ship, and I was cheering for them the entire time.Overall: A funny and witty romance, which made me laugh, smile, and swoon."
"Take a Hint, Dani Brown is another Talia Hibbert masterpiece. Long time readers of my blog or my reviews know that I love love love Get A Life, Chloe Brown. It’s perfection and Dani’s story is just as fantastic.Talia Hibbert is so talented. She writes such amazing, down to earth characters. Dani is a super smart and witty bisexual woman. She is really focused on her career. Zaf, her love interest, is an ex-rugby player who loves romance novels (swoon!). He suffers from anxiety and yet runs a small charity for youth who often experience the same. Zaf is a hopeless romantic whereas Dani doesn’t truly believe in commitment.I love how Take A Hint, Dani Brown is the fake relationship troupe. I love how it tackles mental health and anxiety. I love watching both character’s personal growth. I love that Zaf just accepts Dani for who she is. He doesn’t’ try to change her…..he just loves her for her (my heart is melting). I love the cameos by Chloe, and Red and Eve. I love all of the side characters. I love how Dani and Zaf find their self-worth. And I really love how Dani and Zaf just make each other better.In case it is not clear, I LOVE THIS BOOK!"
"4.5 stars...rounded up!""Major or minor, if something keeps you human when pressure makes you feel like a volcano, hold on to that thing by whatever means necessary.""Dani brown is a really accomplished woman. She is a scholar and is working hard towards her PhD. She puts romance on the background but only because she's had bad experiences. Are feelings worth it? Dani doesn't think so but she's all for friends with benefits. Every morning Zafir, the security guard, gives Dani a protein bar and Dani brings him his (awful tasting) coffee order. They're friends with a flirty banter. One day there is a fire drill and Dani gets stuck. Zafir notices she's not outside and goes into save her. Someone videos his ""rescue"" of Dani and they go viral and better known as #DrRugbae. Zafir has a charity - Tackle It - and this newfound attention could help. Dani decides that her and Zafir can fake their relationship in order to help his charity. But can they keep it from becoming something more?I love Talia Hibbert's first book with Chloe Brown. If possible I may love Dani Brown even more or just maybe the same (so ALOT). Hibbert has this way of writing her characters to be so sarcastic but hilarious at the same time. This book has everything you want: a love story, steam, sarcastic banter and overcoming fears. I loved the banter back and forth between Dani and Zafir the whole time. It was like listening to a real couple and you could definitely start to feel the intense connection build up the more time they spent together. The author also touches on anxiety disorder and I think does a good job. I could relate to Zafir in some ways and I loved how Dani was patient and kind with him about it. Oh and loved the cameo of Chloe and Redford!Thank you to Avon books for my copy of this book. I definitely recommend this one and you should pick this up and Get a life, Chloe Brown if you haven't already."
"CW: General Anxiety Disorder, Mention of a death of a family memberTalia Hibbert quickly became one of my favorite romance authors last year. So, I was extremely excited to get the ARC of Take a Hint, Dani Brown. Unfortunately, due to a death in the family, this book went to the back burner. I finally found the energy to read, but my focus was all over the place. Instead of reading the ARC, I bought the audiobook from Libro.fm and dived in.This book was everything I wanted and more. Talia Hibbert knows how to craft characters with realistic flaws and scorching hot chemistry. I was a bit worried that I overhyped this book, but that worry faded the second I started this book.The best thing about this book was how adorable Dani & Zaf are. I loved their friendship, seeing the sarcasm, and watching their awkward moments. I appreciated that Talia Hibbert wrote Zaf with realistic anxiety. Anxiety is such a hard mental illness to show, and I loved that this was handled with love and care by the author and the characters. Something else that I loved about this book was the representation in it. Dani is a proud bisexual black woman, and Zaf is a proud non-practicing Muslim. I just loved everything about the characters.The plot was quick paced, cute, and everything I wanted. I  loved watching the characters flirt and get to know each other. There was just something beautiful about their relationship. This was a sweet romance where both Zaf and Dani took care of each other in ways neither one knew they needed. I loved everything about this book.All in all, this is one of my top reads for the year. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves witty romances. I laughed, I swooned, and I cried because the book was over. Do yourself a favor and read this book. You deserve this book in your life."
"I'd like to petition for an increase in potential star ratings because Take a Hint, Dani Brown deserves at LEAST 20 stars. It's a friends-to-lovers, fake relationship, grumpy one and grumpy one (but both secretly soft) dish of deliciousness. Dani is a (supposedly) anti-love, career and family focused woman who's just looking for her perfect friend with benefits, because who has the time or energy for a relationship? Ew. And Zaf is a romance-reading, ex-pro rugby player cinnamon roll who knows exactly what he wants. Unfortunately, what he wants is forever with a woman who only ever does right now.When a video of the two of them goes viral and everyone assumes they're #couplegoals, Zaf's nonprofit Tackle It, which uses rugby to help boys stay in touch with their emotions and deal with mental health issues, starts getting more attention. Which leads to more donations and more exposure. Which leads Zaf to a crazy idea: a fake relationship with the woman he wants more than his next breath. Somehow - miraculously - Dani agrees. But soon their fake relationship becomes a real ""no-strings"" affair, lines start to get real blurry, and soon they'll discover that a very real love is on the line.Full disclosure: I love everything Talia Hibbert writes. She's one of my favorite writers, so it really should be no surprise that I'm over here mooning over Dani and Zaf. They are just so PERFECT for each other. I also somehow feel like I'm both Dani and Zaf at the same time? Emotions are the worst but also I'm a romance-novel-reading mushy sap? (A status I am proud of.) I love-LOVE that Zaf reads romance novels and through him Talia perfectly encapsulates why I read romance in a way that my rambling self never could. Also, he reads Dani's essays. In the library. Before they're even in a fake relationship. And gives her protein bars because he knows she doesn't always eat. Swoooooon.I also really loved Dani's journey throughout the entire book. As with all our favorite supposedly emotionally-stunted MC's, Dani's problem is not a lack of feeling - it's an abundance. She was burned badly in her past relationships and made the decision to not be hurt again. Unfortunately, the insecurities those relationships created managed to dig their claws deep within her and whisper lies about who she is and what she deserves. I wasn't sure how to feel about Dani's complete dismissal of compromise in a relationship - her refusal to make time for another person. It almost made her a quote-unquote unlikable heroine. But then I (and she) realized that when it's the right person, it doesn't feel like a compromise and that it's not about making time, it's about balance and embracing joy. Dani has to work extra hard to come to the realization she is both capable of giving and deserving of the kind of love Zaf offers. And that dealing with emotions isn't a bad thing. And she reads Zaf's favorite romance novels to learn how to woo him. Heart eyes. So many heart eyes.Like I said. 20 stars.I received a free copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."
"I absolutely loved this book.  I've been a fan of Talia Hibbert for some time now and she just continues to impress me.  Hibbert produced a cast of characters that you can't help but love. She pulls you in and gets you invested in all the characters not just the main ones. I love how Talia Hibbert strives to present diversity and inclusion with her characters. It's a breath of fresh air to see so many people of different ethnic, cultural, and religious backgrounds in mainstream romance.I really like that Dani and Zaf are relatable even though I have nothing in common with them.  They aren't perfect, they face some of the same issues that we all do and they have to work through them. I found myself cheering them on through out the book.  I love the acceptance and the lack of judgement  between all the characters, how supportive Dani's and Zaf's families were,  and their relationships with their friends.One of Hibbert's biggest talents is her ability write humor, as well as incredibly moving prose, often in the paragraph. She has a way with words that can have you laughing out loud then minutes later giving you the warm fuzzies, for example Zaf saying ""his feelings for Dani were like sunlight: they'd always find a crack to slip through, a way to light things up."" I think I legit melted when I read that.Overall I throughly enjoyed the book and I'm looking forward to the next one."
"I liked this book.  It's a second in a a series and I love how the characters are diverse and so real.  Danika Brown is a smart, funny, bisexual, plus-sized black woman.  She feels very strongly anti-relationship but wouldn't mind some companionship and finds that with Zafir, an ex-pro Rugby player turned security guard at the campus Dani works at.  Zafir has had some loss in his past as well as anxiety that he has dealt with and is a romantic at heart.  A small incident leads Dani and Zafir to instigate a fake relationship and the story goes on from there.I laughed in this book.  The banter was great and the steam was intense.  These two definitely had chemistry.  I really liked how well Hibbert wrote a male lead who is dealing and has dealt with anxiety.  It was so very well done.  These books are a breath of fresh air because they have real, modern day characters.  While it can feel slightly over-the-top at times it is so nice to read a love story where those in it do not fit your traditional molds.  I'm really looking forward to the next in the series."
"I liked the first book in this series, but for me, this one was much better.I really liked Dani. She's confident and smart and knows her worth. Zaf is a straight up marshmallow who loves romance books. Together there's loads of chemistry and support and conversations. I loved seeing the support of Dani's sisters and Zaf's family. It's always great to see a loving and accepting family who pushes the character when they need it.Plot wise, it did feel a bit repetitive. Even with all of the conversations, there's a crap load of inner monologue and that did get a bit old. Dani's constant resistance to a relationship (even when she acknowledges how she's feeling) was also tiring. I wanted more of them together and in love at the end, not the break up, quick resolution and ending...although, I will say the epilogue was perfection.Overall, it was a quick and enjoyable read with characters who were so easy to root for. I can't wait for Eve's book next.**Huge thanks to Avon Books for providing the arc free of charge**"
"I adored Talia Hibbert's ""Take a Hint, Dani Brown,"" the second book of the Brown Sisters series. The characters seemed so real and vibrant to me, and once I started reading, I didn't want to put the book down. Main characters Dani and Zaf were both incredibly likeable and three-dimensional, and watching them fall in love put a huge smile on my face. I loved their witty banter, but even more than that, I loved how hard Dani and Zaf worked to make each other happy. Their relationship wasn't perfect, but it was a true partnership, and the way they cared for and supported each other was beautiful.I'm a big fan of grumpy heroes as well as men who read romance novels, so the fact that Zaf was both of those things made him pretty much irresistible to me. He was like a giant teddy bear, so sweet and caring, always trying to be in touch with his emotions, supporting Dani when she needed it, and even making sure she ate and took care of herself when she went into her workaholic, absent-minded professor mode. Dani described Zaf as a ""dad"" at one point, which was 100% accurate and made me laugh out loud because he was trying to feed her a protein bar for breakfast around the same time.I also appreciated that both Dani and Zaf were so close with their families. Zaf's teasing relationship with his niece, Fatima, was adorable. (I would love to know the story behind her nickname, Fluffy!) It was also great to catch up with Dani's sisters, Chloe and Eve, as well as get to know Dani's BFF, Sorcha. She seemed like an honorary Brown sister, so maybe she's a candidate for a story of her own at some point in the future? I have a feeling Sorcha would be pretty entertaining as a lead character.Overall, ""Take a Hint, Dani Brown"" was a lovely book and I highly recommend it for all fans of contemporary romance and romantic comedy. I am very much looking forward to getting my hands on Eve's story next!*ARC provided by the publisher via Edelweiss. All opinions expressed are my own."
"Talia Hibbert’s voice and talent sparkle in this new release. Get a Life, Chloe Brown was a highlight of my reads last year and I went into Take a Hint, Dani Brown with high hopes and an open mind. All of that said, this book surpassed any expectations I had.Danika, or Dani, is a PhD student who has sworn off relationships because she is so driven that she has not been able to be the partner her past lovers wanted. She often works late into the night and misses meals or meetups when she is really focused. The book opens with Dani and her best friend casting a spell, Dani lamenting how her last friends-with-benefits arrangement backfired. Dani is instantly established as a queer woman with a healthy sex drive and a wariness of relationships. Zafir is the security guard at the building on campus where Dani teaches. They have a budding friendship and are secretly attracted to each other. When there is an emergency drill, Dani is trapped in an elevator and Zafir rescues her. He carries her out of the building and it is captured on video, which goes viral on social media with their own hashtag (#DrRugbae) once Zafir is recognized as a former rugby player. They are not actually a couple but the world sure thinks they are. When Zafir’s identity goes public, his meddling niece points out that the positive attention can help Zafir’s charitable organization. Zafir and Danika decide to fake date for the sake of their adoring public.Difficult experiences in Zaf’s history led him to work against toxic masculinity and encourage boys to express their emotions. He is a true coach, and the way he unconditionally supports and appreciates Dani is a salve for the soul. We get to watch and cheer as they bravely face their fears to come together. Zafir also reads romance novels! He is a strong and sensitive lead character. In my experience, Talia Hibbert manages to write heroes that are considerate partners but don’t come across as being too perfect or generic. They are also smoking hot!This book made me laugh out loud repeatedly. I learned of topics I had never heard of, I yearned for this couple to make it work, and I was inspired by their persistence at every obstacle. I loved the nature of Dani and Zaf’s interactions with their family members, friends, and mentors. This was immensely fun, sexy, and satisfying. It can be read as a stand-alone and I highly recommend it!"
"Based on review copyIf you adored Get a Life, Chloe Brown, you’ll fall in love with Chloe’s sister. Dani, a young witch who has trouble with relationships and commitment, asks the goddess to identity the perfect sex partner. The goddess answers by presenting her work friend, Zaf – a retired rugby player who is helping young men process their emotions. The two of them start a fake relationship to help Zaf’s nonprofit and slowly realize that they’re compatible outside the bedroom.I absolutely adored Take a Hint, Dani Brown! Zaf was the sensitive cinnamon roll I needed who listened to romance novels while at work and had a healthy supply of Beverly Jenkins’ novels. Dani demonstrated self confidence but didn’t trust that she was lovable and the two were so sweet together. Hibbert’s banter and humor had me snorting the entire time and I never wanted this book to end. Take a Hint, Dani Brown was a worthy successor to Get a Life, Chloe Brown and I can’t wait to return to Hibbert’s imagination with Act Your Age, Eve Brown."
"Book 2 in The Brown Sisters series. Danika Brown is highly motivated in life. Her professional career in the academic world comes before anything. And that includes love. Oh don’t get me wrong she has time for a hook up here and there. But has no interest in a serious relationship.Zafir works at Danika’s university. He has always had his eye on her but never thought she felt the same way. Stuck in the friend zone. But when a video of him rescuing her during a afire drill goes viral maybe their is a way to move their relationship to the next level.This was a fun and spicy rom com🌶. I loved the strong woman Danika was. And the love Zafir felt for her melted my heart. (Seriously…where are these men in the real world?!😂🧐).I listened to the audio version and the narrator did a fabulous job representing Dani.Though book one Get a Life Chloe Brown is still my favorite, this was a great follow up. I have the next release Act your age Eve Brown on my shelf and hope to start it soon!"
"TW: mature sexual content, swearing, mental health, anxiety, depression, loss of loved ones d/t car wreck, hyperfixationREP: both MCs are characters of color, Black MC, Muslim MC, mental health, hyperfixation, MC describes herself as chubbylikes:-fake dating trope-positive mental health discussion-entertaining! Talia Hibbert creates loveable and relatable characters that you can't help but root for. you laugh, you cry, you yell at their thoughts and actions and by the end of the story you are left wanting more.dislikes:-no dislikes per se, but i would recommend not reading Take a Hint, Dani Brown and Get a Life, Chloe Brown back to back as i did. both stories have such similar themes and structure that the 2nd book lost a little bit of it's luster. don't get me wrong, it is an excellent book! but because i read them back to back i felt that i had just read the same book, but with different MCs. if you think that this may be an issue i would definitely recommend putting some space in between the 2 books."
"Take a Hint, Dani Brown by Talia Hibbert is one of my favorite books for the year because it takes the geeky Dani and matches her with the oh-so-serious Zafir and then takes them on a journey fake dating to maybe something more and then being serious about being in love.Take a Hint, Dani Brown has a heroine that really doesn’t think she deserves love because she gets involved with research and forgets things. Dani Brown hasn’t met the immovable force that is former rugby player Zafir Ansari how is the building security guard that Dani and secretly been lusting after. Zaf’s job is being a security guard but his passion is the program that he started helping young boys open up about mental health challenges and how to deal with them.I seriously loved Take a Hint, Dani Brown because I couldn’t put it down and read the book in two days, I’m a fast reader but paperbacks take me longer to read so you need to read the book too!Thanks to Avon and Goodreads for the ARC giveaway!"
"‘Take a Hint, Dani Brown’ is Talia Hibbert’s second book in the Brown Sisters series. We follow Danika’s search for love! Seeking a partner with no strings attached, she finds a kindred connection with Zafir after a rescue that goes viral.I really enjoyed reading this ‘fake dating’ storyline! Their ‘relationship’ begins according to plan: some public appearances, a few viral ‘couple-esque’ photographs, and Zafir gets his children’s organization promoted. However, things take a dramatic turn when Zafir receives his breakthrough interview. Both characters begin to confide their greatest fears and wants in life. Suddenly, playing fake love interests is no longer that simple with feelings involved!What I loved the most is the romantic tension, the buildup for these characters to realize there might be more than just lust coming into play. The novel was filled with playful banter and sarcastic remarks, with true compassion at its core. Both characters also endured heavy traumas in their past experiences, and they lean on one another to lift them out of their anxieties.I love the diverse representation in Hibbert’s novels! There are strong female characters handling chronic illness (Chloe) and extreme insecurities (Dani). Also, Talia Hibbert writes about men who lived through traumas and shares them with trusted support systems. Zafir battles the anxiety left behind after a traumatic life event, yet this motivates him to begin an organization for teenage boys. It’s okay for all people to address anxiety, as everyone handles fear at some point in their life.I loved everything about Take a Hint, Dani Brown. If you’re searching for a contemporary romance that addresses the value of wonderful support systems, then you will love this story!"
"What did I like or dislike? I loved the characteristics of our two love interests in this book. Their compatibility was evident as it is with any romance novel but so adorable that it was the guy convincing the girl fora change. It was refreshing. I also loved how it delves into their pasts and flaws with sensitivity. I love that, like in Get A Life, Chloe Brown, the main characters value and respect family. (Please let Adjoa Adoh play Gigi if there’s an adaptation in 20 years!) I loved the interracial love, the plus sized self-love, the witchy-ness, the confidence, everything!I only dislike that I promised myself not to reread any books this year!Whom would I recommend this book to? Anyone tired of the same old trope of demure women who are scared of sex or men who are terrified of commitment. Anyone who loves sappy romance AND hot sex scenes. This book balances both with dashes of humor.Why did I choose this rating? I couldn’t put it down! I tried starting another book for a book club but couldn’t. If I couldn’t start another book until I finish this one then I know that it’s a great book. I can usually read 2-3 books at a time. I had to finish this well into the night because it was gnawing at me to complete the story!"
"“What you get out of being loved, it’s supposed to be worth the compromise. When it’s good, it makes you want to compromise.”I love a good fake dating trope. Hibbert made it happen like no other.We get a glimpse of Dani and her personality in the Chloe's book, and I was so excited to see how she managed to fall for her man. She's a tough package to crack, hiding behind her walls.Zafir was intriguing from the first interaction. I loved his layers and we slowly realize why he has those layers as parts of his past are brought to light.The dynamic of them attempting to figure out their relationship was... hilarious and heart breaking at the same time. Because they are so perfectly matched but we all know it takes time for them to figure it all out!I absolutely adore the Brown sisters, and I cannot wait to get to Eve's book.Once again, don't let the illustrated cover fool you... this book is SO steamy, and I loved every minute of it!"
"When a video of thick-thighed campus security guard Zafir Ansari carrying PhD student and teacher Dani Brown out of a campus building like a super hero goes viral, launching #DrRugbae as the best ship of the season, the two friends who already had decided to have some fun and absolutely CASUAL sex decide why not take advantage of their new notoriety for the sake of Zaf's kids' charity? IT IS FOR THE CHILDREN.Of course when two idiots who are already in love decide on a sex pact, it doesn't take long for the feelings to start becoming clear. But Dani is definitely not interested in any sort of relationship. Nope not at all. Even if Zaf seems to be absolutely in love with her as a whole, quirks and all.Hibbert just nails it every time and god I loved this one. Dani's academic drive and the stress that comes along with it is perfectly captured. And Zaf? What a babe.The author includes CWs at the beginning of the story.Thank you to Avon for the advanced reading copy!"
"This book was a cute read. There was something missing for me but ultimately  did enjoy it. The author is talented, I'm just not sure I'm a fan of the situationship turned relationship because rarely do situationships ever end in monogamous relationships.I never warmed up to Dani. Her first introduction to me is being a witch, but I never got a clear view of what she practiced religiously. As a Black Caribbean Latinx person, I recognized Oshun being mentioned but her belief system seemed so linear and one-dimensional, I would expect this by white ppl interpreting african pagan religions but not a black woman. The fact the most she'd ever ask for from Oshun was to get laid felt like she was making fun of it.Dani was so masculine, she didn't have any feminine traits. As a reformed hyper masculine woman due to what I'd been cultured to be, I wonder why light skinned, biracial or non-black/non-dark skinned women are never encouraged to be women who ""don't need men"".She was amazing as a character but a little weak as a heroine. Her hero consistently gave gave gave but she rarely reciprocated even the smallest of things(like compliments or reassurance)even the ones that took little effort.I understand this is a trope being turned on its head; Dani is wealthy and alpha-female and anti-commitment but she had very few traits that softened her. A man in this situation wouldn't deserve his love interest so I don't think she deserves her hero Zafir.I love brown men in interracial. I think I'm disappointed that many of the brown men I've been reading as of recent weeks are a little boring. Zafir was a non-practicing Muslim and a cinnamon roll but much of what was adorable about him made him feel like financially he couldn't compete with Dani. I had to wonder whether this is the reason she never reassured him because he wasn't impressive in comparison to her so she reminded me of Molly from Insecure. She didn't really want to put in work she just wanted when her time was free to have a loyal partner.Zahir was soft, I wish he'd had more Alpha traits but romance works better when the characters are opposite so I get it. Many of the things he did didn't seem realistic for a cis/het man. I'm all for challenging stereotypes but at times it felt like it was trying to be too feministy(I like feminist topics brought up but this one tackled too many). I also wished that all the characters he was close to who were practicing Muslims wouldn't have had Westernized names, especially because not every PoC needs a nickname easier to pronounce.The narrator is pretty good and I commend her for finding a Black British narrator. I think as an American, I was already lost in translation for things, so I would've loved it if the name dropping of celebrity names would've featured more British Black women instead of American ones, because it would've forced me to learn and research celebrities I don't know as well.At times it read too witty, and the banter was good but often never led anywhere since it took so long to get them in the sheets for me. I wish for as long as it took, that they would've at least gone on dates or hangouts that weren't booty calls. I never felt like they really knew each other outside of what they liked in the bedroom. Situationships rarely become deeper than that so while there's a desire for it, both parties rarely want more than what they're getting and because they did little to learn about each other, I wasn't sure it was this developed romance it's marketed to be.Overall I think Zafir's mental health was handled well. He experienced panic attacks, had anxiety, suffered from depression and I didn't feel like it was too much. Dani wasn't my cup of tea but I loved that she was bi and chubby. I wish the descriptions had painted better pictures of them but she's not as descriptive as some authors I also read so maybe I'm just spoiled by certain authors.It had a HEA so I'm obliged to give it at least a 3. I wish it would have at least been a 4 for me =/"
"I really loved the playful, vibrant writing style in this! It’s my first time reading something from the author, but her reputation and that adorable cover drew me in. I’ll be the first to admit that friends with benefits-style relationships are not my thing, but Hibbert makes it obvious that there’s so much more to this couple than just the physical. And for a book that focuses on a relationship that’s supposed to be sex “without” feelings, it’s actually a pretty solid slow burn. Readers might be taken aback by just how steamy things get – Hibbert’s descriptive writing style translates into some lengthy intimate scenes – but that’s definitely not the focus. I think our hero steals the show here, because every time the heroine’s hangups over commitment started to grate on my nerves, he would do something to reel me right back in.The story follows Dani and Zafir, two people who see each other at work every day. They’ve been flirting for months, but Dani’s been burned in the past so she has sworn off any kind of relationship. She’d love to burn up the sheets with Zaf, but only if he agrees to keep feelings out of the equation – and something about the stoic security guy strikes Dani as the relationship type. But when they’re caught on video looking like a couple and keeping up the rouse helps Zaf’s charity, these two agree to fake it for awhile. Though Zaf would love to start something real with Dani, he knows that he’ll take her any way that he can get her.The absolute best part about this book is Zafir. He is such a protective, loving guy; patient and compassionate as he handles Dani’s hangups. She took a lot longer to grow on me, but it’s also easy to see that she cares for Zaf more than she’s willing to admit. The writing is fresh and distinctive, which also makes this a quick, fun read. Though there are shots of angst, the majority of the book is light with plenty of depth. I can’t say that I was 100% onboard with every element of the storyline (Dani practices witchcraft for some reason, she’s resistant to a relationship for the entire book, and they continue to insist that there are no feelings between them), but I was entertained and engaged with the story from start to finish. I’ll definitely check out more of the author’s work in the future, because this made for a dynamic and interesting read. I received an ARC via NetGalley and am voluntarily leaving a review of this fake relationship romance."
"(Disclaimer: I received this book from Edelweiss. This has not impacted my review which is unbiased and honest.)I fell in love with Take a Hint Dani Brown from the first chapter. The characters and the narrative voice are amazing. Dani Brown doesn't believe she can be a good girlfriend and her relationships with men and women have seemed to prove her right. Zafir is a hopeless romantic with a tragic past that has him trying to focus on being emotionally open. What could go wrong when they have to pretend to date? We become introduced to Dani and Zaf from their witty banter, their clever retorts, and the way they are drawn to each other. And what ends up happening is we quickly fall in love with them as characters. It's a dual POV so you're really able to get to know both Dani and Zaf and I couldn't decide who I loved more! If you've been searching for more Brown sister interactions - this is certainly a win!There were so many moments I laughed out loud and I stayed up till 2am multiple nights to finish this. I barely took notes I was so absorbed in their interactions. Throughout the entire book, I never got tired of these characters. It's a wonderfully balanced romance that looks as coming to terms with our past, love which inspires compromises and acceptance, and the necessity of taking a hint from the universe. The writing is clever, things falling into place almost cosmically, and never feeling forced. If you loved Get a Life Chloe Brown, this will be an instant win for you. While you can read Take a Hint Dani Brown without the first, do yourself the favor and read them both. They're one of my favorite romance novel series ever!"
"Rating: a billion out of 5 starsI don't even know where to start with reviewing this book, honestly. It's just so indescribably good. I want to take both Dani and Zaf and hug them both forever, and also feed them and make sure they have a comfy sleeping pillow. It's a sort of fake relationship, friends to lovers contemporary romance but really it's so good it transcends tropes.Talia Hibbert is brilliant at writing these very REAL characters that are entire people with hopes and dreams and foibles and flaws, and it's easy to forget they aren't actually, y'know, real. She's also a master at breaking your heart into a thousand shattered pieces, then bending down and holding out a roll of tape to help you put it back together. Or, as Dani would say, framing the scar in gold.I want to be best friends with Dani and Sorcha (even though I'm no where near cool enough to hang out with them.) I love that Dani is a lush, curvy, plus-sized woman and nowhere at all is this book about her needing to change, lose weight, diet... She is a phenomenal woman - she knows it, we know it. She inspires me and I wish I had half of her confidence in my own skin. At the same time she is also so vulnerable and I want to wrap her in bubble warp and feed her marshmallows and give her a thousand soft kisses. (I TOLD YOU, this book broke me, okay?) And then there's Zaf, who's big and hot and sweet and reads romance novels (you know I stan a hero who reads romance!) because they give him hope. He's basically the ultimate cinnamon roll and I want to eat him up.There is a moment where Zaf is having a panic attack and is trying to explain, and Dani says ""You can tell me later. Right now, do what you need to do.... If I can help, let me know. Otherwise, feel free to ignore me. I'll still be here."" And if that isn't just the most RIGHT response to someone having a bad spell with their mental illness, I don't know what is. And a bit later: ""No one can be fine all the time. So we'll sit here while you're busy being not-fine, and we won't move until you're done, and that's okay."" Reader, I tell you I *sobbed*.I really don't know what else to say. Why are you even still reading this review? Go pick up a copy of Take a Hint, Dani Brown and read it for yourself. It's definitely my favorite read of the year, and is a contender to be my favorite book of all time.This is the second book in The Brown Sisters series, and can be read as a stand-alone. I loved the first book, Get a Life, Chloe Brown, and can not WAIT for Eve's book, Act Your Age, Eve Brown, which I assume will be the final one in the series.Anyway, in conclusion, Talia Hibbert writes amazing books with great disability and mental illness rep, and you should go read all of them RIGHT NOW."
"Take a Hint, Dani Brown was funny and sweet and emotional and will warm the cockles of any heart. Dani and Zaf are truly Couple Goals. Their friends to lovers relationship has a slow burn like quality as the reader learns the depths of their feelings for each other.Danika Brown is an academic nerd, career focused and has been hurt in the past. I found her extremely relatable. For example, the story begins with Danika and her best friend engaging in some witchy business, but the fact that she Identifies as a witch does not commandeer the narrative, it simply adds depth and dimension to her character.Zaf is a big tough ex rugby player, but he also continues to live with trauma from his past, which he embraces in an inspiring blend of vulnerable masculinity. My favorite thing about him is his preferred reading material and that he both reads and listens to audiobooks. I would love to know who his favorite authors are (besides Talia Hibbert- obviously) and his favorite narrators.We get a nice little peek at Chloe in red at a couple points in this book. I feel like there is so much story left with Zaf and Dani, I really hope for some novellas or insights in the next book.I received an ARC of this book and voluntarily give my review."
"This book is absolutely delicious.  I was sure I couldn’t possibly love it more that Chloe’s book but I was wrong.Dani is such a porcupine.  She does not believe she’s lovable and besides she dies not have time for love. She is working on her PHD and just needs sex as a release.  She asks the universe for a provider of orgasms.Zafir was once a rugby king until he suffered a terrible loss.  His anxiety is sometimes overwhelming but he is helping boys learn about their emotions while working as a security guard.He & Dani have been flirty for some time but when he rescues her from an elevator, the internet goes crazy. Of course this is the beginning of the “fake” dating portion of their story.Zafir is such a cinnamon roll.  He sees Dani for who she is and fits into her life with little fanfare.  I absolutely adored this entire book.  Both of them are such wonderful characters.  I cannot wait for the next book."
"Ever since I read Get a Life, Chloe Brown by Talia Hibbert earlier this year, I’ve wanted to pick up the sequel. Plus, I’ve been listening to a ton of Arctic Monkeys and have been in the mood for a romance. Thankfully, Take a Hint, Dani Brown came through from the library and I was able to read it before the mood for a romance passed. As much as I loved Chloe’s story, I think I loved Dani’s even more. Dani teaches college English (I can relate) and has sworn off romance after some bad experiences but when a video of her being carried out of a building by a gruff security guard goes viral, they decide to fake a relationship and reap the benefits. The banter and pining were so fantastic in this story and I also appreciated the discussions surrounding grief and anxiety. It isn’t just a romance; Hibbert tackles some more serious topics and that’s what keeps me coming back to her romances. I’ll definitely be checking out Eve Brown’s story when it comes out.TW from BookTriggerWarnings(dot)comAnxietyCar crashDeath (parent and sibling, mentioned/discussed)GriefPanic attackSex"
"Take a Hint, Dani Brown by Talia Hibbert is a cute romance that is also quite steamy. This second installment in The Brown Sisters series can be read as a standalone.Danika “Dani” Brown does not want a relationship. She is very career-oriented and focused so she often disappoints her romantic partners. Dani is open to a no strings fling so when a video of security guard Zafir “Zaf” Ansari carrying her from their work building goes viral, she agrees to a fake relationship in order to help the charity he runs. Before the pretend romance, Dani enjoys Zaf’s company so spending extra time with him is no hardship. He readily agrees  to her rules but suddenly, she is the one breaking them.  Having been hurt in the past, Dani puts a screeching halt to anything resembling  feelings.Zafir is no stranger to pain, grief and anxiety. After recovering from a tragic loss, he started a sports charity and uses his past experiences to teach young men to accept and express their emotions. Zaf does not like being in the media spotlight, so he is not quite hitting the mark with publicizing his charity. Thanks to his interfering niece, the viral video shines a spotlight just where he wants it.  However, in order to capitalize on the free publicity, Zafir and Dani keep their fake relationship in the public eye. Behind the scenes, they are enjoying their time together and mutually agree to give into their sizzling attraction. Zaf is a little leery of this part of their arrangement since he does not indulge in meaningless flings. He easily justifies his decision to himself but will he keep his heart out of their arrangement?Both Dani and Zafir are delightful characters that are vibrantly developed. Their exchanges are witty and their text messages are laugh out loud funny. Due to his struggles with anxiety, Zafir is self-aware and comfortable with expressing his feelings.  Dani is unapologetically honest about what she wants in life and she steadfastly works hard to reach her goals. She is also not quite as inflexible about letting Zaf into her life as she originally believes. They perfectly complement one another and their bedroom scenes are off the charts smoking hot.Take a Hint, Dani Brown is a lovely romance with a diverse cast of characters. The storyline is enjoyable although it is a little predictable. Zaf and Dani are a well-rounded couple who are genuinely appealing. However, both of them get lost in their own heads which leads to long introspective passages that become repetitive. The conflict that arises is unsurprising but Talia Hibbert  resolves their issue in a very sweet and imaginative manner.  An enjoyable addition to The Brown Sisters series that will leave readers eagerly awaiting Eve’s story.I received a complimentary copy for review."
"Oh, goodness. This book has me gushing.Take a Hint, Dani Brown is a master class in the Grumpy Cinnamon Roll hero. Zaf is a big rugby playing, romance reading softie and I want to squeeze him.He's into Dani on so many levels from the beginning. Not just ""curves, yes please"" but HER. This isn't insta-lust or a shallow affection. This is LONGING and it makes me ridiculously happy.Often laugh-out-loud funny, this story is giving me pure joy. Like, sit-on-your-sofa-grinning-like-an-idiot-because-you-love-these-imaginary-people JOY.The hero and heroine are work friends who embark on a fake relationship for reasons, and find out they've been hot for one another all along.Hibbert addresses anxiety, depression, and toxic masculinity with examples on the page showing healthy ways to deal rather than using the easy out of Love Conquers All.If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would."
"Although you don't have to read them in order (there's only a tiny, inherent spoiler),  I'd still suggest reading Get A Life Chloe Brown too. They are great books and the family is full of strong, intelligent, if not wary, females.  I love the matriarchs of the Brown family and the family's eccentricities in general.  American black people in books aren't allowed much eccentricity, so this was fresh.  I GUESS this could be called interracial but it's not really.  It's onlyintercultural and it's moot. It's never a problem, never brought up as such. She's a litle bullheaded but even if you want to smack her a little (get a hint!) you are so busy loving him and feeling for them both to stick with it. Warning - it's a bit more steamy than Get a Life, Chloe Brown.  Chloe Brown was more romantic sexy and this one is more sexy-sexy. LOL.  Great read and smartly written. Book 3, please, Ms. Hibbert!"
"Though I didn't like the first book in this series a great deal, I thought I'd still try the second book. I am glad I did! I listened to it and found it to be an entertaining and enjoyable listen. The narrator Ione Butler was very good.Zafir works security at the university where Danika is a PhD student. When a fire drill goes wrong, he rescues her from the building. News and video of that surface on social media and #DrRugbae is trending. All the publicity is helping Zafir's sports charity for children and he asks Dani to play along that they are a couple.Dani can do fake, because she doesn't do relationships. But, we all know how it's going to end...FYI...this is a very steamy book. I listened to it and it was a little too much at times. Some of the language used to describe things was a little off-putting. But, besides that, it was a great listen."
"I was pleasantly surprised by this one! I definitely enjoyed this book more than the first one in the series. When it first started I didn't think I'd like it but I'm so glad I continued. Dani and Zaf were easy to fall in love with!Dani has her mind set on this perfect career and everything seems to be going well, she just needs some spice by adding some ""extra curriculars"". Relationships aren't for her, they just seem to add drama. She asks the universe for a friends with benefits situation.Enter Zafir Ansari who just so happens to rescue her during a fire drill gone wrong. To Dani the rescue must be a sign and out of nowhere they are now trending on social media as #DrRugbae A simple plan to fake a relationship to benefit Zaf's sports charity is about to completely shake things up!This book will define make you smile and give you some laughs."
"I have to make a confession - I didn't read ""Get A Life, Chloe Brown"".  I received all the emails, read some reviews, and even bought the book when it came out.  I meant to read the first book before I read this one.  But this one just captured me and I had a case of ""must read"". This book has it all - sassy dialogue, steamy scenes, and a sensitive hero.  Dani Brown is a university lecturer working toward her PhD and Zaf is an ex-rugby player/now security guard at the university.  Circumstances catch them in an twitter worthy event and it is all hashtags and followers.  In order to garner support for Zaf's nonprofit, Dani and Zaf do a ""fake"" relationship.  When does the ""fake"" become ""real""?  Read the book to find out.  I loved this book and I look forward to the last Brown sister next year.Thank you Netgalley and HarperCollins/Avon for this ARC>"
"This was a super cute Brown Sisters installment! While I didn’t connect with Dani as much as I did with her sister in the first book, I still really enjoyed her character as a whole — her social aversions and career drive and her witchiness all gave her great depth that I really appreciated! However, I absolutely ADORED Zafir — he is a grumpy cinnamon roll and I loved him! Ever since reading a couple other books earlier in the year with similar male MC’s, my new favorite thing is men who read romance novels for the sheer pleasure of it and knowing Zafir’s reasons for his love of love and romance novels had me soaring through the sky!I really enjoyed the fake relationship aspect of this story and it was heartwarming to see them grow together through their journey. Partially own voices, the author does a brilliant job with the diversity, not just of this book, but the whole series (and all her other books as well) — varied sexuality, race, and mental health representation throughout, and all represented respectfully and accurately! This is just a fantastic series and I seriously can’t wait for book 3!!!"
"“No soap-opera sob story here. Mostly because I’m incapable of sobbing. Superior tear ducts, you understand.”Danika Brown is smart, ambitious, and highly motivated to achieve her career goals. A self-described “a bookish workaholic who wants to vomit at the prospect of romance,” Dani isn't about to let anything (or anyone) stand in the way of getting to where she wants to be. And besides, she's “not interested in the transformative power of love” anyway.“ 'Am I a romantic? Sadly, no... I am entirely too busy for dating and ego-stroking and sharing my feelings and meeting peoples’ parents.'  Her expression grew more and more disgusted with each item she listed.""So when Dani finds herself in the middle of a viral social media sensation, with everyone around her believing that she is somehow in love with her friend, Zafia Ansari, the former-rugby-player-turned-security-guard, she's forced to play along, even though Dani and Zaf both know the truth that no one else can see. But there are some things that even 5-year-plan Dani didn’t see coming...""It reminded Zaf why he loved [romance] so much: because it was all about hope, about finding sparks of light in a world that could be so dark.""The second installment in Talia Hibbert’s Brown sisters series, Take a Hint, Dani Brown was even better than the first, for me! I liked Chloe and Red, but I loved Dani and Zaf. I found Dani’s boldness and directness so relatable. I like reading about ambitious, career-minded, commitment-phobic women who don't spend their lives waiting for Prince Charming to show up, and Talia Hibbert really delivered that with Dani. This character gets to experience a nuanced intimate relationship, but she doesn't live and breathe for it, and that's refreshing in a romance novel.""All she could feel was happy. Ick.""Not only did I adore Dani, but I also really appreciated how Hibbert tackled the tough topics of anxiety and loss. There’s more to this book than you’d expect - Zafia, the primary male character, has lived through his share of heartbreak, and watching the way he deals with it (and helps other people cope with their own pain) was just beautifully rendered.""He wasn’t going to tell her about the heights his anxiety had reached, or how it turned out depression could fuel rage like nothing else, or how bleak it felt when the fire ran out and the demons were all you had left.""So many romance novels are flat and one-dimensional, existing only for the happy ending, but Talia Hibbert delivers a multi-faceted story every time, acknowledging the rawness & realness & pain laced into the human experience. Highly recommend!---Follow@letteredlibraryon Instagram!"
"I have truly found my sweet spot with audiobooks which are modern romance novels and romcoms. I found another winner with Take a Hint, Dani Brown!I read and enjoyed Get a Life, Chloe Brown, but I think I liked Dani better. Dani is a curvy, bisexual women who isn’t afraid to go after what she wants even if it’s just a good time. She works with Zaf, a security guard (and former rugby player) in her school. After Zaf has to rescue Dani, the story goes viral and DrRugbae is born! Dani agrees to date Zaf in order to raise awareness of his mental health nonprofit for young boys. It’s pretty obvious what happens here, but I really enjoyed this book.Talia Hibbert has such a way of writing her characters with such depth and she really knocked it out of the park with Zaf. He’s in tune with his feelings, he has a soft spot for helping younger children with emotional intelligence and mental health, he’s a romantic and a family man. Of the four main characters in her first two books, Zaf is definitely my favorite!Looking forward to reading about Eva next!4 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
"Danika Brown is fiercely independent, outspoken, headstrong and determined not to fall in love again. After having her heart broken she has decided relationships just aren't for her. Instead, she just wants the perfect friend...with benefits.Zafir Ansari is sweet, strong, funny and madly infatuated with Danika. They see each other every morning when she comes to work and they share mere minutes of chatting and flirting. Zafir wants more but doesn't have a clue how to take it beyond that.Fate steps in, as a fire drill ends up getting Danika stuck in an elevator, turns Zafir into her rescuer, and captures the end of said rescue on video that goes viral on social media. Now it seems Danika & Zafir are to be in a fake relationship, as it seems everyone believes they are in a real one due to the video and Zafir has begged her to play along.Being in a fake relationship has its perks and rules...rules that are meant to keep things informal and feelings at bay. What happens when those rules get broken and hearts turn tender? Maybe what fate had planned all along.This was a fantastically fun and laugh-out-loud read. Danika Brown is a great character and I love how confident yet vulnerable she is, and could relate to so much she was going through. Zafir is strong yet sensitive and knows it's ok to not to be ok sometimes. It was great to see this in a male character.Talia Hibbert has a way with words and will have you laughing, holding your breath, tearing up, and feeling a bit anxious...all while getting completely lost in the story. Such a great pick-me-up book!"
"Absolutely loved! Talia Hibbert was not exaggerating when she described Zaf, her latest hero, in her last author newsletter. That man is all that, and more!(He reads romance! And coaches rugby teams on how to take care of their mental health! And actually pays attention to Dani when she talks--and remembers what she says! Plus, he reads her academic articles! I could go on and on and on, but really--read it for yourself. Once you do, let the Zaf-gushing commence. Trust me, it's inevitable.)Honestly, from her descriptions of them Dani's previous romantic partners were all seriously lacking. But even if they had been more...average? I hesitate to say ""normal""...OMG, they would have paled in comparison to the significant other that Zaf is, and has clearly always was meant to be. Dani wasn't a slouch in this department either--for all of her I can't do relationships and I'm just in it for the Os protestations, the way she took a single mention from Zaf about panic attacks as a reason read up on them, and then was an absolute rock star when he then had one in front of her? I mean, good grief. These two. They were almost too much.(Yet, not. Because this book could have gone on for another 400+ pages and I would be here for it.)I really enjoyed Chloe's book ( Get a Life, Chloe Brown ) and I'm sure Eve's book will be perfectly lovely...but goodness. Dani and Zaf will stay in my memory as one of *those* couples for a good long time, I am sure.Rating: 4 1/2 stars / AI voluntarily reviewed an Advance Reader Copy of this book."
"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️💫 4.5 Stars🔥🔥🔥🔥 4/5 Steam RatingThis is the second book in the Brown Sisters series but can easily be read as a standalone. Once again, Hibbert has written a cute but steamy romcom with underrepresented characters!!What I enjoyed:✨ Dani is not your stereotypical smart girl seen in books, she’s feisty and I love it!✨ Our main characters are both BIPOC✨ This is a faux-mance/ friends-to-lovers✨ I love the way that grief and anxiety are discussed in this book. It’s such a heavy subject yet approached with a light touch✨ There’s a lot of steam, even more so than in Chloe’s story✨ I liked how social media propelled this story, it gave a very modern twistIf you enjoyed Chloe’s story, I have a feeling that you’ll love this one too!"
"It's so good, you guys. Dani is a driven Ph.D student who doesn't have time for emotional relationships. Zaf is the ex-pro rugby player security guard who Dani's been chatting with daily for months. When a non-emergency emergency makes them a hasshtag viral item, they start a fake relationship... with benefits.I loved this book. I literally laughed and I literally teared up. Hibbert has a way with language that makes me smile and a way with emotions that twists my heart. Dani has put aside nearly everything in her life to focus on professional advancement and Zaf has boxed up the past as a way to deal with his anxiety. Both of these characters grow and change in beautiful ways.Plus we get to see a glimpse of Chloe and Red from the first book in the series, which is always a delight.I received an ARC from the publisher via Edelweiss  for review."
"I was a huge fan of Chloe Brown, and felt a kinship to her that I don't get very often, so I was really excited for her sister's book. Dani is both just like me and nothing ike me at the same time it was befuddling. With this book I connected most with Zaf. The guy who notices the little things and does everything he can to support, encourage, and show how much he cares. Talia is so breathtakingly good at bringing in the emotional depth, and showcasing both the right and wrong ways of coping with difficult emotions.There were times though that I felt the repetitive nature of Dani fighting her feelings to slow things down. But it was such lovely prose, with a twist of wit that kept me going.I wouldn't say it's as good as Chloe, but it was a really enjoyable read and I'm looking forward to the final Brown sister's book."
"God I love Talia Hibbert. What a delight to read. Like I said in my last review of hers, Get a Life, Chloe Brown, I would basically read anything Hibbert writes. I am HERE FOR IT.Take a Hint, Dani Brown focuses on the second Brown sister, Danika, in her quest to find some no-strings-attached, a-bit-more-than-friendship. The security guard at her work building, Zaf, is a great friend, but she doubts he’d be up for more than that. Until the goddess Oshun leads her to believe otherwise! After a video goes viral of Zaf saving Dani from a building that is definitely not on fire or filled with poisonous gas, Zaf proposes they fake a relationship for the good of his nonprofit. Tackle It, which provides training programs during rugby games that help young boys get in touch with their emotions, is getting great publicity from their fake relationship…but it’s only bringing Dani and Zaf closer together.The problem is, Dani has been seriously hurt in the past. She’s got a lot of confidence and bravado, but her self-esteem is in the toilet. She is extremely opposed to making this friendship with benefits into anything else.I’m just so in love with the way Talia Hibbert writes her characters and her stories. She’s got a wonderful way of using words. Again, I will read anything she writes. It’s just a delight.I particularly liked in this one just how different the characters we got were. I feel sometimes that repeat romance authors fall into the trap of using the same archetype over and over. But Zaf and Dani were very, very different from Chloe and Red! Dani is a witchy, feminist PhD candidate with an incredible brain but basically no capacity for taking care of herself. Zaf is tough on the outside, but has struggled much over the last few years of his life, trying to put loss behind him. Their story is a fundamentally different, yet important one. I like that this book can dive into some real issues and gives the romance more purpose. I hate nothing more than a romance that sticks two people together with no rhyme or reason; this book does the opposite because it provides a really deep understanding of who these people are and why they fit together so well.I particularly liked Dani’s character, because I think she’s relatable. Not only to me, but to the many women who have begun to pick up our modern age’s feminist romances. She’s an academic, and extremely goal driven. She forgets to take care of herself properly. She’s a feminist. And she practices whatever form of witchcraft feels good to her. Basically, Dani is all of us, and Take a Hint is our reminder to stop eating Skittles for breakfast and staying up ’til 2 in the morning. YOU CAN DO THIS. ❤In an age where we are driven by progress and accomplishments, we mustn’t forget to leave time for what brings us joy. Which is exactly why I’m very happy and grateful I got to read this delightful novel. 🙂Highly, highly recommend Take a Hint! I can’t wait to read the next book, with Eve’s story! A copy of Take a Hint, Dani Brown was provided to me by the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. It will be published June 23, 2020 (and you should go get a copy!)."
"It’s official, I LOVE the Brown sisters 🙌 Fans of Chloe will absolutely ADORE her younger sister Dani as our smart & funny heroine in Hibbert’s latest romance. Similarly to her last book in the series (Get a Life, Chloe Brown!), Hibbert has created authentic, relatable characters, who you’ll be rooting for from page one!Something I really love about Hibbert’s stories is that neither partner is “saved” by the other. Both equally help make each other better. Dani & Zafir are both interesting & dynamic characters, and the book switches between their two points of view, really giving a full picture of their relationship.While at times a little predictable, this book is SO sweet & fun! Hibbert opens conversations about mental health (particularly anxiety), while also delivering the perfect romance & some steamy scenes 🔥 Overall, I really loved it! A perfect summer read!!CW: anxiety, gaslighting (in a romantic relationship), death of a family member"
I have already pre ordered the next one and I am so sad there are only three sisters! Chloe is still my favorite (as a fibromyalgia sufferer that will not change). I have to say that I my like Zaf more than Red though. A big athlete who loves romance novels 😍 Not to say that Dani isn't a great character. I love that it's her who has the issues with emotions and letting people in when that is almost always a guy thing. I too have a guy who is more of a romantic than me so I really liked that part. I think giving a guy flowers should be more normalized. Anyway definitely five stars. Warning for family death (death of Zaf's father and brother in the pre book timeline) and for bad relationships in Dani's past ( a cheating ex who by description was probably emotionally abusive).
"Honestly, I knew I was going to love this book. Get a Life, Chloe Brown was my top read of 2019 and I couldn’t wait for her sister’s book. Add in a fake relationship and an ultimate cinnamon bun hero and I was sold! This was an adorable and heartfelt read and I loved every minute of it!Zaf is 100% my new book boyfriend! He loves Dani so deeply and completely and it’s just adorable! They have this flirty friendship thing going on in the beginning of the book and then move to a pretend relationship when he literally carries her from a building and they go viral on social media! He has anxiety and needs to learn to let go and Dani, even with her crazy, work-focused self, is great for that. They just fit together so well. I can’t recommend this book enough!"
"What a treat it was to read this book!In the prologue, Dani Brown and her best friend sit bickering at their homemade altar before statues of female deities and ask for help with their love lives. Dani asks for a sign to point her in the right direction -- and a protein bar falls out of her pocket.  So...a sign? A hint?Dani is a Ph.D. candidate at the university where Zafir Ansari is a security guard, working to get funding for his nonprofit organization. From the beginning, we know that Zafir is smitten with Dani and each day when Dani brings him coffee, he gives her a protein bar. When Zafir rescues Dani from a stuck elevator during a security drill and the video goes viral, they become campus celebrities.  Dani and Zafir then pretend to date to get publicity for Zafir's foundation. The reader spends the rest of the book waiting for  Dani to ""take a hint"" and stick with Zafir.One of my favorite tropes is where the hero is smitten from the start and spends the rest of the story trying to win the heroine. Dani has emotional wounds from the past that get in her way. Zafir is a fabulous, sexy alpha who is rebuilding his life after a family tragedy. In a delicious twist, he is also an avid romance reader who is a hopeless romantic. (I'm pretty sure he was reading Beverly Jenkins' Tempest at one point). You will love Dani and Zafir and when the HEA comes at last, you will want to read the all over book again. Talia Hibbert dedicated this book ""For the Hopeless Romantics..."" and you will absolutely agree.Five stars!"
"4.5 starsI don’t know why I ever doubt Talia. I place her books on “to buy” shelves, wait forever, and then get annoyed with myself because I didn’t read them immediately. This book is no different and I loved that the heroine is a hot mess wrapped in a very secure body and the hero is a hot, stern man hiding a loving, gooey middle.The fact that Danika and Zafir work is not surprising. What made it lovely is that Talia wrote them with their insecurities for all to see, didn’t make their coupling easy but showed that being flexible in a relationship does not mean that you have to change who you are.I cried with these characters, loved that we got to see Chloe and Red again and can’t wait to read Eve’s book. I have a feeling I’ll love hers best of all!"
"I really enjoyed this book and thought it was better than the first book in this series.  Though Dani and her sisters are nothing alike, they still have a familiar bond that unites them.  There was instant chemistry between Dani and Zaf and the wit between the two kept the story going.  The author did a fantastic job portraying both of her characters and the attraction between the two was undeniable.  Dani is an intelligent and independent character who comes to realize that loving and being loved is a powerful thing.  Zaf is an absolute joy of a character-so thoughtful and romantic in so many little ways.  It always takes me a bit to get used to the author’s style of writing, but once I do, her reads are very enjoyable.  Looking forward to the final book I’m this series!"
"I really enjoyed this book, despite thinking I wouldn't because I hate FWB/fake relationship books. But this book had some literal laugh out loud moments, balanced with serious issues. Dani was a hoot, but I didn't like how she pushed the **** buddy arrangement when she knew that wasn't Zaf's thing. I don't know why she thought the universe would send her him as a **** buddy when he was a romantic at heart and more into relationships. Zaf was a perfect character. I loved him, and I loved the mix of grumpy, funny, caring, understanding, and just being overall loveable. It would have been four stars but I was just too irritated by Dani's view on relationships, the reason behind it, and the reason for their brief separation."
"I loved this so much!!Oh I love some Brown sisters, and was delighted to read Dani’s story in Take A Hint, Dani Brown. Talia Hibbert has truly created characters that are sexy and fun, strong and engaging, yet each as tantalizing as the next.As much as I loved the first book, and devoured Chloe Brown, I might even love Dani more. Zafir is adorable and makes me swoon, and this book brought the steam, the laughs, and just left me excited for the next book.I highly recommend this series, and just know you are about to find your next book boyfriend and left wanting to be friends with the Brown sisters.*many thanks to Avon for the gifted copy for review. All opinions are my own"
"With all the craziness in our culture right now, I appreciated my time absorbed in this diverse and representative world Hibbert creates. And she's an artist with words who brings three-dimensional characters to life in ways that allows readers to understand how issues like anxiety and fear of not belonging can shape one's ability to be a good partner to another. I'm also quite fond of the career-driven heroine who falls for a laid-back guy. It's a nice flip of the common trope where the grumpy, driven hero needs the lighthearted woman to help him balance his life.Dani Brown is a part-time university teacher working her way through a Ph.D. program in English with all sorts of goals and expectations of a successful academic life. She has her life meticulously planned out for the next two decades. Her role model, academic superstar Inez Holly, factors in big in this book as Dani's raison d'etre, allowing Dani though little time for anything else in life. On top of Dani's life goals is a fairly high degree of fear and anxiety that she's not fit to be a romantic partner. She genuinely believes based on past experiences that she lacks social skills and is doomed to be a failure to others who want more from her. Enter Zaf, one of the sweetest heroes I've read. He has so many stellar and beautiful character traits, but maybe most of all, he loves Dani unconditionally. She sees this but internalizing it takes quite a while, allowing in the meantime the two to engage in a friends with benefits relationship. I was less keen on the fake dating plot - which oddly features in a whole bunch of romances I've read of late. Zaf pretends to want only a friends with benefits relationship, even though he's secretly hoping Dani will change her mind and fall in love with him. He's also sensitive to not wanting to coerce Dani into something for which she is genuinely opposed. I have to admit that I was holding my breath at times, really hoping that Dani would not hurt this lovely man, and mostly she does not, and their relationship remains a giving and respectful one throughout.One misgiving I did have with this book though is that Dani remains a bit inscrutable to me right up to the end due to a number of issues that keep her determined to elevate her professional life over her personal one. Her belief at times that she's unworthy and doomed to failure in her personal life felt more conceptual and I didn't <i>feel</i> this idea the way I wanted. Also, she's traumatized by mistreatment from previous romantic partners and that too didn't feel as realistic to me as it could have. Some of the information about her trauma comes in late in the book to keep explaining why Dani wants Zaf at arms length, but I thought it would have been more helpful if explained earlier in the novel. I think the  book suffers a little from too obvious an attempt to create obstacles between a couple. My overall sense though is that Hibbert is disrupting the conventional trope of the man as the commitment phobe in a relationship by constructing an alternative feminist narrative. That works for me in lots of ways, though on the whole, the obstacles to Dani and Zaf's happiness still existed for me too much on the surface of the story.Nevertheless, a vibrant bisexual plus-sized feminist heroine paired with a feminist Muslim  man who reads romances to stay connected with the kinder aspects of life is a breath of fresh air right now. The books also seamlessly incorporates lots of representative secondary characters that make me feel hopeful about our future. I am looking forward to the third book in this series."
"Grab this right now!! Seriously, go get your copy!Not only is TAKE A HINT, DANI BROWN funny, witty, well written, and has a super cute cover, but Zaf is so effortlessly sexy, that I fell head over heels in love with him! He lit me on fire and had me melting into a puddle! Yup, all at once! He’s that good!Dani is my spirit animal...right down to her zodiac sign! She’s phenomenal and hilarious. The total embodiment of an amazing friend and epic love interest. She certainly kept Zaf on his toes with her antics. I adored her!The trope is one of my faves. The writing is beyond fantastic. It’s emotive and flawless. This book freaking rocked!I absolutely love this series! I’m completely and totally obsessed with this series. I want more right now!! Seriously, if you’re looking for a read that literally has it all:Amazing writingWell developed charactersEntertaining plotFlawless execution with some laugh out moments seamlessly woven into the dialogueLook no further. This is the book for you!Highly recommended!"
"Fake dating is one of my favorite tropes and this one was done exceptionally well. The fact that Danika was so relationship-phobic made this even better. I love that Hibbert doesn't shy away from bigger issues in her romance novels. Grief was tackled very well in this novel and I loved watching Zaf start to work through it to be a better version of himself. There were great conversations about race, especially what it's like to be a black woman. I loved how casually queer Dani is and how it wasn't a big deal at all. Trust me, you'll want to pick this one up.*I received a complimentary copy of this book from Avon through NetGalley. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.*"
"Dani Brown loves her work and often gets so caught up in it she forgets what time it is. It’s one of the biggest things stopping her from being in a romantic relationship, so she’s decided she’ll just have sleeping buddies. And she’s asking the world for a new one.Zafir Ansari is the brooding security guard, ex-professional rugby player, at the college building where Dani teaches. Everyone thinks he’s grumpy and after he saves Dani from a building fire drill gone wrong, she realizes they’re destined to sleep together.After a video goes viral of Zafir saving Dani with the hashtag #DrRugBae, Zaf asks Dani to go along with the fake relationship since his sports charity for kids is finally gaining traction. Dani agrees and her plan is simple: fake a relationship to the public and seduce Zaf behind the scenes. But Zaf is a hopeless romantic and is working on changing Dani’s mind about relationships.I loved this book so much. You get to see glimpses of Chloe and Red (not really updates on them, but at least they pop up).The book switches views between Dani and Zafir and I loved it. I actually loved Zaf more than Dani. And I loved this story more than the Chloe Brown story – the falling out, that happens in every rom-com, was more believable in this book.I also loved the discussions around mental health. It definitely made anxiety and depression seem more normal.I’d also like to mention that the sex scenes aren’t as graphic in this book. I loved Chloe Brown and I’ve heard friends be surprised by the sex scenes. Dani Brown had maybe one sex scene and then it would mention they were having sex. I’m not mentioning this as a good or bad thing, just a content warning for others who may or may not read a book based on the scenes.I give this 4/5 stars. I’d also like to thank Netgalley and Talia Hibbert for an advanced copy of this book."
"I read a lot. Several hundred books a year ""a lot"". Since it's near the end of December, you know I've consumed quite a few books by now, many of which were quite good. This was my favorite.I'm not going to spend time recapping the story but there were two main things this book blew out of the water.1) Mental health and the importance of prioritizing it. That the hero started a foundation to do this, and address emotional well-being in general, specifically targeting toxic masculinity, just made it better.2) Learning your partner's love language and trying to speak it, without trying to change them to match yours.Seriously. I loved this book."
"This is a story about about two imperfect people who are adorably perfect for each other.Ok. I’m probably in the minority here, but I loved Dani Brown so much more than Chloe Brown! Both of these sisters are hilarious, but I feel like I related to Dani more. She’s smart, confident, and driven; but when it comes to her heart, she hasn’t gotten out of bed yet.I love how this picks up in the middle of Dani & Zafir’s relationship as co-workers and friends. Because they are already familiar with each other, everything else just leads to a higher level of comfort and trust between them.The author did a really good job when creating these characters and their stories; they aren’t stereotypical, they are dealing with real life, grown people issues, and the banter between the two is hilarious.Also...bonus points for an interracial relationship that still consist of POC."
"This was such a cute and quick need. I was able to read through this book within a day. I found the two main characters, Dani and Zafir, to be hilarious and multi-dimensional. I found that they are not what they first presented themselves to be. I loved how Zafir was in tune with his own emotions and was still confident in his masculinity. It was refreshing to see a reversal in their roles in their relationship because books hardly portray the woman not wanting to settle down…or maybe I just have not read those books.I love the diversity in the characters both in religion, sexual orientation, and race. I find that such diversity is such a rare find in a romance book but Hibbert is just killing the game. Hibbert’s writing was phenomenal and you can tell that she truly did her research on mental illness in general but specifically, men dealing with mental illness.Also, I appreciate that the author/publishing company provided a trigger warning at the beginning of the book and I did not feel that by doing so gave any type of spoilers.Anyway, I would recommend this book for anyone who is heavily into romance books and does not mind cringe-worthy parts but the steaminess thoughhhhh is well worth it."
"Take a Hint, Dani Brown by Talia Hibbert⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️......“Because the world wasn’t split into unhappy endings and happily ever afters. There were blessings everywhere and a thousand shades of joy all around him. Every shade should be savored.”......Let me start by saying that this book is super steamy (I’d put it in the rated R category), so if that bothers you, then this one may not be the book for you.This is the second book I’ve read by Talia Hibbert. She is a black British author who writes about diverse characters and this is her second novel in The Brown Sisters’ Series (Get a Life, Chloe Brown was the first). What I love about her writing is that she includes characters with strong, female voices. They know what they want out of life but they also grow and develop throughout each story. She also includes men who don’t pretend like they have it all together and are doing hard work to be better humans. Talia is a self proclaimed book snob and her wit and sense of humor come through on every page of her writing. There will be three total books in this series. Each one is about one of the Brown sisters falling in love. This second installment comes out in June! Thanks to @netgalley and @harpercollins for providing me with this advance copy."
"“What you get out of being loved, it’s supposed to be worth the compromise. When it’s good, it makes you want to compromise.”⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣I’m a sucker for a fake relationship romance & the second book in the Brown Sisters series delivered, exploring the deep vulnerability of love while portraying the pressures of academia, recovery from acute grief & the odd yet sometimes pivotal role social media can play in our lives.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣What I loved:⁣⁣⁣- Dani is bisexual, Black & has a beautiful, real, full body. While she’s confident in her appearance & intellect, she’s also secretly hurting & guarding her heart after seeing her relationships fail when they’re strained by her commitment to her work as a professor & researcher. She’s also the one who’s anti-relationships—that’s refreshing to see not being cast in the man.⁣⁣⁣- The banter: witty, sharp, sarcastic, the repartee between Dani & Zafir is delightfully laced with playful affection.⁣⁣⁣- Zafir wears his heart on his big burly sleeve. He loves reading romance & believes in happily ever after. He’s a Pakistani teddy bear of a man whose body isn't a Calvin Klein model’s, who wants to teach boys to emote & grow into men free of toxic masculinity.⁣⁣⁣- Representation: It's empowering & imperative that romance portrays all bodies as lovable, desirable &  sexual. On this front, Talia inspires me & knocks it out of the park.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣With her usual wit & sensitivity, Hibbert delves into heavy topics—grief, anxiety, panic episodes & toxic relationships, to name a few. I LOVE seeing this in romance. That said, I personally enjoyed the heaviness & humor balance *more* in GET A LIFE, CHLOE BROWN, which felt a bit funnier, a bit better at settling into the love & intimacy between its leads. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣In short: I continue to be in awe of Talia’s writing. While this book’s tenor feels a smidge heavier than Chloe Brown, I still recommend it! lt’s snappy, bright, real & sexy. I'm looking forward to hearing about Eve & seeing where the last Brown Sister takes us.⁣⁣Thank you to Avon & NetGalley for the early review copy—all opinions are my own!"
"I've heard great things about Talia Hibbert's books and was excited to read Take a Hint, Dani Brown. This book was funny, sweet, and sexy. I loved how Talia subverted gender stereotypes in this book, with the hero who reads romance and believes in HEA and the heroine, who is a commitmentphobe. It also touched on some heavy topics such as grief and anxiety. I enjoyed this book, but I didn't love it as much as everyone else. My attention kept wandering because Dani's and Zaf's romance didn't captivate me. I think having very high expectations didn't serve me well. But I am happy I finally read one of Talia's stories.*ARC provided by the publisher"
"This book really resonated with me. I already loved the first in The Brown Sisters series, so I was expecting to love this one as well and I was not wrong.The growth both Dani and Zaf have throughout the course of the book is heartwarming and inspiring. The struggles and honestly around mental health are great to see. Dani's difficulties working herself too hard and doing no self-care (not remembering to eat, not sleeping, etc) is sooo relatable to anyone who has gone through grad school. And Zaf is kind, caring, and has his own relatable issues with grief.On top of dealing with all of that, the book was fun to read and steamy AF!Can't wait to keep reading Talia Hibbert!"
"The story of Dani and Zafir is simply excellent. I enjoyed the sarcastic and witty banter between the two main characters. It made for a smart and funny read that is really enjoyable. Like Get A Life, Chloe Brown, this second book in the series also offers a layer of depth that gives the story a richness not normally found in romance books. Not only are Dani and Zafir two diverse characters not typically found in romance books, but they struggle with real emotional and mental health problems that I think readers will relate to or learn from.I would HIGHLY recommend this book to fans of romance or fans of fiction with diverse characters. The first book in the series is excellent and worth reading, too, but it is not necessary to read that book BEFORE this one. This is a steamy romance book, but I would not classify it as erotica."
"We have Danika and Zafir in this book. They’re friends who to fake date to help his nonprofit after a video of him carrying her out of a building goes viral. They “date”, sexual tensions grow so they become sex buddies and eventually it all turns in to love and happily ever after.I loved Zaf more than Red from the first book. Plus Zaf reads romance novels so he’s already a winner! This book gives you all the feels while dealing with the tough issues of grief, anxiety, self-worth, and therapy. A well developed storyline and characters you root for...there’s literally nothing not to love!"
"I loved this book!  Zaf….sigh  Zaf is a sweetheart who’s totally cuddly and alpha hotness combined and he completely stole my heart.  This is the second book I’ve read of Talia’s and I love that her characters are wonderfully real with real issues they’re dealing with every day.  Zaf has been dealing with his anxiety issues since he’s a kid and he continue to improv on how he manages his anxiety as a grown man.  Dani has trust issues both with herself and especially with others.  And, again, she continues to work thru her issues.  At the heart of Talia’s stories are relationships and that Family is everything.I would encourage everyone to read this book!I received an ARC from NetGalley for my honest review."
This was a nice romance book with a queer black female which is something rarely seen in books. I thought that aspect was dealt with really well in the story and incorporated the things Dani dealt with as a black woman without drifting from the main romance theme. Zaf and Dani had gray chemistry but I think there were so many unnecessary scenes. This book could have been 250 pages and still have been great. Many of the unnecessary scenes made me bored and there were points where I was skimming. All in all it was a nice happily ever after romance with two POC leads and was quite entertaining.
"This book. This book made me smile so much, excluding the times it made me cry. The writing is delightful-witty banter, engaging story, and a couple of lovable fools. And I mean that in the most complimentary way possible. I adore Zafir and his dry humor and slight grumpiness. Danika is so smart but kind of exasperating but also lovable. They really are #couplegoals.I was lucky enough to win a copy of the book in a Goodreads giveaway. It’s extra sweet because I can’t stop looking at the adorable cover and the experience might not be the same in ebook."
"Talia Hibbert has somehow done the impossible — made a sequel that’s even better than the first book! I so enjoyed reading about Chloe Brown, so I started this book with a little trepidation. I just didn’t see how Hibbert could outdo herself, but I was so wrong! It’s like she took everything that worked in the first book, and increased it with this one. More sarcasm and witty banter, more emotional, tear-jerking moments, and more steam!And in true Hibbert fashion, she made me fall in love with all her characters (can Fatima be my new BFF?), but here are my reasons for loving the two main characters:🌟 Dani: What. A. Badass. We don’t see a lot of characters like Dani. She’s a bisexual, Black PhD student, who works hard to be on track for her career goals. She forms her own opinions and doesn’t let anyone get in her way. However, Dani is also proof that someone with an abundance of self confidence can still have insecurities. Her insecurities of her own worth and sharing vulnerable emotions was so relatable, and watching her growth through the book was one of my favorite parts of the book!🌟 Zaf: What. A. Hunky. Teddy Bear. Zaf is a Muslim, former professional rugby player with a tragic past. He deals with his anxiety daily, but won’t let that stop him from helping others. While he works as a security guard in the building where Dani teaches, his true passion is growing his charity, Tackle It, that aims to teach young men how to talk about their emotions openly, while being coached in rugby. Though he has a rough exterior, Zaf’s patience, sweetness, and willingness to be open with Dani will make you swoon! Did I mention he reads romance novels for fun?Talia Hibbert is quickly becoming one of my favorite contemporary romance authors! I 100% recommend this book as a fun romance to get lost into!This book comes out TODAY, so you don’t even have to wait to pick it up! Thank you to NetGalley, HarperCollins Avon, and the author for a review copy of this book.For more book related content, come find me on Instagram @MissBookReviews"
02/2021Ok im so glad I decided to re read this story! 8t was just absolutely adorable and I cant believe I thought it was annoying the first go round! Dani is a hilarious character and her view on what she wants is awesome. I loved that the author gave us a woman who didn't want to just settle and put her career on hold. And Zaf is like the sweetest man ever. So incredibly patient!! And such a gentleman too! You hardly ever see that in books. This author has a way of creating characters that are complex and opposites of what today's societies expect.
"I wasn't sure what to write as a review for this book beside fun and sweet but I did find that Zaf and Dani are a great pair together. Zaf is the perfect go for Dani if she's willing to let anyone knock down her wall. She needs someone who will love her for who and what she is and that's her nerdy, quirky self. Zaf isn't just the hot co-worker but he's a romantic but he has his own issues as well. Once these two get together with a plan the collision between them begins. Now who's going to end it. I've enjoyed this fun and can't wait for the next book."
"“𝓟𝓮𝓸𝓹𝓵𝓮 𝓼𝓱𝓸𝓾𝓵𝓭𝓷'𝓽 𝓫𝓮 𝓬𝓱𝓪𝓷𝓰𝓮𝓭 - 𝓫𝓾𝓽 𝓹𝓮𝓻𝓱𝓪𝓹𝓼 𝓽𝓱𝓮𝔂 𝓼𝓱𝓸𝓾𝓵𝓭 𝓰𝓻𝓸𝔀.”ROMANTIC, HOT, AND A COMICAL MASTERPIECE.A fellow witch!! I would have loved to meet Danika in real life. She's a gorgeous and strong woman. They couldn't have been more unalike if they tried but then again, Zaf has proven to us all that love conquers all and I feel like his patience and kindness is what Dani needed the most in her life at the moment. This book is absolutely amazing. I highly recommend this book to any lover of reading romance. This book was hilarious and I couldn't help but LOL at some parts. One more sister's happy ending awaits; happy reading!"
"This book was really sweet. I loved Zaf because he was such a sweetheart, read romance books, and was so open and vulnerable. The discussions on anxiety and breaking down masculinity are so necessary. But tbh I didn't really like Dani. I also would have loved more discussions on her life in academia.I think folks will enjoy this a lot, especially the fake dating and social media aspects. The chemistry between the two was sizzling, so I do recommend it. I just wanted more. Tbh, I reallly loved Kiran and Jamal and would LOVE to read their story!I love Talia Hibbert's writing and I will be coming back for more when she writes Eve's story!I HIGHLY recommend the first book in this series if you haven't read it yet. I loved it more.I recieved an advanced copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."
"I read Get A Life, Chloe Brown and enjoyed it so when I saw the next book focused on Dani Brown, I couldn’t wait to read it! Take A Hint, Dani Brown was even better for me than the first Brown Sister book. I read it in a day and loved the strong, quirky, unapologetic, confident, uber academic nerd that is Danika Brown! Zafir was also a perfect book hero for me! I loved the broody, secretly sweet, funny, “murder face”, ex-rugby player who was holding out for a happily ever after when he’d dealt with a crippling family tragedy. I LOVED Zaf’s charity that targets toxic masculinity and mental health in the book and I wish that all athletic institutions would jump on this bandwagon to Tackle It! *read the book and you’ll get what I did there* This book had two of my favorite tropes; fake relationship and friends to lovers! Aside from the stellar romance and relationship, I loved the theme in both of the existing Brown Sisters books that recovery and healing aren’t instant and there isn’t a magical point where everything is better and that mental health issues are as real and important as any other illness. In both books, Hibbert makes a point to have a character discuss that getting better doesn’t mean that you always have to be OK. Bravo! I also loved all the cultures represented in this book, I found this series because I was seeking out Own Voices books and diversity in main characters, so this series ticked all the boxes! I will probably reread Take A Hint, Dani Brown, and cannot wait to see what is in store for the last Brown sister!"
"I finished Chloe’s book yesterday and I don’t think I’ve ever bought and read the next book in a series quite so fast. This book was hysterical and heart warming and silly and so much fun!! Dani is brilliant and funny and so very set in her ways. Zaf is probably going to be my book crush for the next fifteen years or so. Thoughtful and understanding and so caring and honest about his struggles with anxiety and losing his family members. Truly a superb book, the only downside is now I have to wait for book number 3!"
"From my instagram @the_og_kindle:*warning: this novel addresses mental illness and anxiety*⠀⠀We are back with the Brown sister trio, this time addressing the life of my favorite sister, Danika. Dani Brown is a woman who knows exactly what she wants professionally. But romance? Yeah that’s not for her. She’d rather eat dirt than embark on a relationship with anyone. So when she gets locked in an elevator and is rescued by the impossibly gorgeous ex rugby player security guard Zaf Ansari, it spurs a video being posted online “shipping” them with the hashtag #DrRugbae. At the same time, Zaf has a sports charity he has been wanting to get off the ground and coupling them together may be the ticket and the publicity he will need to make it a success. Even though both of them feel something, they each make this agreement: don’t fall in love. ⠀⠀When I read books by the same author, I can’t help but compare the two and I will say I connected and loved this book so much more. In the previous novel, I struggled with enjoying the character Chloe and Chloe’s love interest Redford but in this novel I loved Zaf’s open heart, directness, and I could easily relate to his anxiety about love and life. I also loved Danika’s confidence, passion, and her character development was so raw and real. And, as always, their sexual tension was 🔥. Their journey about the trials and tribulations of relationships was written in such a witty and enjoyable banter, I can’t wait for the third novel about the third sister! ⠀⠀"
"Yet again, Talia Hibbert hits it out of the ballpark. I swear, I love and adore every word she's written and this book is definitely no exception. If I could live wrapped up her words, my life would most likely be complete. Zaf and Dani are such real, strong, wonderful characters and watching them slowly fall for one another despite their best efforts was beautiful. Not to mention watching them support one another when they were struggling respectively. They are absolutely relationship goals #DrRugBae"
"Took a chance last year and read the first Brown sister novel, patting myself on the back for that astute choice ever since. When the second one was announced, I was overjoyed; Danika's character in Take a Chance, Chloe Brown gave readers a hint of what her story would be like, so it is fitting that the title is Take a Hint, Dani Brown. Dani meets her match in former rugby player turned campus security guard Zafir Ansari. They enter into a pretend romance that morphs into so much more, leaving both participants changed in unexpected ways. Loved it!"
"When you think a perfect book man doesn’t exist, along comes Zafir. He’s emotionally in tune, he loves his family, he reads romance, and he understands and is dealing with the trauma he’s been through. I thought he and Dani were totally worthy of social media fame and a cute hashtag.Fake dating turned more is a favorite trope of mine. And then throw in opposites attract and I’m hooked. Zaf’s more laid back and calm attitude meshed so we’ll with Dani’s work focused, stay busy mantra."
"An absolute delight of a book! Dani Brown isn't interested in relationships--she just wants sex. She's got her ambitions, her studies, and her sisters, and she certainly doesn't need romance on top of that. But her friend Zafir is a romantic at heart, listening to romance audiobooks during his gig as a campus security guard. An incident during an emergency drill ends with Zaf carrying Dani out of the building and a hashtag that labels them as the perfect couple. Only one problem: they aren't. Except faking it could be exactly the thing Zaf's struggling sports charity needs to reach more people. A fake relationship is fine by Dani--but when real emotions start to come into play, she'll have to come to terms with just how real their relationship might be becoming.I adored this book from start to finish. Hibbert's writing was so witty and hilarious I often found myself laughing at the dialogue between Dani and Zafir. The relationship was so sweet and well developed, and I loved that the drama wasn't overly drawn out or overdone. And Zafir's anxiety was handled so wonderfully and genuinely. We don't see that nearly enough in fiction, and I love to see author's including it and including it well. I just can't say enough good things about this book. If you like romance, you need to pick it up now. It's just that good.**Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for providing me with an advanced copy of this book in exchange for an honest review**"
"What a treat it was to read this book!In the prologue, Dani Brown and her best friend sit bickering at their homemade altar before statues of female deities and ask for help with their love lives. Dani asks for a sign to point her in the right direction -- and a protein bar falls out of her pocket.  So...a sign? A hint?Dani is a Ph.D. candidate at the university where Zafir Ansari is a security guard, working to get funding for his nonprofit organization. From the beginning, we know that Zafir is smitten with Dani and each day when Dani brings him coffee, he gives her a protein bar. When Zafir rescues Dani from a stuck elevator during a security drill and the video goes viral, they become campus celebrities.  Dani and Zafir then pretend to date to get publicity for Zafir's foundation. The reader spends the rest of the book waiting for  Dani to ""take a hint"" and stick with Zafir.One of my favorite tropes is where the hero is smitten from the start and spends the rest of the story trying to win the heroine. Dani has emotional wounds from the past that get in her way. Zafir is a fabulous, sexy alpha who is rebuilding his life after a family tragedy. In a delicious twist, he is also an avid romance reader who is a hopeless romantic. (I'm pretty sure he was reading Beverly Jenkins' Tempest at one point). You will love Dani and Zafir and when the HEA comes at last, you will want to read the all over book again. Talia Hibbert dedicated this book ""For the Hopeless Romantics..."" and you will absolutely agree.Five stars!"
"Zafir was such a sweetheart with Dani! I loved how much he adored her, and this couple were just SO ADORABLE together. Take a Hint, Dani Brown was so sweet, funny and sexy, Dani & Zafir had some pretty intense chemistry happening.I'm so glad I listened to the audio, the narrator was fabulous, and she made the story so enjoyable to listen to. I smiled so many times listening to this, especially when Zafir was so grumpy towards others, yet so sweet to his Dani."
"Zafir is the epitome of SWEET CINNAMON ROLL. I just enjoyed reading his character so much. Also loved  Danika's character as well because, I can relate to not being emotive and coming off as heartless robot. This book just checked all of favorite things to find in a romance. Sweet hero, quirky heroine, and steamy romance to boot. Also this book was unexpectedly hilarious and that was a joy. I really can't wait for Eve's books and just more books from Hibbert in general."
"Y’all. I knew I was gonna love this book even more than the first one! I appreciated the first one so much, but when we got bits and pieces of Dani and then I read her synopsis I knew this one was going to be my favorite.Things I adored about this book:1. The gender swap of typical romance stereotypes. Dani got to be the no-strings, “I just want what I want without the love,” snarky badass and then we got soft, sweet, grumpy Zafir who’s looking for nothing BUT love. It was excellent.2. Her male love interests being so mentally and emotionally open and respectful. They experience grief and abuse, etc. and they are willing to put in the work to grow and get better. I loved that Zaf not only worked on his grief and mental illness but helped other young men too as well and ties it all to working against toxic masculinity. Heart eyes.3. Not only diversity in race, but culture, spirituality, beliefs, etc.4. ALL THE SNARK. There were so many hilarious/snarky, grumpy/snarky, unbearably cute/snarky lines in this book that when I started thinking of one to quotes couldn’t decide cause it’s the whole book.And honestly so much more because this book did everything for me: sweet and steamy, emotional and adorable. It did everything.Just please read it."
"Dani Brown is busy. Teaching her own class, working on her PhD, keeping up with her crazy sisters, she has no time for romance. Everything changes when a video is released of her being carried out of work in the arms of the handsome security guard Zafir (Zaf) Ansari. While the world fell in love with the video, the two made a plan to fake a relationship to help promote his charity. How long will #DrRugbae stick around? Will their pretend romance turn real? The steamiest romance I’ve read in a while, fans of Talia Hibbert will love this book just as much as her first!"
"this book was a bit too precious and twee for my taste. some of the dialogue was bordering on eye rolly, the heroine, danika , felt more like a collection of aesthetics than a real person. really enjoyed zafir. the big romantic gesture at the end was sweet, but overall, didn’t really enjoy this as much as say, work for it."
"I love this series, I love the characters. I love how they are unique, struggling with mental and physical challenges that are not often discussed in real life. Fake relationship has always been my jam, but I love how Zaf and Dani find not just love, but balance and self acceptance through their journey."
Lots of humor and fabulous sarcasm.A bit heavy on the narrative and did skim quite a bit especially at 80%.  However the narrative was balanced with engaging and witty dialogue.Love the interaction between the characters. Would recommend and will read the next in the series.
"9/10 I hold the hand of the girl character and take the ride as she grows, fails, etc. but in ‘take a hint’ I was team zaf! I held his hand through his highs and lows. He was beautifully honest and flawed and my favorite! I can’t wait until book three is out and tells Eve’s story🤗🤗"
"Another success by this author! Loved almost every minute of it. There was a little too much inner monologue for me in which they denied their feelings for one another, but overall what a great story. Romantic, sexy, smart, and so damn funny. Can’t wait to finish the series."
"Take a Hint, Dani Brown is delightful. Talia Hibbert always does an amazing job writing characters that are flawed yet lovable, and this book is no different. We have Dani, a brilliant, confident, witchy professor, and Zafir, the grumpy, burly, security guard who's suffered a terrible loss. After accidentally becoming a viral sensation, they embark on a fake relationship.This is a story where both characters treat each other with respect. It is just lovely. Yet again, Talia writes a story that is beautiful and inclusive, but will still make you cackle."
"So good! Oh my God, I loved this book! This book handled interracial romance, people dealing with anxiety, people scared to get close with others romantically, plus-sized women so well. This is how you write a superb book. I can't believe I am moving on to the last book soon."
4.5 starsDani and Zaf are so meant to be and #couplegoals.  Two people who make each other whole.Enjoyed reading their love story immensely.  The supporting characters along with Dani and Zaf really make the story.
Hibbert does it again! This is a thoroughly enjoyable romance with real characters who tackle love and being a human head on. Hibbert strikes this amazing balance of sexy fun and deep poignancy. I can’t wait for the final installment!
"The unconventional love story between Zaf and Dani was as unexpected as it was wonderful. I found this story funny and charming. The dialogue between the two characters was absolutely fabulous. Both characters defied gender stereotypes in a way that was so refreshing. Zaf, in particular, was great to see in romance literature. We have a Pakistani man who is not a controlling alpha male, but instead is a nuanced, gentle man who is both a former professional athlete and a reader of romance novels. I have not read Talia Hibbert's first novel, but I plan to now."
"Take a Hint, Dani Brown was insightful, sweet, witty, and a complete page-turner. I absolutely adore the Brown sisters and everything Talia Hibbert writes! Dani is freaking hilarious and Zaf is broody when a bit awkward and a whole lot swoony. Just what I needed, really."
Dani and Zaf’s relationship draws you in from the moment that you’re introduced to them. Their chemistry is evident from the very beginning and only grows through the book. A good light hearted read.
"Super fun, just like the first one. A perfect beach read. I completely loved the two main characters, and Zaf's personality was just SO sweet!"
"Talia has done such an amazing job on Take A Hint, Dani Brown. The characters are flawed and real. The romance is done fantastically and the writing is great (and funny)!"
This book just filled me with such joy. I loved Dani and Zaf may be one of my favorite heroes now.
"I love the way Talks writes!! I can't wait to read the 3rd book! I'm hooked on the Brown sisters. This was an absolute page turner, just like Get A Life, Chloe Brown. I must admit, I'm so glad I can read these on my Kindle so I can get the definitions of some of these ""big words"" right away LOL I'm definitely expanding my vocabulary LOL."
This particular story wasn't just for me.  It was just an ok read for me.
"This book was funny, sweet, romantic... basically everything I want."
"I really enjoy this series and though at some points I was so frustrated by both Dani and Zaf, it warned my heart to see their growth throughout. Looking forward to book 3!"
I loved the first book about Chloe but this book may be even better. I laughed out loud so many times.
I loved everything about it.  What a wonderful summer read!!!!  I waited for this after the first book.  I think I like this one better .  Her books were my first romance let alone mixed ethnicity books.  Thank you TH.  Now waiting for the book about Eve!!!
"I loved this book! Such a fun, yet emotional read. Dani is a super hero and Zaf is a sports legend and I never wanted their story to end."
Very mushy and I liked it a lot!
"I loved the first Brown Sisters book and this one might have been even better! Sexy, funny, incredibly sweet, a joy to read."
This book was fantastic. It kept me smiling throughout the book.
"Intelligent, fierce, nervous, sexy DANI BROWNZAFIR MR. RUGBY, romantic, anxious, strong  family orientatedMust read Dani Brown is the middle sister of CHLOE BROWN(The big Sister)"
"One of the best books I have read all year. Unlikely main characters make it unexpected and a really, really good read."
"This book was everything I want in a summer rom com. Feisty heroine, hilarious dialogue, a super sexy and sensitive hero. PUT IT IN MY VEINS, TALIA HIBBERT."
This is a fun uncomplicated read. Loved the fact that Zafir was a man who faced his own emotions so clearly.
"Great easy read, relatable characters, steamy scenes!"
I have started reading this and couldn't get into it
"It took me awhile to get into this book but when I did it was pure joy. This is book 2 in the Brown Sisters series and I think it's safe to say there will be a book 3 with the youngest sister Eve. I loved Get a Life, Chloe Brown so I expected to also love this book especially since Dani is a PhD student. I didn't love Dani Brown until the last half of the book :). Zaf though is an overprotective uncle, brother in law cinnamon roll. I loved him from the start. We get to see a main male character who is in touch with his feelings AND emotionally available. Can I meet a Zaf irl? I loved these 2 banter and throughout their fake dating they established healthy boundaries (except for breaking up aftera month).Dani Brown like many of us realizes how difficult it is to recover from heartbreak. She believed that she wasn't good enough and had to change in order to be in a relationship. So her strategy was to position herself to avoid being hurt again. She focused on her work and didn't want to compromise for anyone. But thankfully there was Gigi (who I love) and Professor Holly to remind Dani, work isn't enough and that relationships matter. I think it's important to be aware of how previous hurt bubbles up and protective decisions we can make in order to avoid being hurt again. Hibbert presented the reader with a romantic dilemma that sometimes the decisions we make can be just as dangerous as trying to falling in love. However, with the right partner and taking the relationship at an agreeable pace you can simultaneously experience love and fear but survive. Zaf was a good example of taking a past hurt but trying to learn from it. His advantage was he went to therapy and developed healthy coping skills. I want to read more male characters with Zaf's temperament and vulnerability. Also this is the 3rd book that uses men reading romance novels as a way to be a better partner (Bromance bookclub and Beach Read), if this is a new romance trope I'm here for it. I really liked Dani and Zaf together and there love story was so precious. Thankfully we got a little cameo of Chloe and Red who are still going strong. This was a sweet book and I'm so happy to have read it.4.75 stars for some pacing issues in the beginningTrigger warnings for car accident resulting in death (father and brother), panic attacks, anxiety, cheating, and gas lighting."
"There is something about a m/f romance with a soft hero for me. I love them. Maybe is because of a big number of romances with douchebags as heroes that reading one with a nice guy is my weakness. And Zafir is exactly that. He looks all big and intimidating because of his resting bitch face (which as someone who also has one: relatable), but he's so soft and caring and funny and precious, and he reads romance novels!! And is just THE MAN (seriously, what do I need to do to have a man like him?) and I love him.This book has several tropes I love in romance: fake dating, friends to lovers, friends with benefits to lovers, soft hero and it does them all perfectly.The chemistry Dani and Zaf had was AMAZING. I am just so so in love with them. The way they could joke about so many things but also talk about their struggles and mental health issues and how because of this you get to see how much they care for each other melts my heart and I loved every time they called each other ""darling"" or ""sweetheart"", it was so cute. They just love each other so much and I love them for it. And the crumbs we got of Chloe and Red made me want to re-read their book ASAP.""Take a hint, Dani Brown"" was perfect and I will be re-reading it as many times as I can."
"Laugh out loud funny.  Danika Brown is no joke, quirky and oblivious to her own world of teaching and working on her PhD.  Zafir, ex Rugby player and security guard who suffered a personal family tragedy fancies Danika with her weird ways.  Zafir is a hopeless romantic reading and listening to romance novels and hoping to get the attention of one Danika Brown while slowly working his way into her life.  I thought it was sweet."
"Thank you Talia Hibbert for reminding why I love romance novels. I didn't know a book could make me laugh, smile, and cry all at the same time. I love the way toxic masculinity is tackled in this book as well as representation of neurodivergent folks. I think I may love this one more than Get a Life, Chloe Brown and that book was pretty great!"
It was an easy and fun book to read. I can't wait to read the other books in the series.
"Dani Brown was hilarious!I loved her inner monologue, it made me laugh out loud so many times and I am not one for laughing outwardly at a book.Zafir was an amazingly supportive love interested. I appreciated his openness and willingness to let Dani shine. We all long for partners that see us and let us be our most authentic selves. He just needed Dani to trust that feeling too.I was a huge fan of Chloe Brown's book and cannot wait for Evie's!This series is so much fun, with great characters and hilarious hijinks.Highly recommend! -Sky———Ah, Dani and Zafir. What a delightful story. This is a fake relationship trope story, which is my 2nd least favorite trope, but honestly, it was never fake for Zafir and WE. ALL. KNEW. IT. It’s so refreshing to see an emotionally available man, try to give his partner what they want, but still knowing they are going to fail and fall. Hard. It was like watching a beautiful car crash…no wait, that’s not right…it was watching a flower bloom: beautiful, magnificent, quick to wilt.But fear not! As is always with romance: there is a happy ending.For the majority of this book, Dani is preparing for a panel with her idol. The whole time I was worried that something would happen at the panel. I was worried because this is how books work sometimes, that the black moment would occur before or during Dani’s big moment, ruining it. But it didn’t. Dani shined. She was exemplary. It was a beautiful moment for me.This book gave me a book high. It’s a must-read. -Ford"
"This is a Romance, and this book is the second book in the Brown Sisters series. I really enjoyed this book, but I love the first book in this series a little bit better. I loved the characters in this book, and they where so fun to follow. This book was well-written. This book is a lot more steamy then the first book. This characters starts fake dating, but both of them really likes each other which turns to real dating."
Amazing and fun book
"Take a Hint, Dani Brown is the hilariously romantic tale of Danika Brown, a PhD student, and Zafir Ansari a rugby-player-turned-security-guard. Dani is an ambitious realist, and an all-round badass. Zafir is the brooding, sensitive, hopeless romantic. A video of them quickly goes viral, and as the internet dubs them #DrRugbae, they take advantage of the publicity to help Zaf’s start-up charity.Both the protagonists are bursting with personality in this book. Their sharp back-and-forth highlights Hibbert’s talent for playful conversation. Their dynamic was so entertaining! There’s something about insults with flirty undertones that will always be funny to me. And I found the dialogue to be one of the most captivating elements of this novel.I also love the diversity between the Danika and Zafir. Their race, body type, sexuality, and personality differ but they fit together perfectly. The secondary characters are delightful too. Dani’s sisters are amusingly quick-witted as always, while Zaf’s family are adorably charming.Dani is a cynic when it comes to romance. Despite her fiery and blunt personality, she still comes across as very loveable human. Nevertheless, Zaf is easily my favourite character in the book (and funnily, Red was my favourite in Chloe’s book). I love that Zaf’s a romance-reading titan. All he wants is a happy ending. He also suffers from grief and anxiety, which is openly discussed throughout the book, and expertly covered. I found his way of thinking to very relatable and realistic, and his vulnerability is refreshing to read. He comes across as a big, aloof, grouch, but in reality he’s a bit of a gentle giant. His goal is to combat toxic masculinity through sports and therapy – he’s too pure!I’ll forever be a fan of Talia Hibbert’s writing. The way she portrays thought, emotion and awareness always makes her books so compelling! It’s difficult not to become wrapped in the lives of these characters because they’re so well-layered and refined. The drama, which occurs in almost every contemporary romance, is very believable. And I think the main reason is because the nature and traits of the characters are so well-developed, there’s little for the reader to question. As I saw the events unfold I thought, “Yep, that’s exactly how Dani would react.” Components like this make even the conflict a gratifying reading experience.In comparison to Chloe’s story, I felt this book didn’t have the same addictive flow. I struggled with the pacing in the middle, as the characters and the storyline fell into a bit of a limbo. Fortunately, Hibbert’s moving and expressive writing made up for this, and the story picks up again as it rounds to a close. Although this book didn’t beat Get a Life, Chloe Brown for me, it was still an enjoyable (and swoon-worthy) read. I can’t wait to read Eve’s book next year!Overall, Take a Hint, Dani Brown is an awesome addition to The Brown Sisters series. If you’re a fan of the friends-to-lovers and fake relationship tropes, as well as diverse romance that sits on the steamier side, this is the book for you.PS: Talia Hibbert included a trigger warning at the beginning of this book. Why don’t all authors do this?!Anika | chaptersofmay.com"
"This is going to be a short review because the book was just brilliant.Great storyline? CheckLoveable characters? CheckLaugh out loud parts? CheckFan yourself parts? CheckCan't put it down? CheckWhat else do you need? Talia Hibbert has a way with words that continues to amaze me. Topics are dealt with sensitively, the conversation between characters is fab and there is absolutely nothing to dislike about this book! If you are looking for your next great read this is it!"
"So I have a really bad habit of avoiding hyped books because I think I'm going to dislike them to just be swept away in the hype. Neither is the case here because this genuinely is glorious. The banter, the quirky Dani, sweet loveable giant Zafir. It really is everything everyone says it is. Funny, adorable, sweet as sin, spicy and tense in spots and I cannot say enough about how wonderful everyone in this book is. It is the moment. No question."
"Talia Hibbert is the Queen of incredible characters – writing honest, human characters coping with the struggles that life throws at them. She gives people characters to look up to and love. In this book, Talia Hibbert tackles anxiety and I adore how Zaf teaches the boys in his class that mental health issues don’t make them any less masculine. It’s such an important message and one that the author demonstrates with sensitivity and empathy. I can’t get over how amazing Talia Hibbert’s books are, and I can’t wait to explore them all!"
"I loved this book. It was just a great refreshing take on the genre. A black, bi, goddess-worshipping woman who knows she’s excellent and just wants someone to fulfil her sexual needs? How often do we get a main character like that?! The dialogue was snappy and fun, the sex scenes were scorching and I loved Dani’s relationship with her sisters and her friends.Can’t wait to read more from this author."
"Initially I loved the characters and the story line. I love romances, comedy and quirky characters and usually take things for what they are. Basically I read this book in one hit and did enjoy it but 2 things made me roll my eyes, put it down and take a little break. 1) the conflict that every story has- when the main characters decide they won't be together; in this case Danika decides Zaf can't possibly love her and doesn't want to ultimately dissappoint him by not being enough so she breaks up with him. And 2) The reunion at the end, was just a bit too sickly sweet and cringey for me. Overall, I 100% loved the first two thirds of the book, just thought the last part was a bit dramatic."
This is a book I would definitely recommend. There are very few books which have approached the awareness of emotions and their acceptance so beautifully and crafting such a sensible love story. I am in awe of the author. Thank you Talia Hibbert for writing this story.
"I absolutely adore Talia Hibbert. She's definitely my favorite romance author, and this book was just as incredible as all her other books. We have a sassy, confident, and amazing heroine, and a sweet romance-reading hero. Friends to lovers and fake dating. What more could you ask for? It's super hot, romantic, and swoon-worthy. READ IT NOW!"
"Haven't read Ms Hibbert before but I will definitely do so again. What a treat this book was. Funny, sweet, real, poignant and tender. Oh, and HOT! Zafir and Dani are so opposite to each other yet the author shows how exactly right they are together. If only we could all have Dani's smarts and confidence and Zaf's huge heart filled with courage and hope. Delicious read from start to finish."
"I enjoyed this book but preferred Chloe brown. It had much more humour and enjoyed the relationship that she had with her man. Whilst this was ok it lost me at times and I found myself skipping pages just to get to the end. Felt it was too long for the storyline, felt repetitive"
"Please and thank you to the author. EXACTLY what I needed in 2020. Rarely do I read IR books set in the UK without a white counterpart, and rarely do I get a male lead who reads romance books. Re read straight away and in 2020, that is saying something."
"It's good to read a book with some proper, real world feelings even if it is a HEA. It's also great, because even though the characters are different races and different religions that is not the focus of any conflict; very refreshing and much appreciated. Thanks Talia"
"Yay and yet again I’m left completely satisfied by another one of Talia Hibberts books. I absolutely loved the relationship between Dani and Zaf, it all felt so real and true as if it could see them right in front of me. I just, don’t understand how Talia Hibbert does this? How does she make it so that every book she writes is utterly amazing and fascinating?"
"I loved the representation and diversity of the characters, the relevance and relatability of the personal challenges they were facing, and the vulnerability, emotion and understanding Talia brought through in the writing.The story arc is predictable, but the depth and character development makes up for it - the dialogue between Dani and her best friend and her sisters had me laughing out loud often. Thankfully this time round I knew it would be raunchy 🥵, but the rugby theme was a welcome and unexpected bonus."
"The writing of this book was so bad. So many obscenities and sexual references when they weren't even needed or funny.It came of as try hard and like the author wanted to show how cool she is.  I don't mind a curse word or a sexual reference, but God almighty I felt like I was attacked by a horny 12 year old. Bought it used from WeBuyBooks. I wouldn't recommend. I actually had to download the book and read it, because I didn't have my copy on time. Thank god though,  cause at least I got a refund."
"Talia, you have gone and done it again. Great believable characters, with real life problems and realistic love. Thus book is hot and adorable at the same time. I loved it and I can’t wait to read about Eve😉"
"Loved! Great characters...awesome plot... adored their relationship journey, and excited to read the next brown sisters book!"
"3.5 stars. this one is one of the smuttier books of the series.i liked it better than the first book, though it was too fluffy for my taste. loved the characters and loved the healthy portrayal of mental illness."
Great
"Beautiful beautiful beautiful. My whole heart skipped a beat. Both main characters were perfect, whole in themselves and honestly some of the best compatibility I’ve read in a fictional couple. Finished this in two days, would’ve finished earlier but I had exams haha."
"It was a steamy, lovely look at diverse characters who were smart, funny and believable."
"Amazing product, and fantastic read would buy again."
"I’m a sucker for the fake-dating trope and this book didn’t let me down.I liked how dramatic Dani was and how grounded Zaf was. They balanced each other so well.I loved loved how they portrayed Zaf’s anxiety and how his organization helped young men to express and deal with their emotions without judgement.Sorcha and Dani’s friendship was one of my favorite parts of this book. They’re hilarious.I related to both of the main characters because I’m an overthinker like Dani and a hopeless romantic with anxiety like Zaf.The grand romantic gesture at the end was very very cute and the epilogue even cuter.Overall, I enjoyed this book more than the previous one in the series!"
"I waited weeks for this book to arrive and today it did... what a shame... if there is a book more poorly written, I will be very surprised. I am not at all adverse to strong language in books, but come on, try and use it cleverly and possibly more sparingly, so that it has some meaning, rather than every second word and so without meaning. I so wanted to enjoy this book but I found the writing style unbearable and completely lacking in intelligence, with short disconnected sentences and poor use of words. Can't imagine a more poorly written book... sorry, but just can't find any positives about it!"
"Divertido, ingenioso y romántico.Estar en la cabeza de estos personajes, sobre todo de Danika, son unas risas.Él es un amor."
"I love everything about this book. Truly everything.'Take a Hint, Dani Brown' has my whole, entire heart. The bisexual rep!! The anxiety rep!! Just excellence all around. POC excellence. And the fake dating trope!! LOVEITLOVEITLOVEITLOVEIT"
This book was so much fun. I think I liked it even better than the first. Dani's personality was so funny and Zafir was just perfect. I loved them together and all the little moments they shared.
"Quero ler tudo que a Talia publicar! Eu amei esse livro, talvez ainda mais do que o primeiro. É muito divertido e coração quentinho."
"A fantastic follow-up to Get a Life, Chloe Brown. Definitely looking forward to the last book in the series."
"Fantastic book, she is my new favorite author!!"
Turned up early and is in great condition.
"o livro é ótimo, mas a amazon não empacotou direito então chegou todo amassado"
Another absolutely charming love story from Talia HibbertLoved it!
Geniak
J’ai beaucoup aimé mais je l’ai trouvé moins bien que le tome 1. Je l’ai trouvé long par moment mais j’ai adoré l’histoire et les personnages !
"I enjoyed every bit of this book, it’s a classic easy read!I appreciate the diversity of the characters and the touch of comedy, 100% recommande for hopeless romantics."
"The great goddess of our time, Talia Hibbert, said in her Goodreads review of this book that Boyfriend Material is an ""instant classic"", and I'm quite inclined to agree. I've been searching for something to fill the Red, White, and Royal Blue-shaped void in my heart, and not to take away from that priceless gem, but this book certainly did the trick. Our narrator, Luke, is vulnerable, honest, and so, so likable. And it's got everything-- fake dating, delightful banter, and an enviable friend group. I loved it!"
"I randomly saw the cover on goodreads and was immediately drawn because of the cover art! I'm glad I bought it because it was such a great romcom! I love Luc and Oliver! My only regret is that I found this book in 2021, so I missed all the hype and contests when it was released in 2020. Anyway, I've read this book about 4 times now, audio and kindle. I'm patiently waiting for Husband Material! Attached is my lego creation as a tribute to this amazing book and amazing cover art! Also check out all Alexis Hall's book especially Rosaline Palmer Takes the Cake!"
"I have always turned to AH books when I wanted to lose myself in UK settings and very sharp turns of phrases. This book is no exception, bit it's lighter in tone than most of the others I've read of his. I loved it. It kept me captivated from the first page, and I was sorry when it ended. I'm not an underliner but there were many things I wanted to remember later here."
"Yeah, this was fantastic. Luc and Oliver have rather legitimate emotional hurdles to contend with that louse up their ""fake"" relationship but they deal with them realistically and you get to see their behaviors change for the better. There are several instances of insidious and nonviolent homophobia that are simultaneously ridiculous--""we don't mind that you're gay, so long as you're the right kind of gay""--and devastating. This was a funny book that tackles emotionally difficult topics without losing its buoyancy."
If the ending wouldn't have left me with more questions than answers. About their future I would have gave this a five-star. I enjoyed reading it there was a lot of truth to it. And even though some of the storylines were a tad bit far-fetched they were humorous and therefore enjoyable. I just wish I could connect more with situations that happened after maybe an epilogue showing how they dealt with family issues and other suggestions given to each other
"I stayed up way too late to finish this book. It is so funny at times I had to stop reading just to finish laughing. It was heartbreakingly beautiful the way emotional vulnerability, friendship, and love were portrayed. It's an astounding story of personal growth. Some of the characters seemed ridiculous to me, but I ended up loving them. I didn't understand a lot of the British slang and there are cultural references that I still don't get but google is your friend here. Boyfriend Material is simply one of the best books I've read and now that I think of it, it is as delightful and insightful as my favorite Jane Austen books."
"I’m usually put off my romance. I took it on myself this year to read a select few of the most popular to see if I could find the appeal since romance seems to be such a hit genre among my demographic, and this happened to be on the goodreads 2020 nominee list for best romance. I went in with pretty low expectations but came out absolutely in love with all of these characters. I’ve had bad experiences with romances where the two leads are basically together just because they’re both attractive and horny so why not? But Luc and Oliver have genuine chemistry and great banter. The humor is exactly my style and each character is an individual and stand out. The supporting cast could support several books of their own. I’ll definitely be keeping my eyes open for my work from this author."
"I loved this book and the audible book is even better. For anyone who has messed up and thinks they've screwed up their life, Luc is your guy. This book is sweet, funny, and shows you that just because it looks like someone is a mess or completely on the ball, sometimes the reality is different. I laughed out loud several times (especially Luc's mom, her friend, and his co-workers) and groaned at Luc's mistakes. One of my favorite books of the year and top of the list for audible book."
"I saw this book on sale in a bookstore in Provincetown, MA.  As a Brit, the cover, with British images on it, immediately drew my attention. I am so glad it did. This is the best fiction I have read in a while. It is laugh-out-loud funny in places and great fun fun to read. But behind the humour is a beautiful sweet, tender and sincere love story. The main characters are so real, three dimensional, relatable and likeable. The supporting characters are also well defined and bring additional humour to the story. I don’t want to give any of the story away so I will end this review by simply saying that I strongly recommend this book. Buy it, read it, you won’t regret it in fact you will be happy you did."
"This book has officially filled the ""Red, White, and Royal Blue"" sized gaping hole that has been left in my heart since finishing said book.I adore this book! It was hilarious and real and sweet and perfect.The secondary characters were so well developed and Luc and Oliver were just amazing. I especially loved Luc's mom. Her quirky character reminded me of a friend's mom and she was super endearing!If you're a fan of this genre, if you've read RWRB, or even if you aren't or haven't... this is a MUST ADD to your list."
"Then this book is totally for you! This was such a cute, sexy weekend read! Americans might struggle a bit with the british pop culture references but the story and romance didn't get lost in translation."
"Alexis Hall writes Boyfriend Material in such a way that you truly don't want to put it down. Oliver and Luc's story is just so sweet and hilarious and utterly addictive, I loved it!"
"I loved it! Alexis Hall has a way with words and banter and irony that just work, no matter the genre they write in, and this book is no exception! A wonderful adventure where I could just relate so much to everyone, it was a delight."
"Fabulous book! Devoured it in a little over 24 hours, couldn’t put it down. Great writing, kept me entertained. A lot like “Red, White, and Royal Blue” in tone, which I also loved, but the story wasn’t quite as long or complicated. Just lovely. 5 stars!"
"I really enjoyed this book, the characters are witty and likeable. It was funny, low angst, unique take on the fakers to lovers and opposites attract tropes."
Couldn’t put it down!  It grabbed me from the start and never let go. To steal a line from its blurb: “Practically Perfect in Every Way.”
"This book was delightfully charming in a self depreciating way. Luc 's inner monologue was hilarious, and allowed the reader to identify with him. I fell in love with Oliver much as Luc did."
Found myself laughing out loud all the way through reading this. Such great characters and set up. I want more!
"I'm half way through the book and quite often laugh out loud. Hilarious. So far, a really fun read. Sorry it's fiction. Would like to have dinner with Luc and Oliver. Can't wait to find out how the plot is resolved."
Boyfriend Material has been one of my favorite reads this year! I normally shy away from one POV but Luc is SO funny and real that I was captivated right from the start. Classic Rom-Com gold that you won’t be able to put down!
"I loved this book!  The exclamation point was because I'm surprised by that.  Although I am gay, they deactivated my card years ago because of non-use.  I normally read spy thrillers and mysteries, and classics when I'm feeling guilty about my preference for airport fiction.  I stayed up until 1:30am in order to read this in a single sitting.I was more than pleasantly surprised by how well-written this book is.  The character development is superb, and most of them manage to be amusing as well as slightly poignant.  The plot (and yes, there is quite a good one) is witty, fast-paced and romantic without being the least bit cheesy.  I am not an immediate convert to the genre, but I am going to read more of Mr Hall's books to be certain this one isn't a fluke.  I doubt that somehow.I lived in London for many years and appreciate this sense of humor.  It is much more subtle than, say, Joe Keenan is.  While I was reading, I kept mentally seeing the film that needs to be made of this book.  It's more Notting Hill than Love Actually.  Elton John needs to play Jon Fleming."
"Boyfriend Material is a sassy, vivacious, delightful tale featuring the affable, fun-loving Luc and the intense, thoughtful Oliver as they discover that there may be more to their relationship than just convenience, pretend feelings, and fake dating.The writing is humorous and sharp. The characters are charismatic, dependable, and engaging. And the plot is an irresistible blend of tension, humour, sexual innuendoes, sizzling chemistry, flirty banter, familial drama, friendship, awkward mishaps, tender moments, introspection, and tricky situations.Overall, Boyfriend Material is an amusing, cheeky, brilliant tale by Hall that had everything I look for in a lighthearted rom-com and more. I loved the characters, I loved the storyline, and I loved the happy-ever-after ending. It is without a doubt one of my favourite reads of the year and is definitely the must-read novel for summer 2020. Red, White, and Royal Blue was the must-read novel of 2019 and dare I say it, I think I liked this one even more!"
"Just when I'd thought the fake dating trope had been beaten to death, here comes Alexis Hall to breathe a fresh and charming breath of life into it.It's amazing how not being afraid to really go into the emotions of a character can have such a positive effect on making the development of characters and the plot flow in such an organic way.Luc O'Donnell is, at first, not a very likable guy. Then you get to know more about him and the sad situation he finds himself in and you just have to root for him to have a happy ending. Oliver Blackwood seems to be the ideal stiff-upper-lip, middle-class English lawyer of everyone dreams-- and he mostly is, but one thing that Hall excels at is depth and Oliver is one of the best-developed romance heroes I've read in a while. The time they're together results in some of the loveliest, most charming scenes I've read in ages.Add in a host of unique characters and some very British snark and sarcasm and you have all the ingredients one needs to make romance magic.Many thanks to NetGalley and Sourcebooks Casablanca for granting my wish to read it early."
"Sometimes you love a book so much that not only are 5 stars not enough, but I can’t really even form sentences about it. So I’m sorry in advance for this mess.... ⁣⁣When messy charity worker Luc needs an image overhaul for work purposes, he turns to a fake relationship with the prim and proper barrister Oliver for help. Fake relationships and opposites attract are two of my fave tropes and this was absolute perfection! I immediately got a Bridget Jones vibe, which is a high compliment from me. There is a hilarious cast of quirky supporting characters - Luc’s mom and all of their friends were hilarious. I laughed sooooo hard at parts of this book ( particularly the “Richard” pic texts). Then I swooned equally hard at others. Luc and Oliver’s awkwardness made the romance so relatable - talking about your feelings and letting people see you at your worst is hard. But man was I rooting for these two!!! Please just read it! You won’t be sorry! ⁣⁣AND - I absolutely can not recommend the audiobook enough. The narrator of this one is CRAZY talented!!! I would listen to him read me the instructions for an IKEA shelf. His range of voices for each character had me questioning if there were more than one... it made the story that much better for me!!⁣Thank you to @librofm and @dreamscapemedia for the #gifted audiobook of this one!! All opinions are my own."
"You know how some people say something’s a romcom but when you go read it, it’s… just not funny? And it takes itself much too seriously? And then you sit there wondering if, five months into this pandemic, you’re just a soulless husk of a person now? OK, well, this book is not that. This is the laugh-out-loud, can’t put down, still-deals-with-serious-issues-but-god-so-well all-the-feels real deal. Plus, it’s got my favorite trope – fake relationship – and that makes this an absolutely stellar read.“Oh hello, rock bottom. Nice to see you again. Do you want to be my boyfriend?”As the son of two famous rock stars, Luc’s had a rough time with the associated fame. When a chance paparazzi photo goes viral for all the wrong reasons, his boss gives him an ultimatum – shape up his image for their squeamish donors or he’s fired. But how’s he going to find someone that perfect who’s still going to be willing to date him? Enter Oliver, straight-laced barrister and snazzy dresser. Luc and Oliver will pretend to date, and Luc will get the “good gay” press coverage he needs as well as a straight-acceptable date for his work fundraiser, while Oliver will have a date for his parents’ wedding anniversary party. Sure even two such very different people can pretend to get along for that long?“I increasingly think some people are meant to be lonely. I’m lonely because I’m a wreck and nobody wants me. He’s lonely because he’s awful and nobody wants him.”“See. You do have something in common.”Alexis Hall has the ability to write a character who is, by his own admission, an absolute prick at the start of the book but also completely sympathetic. Luc’s the type of guy to lie about speaking French to his date, then when his date (predictably) starts trying to talk to him in it, spouts out the only phrase he knows – “where’s the bathroom?” – and then feels obligated to go to said bathroom after Oliver answers. Basically, Luc’s a hot mess, and things become even more complicated when his estranged father reaches out to him. On the other hand, Oliver’s… boring. Boring and a bit judgmental and uptight. He doesn’t actually see himself as judgmental – despite such doozies as “you shouldn’t eat meat because of the environment” and “you shouldn’t use Uber because of workers’ rights” – until Luc points it out, but at heart he’s quite the sweet person. Luc also envies his apparently perfectly normal childhood with his perfectly normal set of parents.“He was gazing at me, with this terrible earnestness, meaning every word. And, y’know, it was fine, I could cope with this, I could have feelings, it was fine. Never mind that there was this sense of nakedness settling over me, strangely independent of the fact that I was actually naked. And never mind that every time he touched me it was like he was unmaking me with tenderness. And definitely never mind that I needed this so badly I wasn’t sure how to have it.”The story is told solely from Luc’s first person POV, so the reader has a front row seat to not only all of Luc’s mess-ups with Oliver but also the confusing attraction he feels for him, not to mention having to deal with the fact that the most functional relationship Luc’s ever had is with this fake boyfriend. The way Luc slowly accepts that he’s worthy of having that kind of relationship – that Oliver’s worthy of that kind of relationship – is just heartwrenchingly sweet. So was watching them learn to lean on and support each other. There’s a particular moment near the end of the book – the moment that leads directly into the dark moment – where I was literally crying with how proud I was of Luc for standing up for Oliver, and by extension, himself. Their relationship is an all-the-feels rollercoaster and it is delightful.Of course, all those feels are perfectly balanced by the humor. There were several points where I literally laughed out loud, sometimes directly after tearing up due to the already mentioned feels. The secondary characters are absolutely hilarious and well done. There’s the posh aristocrat Luc works with who, for example, confuses jury trials with badgers (“terrible for dairy farmers”) or the fact that two of Luc’s friends were named James Royce who, after their marriage, are now referred to as the James Royce-Royces. Luc’s mom is an absolute treasure, doling out the perfect amount of support and advice with a hilarious twist. Even Luc’s estranged father, who could easily have been written as a cardboard villain, is nuanced and flawed in very specific ways that help highlight Luc’s own messiness.Overall, easily 4.5 stars and most likely the funniest book I will read this year. Alexis Hall is an absolute master of the rom-com and I am very much looking forward to whatever he writes next. Highly recommended!I received an advance review copy of this book from NetGalley. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review."
"Can't remember the last time when I wanted something this bad like this book. And if you want something, then you have expectations. And this book was way more then enough to satisfy my expectations.First, the cover. It's effing perfect. It's enough for me to one-click it. It's written by Alexis Hall? Hell to the yes, give it to me and I won't hurt anyone. 😉The book was long but not long enough - I mean, come on, I could read Luc&Oliver forever and I wouldn't be bored at all. There is something in Alexis Hall's writing style that hooks you to the story and won't let go. The characters, the background, the side characters/ friends/ parents, everything is real. Make you believe that you can totally meet them on the street, you can hug them and you can be friends with them. Their life is like yours - minus the rockstar parents.I fell in love with Oliver and Luc too, both were adorable, loveable and really good characters. Loved the way how Oliver called Luc Lucien, it was swoon worthy. So sweet.Loved how they fell slowly for each other but were really blind for the other's feelings. The fake boyfriend trope is really good, I love reading this kind of stories, and Oliver&Lucien were really, really a good couple.And Alex was hilarious, I liked him and the jokes between him and Luc.The romance was perfect. I was hot for them. This is the perfect romance book ever. I just want to throw this book in few author's face' to read it and learn from it, because this is the way how you write romance without erotica while the reader is totally hot and bothered. When the kiss scene or just a simply touch can make you sweat - it's just PERFECT! You don't have to write full on sex scenes with all the details - Alexis Hall can make your heart beat faster with the simple of touches between the main characters. And this is right here what makes this book beautiful and perfect.Oliver&Lucien were perfectly imperfect, and I loved how they relationship worked. Their first kiss, their first date, their first sex (OMG that was so GOOD! How Oliver lost his politeness and got HOT. That scene was everything. E.V.E.R.Y.T.H.I.N.G.)I can't tell you how very much I loved this book. I need it on my shelf in paperback. And I need a real life Oliver to be friends with because he is so cute, I just want to hug him.HIGHLY recommend this to everyone who needs romance. Perfect romance.I just want to be able to forget this book and read it for the first time again. And again. And again. Oliver&Lucien are everything♥"
"Boyfriend Material was the M/M rom-com novel that I needed right now. With COVID-19 and a dismal economy, this book really put me in great spirits. Alexis Hall is going to be my new M/M romance novelist, I just know it. Thanks for being there for me when I needed this book the most.Luc O'Donnell, son of a rocker and tabloid star and a French songwriter, is constantly in the press for his antics ever since his ex boyfriend leaked a story about him for a payout. Vulnerable and depressed, Luc continues to stumble (quite literally) into these public scandals and is more known as a gossip magazine topic than as a fundraiser for a local charity.After one of his nights out, Luc is put in the press again and this time it's affecting his job. Luc's boss wants him to clean up his act and find a nice, reputable boyfriend to put donors at ease. Luc and his friends decide that they need to find the perfect candidate. And that candidate is Oliver Blackwood—a rigid and uptight, but muscular and sexy, barrister who is the complete opposite of Luc. The plan seems simple, but just one catch—feelings aren't supposed to get involved.Boyfriend Material is the perfect gay romance novel to get you out of your slump or bad mood, I promise. It's funny, kind of steamy (not explicitly so, so you're ok Karen!), and very relatable. I related to the dynamics between Luc and Oliver a lot and I think whether you're queer or not, you will as well. I loved the nods to pop culture references and true to form romance and not the stereotypical BS that we've come to see in a lot of M/M romance novels. I am unsure if you should consider this as a YA novel, because it's very graphic in terms of language and I would legit cringe seeing a younger family member of mine reading this, but at the same time you won't be clutching your pearls gasping. If you want a gay Christina Lauren rom-com, Boyfriend Material is your best bet! Alexis Hall, thanks for keeping me up until 2:30 AM to finish this wickedly funny and cute book."
"I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.I have had a mixed experience of Alexis Hall’s work. Some of it has become desert island reads, and some I haven’t made it past the first chapter. There is one I managed to finish, but hated one of the main characters, and hence hated the romance, as no one should end up with such an awful guy. Also, I freakin’ hate the freakin’ fake boyfriend trope. I was only interested in reading this book due to the author.Having actually read the book I am not sure how this one will play out for me. Will it become a book I remember positively, or a beloved desert island read?I should also note that I apply a higher standard to Hall than most other writers, because he is just that good.First point: both guys are nice.There is a similar pattern to the billionaire books - the flibbertigibbet and the staid “successful” guy - and the flow-on from that. That is all I am saying - no spoilers here.Second point:  Alex and co. Honestly, it is worth reading the book for all the side characters. Alex (and Miffy) had me repeatedly howling and crying with laughter. I’ll probably be rereading the book just for them - also the MC’s mum. I was interested to learn other French people refer to gay people as “a gay” too.Third point; Hall is a very skilled fluid writer. He’s the real thing, with a long term commitment to romance. His writing, in whatever genre, is always superior, and usually hilarious. He’s big on social comedy. I adore good social comedy.Points that pulled me a bit out of the story (normally, having enjoyed the book so much I would be gushing incoherently):First point: I am passionate about dung beetles, so the ha ha ha stuff about dung beetles was a bit annoying.Second point: I used to work in appellate jurisdictions so the stuff about criminal barristers jarred me a bit. They aren’t highly regarded because they tend to be on-the-fly workers (they have to be - it’s the nature of the way the criminal justice system works) who have to rely on clever quick often dodgy quick-stepping. Also the pay isn’t great unless you are defending organised crime. The other reason it’s not highly regarded is because it is often where people start out at the bar.Third point: the Greek chorus of annoying friends including the pushy best friend. Wtf is it with m/m romance where the MC has to have a pushy female best friend, who pushes the MC against his will into doing “what’s best for him”? Writers, please find another way to progress the plot. I am so over this one.Fourth point: why don’t the characters use airplanes? Or trains? The book was written before the global pandemic. There’s all this stuff about having to drive 4 hours here, and five hours there, (and back). What’s with that? Is that a UK thing?Fifth point: the story is very strongly located in London. Place plays a big role in Hall’s stories. Because I was a bit pulled out of this story, I noticed more all the local references which I didn’t understand. Living in Australia, I am used to reading books set in places I have never been to. I’m not really complaining, just noting. If you are English, I’m sure this book will have a whole layer of enjoyment absent to the rest of us. It’s probably analagous to a marvel movie - great fun if you know nothing about the MCU, but if you do, there are infinite layers of enjoyment available.All in all, this is good quality Alexis Hall fare. It is good quality romance written by someone happily soaked in the genre. If you or a friend are new to m/m romance, this is a good place to start, or to continue with. There is a strong likelihood that this book will end up on your keeper shelf.There is also a heightened likelihood of glomming everything else Hall has ever written."
"I received a free copy through NetGalley in exchange for an honest and unbiased review/opinion.4.5 stars — This one reminded me a LOT of Bridget Jones’s Diary in tone and snappy dialogue…I mean, the movies at least, it’s been so long since I read the book, I don’t remember what the writing was like.  I was actually a little…put off? (or lost I think) by the fast pace of the external and internal dialogue, and all the UKisms.  But as I continued to read, I got back into that groove and really enjoyed myself.  I guess I just hadn’t been expecting it.I was also worried by the sheer level of snark and dryness and total lack of self-esteem that was Luc.  It could be offputting at times how much he put himself down.  But honestly?  In the end I did connect with him in spite of that, and I guess I just figured out who Luc was, and loved him in spite of his deflections and fear of feelings.  I think it made it really satisfying to see the places where he did end up growing, and I LOVED that he really truly did grow — perhaps because of Oliver, but he didn’t chuck it all when they hit the conflict.  That was kind of awesome.Honestly, I feel odd saying this, but there were so many things that had me wary when I first started reading this book.  I think I went into it fairly blind, no expectations, and I had to get used to a different set of characters than I was used to.  I really truly am bummed that this wasn’t dual POV, because I really wanted inside Oliver’s head.  It didn’t detract from the story necessarily, it still felt full…I’m just greedy.  I had an initial hard time figuring Oliver out…but I think I got him as Luc was getting him.  And he was really endearing in so many ways.  But I also appreciated that he was messed up in his own ways, that may have seemed quite different from Luc’s hangups, but in the end came down to the same thing.  Basically, the conflict and resolution ended up being strangely satisfying for me.And the two of them together put me through so much.  I laughed so much at their witty banter, I ached with them as I saw them both feeling the feels, and I hurt for what they were going through individually as well as together.  I thought their chemistry was pretty solid, though was a bit bummed at the mostly fade to black (again, greedy).And wow, were there ever a lot of seriously colourful secondary characters in this one.  So many of them felt completely unbelievable and caricatures, and AGAIN, that threw me off initially…but then I just kind of rolled with it, and they added their little tidbits, and it was fun and zany, and…it just worked for me.  Of course there were also some douchebags, but when aren’t there?  And they were seriously douchey.So yeah.  This book was a strange rollercoaster ride for me.  Maybe it’s just a solid 4 stars…I can’t tell.  I think I’m just impressed with how it burrowed under my skin and made me accept all sorts of weird things that put me off initially.  So take from that what you will."
"Title: Boyfriend MaterialAuthor: Alexis HallAge Group: AdultGenre: RomanceSeries: StandaloneStar Rating: 5 out of 5 Stars I borrowed this book from my local library and reviewed it. I asked my reading Discord server buddies to help me pick my next book, after Aurora Burning (which, just for the record, I’m still totally wrecked from! Jay and Amie, y’all are sadists! Lol.) And on that note, they all suggested Boyfriend Material by Alexis Hall. And it turns out that this book was the perfect book to cure all the FEELS that AB left me with. This book was hilarious, romantic, witty and sexy; it really gave me Red, White and Royal Blue vibes, and I loved it. I had to force myself to slow down to make it last longer! I loved it; it made me laugh, cry, scream, and swoon. This was such a perfect, lovely story, and I’m such a complete sucker for the classic fake dating trope! Easily one of my favorite books of 2021! I will definitely be on the lookout for Alexis Hall’s work! Luc O’Donnell is reluctantly famous, the child of two rich and famous rock star parents. Forever trying to avoid the limelight that both parents bring on him, skittish after being burned by a vindictive ex, he half-jokingly asks his friends to hook him up with one of their gay friends. He’s set up on a blind date with barrister Oliver, hunky, sardonic, and more than a little unusual. Desperately needing a date and a distraction, Luc and Oliver made a deal that they pretend to date, up to the duration of Oliver’s cousin’s wedding. But things become messy and complicated when Luc finds himself falling for Oliver. When he finds out that his father has cancer, Luc’s life takes a turn for the worse. Luc must decide what it is he wants from his life. Be boxed in by his parents’ reputations, or live freely, as he truly wishes to? I loved, loved, loved this book! I was a complete wreck after the thrilling scifi adventure that was Aurora Burning, and this was the perfect antidote to all the FEELS I was stuck with. I loved Luc’s voice, insecure, shy, and self-deprecating. His humor throughout the novel constantly had me cracking up! I was laughing, crying, screaming, swooning; I was nearly crying with laughter as the novel went on. This book was a quick one; I devoured it in less than two days. This book was so good; witty, snappy, beautifully paced, sexy and romantic. This book would be perfect for readers still missing Red, White and Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston! I loved every character in this book, except Luc’s father. I was laughing, crying, screaming, and swooning throughout it. This book was funny, smart, witty, and sexy, and I loved every crazy, sweet moment of it! This is a love story that I will certainly never leave me! The bottom line: Unique, funny, tender and most of all, hopeful, I loved Boyfriend Material! Next on deck: Yolk by Mary H.K. Choi!"
"This is much more than a cooking book, it’s a declaration of love for french gastronomy.I would like to have had this book during my cooking training at Le Cordon Bleu, years ago."
"Wow! This is an encyclopedia of French food. The book is the size of the Sunday NY Times, almost. I opened the box with it today and haven’t put it down. Everything, it seems, is explained in this book. The pictures, diagrams, and layout are beautiful. This book will become a food lover’s favorite for fun and for actual French food information."
"This is an amazing encyclopedia of French gastronomy for the foodie, Francophile, or just plain old knowledge geek. It's definitely a book to dip into from time to time instead of a straight through read. Size and weight make unwieldy for reading in bed or frankly anywhere but a table. In a pinch it could be used as a weapon. Contains classic recipes but isn't primarily a cookbook. Buy it and enjoy."
"A really wonderful book - full of information about French regional food, great recipes, interestig articles on French chefs, restaurants, and useful tips.  I rated it so highly it that I bought 7 copies on Amacon UK for my UK friends, 1 French edition for French friends and another copy on Amazon com for American friends, and recommend it to all those with an interest in France and French food.  An absolute joy."
"I own well over 100 French cookbooks from every region of France and her overseas territories. I didn't think I needed another one. Yet, when I came across ""Let's Eat France"", I was mesmerized and ordered it on the spot. It reflects a depth of knowledge and a degree of erudition about French food that puts it into a category of its own. I didn't really buy it for its recipes, most of which I already have, but for the background it offers about dishes and ingredients and, more generally, about French food culture. I also fell in for the artful way in which the information is presented. It's not a long-winded text but a refreshing assemblage of creative graphics and pictures that turns each page into its own mini-voyage of discovery. This is a book that one can open at any page and get immediately captivated by the contents. There is literally something to be learned from each page, even for those well-versed into French gastronomy. It's quite a unique contribution to its subject that I highly praise and recommend."
"Easily the most graphically impressive tome I have ever seen, if you like charts, pictures, tips, illustrations, short cut ideas, short histories, summaries, you will adore this. The author is a genius. 25 stars! The perfect GIFT for a foody!"
"This is packed with information and pictures. As a chef, it’s fun for me to use this as a way to educate my staff. The recipes are lovely little additions and moderately accessible for a “foodie” home cook. I would classify this as an entry French cuisine class in a book that’s both enjoyable and attainable. The recipes are mostly very good versions of classic French cuisine sprinkled with some modern pastry recipes. Merci beaucoup to the author and illustrator!"
"I love this book! It is big and heavy (probably the largest book I have in my home) and it is full with all kind of food and drinks information, charts, pictures, descriptions, curiosities -- all that would be very hard to find otherwise and have them all in one place. If you want to learn about french food, origins, variety than this book is for you. If you are just looking for a french recipe you might want to get a more ""traditional"" cook book. I can't wait to dive into all the info, learn more about french food and culture and try some of the featured recipes ."
"This is a huge, coffee table book that is actually fun to read.  It's the kind of book that is fun to get lost in, you can open it anywhere and learn something knew.  There are indexes in the back to look up specifics.  The book contains several maps of France with local food products (everything from wine to cheese to breads, etc.)  There are profiles of French Chefs and their recipes.  From food history to classic recipes, this book contains a bit of everything to do with French cuisine."
"Big book, lots of tidbit information but few recipes. Once I go through the book read some of the albeit interesting info but not what I need I won’t use the book afterwards. I don’t hate the book but not what I was looking for at all. Good coffee table book for interesting conversation and guests to thumb through but I wanted recipes. I don’t have the coffee table or guests to use the book for entertainment. I don’t regret the purchase but I would of rather my money went to a cookbook not a amusement piece."
Very unique cook/ history book on French cooking & foods. I get this cook book for gifts!! Nice recipes too.
Great price and wonderful gift for the Francophile in your life! Would make a fun coffee table book!
This book feels like a joy ride with no specific map for guidance.  From page to page you are almost overwhelmed for fun facts on history and culture.  We are on our way to Paris and I'm glad to have this book in our collection.
Fascinating & packed with info but zero organization. It’s ADHD in book form.
"Recipes, explanations and history meld well in this cookbook.  Delicious thus far!"
"This book is a DELIGHT....every single page is fun, instructive, entertaining, and interesting !!!  For any foodie or lover of France !!!!!!  BUY IT, GIVE IT, LOVE IT"
This book is huge and heavy so I won't be holding it in one hand anytime soon. It is also very complete and well-done! Worth every penny. Illustrations and historical details are fun. Thanks for creating this masterpiece.
"and informational material.  Tons of little stories about food that make you better understand the food, the culture, and the history of certain dishes.  I gave a few copies for the Holidays and got great reviews throughout."
"Amazing book, I could look at it for hours! So much great information. It’s big, definitely the size of a coffee table book. It also doesn’t seem to be organized in any particular way (sections/chapters) so it might be hard to find specific things"
Beautiful book and easy to understand
Great Book! Lot of stories and traditionalismes recipies .Very good giftBut there s a poster included in the french original Book  but not in this english one ! I m wonderi if it s normal ?
Took a while to read....amazing French detail

"Fantastic in depth book, with great illustration and design. Exceeded my expectations of it! Excellent book"
"It’s goid but big book, not tried any of the recipes but ratatouille recipes (few versions) look good."
Phenomenal book wirh numerous chapters on various aspects of French Food at its best.
"For anyone who loves history, food and France! Beautiful book."
Huge reference book with loads of information and interesting history. Laid out in a very easy to read manner
Great Present
Interesting book full of little snippets.
"For me, usually when I am on a lunch break at work, if I can get thru 50-100 pages in those 30 mins, then I am enthralled. With this book, even with the re-read, I was cruising at 20-30 pages.To be honest I was pretty much masking my true feelings on this book. If you love nothing but various characters talking it out everywhere....then get this book. If you want an overall story arc or something epic to happen...look elsewhere.Most times I can overlook heavy handed politics if the characters and setting are awesome. If you want to get your LBGT kick but with an interesting story, go with the Nightrunner series by Lynn Flewelling. I have more appreciation for writers who can weave a great story in spite of their political leanings.If you want some awesome world building sci fi, Go with Evan Currie or Christopher Nuttall. The Expanse series by Corey is great too.As for interesting sci fi in the vein some people are looking for:Its kinda hard to find books that don't have the ID politics just running amok over everything....hmmm....Give Dark Horizons by Rae D. Magdon a whirl or Nova The Dark Reach Wars Vol I by Lora E. Rasmussen a try. Those two books, while somewhat inspired by Mass Effect and the like, prioritize story over politics."
"I purchased this book and the second one on a whim and it started out really good! The characters are all fascinating and well-done, which is what I generally look for in my stories. However (and I may be the only one bothered by this) the constant use of heavy swearing was really jolting for me. I don't particularly care for cursing in general, but it was pretty bad in these books (I'm talking f-bombs every few sentences)... I stopped reading the second book half-way because it was bothering me a lot. Again, maybe just me... but to be fair, a story that's supposed to take place in the far-future shouldn't even be using the same swears that we use today anyway. It doesn't make sense. Anyway, sorry about the rant... great characters, interesting story, but if that sort of thing irritates you, then don't bother."
"Appalling. The author figured out they could just write ""Wokeness in space."" and the plaudits would come rolling in.Expect to get hit in the face with future versions of race privilege, transgenderism, anti-capitalism, Queer theory, gender dysphoria, and more, all within the first 50 pages.Perhaps the most appalling is the clear connection between the concept that different species represent different races, implying for today's world that the color of people's skin makes them as different as various animal species (not an uncommon implication in Woke theology.) This smacks of race essentialism, and should be rejected for the clearly unethical, racist overtones it exudes.Do not read. This isn't a book for science fictions fans, it's a bland template for integrating Woke gender-hate and neo-racism into science-fiction."
"This is one of the best debut novels I've read in quite some time. Like all the best space opera, the Wayfarers' books introduce us to a rag-tag crew of n'er-do-well's and misfits who would fit in right alongside the crew of the Firefly, the Nostromo, the Keiko or any other crew you can name scratching out a living on the edge of the black. ""Long Way..."" is a fun book; a story told with love and care by someone who obviously loves the genre and the characters they've created. In fact, if anything takes away any of the joy I have for this first book, it's the fact that the second and third book in the series, while enjoyable, leave the crew aspect of the stories behind for tales that center around only one or two characters. Still, Becky Chambers is someone to watch and The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet is a great place to start. I recommend it wholeheartedly."
"Could not get past 17 percent of book. Story seamed to be about touching all the Woke bases. Uses renewable energy without explaing how algae could possibly power a space ship and create wormholes in space. Every one is a different shade of brown except one white man. And supprise, he is angry and a racist. He does not like the the reptilian grew member who of couse is one of the nicest characters on the ship. No action."
"A fun, light read. Most of the characters are good (the exception being Kizzy, who I just can't believe as a real person) and it moves at a good pace. It probably won't stick with you in any meaningful way, but it's entertaining.I only have a couple of real criticisms: One is the sci-fi language (eg. tenday instead of week) which is a bit grating, and the fact that the plot supposedly takes place over the course of an entire year, but doesn't feel anything like that long. If they hadn't made explicit reference to the time the trip took I'd have guessed a few weeks. It makes sense that there are long periods of not much happening, but you don't get any sense of those breaks, one adventure just flows straight into the next."
"It took me a long time get into this book.  It is way too slow in the first half.  Nothing seems to happen for about ever, and then finally some plot as you finish up.  I enjoyed it finally, but was bored much of the time along the way.  Ms. Chambers is not CJ Cherryh and does not have the ability to get into the alien mind the way that Cherryh does.  The alien characters read pretty much as humans in other skins.  I could have three or less-starred it, but in the end felt it was enjoyable enough say...go ahead, hopefully she'll pick  up the pace, follow some of the plot points in a more interesting direction--interspecies sexuality for example--and bring the characters to a more fully fleshed-out realization.OK effort.  Author needs growth."
"I adore this book and bought a copy after reading a library copy. Excellent world building, humor, creative sexiness, and characters you’ll wish you could hang out with.Unfortunately, the copy I got was missing 32 pages. I reported it to Amazon and tweeted about it to HarperVoyager. Alas, the replacement copy is also missing these pages.[Update: I was able to get in touch with the publisher. They sent me a complete replacement copy and promised to check out the problem.]I highly recommend buying this book once this problem is fixed or in Kindle format. [Update: the partial copes should have been replaced.]  The next two books in the series are terrific too. Can’t wait until this is resolved so I can read book 4! [Book 4 may have been the best one yet! Read the series!]"
"This book was unexpectedly fabulous, especially from a relative newcomer author. Chambers has created a fully fleshed out galaxy populated by tons of alien races, some that are relatable, some truly alien and foreign. Chambers has obviously thought out the ramifications of each species' differences in biology and evolution, and how it makes them similar or different from humanity. But rather than beat the readers over the head with an encyclopedic listing of all these species and their traits, she reveals them throughout the book as the story progresses, so that we learn about not only the characters but their species as well.Which leads me to the best part of the novel - the world building is wonderful, but where Chambers' work really shines is the story and the amazing characters who fairly jump off the pages. The story focuses on the main crew of the Wayfarer, which is a mixed species bag of human and alien. I loved every character in the crew (even grumpy Corbin), but my favorite is probably Kizzy, a tech who is equal parts brilliant, scatter-brained, and endearing, and swears like a sailor (read: hilarious). But even the minor characters we encounter throughout the story have a depth and relatability (ok I made that word up) that I rarely encounter.Overall A+ read that I thoroughly enjoyed and probably rushed too quickly through. If ever any book cried out for more, it's this one. Can't wait to read more!"
"Ashby Santoso is the owner and captain of a space-boring ship, he's the contractor folks call when they need a wormhole drilled.  Ashby is a human, a minor race recently admitted to the Galactic Commons (GC) community. His crew is a melange of species that make up the GC. Their latest, very lucrative contract: a long normal-space haul to the distant Toremi territory to bore a wormhole back. But not all the Toremi are in favor of this new alliance and space, particularly out in the sticks, can sometimes be deadly.  Angry Planet is not about galactic politics or war, but is a character-driven story about an ordinary, likable crew doing an ordinary, yet kind of thrilling spacer job. The depictions of different species, their viewpoints, and how they manage to get along and function together is very well drawn; Chambers is an excellent writer, delightful to read. The story is quite human-centric, and so we get a skewed view of this Galactic Commons, in which the human species is but a minor player, but this is a small quibble.  Thoroughly  enjoyable and highly recommended!-Mary Whealen"
"A sci-fi that’s more about the characters than the science or the action. Made me think about how things are changing in our world. Some people these days might seem “alien” to us, mostly because they are just simply living differently than us. Good book. I will be reading the rest of Wayfarers adventures."
"Okay, this book almost lost me. I went in thinking it was going to be basically about Rosemary, and the first couple chapters do enforce this idea--and then it's...well, it's a lot of characters, all and none of them the main character. Though confusing at first, it really is quite wewll handled, and you do wind up loving easy and every one of these quirky characters. But--well, the first 40% of the book...drags. I won't sugar coat it. It's the price paid to have a great deal of characters sharing the limelight and being loveable. It's understandable, and every character really is interesting, but it's a lot of character development with very little plot. Even as you enjoy it, you sortr of drag your feet through slowly reading it all.And then you hit about forty percent and the book goes from a crawl to a sprint. It's a completely different game and it's wonderful. These characters you've just stubbornly sat through learning come to life--and they aren't some heroic adventure crew, aren't a bunch of dashing and daring people out to save the world! They're ""just"" the space equivalent of road construction. And it's wonderful.The characters are brilliant, the species are widely varied and fascinating, they plot and setting are all incredibly well thought out, and I'm looking forward to reading this again--and then a few more times for good measure. An A+ debut, and a must read for anyone who loves high scifi--especially those of a more queer persuasion, like myself and (to my immense fight) the author. But it's not about gays and gayness and such. That's the best part. It's just there. Real and wonderful."
"Not quite technical enough for me. All the engineered emotions and happy outcomes I can endure. They don’t spoil the plot, which I like. Another three books, so I’ll hang in there."
"You couldn't ask for more satisfying nerd comfort food than Becky Chambers' space adventure. The optimism of Star Trek, the chaotic, lived-in feel of early (and late) Star Wars, and the warmth and wit of Firefly are all here, in a more richly detailed fictional galaxy than I think I've ever encountered. So much thought and care went into the myriad of alien biology, culture, social mores, not to mention how humanity has changed in the far future. She draws you into it all without overloading you with made-up terminology, or making you wade through one info dump after another before you get to the action. The pace of the story, which is essentially a series of vignettes, each focusing on a different relationship between characters, let you get to know the book's ensemble and the world they live in gradually. Bonus points for not touching the usual chosen-one we-have-to-save-the-entire-universe clichés, and keeping the stakes personal and down to Earth (so to speak)."
"... Expectations which were fairly high, and totally wrong. This is a fine story, well written with lots of surprises and few if any stereotypes. For some reason though I thought it was going to be a comedy. My mistake, but the reality proved to be even better than what I expected. Time to check into the sequel!"
"So far I am enjoying this book,I am about half way through. It's kind of adorable. Yes, it's quite Whedonesque, as many have noticed, but what her writing reminds me of even more, is Robert Heinlein . There's something quite Heinlein like about its straightforward story telling style and humor. I find it kind of refreshing after my usual diet of modern Sci Fi.  It's a refreshing after Planetfall( which I just finished) , which was heart rending. I am enjoying this amusing book."
"Chambers debut novel, The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet, is an imaginative and enjoyable tale well told.It is a character driven story and Chambers has created quite a cast of characters. Most are exotic, yet each one is interesting and authentic.  All are believable, growing and changing as the story progresses.The plot is not as thin as some critics argue. It’s just that the characters are so compelling that they overshadow the plot. I highly recommend The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet."
"pros: decent writing, nontraditional relationships, good world building.cons: the manic pixie dreamgirl thing is tiresome. and will someone please tell the editors the difference between ""some time"" and ""sometime"" because they kept using the latter when it should have been the former and it took me out of the story every time.I may someday pick up the next one, but I am not rushing out to buy it right now. this book is a good palate cleanser between better books."
"Of the three aspects of a novel: plot, characters, and setting, Chambers excels at characters and settings. The plot is not compelling. The focus is on the relationships between humans and a variety of aliens, including sexual relationships. To be sure, the relationships are very well done, but they did not grab me. Don't expect any science."
"This read like the book I've been looking for: a varied cart of characters, half alien, developed personalities - aliens included, an adventure, action, just enough science without going overboard on geekiness, no overly convoluted political or religious or ethical philosophies/diatribes. We are dropped happily into the story and take along for the ride. It reminded me of the Firefly family. I can't wait for another episode, even though this book doesn't seem to be a set up for the popular trilogy.  As Oliver Twist said, please, can I have another?"
"A cute story and adventure. Not a huge swashbuckling story full of conflict, but a solid personal journey along with her crew to a ""small angry planet"" LOL. I don't want to give away the story. I'd definitely recommend this book. (However, the 2nd book in the series is very very slow.)"
"Loved everything about this book: a great story, excelent setting and fantastic characters. Will definetly look for more on the series."
"On the surface, this book would be easy to compare to the television show Firefly, for its setting (a lonely ship), the crew (a family of quirky independents), and it's pacing (a series of adventures).  But that comparison would be too superficial. This book is written in the best tradition of great science fiction. The setting presents a microcosm in which deep questions about our humanity and our relationship to others can examined and explored. A wonderful read in the tradition of Asimov."
It's not often you get to read feel-good sci-fi. This is a human story--a story of humans who happen to live in space now that are STILL going through totally human things. Totally enjoyable.
"The writer did an excellent job of creating her own universe, and filling it with real characters that can be related to. This is a great story, and if you appreciate the gritty real world where not all is polished smooth it is perfect. The editors did a great job, or the writer is a perfectionist. Either way the writing is easy on the eyes, even if the added pronouns give one a bit of a pause."
"I finished the book recently and I have mixed emotions regarding it. When I first started reading it I recommended it to plenty of people. Though the writing is rudimentary, the characters were likeable and there was a cozy, road-trip style story to it. However, many of the cool characters you meet in the beginning grow stale, and the new ones don't last very long. The entire book builds up to the weak ending, and the characters, once the climax ends, immediately lose their allure.A prime example of this phenomena is the relationship between Rosemary and Sissix. Once a primary point in the book, the ending does nothing to resolve it. In fact, it really seems like Sissix is forgotten about as the book ends.I really wanted to like this book though.Edit: I am currently making my way through Niven's 'Ringworld' which is making me realize how weak 'The Long Way...'  really is. Don't get me wrong, its not deplorable, but the real highlight of Chambers' book is the banter between the leads. What I see as positives in this book may not interest others, so be weary. Dropped my rating from 3 to 2."
"The aliens are almost all friendly, the Galaxy is as convenient as a subway map, and the technology is mostly ""don't you worry about that"". But the characters are all immediately loveable, the world-building is brilliant and the story is great. Quite clever, and a lot of fun - highly recommended."
"I've enjoyed very few science fiction novels more than I did this one. It's not to everyone's taste, I'm sure, because it's not dark or twisty. It's a space adventure on a ship crewed by a number of different species and here's the thing: they're all smart, nice people. And (spoiler alert) none of them die along the way. There are scrapes and thrills and things to be sad about, but the book is full of humanity without reference to how many appendages the humanity has. I loved it."
"I loved loved loved this book! It’s relaxing endearing perfectly put together sci-fi. It has loveble characters, lots of action, but most importantly it explores interpersonal relationships and differences between different races/species and it bridges them in a wonderful way. It is super entertaining while exploring wide range of ethical issues, can’t recommend it enough!"
"As I progressed reading this book I became amazed at how much of it was oriented towards sexual  divergency.  I mean really. ,  Sex between a computer and  A flesh and blood Being?  Interspecies sex? I mean intergalactic, from different planets, way out there sex.  Really?  How about homosexual  Interspecies love?  All of this and more!  Enjoy!  Or not."
">>3.5★<<""I know who I am, but who are you? I woke up during the sunrise, and your hair and your skin and the freckles on your nose glowed like gold. Honey-gold. I think you are my wife, and I will call you Honey Girl.""And so begins the sapphic romance between Grace Porter and Yuki Yamamoto; two lonely souls who found each other in the desert. Grace and her two roommates and best friends, Ximena and Agnes, are on a mini vacation in Las Vegas to celebrate Grace's PhD in Astronomy. On their last night in the city Grace meets a girl with rose-pink cheeks and pitch-black hair. When she wakes up the following morning in her Las Vegas hotel room she finds a photo, a business card, and a note on the bed next to her. These are the only items she has connecting her to the woman she drunk-married the night before. She doesn't remember her name but she can't forget how the beautiful girl made her feel. With only these memento's and snippets of a champagne-bubble dream, Grace and her girlfriends get on a plane and fly back to Portland, Oregon, where Grace must once again face her stark reality. The only thing Grace knows for certain is that she doesn't want to give up her wife, whoever she is, or the connection they inexplicably have.I'll admit that this book started out on a bit of a bumpy course for me. The story felt a little disjointed and the prose didn't seem to flow well. Dialogue didn't smoothly segue into thought. Unfortunately when I read a book that starts out this way I have a hard time deciphering whether it's the book or just me. I also felt the pacing was a little off with the first 40% of the book following Grace and her friends from day to day and then in the second half there were quite a few time jumps. This was necessary for the progression of the story but the book would have benefitted from a more consistent timeline. All in all these are pretty minor infractions. Where the book really shines is in the characters and their growth throughout the story.Grace's mother lives in Southbury, Florida where Grace grew up among the trees in their orange grove. Grace's father, the Colonel, took Grace and moved to Portland when she was quite young. Growing up in an unfamiliar city with only her father and lovely stepmother, Sharone, Grace slowly built her own family- an eclectic group of colorful humans that love and support one another above all else. Her two roommates, Agnes, the girl with claws and sharp teeth, and Ximena, the Spanish goddess who is the glue that holds them together, lean on one another and pick each other up when they need it.Grace works at the Tea House owned by the lovely Indian family that has adopted Grace as their own. Meera is the calm and supportive sister-figure, while Raj plays the role of big brother and protector. Baba Vihaan, their father, lovingly embraces Grace as if she is his own. Later, we meet Yuki, the gorgeous Japanese storyteller that Grace married in the desert along with her 3 roommates. Sani, the Native American MMA fighter, Dhorian, the dark-skinned resident doctor, and Fletcher, the silly and loving school teacher.The diversity in both ethnicity and sexuality make this a decadent and vibrant story. Different cultures and beliefs are touched upon throughout the book in subtle ways. Biracialism is front and center; Grace is half black and half white. The struggles she faces in both her life and her career are heartbreaking and appalling. Intersectionality also plays a big role in this book. The Colonel is both black and disabled; he lost a portion of his leg in the war. Grace is not only biracial but suffers with mental illness as well. And she isn't the only one. Agnes is thriving with Ximena and Grace but she's still battling with her illnesses.""I am here, says the darkness inside Grace. I am listening.""Both Grace and Raj are buckling under the weight of their father's expectations but in very different ways. While the Colonel is extremely strict and refuses to give an inch, Baba Vihaan is loving and warm but their culture demands the eldest son take over the family business when the patriarch dies whether Raj wants that life or not.When Grace decides to take some time for herself after eleven grueling years of non-stop education and job rejections that are based on her race and sexuality rather than her above board and absolutely stellar resume, she does so against the wishes of her very strict father. For the first time in her life she is making a decision for herself rather than someone else. Little does she know that flying to NYC and getting to know her wife will become the catalyst she needs to finally face her fears, confront the people that have hurt her, and begin the arduous task of freeing herself from many self-inflicted burdens.Grace is a brilliant astronomer, vastly knowledgable, and has the degrees and doctorate to prove it but when it comes to knowing her inner-self, the things she needs to make her happy, she is woefully inept. Following along on her journey of self-discovery is both heartbreaking and inspiring; I have a feeling her story will resonate with many people of color, especially women. These beautiful humans can read this story and feel seen. Whether the reader is black, biracial, Indian, Spanish, Japanese, Native American, disabled, Buddhist, lesbian, bi, gay, or straight- this story is a love letter to you. That being said I highly recommend reading an own-voices review; a review from someone who has shared the experiences of our main character. I suggest the following reviews goodreads for your perusal: Mina Reads & Ahtiya (BookinitWithAhtiya).If you're someone who loves diversity, strong female leads, found-family, or self-discovery in your stories than look no further. Morgan Rogers did a phenomenal job representing so many marginalized people. This is a novel that I read with google open on my phone to search all the new things I discovered while reading, whether it was about culture, food, or ethnicity. This is an absolute feast of a book!"
"Grace worked her tail off on her perfect plan, making it to the ripe-old-age of 29 with a fresh PhD and…well that’s it.  Graduating from college was like hitting a brick wall for that girl, she was a little dizzy and had no idea where to go after that.  So she went to Vegas, got stupid drunk, and married a woman she had just met and didn’t even remember her name the next morning.  That certainly didn’t fit into her plan, but since she seemed to be fresh out of next steps, she hopped on a plane to New York City to fall in love with her wife.  Grace seems to have no idea how to live her life without school, and she struggled emotionally without everything that came after her graduation day.  That poor girl falls apart in every way, completely running away to hide at her mother’s orange orchard. Grace is one of the most loveable characters I have read so far in 2021.  Rogers was able to create an overachiever that wasn’t a stick-in-the-mud.  Her friends were so neat, and then Rogers went and made Yuki’s friends neat also.  What are the odds that there are that many neat friend groups???  Maybe I should leave the house more often and make friends, because I wanted those people to be my friends.  Grace did seem to have some pretty lame parents though.  Her dad was completely rigid (though her stem-mom seemed pretty nifty), and her mom was completely absent.  She didn’t seem to have a very good relationship with either of them, which would explain why she fell apart in New York, she didn’t really have a good emotional upbringing.  There’s a large part of me that wants to know more about Grace and Yuki’s story, but there’s another part of me at peace with where this book ended."
"Read this book. Just please read this book. Morgan Rogers wrote an exceptional debut novel. HONEY GIRL is fantastic in every way - *every way* - I adored it. I read half of it in one sitting because I was absorbed in Grace Porter’s story. Plus, Rogers has such an ease with her writing that I didn’t even realize I was lost in the book.So a little book blurb: Grace is a straight A, work-through-the-summer certified high achiever. She is not the kind of person who goes to Vegas and gets drunkenly married to a woman whose name she doesn't know...until she does exactly that. 😍 And then we get the fallout of Grace’s impulse decision and what she has to decide to do with her life now.This book was raw, honest, emotional, and heartfelt. It’s not strictly a romance, but it’s more of a wildcard story - an exploration of life: a coming-of-age story of finding yourself and the love you deserve and want. I loved it, so much. It made my heart so happy. It will stay on my bookshelf forever, be a constant book rec, and I look forward to rereading it.Two things I really loved:☀️normalization of therapy☀️normalization of all kinds of loveHONEY GIRL is beautiful.Please read it.Content Warnings: There are A LOT. They are all listed on the author's website, which I absolutely adore her for doing this."
"(Disclaimer: I received this book from Netgalley. This has not impacted my review which is unbiased and honest.)I was hooked on Honey Girl from the first chapter. If I'm being honest, probably before I even started. The premise spoke to something in my heart and I've been searching for more sapphic romances to read! Honey Girl surpassed all my expectations. I expected a swoony romance about falling in love with your wife. But what I got was an introspective journey of dealing with the pressures of being a woman of color, needing to rely on our friends, and self-discovery. What I expected was all the sighs at falling in love. But what I got was a flood of tears at how emotional the parental relationships were and how lyrical the whole book was.Grace felt relatable to me from the first moment I met her. From the way she's super organized, but how she also just deeply wants to have a break. A break from the hustle, the ways she is undermined by her colleagues, the systematic racism. She is overwhelmed with what and who we should be. The fight for women of color is challenging and demanding perfection. It's for all the opportunities that are never handed to you. That demand your perfection otherwise they discount not only you, but everyone after you."
This was absolutely beautiful read  from beginning to end. I really don’t know where to start there are so many intricate pieces that made up Grace Porter. I loved how mental illness was written about in such a graceful manner in which it didn’t overpower the character or the storyline it was one with them. I loved the diversity among all the characters it was amazing and refreshing all at once. This was far from romance but very heartfelt and appreciative for Grace to find herself in this big scary world a little piece at a time. I loved that not only among Grace’s journey did she grow and learn but also the people she loved closest to her grew as well and that is impeccable writing in my book when all around character growth is present. Moral of this story is no one has it altogether at all or most of the time but there’s no time limit in figuring it out for ourselves and making yourself happy amongst other things.That’s my takeaway!! I’m eager to find out what’s next from this author and I can’t wait to dive into another amazing read
"In her debut, Morgan Rogers shows great promise. Her voice is full of poetic prose is this coming of age tale that follows Grace Porter after she makes one HUGE, uncharacteristically rash decision: she drunkenly gets married in Las Vegas to a woman she doesn’t know – and who is nowhere to be found the next morning when she wakes up with a hangover and a ring on her finger.Romance takes a backseat, so if the fluffy blurb has you thinking this is all about falling in love with your secret wife, think again. Instead, we’re treated to a delicate and moving story about a woman trying to find herself after she’s done everything she was supposed to do, and still feels lost. Grace feels trapped in the shadow of familial expectations; but as she explores the new possibilities after her taste of rebellious freedom in Vegas, she learns there is so much beauty and adventure that’s possible if she starts following her heart instead of her mind – that it’s ok, even wonderful, when life doesn’t go according to plan."
"“Focus on one thing, Grace, and hold on to just that”I knew from the opening scene that I must read this. The author tackles so many topics that I probably won’t even get to address them all. There was a darkness that was hovering throughout the book.. but the words flowed methodically like poetry. It was fluid, tactical, and precise- meaning, every word and chapter played a role. Down to the supporting characters, every thing make sense. I truly enjoyed reading this book and I felt that I got a complete story by the ending.The author really delivered with this book. Honey Girl is one of those feel good stories that can also be seen as a, “coming to age” story. Even though the main character is 29 years old, she is really just starting to find herself. I’d highly recommend for a book discussion or book club read. I’d love to hear other opinions. Definitely a five star read for me!!"
"The characters in this novel are smitten with love and don't know how to process their feelings, thanks to a number of missteps throughout their childhood. The cast are mostly black or brown lesbians, which adds a nice dimension to those of us who aren't either. I found myself immediately warming to the opening premise: two women vacationing in Vegas get drunk and then married despite having just met. And while the situation could easily have degraded into some ""Hangover"" spin-off, the book remains true to their characters and brings us deeply into their world. The couple is an interesting pair: a recently minted astronomy PhD and a radio talk show host who reminded me of Allison Steele of WNEW-FM days. The book will challenge you to think about love and loss and conflict and reconcillation, and I highly recommend it."
"I’m glad I happened to see the author tweet that it’s not super romance-centric before I read it so my expectations were in a more accurate place, but really, nothing prepared me for how moving this was, how well it encapsulated what people want when they beg for New Adult fiction, despite the MC being 28-29. The romance is absurdly cute, but it’s so much more about dealing with expectations from your family and yourself and of society (especially and particularly as a queer Black woman) and I just wanted to hand this out to so many people I know would probably find it an incredibly cathartic and insightful read. There’s so much found family in here, and it’s not nearly as tropey a book as it sounds but I hope everyone reads it and loves it anyway. (CW: self-harm)"
"The basic blurb for this book makes it seem like a light romance:""With her newly completed PhD in astronomy in hand, twenty-eight-year-old Grace Porter goes on a girls’ trip to Vegas to celebrate. She’s a straight A, work-through-the-summer certified high achiever. She is not the kind of person who goes to Vegas and gets drunkenly married to a woman whose name she doesn’t know…until she does exactly that.""But this book is so much more than a light rom-com. Grace has been pushing herself for years. She was raised by her military father whom the whole family calls ""Colonel"", and who has instilled such drive and focus in Grace that she has never thought to waver from it.She always had a next step, another part of her life plan, and known exactly what she would do next. Once she graduates with her PhD and does not get the job interview she has been groomed for, her carefully structured life plan begins to fall apart.This is where the drunken Vegas wedding comes in.In the aftermath, Grace has to figure out what it is that SHE wants from her life. She has maintained such perfect control for decades, striving for perfectionism and always aiming for the best. But what does ""best"" look like?Is ""best"" securing the most prestigious job, even if it means putting Grace's own wishes and desires second? Does it mean checking off those little boxes in the plan we call life, but letting down the people she loves most in the world?This book broke me in all the best ways because I could understand Grace's struggle. While Grace has the added weight of being a queer Black woman, trying to break into a scientific field that is overwhelmingly white and male, I understood her drive for perfectionism and the iron grip she kept on control. I also pushed myself throughout my academia, always knowing the next step, until one day....the step you reach for isn't there...and you falter. When your perfect life plan suddenly fails, it's terrifying. As Grace says at one point, ""If I control everything, it can't go wrong. At least that's how it feels.""There are some very honest and raw moment in this book, dealing with these feelings of control and perfectionism, self-harm as a way to maintain that illusion of control, and therapy as a way to actually manage these feelings.This book is also full of well-written, nuanced, diverse characters. I wanted to know more about all of them because they are so important to Grace. Sequel, please?Lastly, I can't believe this is a debut novel. Rogers is definitely an author to watch, because I can't wait to see what she writes next."
"This a nice book if you understand that life, like books, does not always have to be full of action and you can just enjoy the ride.This book was nice, but just not my style. A lot of it is written very poetically, and I like books that have more action rather than thoughts and feelings. ""Queenie"" is a book in a similar genre (black female mental health) that I really enjoyed and I'm glad I saw some of those themes here. I would also say that the main character's definition of ""lonely"" wasn't relatable to me. I've had months where I only speak to people at work and nights where I feel like I miss everyone I've ever met. Meanwhile five or six characters are described as Grace's family, and she is physically affectionate with them and says ""Love you so much it hurts"" all the time. We just have very different definitions of ""lonely."" I understand that you can be surrounded by many loved ones and still feel lonely but I thought she was very lucky."
"I expected more from this book, but unfortunately, it read like a children’s book to me. The author’s writing style was premature and undeveloped in my opinion. It was disappointing. I found myself skipping through a lot of it."
"This was not exactly what I was expecting. From the description and things I had heard about Honey Girl I just kind of assumed it was primarily sapphic adult romance but that is not the case. While the romance is a prevalent aspect of the story it is not the main focus, instead Honey Girl focused a lot more on Grace discovering herself as an adult, what she wanted from her life and learning how to love herself.Regardless that this wasn't what I expected I did like the characters and I still really enjoyed reading it, I think it could be a good book for you if you're of a similar age, it can be quite comforting to read about an MC with some of the same doubts and fears."
"I gave this book a 3.5 stars I expected a little more fluffy romance than I I however I really enjoyed this book it was funny, fun, emotional.The author deals with some really important topics and wow she does it so well. This book is a lot more than just a romance. Irs about a girl learning to be herself to discover what she wants in life and deals with mentle health.It's wrote really well.The only reason I gave it 3.5 stars was because I would have liked a little.more romance between Grace and Yuki"
"Lovely book, easy read. Well written. Would recommend."
"Drei Sterne für die Kombination aus meinen (zugegebenermaßen ganz schön vom Marketing geschürten) Erwartungen und der Qualität des Buches.Vermarktet wurde mir Honey Girl als Romanze plus Coming-of-Age, mit Fokus auf der queeren Identität der Protagonistin (letzteres hat für mich den Kaufausschlag gegeben). Bekommen habe ich die Geschichte einer gebeutelten Absolventin, die mit Rassismus, den Erwartungen ihres Vaters, und einer für lange Zeit undefinierten psychischen Erkrankung zu kämpfen hat. Das ist erstmal kein Werturteil, allerdings eine ziemliche Abweichung von dem, was mir versprochen wurde.Dazu kam, dass ich der Geschichte selbst nicht allzu viel abgewinnen konnte. Ich denke, jemand der sich mehr mit Grace identifizieren kann, als ich das getan habe (speziell, was die Erwartung des Elternhauses und den systemischen Rassismus angeht, beides Themen, die mir nicht persönlich nahe sind, aber sehr im Mittelpunkt der Geschichte stehen), nimmt wesentlich mehr mit als ich. Die Themen sind nicht schlecht behandelt; man merkt, wie nahe der Autorin viele Punkte sind. Sie sind nur nicht das, was ich üblicherweise gezielt aussuchen würde.Davon abgesehen leidet das Buch auch unter einigen handwerklichen Schwächen. Stellenweise wirken Dialoge sehr hölzern, blumige Beschreibungen werden endlos wiederholt, und neue Charaktere werden fast schon mit einer Liste an Persönlichkeitsmerkmalen vorgestellt, die in einigen Fällen die *gesamte* Persönlichkeit ausmachen. Gerade Yuki ist weniger komplex, als ich mir das gewünscht hätte, und erinnert sehr an den Manic Pixie Dreamgirl-Tropus, ohne dafür ein Gegengewicht zu haben.Über das Ende bin ich mir sehr unschlüssig. Einige Aspekte waren perfekt gewählt und die logische Schlussfolgerung der Ereignisse. Andere wirkten sehr an den haaren herbeigezogen.Wer mit den richtigen Erwartungen liest und den Hauptthemen etwas abgewinnen kann, für den ist Honey Girl sicher einen Blick wert. Für mich wird es wohl kein zweites Lesen geben."
"I will start by saying, that Honey Girl is a very good book.The theme, though, would also make a pretty good topic for a discussion of the general state of our society. Grace grew up dominated by values, that were already out of date at the latest in the early sixties of the 20th century. In fact, what the story turns out to revolve about is what the astrological system I use calls the Saturn return, that happens between the age of 28 and 30. For most around the 29th birthday. That is the moment we, as humans, have to ask ourselves the existential question, if what we are living is actually in accordance to who we are in our heart. For me it was the start of my transition.Here Grace, for the first time, asks herself the question she avoided already during puberty, whether her own values are matching those, she forces herself to live by, because she craves the acceptance of her father. The fact that she has found out, that her sexuality doesn’t match general expectations, isn’t even the worst of her problems, what cripples her is the guilt she puts on herself for not being able to follow the plan her father devised for her, the expectation she has therefore developed for herself to always be the best.In fact, this book is a heavy, to the point, criticism of our educational system, parental ignorance and the lack of understanding of the truth, that all children are born with abilities, that will still be needed, when the parents aren’t alive any more. That, by definition, means that the parents will never be able to understand those abilities, as they exceed their capability for comprehension, that they were given for the span of their lives. The result all too often is a crippling attitude towards the child, who is different than their expectations. Yet in the end it is the combination of the parents genetic heritage lines, that makes the child who the child is.It needs a really strong willed and rebellious child to break the expected mould. In my youth it was much earlier, that you needed to become responsible. Student loans were rare, grants sometimes available for children with exceptional intellects, but most of my age group had to work just as much time as studying, if we didn’t decide for a career, that at least earned us a salary to sustain our lives for ourselves. Then, of course, there had also been the so called student revolution of the late sixties. I think we were just a rebellious generation.Coming back to astrology and who and how we are. The inbuilt rhythm of destiny in all of us makes puberty a much more important phase than just becoming physically fertile. It is also the first time to evaluate our deepest innermost self against the values of our parent’s generation, to find out what does comply with who we are and what doesn’t. Guidance in that direction should be the focal point of the educational system for that age (between 14 and 21), not how to form useful subjects for the needs of the economic system, not to stuff the poor young people full of “learning”. What we are supposed to develop at that age is insight.All that deficit is what Grace is struggling with and in the end it is only the help of a psychologist, that enables her to become who she truly is and find the way back to the love of her life. What does that say about our society, since it is more and more often the case in reality, too?If you read it properly, this novel will hopefully leave you with a lot of questions about yourself and what life you want, unless you have asked yourself all of them at the age between 28 and thirty already. For me that was now more than thirty years ago."
"Stunning, lyrical prose. The emotions invoked were extraordinary and varied. The addresses of systemic racism, depression, mental illness as a whole, medication, self harm, love, lgbtqqip2saa, poc... I am deeply moved by this raw, real story. I can’t relate to all, but it certainly made me question myself, the systems that allows these issues to exist and the world itself."
"This book had me from the first page! I could hardly put it down. It was such a sweet story with amazing diversity in the characters. The personal struggles that the main character goes through are both deeply personal to her, and yet relatable to the reader, that you can't help but feel some type of kinship with her. I also loved that the relationship was between ""older"" individuals (the main character being 28-29) when this type of story would usually contain people much younger - it's very refreshing to read."
This is one of the very few books published recently that is based on a queer love story and one that actually has a plot and likeable characters.
This book was so cute and funny! I loved both of the main characters for different reasons. I loved the plot as fake dating is one of my most favorite tropes. I think the story was beautifully written & it’s such an adorable love story.
I really enjoyed this book! I love romcoms make it sapphic and I am all here for it! I adore the main characters. This is well written and so fun to read.
"A funny, well-written book that was thoroughly enjoyable!  I'm keeping in my permanent collection."
"I really enjoyed reading this book, I liked that there was more happy in the middle than angst.. the love scenes were really well written. Will definitely be reading it again!"
The characters were so easy to fall in love with and 100% relatable! Such a great book. I will most definitely read it again.
"I wound up buying a copy for my friend, who's a lesbian astrologer."
"This book made me immediately need to find my soulmate. Or Ben& Jerry's ice cream. Either will suffice. This book was the sapphic- slight pride and prejudice- book you are looking for. And if you're not looking for it, I'm judging you heavily because this book was amazing!"
The lesbian feel good that you need. If you're looking for a feel good that you'll want to read in one day then this is it.
"The book felt a bit rushed & there was lack of character development but over all it was good. Obviously, the characters are younger...(late 20's) and is based on their experiences. I would like to see more on if & how their relationship grows 5-10 years down the road...now that would be interesting!"
Couldn’t put it down. Loved the storyline and fell in love with the characters! I read this in 3 days <3 Love me a good rom-com.
"This book was fun and easy to read, just like I wanted from a romcom.  My main critique would be that the ending felt a bit abrupt, but overall I would recommend to someone looking for a lighthearted, quick read."
This is one of the worst wlw books I've read. Poorly written story centered around a bunch of cliche tropes. Wouldn't recommend for anyone over the age of 13/14
This book is amazing. I devoured it in a day and I’m so glad I did. The characters are so well written and I loved it so much
"This book is one of my favorite love stories. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, and wanting more. The characters have depth and are written so well. It really highlights the saying “opposites attract”. You won’t be disappointed"
"Saw this book in Barnes & Nobles, decided to order it on Amazon and I don’t regret it. A kind, sweet, soft and warm story. Definitely a comfort book. Totally recommend."
This is a good book that is well written. The only part I didn’t like is that one character is a professional astrologist.
"I love this book! The only thing I has a problem with was that the book had some torn edges on the side of the back cover. Other than that, great!"
This book was so cute! I was hooked from the beginning! The two of them were absolutely perfect for each other! There is a little bit of spice in there as well!
"This was such a fun read while still having enough depth to make you love the characters. One of my favorite tropes served up with humor, tenderness, and love."
This book was absolutely adorable! It was a perfect holiday read to warm your heart. Would definitely recommend!
Was a gift to someone. They had this book on their wish list and said it arrived looking perfect and they were looking forward to reading the book.
"This book is absolutely amazing. It’s fun, sexy, heartwarming, adorable, romantic bundled all in one. It left me wanting more and I absolutely recommend for a rom-com read."
This was so good !!! Sapphic fake dating in seattle that turns into love?????? God I have seen what you have done for others pls
This was a cute and fun story with interesting and complicated characters! Loved reading this wonderful novel!
I feel like I know these characters! The story is adorable and real. I will never say no to a geeky romance that is so sweet.
"Who doesn't love a fake dating, enemies to lovers story?! Plus it's queer? I was hooked from page 1!"
What an amazing story ❤.  I was 🪝 from the very first page. I would recommend this to all .. liked how the love story unraveled into a true love story. Please read..
I really enjoyed this lgbtq romance! I would definitely recommend. The characters were enjoying and it was very readable!
Incredible. Warm. Honest. True to the reality of lesbian relationships - love that no one questions their sexuality. They are just two ordinary women. Thank you for writing this! The audible version is the best! I highly recommend it!
"A relationship that will keep you wondering the outcome will be, but enjoy the highs and lows of love."
This was such a cute book! I spent far too much time grinning like a loon over it!
Absolutely loved this book. Could barely put it down and immediately wanted to reread it when I was finish. A cute story without being cheesy and really well written.
"First of all, If you love astrology you’ll enjoy the references that are made and the general vibes of this book. Second of all, I LOVE THIS STORY. I enjoyed getting to know the characters. This story was fun, cute and .... freaking hot. I could totally relate to them and the self love acknowledgement touch me deeply. I will honestly read it again and again because it gives you hope in the existence of soulmates and I grew attached to this couple. I would have loved an epilogue to make the end a little longer just because I didn’t want it to end. Rather than that, I loved everything !"
Super livre avec une histoire d amour magnifique ; on sent que les 2 personnages sont fait pour être ensemble. Dommage qu on ait pas de plus longue fin ( mariage ; enfant etc...)
"I loved this book!!! It was absolutely refreshing to enter a modern and original vampire world, where love is celebrated in it’s purest form. I read a lot of fantasy and was delighted to come across something new! The characters are very well developed and their relationships feel real. The story has a bit of everything, with just the right amount of heat! I feel so lucky I was able to receive an advanced copy. I am hooked and can’t wait for the next book!"
"Lovely world building. I appreciate that there is no war between vampires and humans. Just a solid story of two strong  , caring individuals learning about each other and their growing love for the other. Can not wait for second book!  Recommended"
I’ve read 100s of vampire books and NEVER encountered a world as unique as this. Try this book! You won’t be disappointed in it only perturbed the lateness of the next release😐
Good book!!! I can’t wait to get part 2...💕
"Fast romance read, although the relationship itself is a wonderful slow build. Nino is adorable and deserves to be protected at all costs."
Loved this story! Liked this take on vampires and their auras. Loved the build up between the two main characters. Can’t wait for the next book!
This is the perfect book for people who likes:- Friends to lovers stories-Slow burn romance  with A LOT OF UST AND PINNING-  Sexy Vampires- Cultural diversity ( Japanese)-Bisexual representation-HFN ( this is the first book of a series)
The cover is what made me decide to try this book and I am glad I did.  It was an enjoyable read.
This is the kind of friends to lovers slow burn that I love to read because you get to see them develop both their friendship and love.
This is one of the best vampire books I’ve read. It’s a romance but with an actual plot! Reading this book brought some form of joy to 2020. I can’t wait until the sequel comes out!!!
This was my first book by this Author so didn't know what to expect but I devoured it in one sitting couldn't put it down the two main  characters were divine this book has it all romance suspense and a good story line
"In the beginning I thought this was going to be slow and even contemplated giving up... After 20% in I was hooked. I love the twist on vampires, love the characters and can't wait to read the second book"
I have never read a vampiric novel with such a wholesome love story. I love the development of Nino and Haruko’s relationship and it’s a great character study of two ostracised purebloods in the vampire aristocracy.
"Adored this book. Perfect in every way for me. Characters, plot, pacing. Even the vampirism is on point! In love with the characters and pairing and cannot wait to read the next book."
Oh my goodness... absolutely dreamy. I have such a stupid smile on my face. I loved it and I'm going straight onto the next book.
"Ohh a unique take on the usual vampire lore story.Haruka and Nino had this easy connection which had them becoming fast friends which eventually leads to more when they can no longer deny their draw to each other and the simmering chemistry.It did take me a bit to get into the story as it is written in third person present tense which is not something that is easy to read, but once I got into the story enough it was enjoyable.I absolutely fell in love with this cover, it's 100% why I purchased this book.I am curious to what book 2 will be like."
"This book was recommended to me on goodreads and I fell in love with it the moment I saw the cover. I bought it and went into it for the m/m vampire romance, and that's exactly what I got.This was a really easy, fun read between two really sweet characters. Their dynamic was so nice to see despite how different they were from one another, to be honest it made it even more adorable seeing their relationship grow.I only wish it was longer so their relationship could develop more, and because I can't get enough of these two. I'm looking forward to picking up the second book soon!"
Absolutely amazing book! I read it in one go!
im so in love with this book
"Je n'ai pu m'accrocher ni aux personnages, ni à l'histoire."
"I was convinced I would hate this book.I'm the type of person who requires a higher quality of writing style. I need a more mature and complex prose in order to enjoy a good story. The moment I opened this book I realized it was not up to standards. The descriptions were awful, the pacing was erratic, and the characters too simple. Annoyed and angry I wanted to put it down, I wanted to throw it away and never speak of it again. However this book was so ridiculously hyped I decided to push through and read it anyway. If not for the enjoyment, then at least to be able to wright a review and let other future readers know to beware before they buy.To my complete and utter surprise this book grew on me like a fungus. I found myself ignoring the terrible writing style and paying more and more attention to the plot unveiling itself before me. In awed amazement, the more I read the more I dared to love this story. As I progressed into the plot, the story changed from a horribly written slave fanfic into a compelling tale with twists and turns with wonderfully thought out characters.Do not be fooled! This is not your average pleasure slave story! It is so much more than that!In conclusion, if you are the kind of person who enjoys intricate writing styles as I do, you may be put off for the first few chapters or so, but believe me this thing is going to grip you like you won't believe."
"Is a guilty pleasure still a guilty pleasure if the characters are deep and engaging, with their own thoughts and motives, and if the prose is well written?I was expecting the same type of writing/content caliber as other kink-catering popular reads (cough cough) which I found to be utter trash and devoid of anything of value.  I am glad I gave this a try.The environment is rich, vast.  The characters are meaningful individuals, nearly all of which are more than meets the eye - and they only grow more interesting the further you get into the text.  The vocabulary is extensive, and the sentence structure is solid and varied.  What I am trying to say is, it's not just gimmicky.  This is well-written.  Surprisingly so.  The plot is heavy and extremely developed, for something that could easily have decided to ignore the need for it.  It could easily have said, ohh through the power of lust and love, the two main characters become smitten!  Which, upon reading this first volume, is far from the case, OR how it's happening.I thought I'd be embarrassed if I took a liking to it.  Far from it.  Quality writing with interesting characters and a plot that snakes around its contents like a dangerous viper... I still can't believe how good it is."
"The Captive Prince Trilogy is one long story.  You need to read all three books in order: Captive Prince, Prince’s Gambit, and Kings Rising.  Book 1 was good.  Book 2 was the best.  I did not like Book 3.  The ending of Book 3 was good - it was happy for the main characters.  But prior to the end Book 3 was mostly frustrating feelings and a couple of stupid events.  I put an example in Spoiler below.  Books 1 and 2 had more interesting strategies and events.  Book 3 was no fun.The story is mostly about military, wars and politics in two countries/kingdoms.  There are a lot Machiavellian strategies, conflicts and trickery.  Other adjectives to describe the story: enslavement, rape, torture, sexual depravity.  Gay male sex is talked about a lot.  Both countries have sex slaves and other slaves.Laurent is a 20-year-old prince soon to be made king of Vere.  His uncle is the current Regent but plans to kill Laurent so he can stay in power.  They are master manipulators working against each other.  Laurent appears to be evil, cold and intriguing.  There is a lot of mystery about him.Damen is a prince from Akielos.  Damen’s brother Kastor took over the Akielos throne and sent Damen to Vere to be a slave.I don’t know the author’s inspirations, but I imagine the following could have been inspirations: David Bowie for Prince Laurent, his country Vere being like Italy, valuing art and beauty.  Gerard Butler in the movie 300 would be Damen.  His country Akielos similar to Sparta.SEX:Throughout the books characters talk a lot about men having sex with men, teenage boys, and male slaves.  These are references to sex not detailed explicit sex scenes, but this keeps sex frequently in the reader’s mind.  Most of it is male-male sex but there is one male-female sex scene.The total number of sex scenes for all three books is about 6:  3 short scenes, 3 longer scenes, and many references to sex having happened.  In one scene two men are forced to wrestle naked on stage with the winner raping the loser.TORTURE:There is a whipping torture scene in Book 1.  A couple torture scenes are referred to in Book 3.CAUTION SPOILER:An example of a Book 3 stupid event:  someone surrendering himself to an enemy who will kill him - without good reason - then luck saves the day.  The logic for this did not fit the character’s logic and abilities in the first two books.END SPOILER.DATA:Narrative mode: 3rd person.  Story length: about 947 pages includes all 3 books.  Swearing language: strong.  Sexual language: strong/explicit.  Number of sex scenes: about 6.  Setting: a time of swords and horses in a fictional land.  Copyright: 2013, 2014, 2016.  Genre: gay male fiction."
"This is one of the most fascinating stories I’ve ever read. Now is it an easy read? Heck no. It has glorified rape, child sexual assault and sexual coercion, and all types of things I don’t even want to mention. But underneath it all is a story about trust. About love in the most unconventional of ways. The writer has managed to create a world that lures you in and doesn’t let go."
"Warning on Captive Prince: Slavery, rape, and pedophilia.Here’s the set up for Captive Prince, imagine this: You’re a slave, bound up and ready to be sent as a gift to the prince of the neighboring formerly hostile country of Vere. You’re angry and confused and feeling very much betrayed by your people. You’re not trained, but that’s alright. The prince apparently likes a challenge.Jk, you’re actually the prince of Akielos.Your brother has apparently pulled the biggest dick move in history, and has taken the throne while telling everyone you’re dead and sending you off to a nation that hates you because you killed their precious previous prince. Yea, his little brother isn’t too happy with Prince Damianos.Right now though, you’re just Damen, and no one is the wiser. If anyone in Vere figures out that you’re not just named in mockery of the supposedly late Akielon prince, you’re screwed. Unfortunately, that doesn’t matter much to your new master, Prince Laurent. He hates your entire nation, and he’s not particularly interested in having a difficult slave. He’s also not particularly interested in sleeping with anyone, let alone his new slave, despite what the Venetians think.Your treatment in Vere is pretty bad, despite you theoretically having a comfy gig as the prince’s slave. Everyone calls you a barbarian, and seems to view you as an unbroken stud horse. You may or may not be a “pet,” which is basically a concubine, but since you’re not actually sleeping with the prince, you basically just sit around until you piss him off enough to do something about you. And oh, he will do things to you. Not fun things at all. This is not that kind of story.Hey, at least the prince is totally your type. Except, you know, his whole terrible personality. In the quiet of your head, there’s plenty of time to thinking about murdering him. You’ve got priorities, after all.“Sweetmeat?” said Laurent.In the stretched-out moment that followed, Damen thought explicitly about killing him.If, as a reader, you’re looking for a sweet gay romance story, this is probably not it.As of the first book, this story is largely about two men who don’t particularly like or trust one another being forced together by politics and intrigue. Damen is a noble guy in a terrible situation still trying to find a way to do the right thing. Laurent is an absolute jerk, but you can’t help but feel for the guy. It seems something is going terribly wrong with his life, and Damen may just be the man to help him. Or maybe they’ll murder each other. You have to read the book to find out!Captive Prince is a book that seems to be building up to something big. Not to spoil anything, but by the end of volume one, everything is about to hit the fan and you’re left starving for resolution."
"This book is one of the best that I've read and among them, one of the most complex and intriguing. Let me start off by saying that I read the first two volumes online. Two years have passed and I have not revisited the series until the third volume came out.I've finished the first volume just yesterday, so let me do a comparison of what I recall of my impression of the series two years ago as compared to my impression now. Two year ago when I first came upon this series, I held it in the highest regard. It is fantastic, it is great, it is the best thing that I've ever read. The characters are intriguing, their dynamic intricate and complex, the story line so amazing as to always keep me guessing. Amazon asks what describes the mood of the series the best and the answer would always, always be suspenseful, followed by anticipatory on the reader's end.  I recall two years ago that once I started reading the story online, I could not stop scrolling and clicking until I reached the end. Now, two year from then, in the present day, I did the same with the physical copy of the book. I finished it in a day and pretty much ignored everything until I did so. When I finally did, I pulled my head away from the book, closed it and went to bed way past my usual sleeping hours, only to awake the next day and repeat the same process. I'm on the second book now, so needless to say, my impression of the book two years previous and now is both very favorable.The volume is as good as I remembered. It is a known fact that stories sometimes are not as good on the second read: you notice inconsistencies, flaws, things that previously made sense but now you clearly saw didn't. You are older, more mature, you've read far more and much better stories out there. And there is some of that in here, but not in the way you would think. Fascinated and awed by the world-building and details of the story, I never noticed how odd some sentence structures of Captive Prince were (ie.""'A reward.' Laurent, flatly.""). Commas are use in abundant, parenthesis not often used but still more frequently than common in novels, the start of many sentences with 'and.' They weren't enough to detract from the story Captive Prince is telling, but they were jarring in the beginning. Thankfully enough, the first two fell away from usage after the first half of the book and the third, it was easy enough to grow used to after a while. While I'm on the topic, the author uses really sophisticated language often, which was distracting for me because I had the option of either 1) searching it up or 2) ignoring it. I went with the second option after a while when my anticipation made it impossible for me to continually pause in my read.So I mentioned the flaws that I came across during my rereads and here are some pros. Captive Prince is essentially a story of court intrigue and double-dealing. Upon reread, I noticed just how much was set up. Details that were seemingly unimportant suddenly come back with vengeance chapters later as an essential part of the plot. While reading the second book today, I noticed the same thing. When you read, pay attention to details just like the characters would, because there are layers upon layers with their actions and words. That impressed me and also the fact that even though I recalled enough of the main plot points of the story, I still looked forward to every turn of my page nevertheless. My knowledge of what would happen, instead of detracting from the pleasure of reading, only made my anticipation of every next line grow. The prose is beautiful and the dialogue, once again, full of double-meaning that I could never resist rereading some parts of it.I'm just writing whatever comes into my mind right now, so here's some of the things that captivated me. The characters are amazing. Damen is a Prince who is a warrior and has no head for court deception and he becomes the slave of Laurent, who is known as a cold, ruthless and entirely-too-sly prince. Damen is by no means dim, but he is nothing compared to Laurent. Laurent's reputation, as you will soon read, is not-at-all an exaggeration. He has grown up in Vere, a country that is full of double-dealing and focus of sex as sport. While I'm at it, I'll warn you that there's going to be rape, betrayal, incest, slaves, same-sex relationship, pedophilia and also non-con. Some of these don't happen between the main characters, but it will be there in the background nevertheless for the sake of plot. Laurent grew up in a country like that, so he treats Damen badly in the beginning and the two of them had a very antagonistic relationship at the start. Despite that, both of them do grow closer but at a very slow pace. If you want to see them fall in love by the end of this book, you will be disappointed. They only starts learning to trust each other by the end. Anyway, besides that, the world-building is amazing. Damen comes from a different country than Laurent and the way that Damen constantly notes makes both countries and himself more realistic (Vere is more decorated, clothing with way more laces than necessary, etc). The author puts a lot of details in the different settings and cultural differences.In conclusion, if a slow developing romance, intelligent characters, and court intrigues interests you, then congratulations, this book is for you. However, once again, keep in mind my warnings. All these things are at least implied: rape, betrayal, incest, slaves, same-sex relationship, pedophilia and also non-con."
"This has to be one of the best buys-on-a-whim I've done! All I want to do is rave about this book to anyone I know at the moment. The first book gets you wrapped up in the author's world, and the much needed background for the story and characters and the second book throws you into the core action.For anyone who wants a genuine story with deception, intrigue, relationships that are realistically shaped and effected, plot, and something to keep your mind engaged, this is it.A lot of the time I find the books under the Gay and Lesbian section to be slightly shallow or where else they move too fast and are obviously concentrated on sex. This is not erotica or BDSM at all; any components that you could interpret that way are there for understanding of the backgrounds that these two men come from, and the dynamic that develops between them. (Don't let the first few chapters trick you into thinking it's BDSM).The author does not dumb anything in this book down; the language is appropriate, the characters are complex, and you are expected to understand and catch most of the subtleties and nuances of a character's tone and words. (Magnificent! I can't explain how great this was to see in a book again!)The characters have substance and depth to them, and strong personalities that evolve in a believable, human manner as the book goes on.You meet the enigmatic Laurant not long into the book and immediately have suspicions about the motivations behind his actions and words. The further along you read the more there are twists and clues that you find yourself following. I constantly found myself second guessing the clues that are revealed, unsure if they were intentionally put there by the author and were relevant or not, and figuring that out became a mystery in itself.I usually detest books that feel the need to drag out a single connected storyline through several books, but this one does not stop mid-action and make you wait for the next book. The ending is not a solid story-is-wrapped-up ending, but an appropriate pause that I liken to the end of a well-done T.V. episode.You're going to be hooked and might as well buy the second book at the same time, and this is something I rarely say. (And I am thrilled to hear that we are awaiting a third book!)I finished the second book last night and have already started re-reading the first two because they were such a pleasure to read."
"Absolutely horrible! FYI, I'm only 34 and have NEVER written a book review, let alone a bad one. This is an example of a writer going off the deep end in an attempt to attract readers! Truly felt that way when I put the book down only halfway through. I've read an EXCESSIVE amount of books and am extremely open ""interesting"" literature. Please know that I am not a scholar by any means - quite the opposite.But seriously, lol! Huge waste of my time and money. Honestly I was it's a sad feeling to have read the words of a desperate soul"
"Full review originally posted here:[...]I realize this doesn’t really fit the theme of the blog but when Sarah J Maas recommended this book in her newsletter a few months back it’s been on my radar ever since. Anything Sarah is willing to recommend means it has to be amazing. And she’s right. This book is everything and more than I could ever imagine. The world is well built, the characters are perfectly fleshed out and wickedly cunning, the court politics were easy to follow yet jaw dropping with twists, the romance/relationships in this book are dark and gritty and I just loved everything. EVERYTHING.Damen and Laurent are now one of my top OTPs. Sorry not sorry. I  adore hate relationships, they are one of my weaknesses. When you hate someone but grow to have feelings and its like this big explosion of emotions and power and just *fans self*. You get what I’m saying. Anyway this book starts off really quickly and everything is easily laid out for you so you can’t get confused save for the absurd amount of characters in the book. By the 30% mark I was better able to know the differences in characters and by the end the cast is whittled down to just the main characters so it’s all good.Final Thoughts:Basically this was a super quick addicting read. I couldn’t put this book down until I finished it. I also know that the next two books are going to physically wreck me so I’m putting them off because I don’t want to be a blubbering sad fangirl just yet. For those of you who have read Laurell K. Hamilton’s work this is like a twist of her work and Game of Thrones.Would I recommend this book?Yes but I realize this book isn’t for everyone and this REALLY isn’t a book for young readers. At all. This is 100% adult fiction with sexual content and taboo topics that made even me feel uncomfortable and sad at times. If you’re looking for something to ease yourself into this sort of genre I recommend starting the Anita Blake series by Hamilton. Eventually it gets gritty and super rough emotionally but the first like 5 books are easy reading. For those of you that are more experienced readers I say give this book a try! I loved it!"
"This is 100% a Lymond Chronicles slave AU fanfic.It's unrealistic, hyper-sexual, and id-driven; its characterization is sparse; it's extremely derivative (down to lines of text, character traits, backstories, user of POV, plot twists, and scenes that are clearly iterations of things that happen in the Lymond books).What that means is it's not a great standalone series, but if you're into these fanfic tropes, it's super entertaining, readable, and fun.Personally I'm not into the slave AU trope, but I'm super into the Lymond character archetype (ice cold, hyper competent, gorgeous, sharp-tongued, brilliant, and profoundly traumatized underneath). So even though I thought it wasn't great, I enjoyed it very much and even went to the bookstore in the middle of a pandemic so that I could read the entire series in one weekend. It satisfies the id (if this is something your id wants), not the brain.For those who did enjoy this - you MUST read Dorothy Dunnett's Lymond Chronicles, which is clearly the inspiration for this and is 1000x better."
"A lot more complicated and deep than I expected. Pretty explicit too, but overall a good book with an interesting plot and amazing characters."
"I used to read a lot of slash fiction online, but haven't done so in the past eight years or so.. I'm sorry that I missed Captive Prince the first time around, when it was originally published in serial form on Livejournal. It's still available free online, but I bought both volumes in ebook format after reading the first chapter - this first-time author is most definitely worthy of your support!Yes, the overwhelming 5-star reviews are REAL! This is an amazing story, the best I've read in a while. The characters are full and vividly portrayed. The tension between the two main characters, Damen and Laurent, is so finely done. The politics and intrigue of the relationship between the two kingdoms, Vere and Akielos, will keep you interested, even for those not normally drawn to political/historical thrillers. Here and there I felt that the writing could have been tightened up a bit, but overall, the writing is eloquent and erudite. I would say that the writing brings together the style and feel of Mary Renault (Fire from Heaven/Persian Boy) and Peter Hopkirk (The Great Game [non-fiction about 19th century Afghanistan]) mixed with a healthy dose of adult slash.Bravo! I'm eagerly waiting for the third volume in this series."
I loved this series. It was like Aida but with several twists and turns that kept me hooked. I was impressed that I actually had to look up a new word or two while reading.
"If you review books by calling things 'Yaoi' or 'Slash' this is not the book for you. If you are wanting something that will require you to think and keep you on your toes, purchase this book."
"Wonderful fantasy. I had a hard time putting it down. Pretty good plot, not too much sexual detail but a good story"
I've read this book and the other two multiple times! I highly recommend them!
Excellent.
Very interesting and well written. The author really drew the reader in. Can't wait to read the next book. Very Recommended.
"I was not fully aware what I got myself into when I started reading this book but I'm so glad I did, because it is amazing."
Completely unexpected and well written. The characters are all full and complex
"Nice read. Entertaining, not schlocky, not porny either! Excited for three to come out. I have enjoyed both 1 and 2."
Great read. Definitely more than I was expecting. I am eagerly awaiting the next book.
I started reading when it was posted on livejournal and I was drawn in instantly!  It may seem like a cliché trope ridden premise but S.U. Pacat is able to turn it on it's head into a rich fantasy world with clever intrigue and thoughtful world building.
So glad I happened upon this book! I can't wait to check out other books by this author! A definite read!
A book that is impossible to put down and leaves every reader thirsty for more. Would recommend for anyone who loves drama and sex and beautiful boys. Lol.
"Kept me wondering what was coming next. Neglected school work to read it, and it was so worth it. Can't wait to read the next one."
I loved it completely
It is very well written and has a great story.
"I hated giving Captive Prince anything but a five star review since the story is fantastic but I felt like I had to because the ebook itself frustrated me so much.Unfortunately, the ebook didn't keep any of the scene breaks that signaled a change between one scene to another (usually done with either several lines space between paragraphs or some kind of visual spacer like a line of dots). This made reading the story straight through very confusing and annoying since it made me think I was missing pages several times or that the ebook must have downloaded incorrectly.Every time it happened, it would completely destroy the flow of the story and jar me right out of that head space where you forget that you're reading a book. It was really annoying and eventually I just gave up and reread the originally posted version online instead. It's amazing how something as small as scene breaks can make all the difference and i can easily see how this could convince someone new to reading the story to just put it down and never pick it up again."
They could have wrote two books not three. $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $
"One of the best books, I have read in a long tie."
The genre of the book is really a m/m fantasy romance.  For the genre it is a good book with solid writing.
The plot was great kept you reading; you will read it in a day and will need to buy book two! Thanks for the great read!
"If you haven't been seeing/hearing the buzz surrounding THE CAPTIVE PRINCE by C.S. Pacat, you've probably been living under a rock. I'd seen it EVERYWHERE, even before one of my favorite authors recommended it in her newsletter (<------why I finally caved).My impression before reading it was that it was some kind of pseudo-fantasy/MM/BDSM mashup . . . and that impression was fairly accurate.Not my typical choice of reading material, but HYPE. And CURIOSITY. *shakes fist at curiosity gods*As one might guess from the title (if one pays attention to things like titles *shakes fist at self*), the MC of this tale is a prince (Damen) made captive . . . A prince given as a sex slave to the prince and heir (Laurent) of a rival kingdom, only they don't know he's a prince, but that's a good thing, b/c Damen did a really, really Bad Thing in the last war, and if Laurent found out Damen was actually the REAL Damen, and not just called ""Damen"" b/c Kastor (Damen's illegitimate usurping half-brother) thought Laurent would be amused by having a sex slave named for the man he most hates in the world . . . Well, that would be Bad.Did all of that cross your eyes? B/c as convoluted as it sounds, it's deceptively simple.What isn't simple is everything that came after the initial introductions, and how I feel about it.Obviously, as a prince, Damen isn't too keen on becoming a sex slave. But who cares? B/c sex slave.And even though there technically wasn't much sex (on page), the hedonistic attitude of the nobility permeated the atmosphere, and the threat was constant, like background noise. And YES . . . I do mean threat.But in that weird, willful suspension of disbelief way that's exciting even as you're consciously uncomfortable.Enter Nicaise, the thirteen-year-old ""pet"" of a dirty old man in Laurent's court. The thirteen-year-old who's been serving in his role as ""pet"" for THREE YEARS. Who is maneuvering to keep his position, b/c he knows---EVERYONE knows---that he has maybe another year before he outgrows his master's tastes.*head explodes*So there are two things you need to know before picking up this book:1. There's rape.2. There's pedophilia.I almost stopped 20% in, when Nicaise first showed up. I'm not sure what kept me going. Could've been the remnants of curiosity. Could've been the person who made an asinine comment on one of my status updates about how pedophilia isn't being endorsed by the book, which pissed me off enough to make me want to finish it, all the better to KILL IT WITH FIRE. B/c really? Show me a book that does endorse the sexual violation of children, and I'll show you a jail cell. #GTFOEither way, I kept going.And much to my chagrin, I found myself fascinated by Laurent.He's a prince with the foul mouth of a tavern brawler. Hatred burns in his eyes, but he almost always maintains a perfect calmness that is infuriating. He's a brilliant manipulator who superficially appears to be no more than an indulged royal brat.Beyond my newfound obsession with Laurent, I was reading not only to try to understand my prince, but in anticipation of other (despicable) characters' downfalls.So I'm hooked. *shrugs awkwardly*But if I'd known what I was getting into, I'd never have started.A secondary issue was the thinly veiled attempt to elevate the book above the stereotypes of its genre.I have an extensive vocabulary. I majored in English, but even if I hadn't, you can't read as much as I do and not pick up an impressive number of words along the way. Even so, it's not unusual for me to make use of the handy, dandy word lookup feature found on all ereaders.What is unusual is having to use said lookup feature every few pages.It took awhile to catch on, so I missed the early ones, but after I grew wise to the tactic, I began highlighting: appurtenances, peripatetic, damascened, febrile, machicolation, etc.I could go on . . . and on . . . and on.After I acclimated to the overuse of words rarely (if ever) found . . . anywhere, I began to notice that many of them were frou frou stand-ins for more common words and phrases.A man didn't frown. His ""smooth brow corrugated.""A room wasn't ostentatious, it was, ""afroth with ornament.""I was pretty sure ""afroth"" wasn't a real word. I was further convinced when the word lookup yielded no results. BUT. Word lookup isn't infallible, so I googled it . . . And discovered that it was a real word, but had been misused. Unless Pacat intended to say the ornaments in the room were, ""in a state of lively or angry excitement.""[Afroth."" Merriam-Webster.com. Merriam-Webster, n.d. Web. 6 Feb. 2016.]I usually applaud the Shakespearean tactic of adapting, evolving, creating words to suit your purposes . . .BUT.In this case, it felt disingenuous.Like the author had hangups about the type of book she was writing---SMUT. Maybe intelligent SMUT, but still SMUT---and decided to overcompensate by impressing her readers with her intelligence and/or education via the implementation of obscure words that none of us have ever heard of.Instead, it provided a distraction, b/c constantly having to lookup words.SO. THE CAPTIVE PRINCE by C.S. Pacat is a deeply flawed book, despite its low page count. If you can handle rape and sexual exploitation as abhorrent cultural practices, then you, too, should willingly fling yourself into this deep, dark hole. If you can't, RUN AWAY. If you don't, you'll probably find yourself as entangled as I am, but you've been forewarned, so you'll have only yourself to blame.BUT.If book 2 isn't the significant improvement I'm promised . . . Heads. Will. ROLL."
"A friend recommended Captive Prince Vol. 1-2.  I'm so glad she did or I would have missed these books altogether.The subject matter of a prince being sold into slavery to an enemy kingdom so he cannot take the throne is a definite plus for me.  But even for those not into captive/slave fiction, this book still offers good solid writing and amazing characterizations that play out slow reveals of character secrets and vulnerabilities that make it a page turner.When I read, I want good characters and solid character building.  The author does such a good job in that arena, while also building the tension and chemistry between two main characters who have every right to want to kill each other, but instead slowly come to admire and respect each other's respective strengths. Though the characters are very opposite in some ways, they are alike in more.  Both are princes who were groomed to rule. Both have had to face duplicitousness and deception and betrayal within their own ranks. Now one is the ""owner"" of the other. The awkwardness and humiliation of that is later overshadowed by a growing dependency they develop for each other, including carefully and artfully set up scenarios where they must save each other's lives to survive. Though born enemies, each needs the other to attain his goal, one to ascend the throne alive, the other to escape back to his home kingdomThe set up is compelling to say the least, and ingenius.  Seemingly invulnerable characters slowly show vulnerabilities but without ever breaking character. The build up of their relationship is slow and steady.  There is no sex between them in the first novel but unlike another reviewer stated, it is not a disappointment because we know there are 2 more books (the third coming soon, I hope.)  Knowing this in advance, I did not expect much to be resolved in this first volume, which is why I bought both volumes at once and why I can still give this volume a 5 star even if it's not the complete story.  There is no secret here that this is a trilogy.  And if you fall in love with the characters as I have, you will not begrudge buying more books about these guys.  In fact, I am thrilled that there is more to read.  I didn't want this first book to end, and when it did, knowing there are two more is a great feeling."
I loved this book! It's a definite must read.
I really wasn't sure what to expect when I downloaded this book but I must say it was better than I expected. I'm looking forward to book two.
"This review contains big plot spoilers and plot guessing (shame on me), and should be considered as a review for books one and two.First off, because I like to be upfront where I got/purchased a book, I read both books in this series on LiveJournal first. Why? Because a recent reviewer abandoned the first story. I noticed when I received my Goodreads email.Of course an abandonment always makes me curious when so many others shove a five star rating on the same book. Curiosity led me to look at Amazon reviews, especially the bad ones, and then I found a mention that the entire first novel was over on LJ and off I went. To be honest, the title did not encourage me to want to read (because it sounded like an erotica novel) and nor did the sample. When it all comes down to it, bad or good, the reviews never help me decide. It's the sample.The sample wasn't all that great. I didn't get enough clues to know if the book would be worthwhile. Rather, I was given a bad impression. But I was still curious and so began reading on LJ.So why the four star? Well, I knocked off a star for the sample. I should probably knock off another for poor punctuation in the LJ versions, but perhaps the author fixed those in the eBook; I don't know. Doesn't matter really. I gave the four star for the remaining content after the poor beginning.Why do I feel the beginning is poor? We have a prince who is assaulted, coming out of a sound sleep to witness his sex slave butchered before his eyes and then he is beaten, chained and placed in the slave quarters prior to becoming a slave to an enemy prince.What are his reactions? Anger. Sure. Fear...? Well, the impression is dim. Panic? Dim again. Murderous outrage? Ok, sure. There was that. Caution? Too much, probably, considering there should have been more panic. Shock? Not enough shown. Denial? Yeah, but it was naive, a bit too naive since the POV character (and there is only one for this story) didn't show the shock necessary to make it plausible. Basically what I'm saying here is that the first chapters glossed the reality of the captive prince's situation. Panic is mentioned. Naivety is mentioned. But did I feel it like one does when fully engaged with a character? No, not really.But perhaps the writer had good reason to do it. Perhaps the story would have been too grim if the more realistic aspects were shown. This is a prince--raised to believe he was all but sacrosanct--getting torn from his bed and having a full social reversal. He becomes a nobody, a slave, a sex slave. There should have been a hell of a lot more emotional upheaval, but I didn't see any real depths emotionally until after the sample, when the captive confronts the possibility of a violent rape. Actually, just a bit before, he confronts that someone inserted an oiled finger into him to prepare him. His absolute unthinking shock was the first intimation of realism for me.Oh, yeah. Not much sex in the first novel, btw. There is some groping and a semi-faked rape. This is not an erotica novel. And there's why the title put me off. I didn't want to read an erotica novel. Most of those have no plot. I like plot. This story has plot and not much sex at all, though it doesn't shy away from sexuality.For me, the story is very worth reading for what follows the sample. Get underneath the politics and the warfare in this story, and you find love at the roots, a false love, a fetish that pretended love, and there at the end of that love, the broken young man who still hasn't fully accepted a rejection that occurred because of a change in his body. He grew up. And now he is unloved.Now place this burden on a man destined to be a king and you have what I feel is a really engaging story, a very human story, and I really do want to read to the end to see Laurent rise above his early trauma and win at everything he sets his mind to.I have to give major kudos to this author. Captive Prince is a non-magical fantasy world in which the pedophilia is realistic (but not at all graphic). Pacat nailed the details of pedophilia that truly ruin lives, the details that haunt a victim long afterward. The author has, in this series, grasped the depths of what a victim goes through who was seduced to love his victimizer, and also the depths of manipulation and control a pedophile levies on his victims. And it's all set in a world where few question the rights of high born men who do this, yet the story questions it very thoroughly.Four stars for book one. Five for book two. Highly recommended.P.S. Purchased as an ebook after."
Great little read. Really enjoyed this book lots of great little details that made the story really good. Enjoy the book!
"Loved this story.  The author has created a whole world that is very detailed and thought out. The main characters, Damen and Laurent, are complex and deep.  I really appreciate a new sort of adventure/love story and can't wait for the next volumes to come out to see how the story plays out."
"This was a really compelling story about a 17-y.o. Chinese-American girl in 1954 San Francisco finding her own way in the face of strong family expectations, plus institutionalized racism, sexism, and homophobia. Lily Hu is such a relatable protagonist that her journey and struggles will resonate with many types of people--especially anyone who has fought to forge their own path, and live their own truth, contrary to what family or friends expect.Alongside the universality of Lily's personal journey, the story is deeply enmeshed in Chinese traditions and values, juxtaposed with questions about what it means to be a ""real American"" in the age of McCarthyism. The historical details perfectly illuminate the setting, and Lily's personal situation in it, and show us another side of the American Dream that isn't often portrayed in our sanitized and whitewashed images of the 1950s. My only critique is that the questions about the possible deportation of Lily's father seem to disappear for a long time in the middle of the novel, only reappear in ominous references by Lily's mother, and are never really resolved. Otherwise, this was a fantastic book that I highly recommend."
"I was thinking about this book in relation to the last book I read.  In the last book, the protagonist was a straight white woman.  I did not connect with her, despite being a straight white woman myself. Lo is such a good author that I had no problem connecting with her heroine, a high school-aged Chinese girl in the 1950s who discovers she is a lesbian.This is a fabulous novel: as a coming of age story, as historical fiction, and as a look at the pervasive racism and sexism of the time. Lily Hu is a good Chinese girl. She is best friends with Shirley Lum, another good Chinese girls.  They live in Chinatown in San Francisco and their whole world is pretty Chinese except their high school.Lily already is not quite like them, though. She is fascinated with space and would love to go to space one day.  Her friends don't understand why a girl would want that.  The only person who might understand is the only other girl in the advanced math class, Kath Miller, a white girl.Lily sees an ad for a club featuring a male impersonator and becomes quietly obsessed with it. Kath hesitantly tells her that she has been there and they make plans to go together.Despite their cultural differences, Lily has much more in common with Kath, who wants to be a pilot, than all the other good Chinese girls.  It's only natural they become friends.Lily finds she doesn't fit in the little box labeled ""good Chinese girl"" as well as everyone thinks. Of course she's a good daughter, good student, good sister, good friend. But she's not so eager to marry a good Chinese boy and have little Chinese babies.I liked the character of her Aunt Judy, who is a computer at JPL (back in the days when computers were women who were good at math).  I was rather wishing that Aunt Judy would reveal that she felt the same way and denied herself to be a good Chinese girl.  Ah, well.  At least her career made her a good role model for her niece."
"1950's San Francisco Chinatown is complicated enough for second generation Chinese teenagers, what with racism whenever they leave their safe neighborhoods, the Nationalists vs Communists entangling families in politics, and the ever present Red Scare excusing blatant police and enforcement inequities.Imagine falling in love with a white person of your own gender at that time.Lily is fascinated by the ad for a male impersonator at a local club. When she realizes the only other girl in her advanced math class also likes that ad, she begins sneaking out of her house and her ""good Chinese daughter"" persona to hang out in a club where terms like ""butch"" and ""dyke"" show her another world where women like her live and love.Lily is naive, and loving, and just wants to do the right thing, but she'll have to face the constant choice of living true to herself or telling lies to appease her family.The romance in this is understated and reserved, and its far more a historical exploration of 1950's Chinatown culture and the most interesting (to me ) intersection of cultures where the second generation children of immigrant parents must negotiate their identities within conflicting expectations. Lily is part of a large extended family that includes close knit families of Chinatown and her actions have repercussions on many people-- including her non-citizen father.I  didn't personally care for the sudden changes in POV to Lily's mother and Aunt...they added little to the tale I thought and their voices were too similar to Lily's to be interesting to me. I  found myself skimming those bits to get back to Lily. The addition of timelines with historical and Lily's family events were interesting,  but also confusing as the flashbacks jumped back and forth.Very historically interesting, sweet, tale that keeps you anxious for Lily's welfare but never goes down a truly dark path."
"I’m so in love with this beautiful and heartfelt story because it gave me a vivid snapshot of what Chinatown, San Francisco was really like and I felt as though I was experiencing every moment with Lily. I really wished this book was around when I was a teenager because I could totally relate to the tough choices Lily had to make. I’m anxiously awaiting this author’s next story because I can’t wait to see what she does next!"
"There are four things I like most about Malinda Lo’s novel, Last Night at the at the Telegraph Club: how she captures the crushing drama of being young, how she weaves history into her fiction, how she featured nerd girls and women who love science and math, and her portrayal of San Francisco.This is probably not a book that most middle aged CIS women would read, but I enjoyed it all the same.Thank you Melinda for your use of the Chinese language, your translations, and your historical notes. One minor point of clarification, I think when Lily and Kath meet during the Epilogue year it is 1954. Was it not the year of the Horse rather than Monkey?"
"Malindo Lo does it again! Fantastic story, engrossing, moving and wonderful!I don’t have the words to do it justice! Thank you for your work putting this story together, giving me insight to a time and culture and all the emotions! Thank you to all the pioneers that make our love possible!"
The author spent a lot of time developing new and unique characters; you wanted to read what was going to happen to them next. The author was not afraid to show the flaws that her characters were dealing with and this made them all the more engaging to read about. I did not know much about what the lesbian community was like at this time and I found that I wanted to read more and learn about what this time was like after reading this book. I want to follow these characters into their futures and find out what happens to them. A great read.
"This was a great book that tackled a lot of important topics from the Asian American experience, queer experience, and the tough history within these experiences. I loved following Lily and Kath. Lo created some beautiful characters."
"Book came late and the front of the book jacket felt wet and greasy... even left grease spots on the inside of the book jacket. I'm a bit sad about that, but I'm excited to read it at least. Just upset that it came like this :/"
Amazing book to read. Was so good that I read it in one day. It was interesting to know how hard it must of been for the Lgbtq+ community back then. If you like sapphic stories and life in the 50s. This book is for you. Highly recommend!
"Saw the movie and thought the book would be better.  It's not, the young girl is so enamored while the older character has so much more going on that she can not put all or half of her focus into the relationship so it makes for a boring love and bland love story. I guess it's too realistic for readers that are looking for something more."
"I really do enjoy this book. Amazon keeps asking me to review it, and I can't seem to get them to stop bothering me about it until I write a review, so let me say this: I purchased The Price of Salt for my Kindle Fire, it wouldn't open. I tried to cancel the order and download it again and that wouldn't work either. So, in conclusion, the book itself is lovely. My copy of it for my Kindle Fire was not."
"Not my favorite Patricia Highsmith's novel. I guess I am more into her detective story novels. However, it's a decent read with an ending that's not nearly as dark as many of gay stories out there. I think I have now officially read all of Patricia Highsmith's books."
"I read about this book in another book -- The End of Your Life Book Club, by Wil Schwalbe. The author and his mother enjoyed The Price of Salt, and I did, too. The book is about a young woman coming of age dealing with her mixed feelings ... for her work ... for her boyfriend ... for the older woman she met. By the end of the book, I felt I knew them all. This was not my ""normal"" type of book. I decided to read it after reading the discussion about it in the previous book. It was worth the read."
"My comments are not about the author's work, but of the printer's.  I found the text very difficult to read, so much so I am trying another publisher.  The text looked like  multi-generation xerox that lost bits of letters along the way or maybe got damp and wrinkled - and then copied.  I hope this isn't what the future of publishing looks like."
"Fascinating time-warp of a novel by an excellent, deep-character-creating author.  Written in 1952, it takes place in a hidden sexual world hard to imagine today, but presented so realistically of its time that I bought it all.  Highly recommend that you find out about the publishing back story as well; that in itself is so reflective of the early '50s.  The more I got into the story/relationships, the faster I read.  A must read if you're into American  culture/sexual mores."
I thought the movie captured Carol so much better.  But I guess it would be hard to capture all the nuances the actress gave Carol as opposed to the book.  The book did not give Carol anything special .  The book was okay.  Although I will try to read The Talented Mr. Rippley since I only saw the book and I understand it's suppose to be a good work of writing.
Required reading for a literature course I am taking but this book is one that I find myself reading far past the assigned material every week!!! Great story line and apparently it's now a film?! Let's hope they don't butcher this book on film :(
This was an awesome book. The movie was good as well.  There is an interesting story behind Patricia Highsmith in relation to  Carol (The Price of Salt)
"""Salt"" is what brings out the flavor of life, and in the case of the love of Carol for Terese, it came at a high price: the loss of her child, her family, her wealth and reputation. Interesting that the reader experiences the emotional turmoil primarily through the nineteen-year-old Therese; and we are left to only imagine the angst of thirty-two -year-old Carol as she extricates herself from a loveless marriage and negotiates with the legal system to see her child ""once or twice a year."" Thankfully we are in the 21st century where the love of a woman for a woman or a man for a man is no longer considered an ""abomination;"" at least not in the socially evolved world. Beautifully written, painfully experienced, sweetly resolved."
"It means so much to me that this book was first published in a time when such things were unheard of. I think it should be required reading in schools. Absolutely lovely and deep characters, and story."
"In honor of the Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage, my book club read ""The Price of Salt"".  I don't think anyone put it down, although I'd say it started slowly. LGBT rights have come a long way in 65 years, although I'm sure there is a long way to go.  Still the book is worthwhile for anyone trying to hang on to their ""tried but untrue"" formula for happiness."
"This is a beautifully written book with a lilting flow and style that - while more complex than more contemporary works - is not so complex that it will intimidate the average reader. The hallmark of a good writer is one that enables the reader to clearly picture the characters and immediately empathize with them, even if the reader does not share the same experience as the characters. I believe this book should be considered a classic. Fans of Daphne DuMaurier should appreciate this book, as I feel Ms. Highsmith's writing style is very reminiscent of Ms. DuMaurier's. I also highly recommend the movie!"
"A landmark novel.  In this case the ""crime"" dealt with my Ms. Highsmith is the love between too women.I read it thirty years ago and have visited it many times since.I also recommend the film CAROL.  A perfect screen play and a perfect film."
"A beautiful novel which makes you feel the emotions of the characters.  So sad there was a time when people could not be accepted because of who they loved.  While there has been progress, and this book makes it clear, there is still so far to go."
"Set in Manhattan in the early 1950s, 

  
The Price of Salt









  
  
    
   takes the reader into a forbidden love between two women: one, Therese Belivet, a set designer, and a wealthy suburban wife and mother, Carol Aird.It is nearly Christmas in the year the two meet, when Therese was working as a temporary employee at Frankenberg’s, a department store. The author describes the first moments, as the two gaze across the room at one another…and then Carol approaches, followed by a shop transaction that takes place involving a delivery. Could something momentous be happening?It doesn’t take long before they are drawn together again, for a lunch, then drinks, and then a visit to Carol’s suburban home, and, at the very least, a friendship is developing. Carol and her husband are separated, and their daughter Rindy goes back and forth between them.Nothing overt happens between Therese and Carol, but within a few weeks, they are traveling across the country, toward the West…and their lives are changing dramatically.Meanwhile, Carol discovers something very sinister is happening, at the hands of her husband. Will the two be ripped apart? Will it be a question for Carol of losing her daughter?The intense and somewhat obsessive love between them could end; in any case, their lives could be altered moving forward. Wondering what will happen and if the societal expectations of the times will dictate the course of their feelings is a reminder, once again, of how times have changed and how stultifying the world once was. A timeless tale that could be about any kind of forbidden love, gay, straight, or otherwise…and was captivating in its ability to describe the longing of two people reaching across barriers to be together. 4.5 stars."
"In just her second novel, following Strangers on a Train, Patricia Highsmith took on the potentially risky story of a lesbian love affair.  It is the early 1950s and 19-year-old Therese, a would-be stage designer and temporary shop girl in Manhattan, falls for Carol, a beautiful and enigmatic customer some 15 years her senior.  Carol is a well-heeled housewife and mother from suburban New Jersey who plays things close to the vest.  The two circle each other, forge a friendship, take a road trip and become lovers.  The love affair at the heart of the story would have been more convincing if Terese were believable as a late teen.  Instead, she is dour, depressed and seemingly close in age to her lover.  The way the two women approach and withdraw, communicate openly and then manipulate each other emotionally, is tedious rather than revealing of character.In Strangers on a Train and the five Ripley novels, Highsmith showed a perversely impressive ability to get us to root for her criminal characters.  Perhaps because writing The Price of Salt was close to the bone for Highsmith owing to her own sexuality, her considerable talent shown in both prior and subsequent works, was not fully evident here.  The story has a satisfying --  and not punitive -- conclusion, though getting there doesn't quite fly.  The time frame  reads like six months and yet 19-year-old Terese is suddenly 21 at novel's end.  In the Ripley novels, time elapses while Tom Ripley doesn't seem to age.  If she was merely playing with the notion of time, she was more successful later in her career.  Still, the slightly older Terese at the end of the story seems for the first time to have the wherewithal to make a life for herself.  Had Patricia Highsmith written The Price of Salt after the Ripley novels, her gifts might have been fully on display and the entire journey of Terese and Carol well worth the ride."
"What could be more exciting than love at first sight? Carol, an exquisite looking, older NYC socialite, and Therese, an attractive counter girl at a NYC department store, are both immediately taken by each other. That is not particularly remarkable, except for the fact that the year is about 1950 and there is virtually no tolerance for such love.The story is told from Therese’s perspective and details her feelings, doubts, and joy as her relationship with Carol haltingly proceeds. Carol, with the most to lose, has to contend with others, including her husband, attempting to assail the status quo of her life. Most interesting is the several week long car trip that they take through the mid-West that is very critical to their relationship. However, the characters in this short novel could be better drawn.Slightly annoying are the many typos, misspelled and run-together words, and strange paragraphing in this book. The author has to be credited for a very perceptive treatment of a controversial topic some sixty-five years ago."
I absolutely love the feeling of this book. I think it really captured the feel of the 1950s. The characters were people you could relate to.  There was a feeling of foreboding throughout but surprise! I don't want to spoil it but really enjoyed the ending.
"Excellent read.  Plot and characters could be depressive, but they were complex and interesting.  I recommend to readers who enjoy deep stories that are not always joyful and light."
This book must have been a real ground breaker in 1952. I think the story is still very relevant today. I wish the movie had followed the book more closely. The main character is Therese. Its her story. She's the one that changes.
"I've always been intrigued by Patricia Highsmith, and this is the first book I've read from her.  To be very candid, I'm not exactly impressed.  I wanted to read re: Ripley, but the writing made me close down, so I moved on to another book, which invited me more.This is an intriguing story.  And surprisingly, Therese Belivet is the most intriguing character.  She has a strange history, and she is completely uncompromising, determined, and in love.  She is so much stronger than Carol.Carol is brave; tries to be brave, and her former lover, Abby, remains loyal.I wanted to be impressed with the writing.  And though I am convinced of Therese Belivet's passion, and even of Carol's fondness for Therese, the chemistry was spotty.And that is because the writing was stiff, rigid, and unenjoyable.  There was no fluidity, no intimacy.It's the fact that the book is a novelty rather than the caliber of the writing that elevated this book.Also re: this product:  the writing is absolutely minuscule.  Made it even harder to read."
"How many times have I read a book because first I saw the film (and yet how many times have I not)! The most recent example, Carol, starring Cate Blanchett in the titular role, inspired me to read the novel. I’ve read Highsmith’s work before: The Talented Mr. Ripley and Ripley Underground. I’m not sure, in spite of the awards won, that she’s ever been truly honored as a writer. The Price of Salt is not “just” a woman’s book or a “lesbian romance,” as some critics have suggested. The novel, originally published in 1952, portrays the story of two women who travel from New York to the West, and it heightens the ideal of love rather than diminishes it. Through its specificity of love between two women of a certain time period of a certain geography (ranging over two-thirds of the US), the novel creates a universality that is appealing across a vast number of readers.Depending on whom you read or side with, Highsmith’s title bears a biblical reference. It may either refer to Lot’s wife or Matthew 5:13. I prefer to think it is the latter: “‘You are the salt of the earth; but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltness be restored. It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trodden under foot by men.’” Could it be that Highsmith chooses to be quite specific, referring to Carol’s nefarious husband perhaps, when she suggests that a relationship without love might as well be stomped on by men? In chapter twenty-two Highsmith makes perhaps the most transparent reference to this idea of salt: “In the middle of the block, she opened the door of a coffee shop, but they were playing one of the songs she had heard with Carol everywhere, and she let the door close and walked on. The music lived, but the world was dead. And the song would die one day, she thought, but how would the world come back to life? How would its salt come back?” (225). Therese now believes that everything with Carol is over, but a small part of her also believes that the salt, the flavor, of their relationship shall in some way be restored. And she is right. The final paragraph, though it may be “romantic,” is certainly not sentimental (see below).Some nuggets:Therese senses a certain role she’s been playing with regard to Carol and their magical trip westward. “But at moments she felt like an actor, remembered only now and then her identity with a sense of surprise, as if she had been playing in these last days the part of someone else, someone fabulously and excessively lucky” (174).“Therese squeezed the wheel, then deliberately relaxed. She sensed a tremendous sorrow hanging over them, ahead of them, that was just beginning to reveal the edge of itself, that they were driving into. She remembered the detective’s face and the barely legible expression that she realized now was malice. It was malice she had seen in his smile, even as he said he was on no side, and she could feel in him a desire that was actually personal to separate them, because he knew they were together. She had seen just now what she had only sensed before, that the whole world was ready to be their enemy, and suddenly what she and Carol had together seemed no longer love or anything happy but a monster between them, with each of them caught in a fist” (199).“‘But the most important point I did not mention and was not thought of by anyone—that the rapport between two men or two women can be absolute and perfect, as it can never be between man and woman, and perhaps some people want just this, as others want that more shifting and uncertain thing that happens between men and women’” (221).And here is the final paragraph I mentioned before: “She stood in the doorway, looking over the people at the tables in the room where a piano played. The lights were not bright, and she did not see her at first, half hidden in the shadow against the far wall, facing her. Nor did Carol see her. A man sat opposite here, Therese did not know who. Carol raised her hand slowly and brushed her hair back, once on either side, and Therese smiled because the gesture was Carol, and it was Carol she loved and would always love. Oh, in a different way now, because she was a different person, and it was like meeting Carol all over again, but it was still Carol and no one else. It would be Carol, in a thousand cities, a thousand houses, in foreign lands where they would go together, in heaven and in hell. Therese waited. Then as she was about to go to her, Carol saw here, seemed to stare at her incredulously a moment while Therese watched the slow smile growing, before her arm lifted suddenly, her hand waved a quick, eager greeting that Therese had never see before. Therese walked toward her” (248-9)."
"I am not reviewing the book, just the printing.  There are a large number of errors in the printing of this book - ""&o"" instead of ""do"",  words incorrectly capitalized, wrong indentations.  Where is the quality control?"
Patricia Highsmith has ruined me. I will never be able to read another piece of fiction the same way ever again. I didn't know anyone could write the way she did. This book was beautiful and heartwrenching. I'm already looking forward to rereading it.
Best book I've read in ages. I'm so not a sucker for a love story.... But this was terrific. Should have read it years ago.
"I saw the movie and read the book, I enjoyed the book far more then the movie, only because it was like my own biography 57 years ago. I saw the movie three times, just to bring back that lifetime feeling.  My partner now has Alzheimer's disease and no remembrance of our past 54 years.  Thank you so much for making this so real to my real life."
"interesting to see the life situation of lesbian women in the 50's.  I read it after seeing the movie ""Carol"" to gain better understanding of life for these women in that era."
A relationship that evolves from a chance encounter to friendship to fascination to true love. What these two people are forced to endure because of their relationship is almost unbelievable. It makes me very happy about the recent Supreme Court decision regarding same sex marriage.
I loved the book. Tender and I have a feeling it was the author's own personal story. The subject matter may not be for everyone.
"I discovered this only because of the film Carol. It is a wonderful read, beautifully textured and subtly insightful with a great sense of truth and honesty underscoring the emotional life of the two lovers."
"Read this many, many years ago.  It's like part of my life-story."
I liked the book but not one I would read again. I thought it was interesting in its own way; well-written and I wanted to keep reading to see how it ended. You have to feel for the main character and how her life was growing up; without family etc. and may have a bearing on how she seem to follow Carol around and clinging to her out of emotional need that turned into a physical attraction.
"Very unlike Highsmith's other novels, of course, and originally written under a pseudonym at a time when writing a lesbian novel could be seen as a career killer, this novel is unlike all other lesbian fiction of the time period, in that it actually has a happy ending. Completely unheard of in the 1950s!"
"I fell in love with Carol the first time I watch the movie then I read the book... love it even more then I couldn't stop reading and watching Carol (the Price of Salt). Carol is a strong and independent character, as well as Therese although sometime she seems to be a bit immature but she is younger after all. If you love to read lesbian novel with age-gap genre you cannot miss this."
"I never write reviews but I wanted to make one not of the story, but of the actual physical book of the paperback copy I bought. DO NOT BUY IT! It's very poorly made and cropped all over. From the cover that is all pixelated from and back cover, to the print on the inside that looks like a poorly made scan of half a page with the smallest font that 3/4 of the page are blank. Very wasteful. Despite the price, it's not worth the buy."
gave these out for christmas-- all there copies have been well read and passed around-- would buy more of her books
Old fashioned page turner drama / lesbian romance.  I read the book in preparation for the upcoming movie.  It was a fast read.  A discreetly handled coming out story with a nice ending.
"I thought it was an excellent read, but it started a little slow. If you can hang in there, you'll be glad you did."
"In case you have forgotten how far we have come, here is the story to put it in perspective. A love story; love of life, love of coming of age, love for another woman, love of one's self. A delicate, sometimes slow, but tender anecdote about love conquering all."
It's a look into real human emotions about real people
CLASSIC
Highsmith is a great writer whose work is depressing to me.
great read
Great book
A beautiful vivid story of love and loss and hope.
Enjoyed this
Engaging easy read
"Very good condition, and very good book."
A really overlooked writer. Top notch.
A classic romance with the self. A rare literary achievement.
I wish I would have read the book before the movie came out. The movie really didn't do a good job of conveying the emotions of these two characters.
Great book!
Good read
"Well, the end certainly left me hanging.  Overall, the story was good and gave us a perpective of how it felt to be homosexual at a time when it was rarely known. But I expected a more definitive ending."
A good read.
No problems.
A melodramatic novel.
Saw the movie and decided to buy the book and happy I did.  A little slow at the beginning but a good read and comparable to the movie.
"Interesting, sophisticated perspective--ahead of its time in beliefs and awareness."
Great read. Looking forward to seeing the movie!
"Ms. Highsmith was a wonderful writer. This book is a good example of her artistry, I think. I would also recommend a volume of her collected stories, and certainly The Talented Mr. Ripley."
Boring
If you saw the movie Carol this is the book it was based  on and very well written !
"Huge fan, fantastic read. Quite different from the film adaptation."
"I decided to read the book after watching the film. I was pleasantly surprised and delighted at both. It makes you think about lust, love, and distance."
"Great read. Totally aborbing. Tense, exhilirating, warm, sweet and terrifying. In the end... I smiled. It will stay with me."
What a brave story for it's time and for all time. Vividly and poetically brought to life by a masterful writer.
"One of the greatest novels ever written, especially recommend for queer women."
This is a very sweet love story between 2 women.  My daughter and grandson are extras in the film so I wanted to read the story before the movie comes out. Easy read.
This book was exactly what I was looking and for and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
Great
It was just right
Incredible story. Can't wait to see the movie.
Amazing!
Absolutely loved it!
I'm in awe of Patricia Highsmith. This is everything and more. Thank you to Cate Blanchett for raving other wise I might never had read this after seeing the movie.
Excellent writing..I liked the book better than the movie
I liked the book but it was a little slow
Great read.
"I expected to find the story well written and thought provoking.  Unfortunately, I just couldn't get interested."
"I applaud the bravery of the author to write this work when she did, but to me, she fails to make either of the characters particularly likable. Their dialogue seems stilted ( I guess a reflection of the times) and the vacillation of each, in her own way, about the relationship seems shallow and self-involved."
"Well written, realistic and consuming  story.  Characters are richly drawn.  You feel the atmosphere of the 50's and 60's - courage before Stonewall"
Easy read
"The story is very slow to get started. The story is solid though, and the writing is not purple or overly sentimental.Therese (pronounced a la francaise) is a young woman making her way through New York, and life. Her boyfriend, Richard, is almost a stereotypically incapable man. I'm not sure if he's a good plot device or so incredibly bumbling in his romantic endeavors that he's a trope.Therese, either with the most undeveloped genius gaydar to exist or because she is extremely lucky, sends a card home with something that a rich woman buys for her child. They develop a relationship that is equal parts sweet and creepy. Carol is more than willing to take the role of Therese's absent mother in her life: she feeds her warm milk in bed, pays for her, drags her along on day trips and forces her to wear clothes she doesn't like. Therese is not opposed to this treatment."
"Not having seen the movie yet, I decided to read the book.  A unique and interesting read of a young girl coming into herself at the age is 21."
"Very, very slow start. I am hoping it gets better, but I was so bored with it I put it down in favor of another book."
"Two stars or three?  This book was written over half a century ago.  An early entry into the canon of women-loving-women literature.  Very dated as a result...I suppose one should interpret it as an example of living in more repressed times.  Still, emotions are presumably universal and the descriptions of the heroine's feelings are SO stilted, so clunky, it's quite a bore to read all the way through."
"I enjoyed the book...it kept my interest throughout, but it didn't offer anything I didn't expect.  As far as the people who edited it are concerned, I found a lot of typos without looking for them."
"This story is about 2 people who fall in love. It's a beautiful story and they made a movie out of it called ""Carol""."
"Though I'm a HUGE Annabeth fan (read ALL of her books) this one just wasn't for me. Somehow the plot and the characters simply didn't ""grab"" me. I felt like the road tripping itself (shifting drivers and getting lost) and the card game (including too many actual games) made this, well, boring.. I used to be into RPG (Role Playing Games) back in the day so I COULD relate and yet I totally couldn't because I don't know this game (or interested in it).Conrad Stewart seems like he has it all but it's all a front to a lonely life. He used to have a loving family, a promising start in college and a very active social life. What's left? Working in as many jobs as he can and playing ""Odyssey "". After coming out his family basically thrown him into the wolves leaving him with no way of paying college (so he dropped out) and barely a way to make things end enough for him to even feed himself. Two weeks on the road to get into an ""Odyssey"" convention seems like a waste of time and money but if he wins the big price he might FINALLY have means to support himself (while doing something he loves).Alden Roth looks to have won the jackpot of a family. Two extremely loving moms (and two older sisters) with a planned future as a doctor. But he hides how much his family's expectations is weighing on him. He hasn't been able to get into any program and after two years trying he doesn't feel like going through it again for a third. His moms are pushing him to make decisions concerning his future and all he feels like doing is hiding and playing ""Odyssey"" - one of the few if not only thing he feels he is good at. Though he has a group who plays ""together"" he struggles socially. The guys don't really like him - especially not Conrad but the convention might be his way out. Winning big can change his future! Though it might not be the kind his family ""approves"" of, at least they are happy he is going with friends.. (though they don't know they aren't really).Both guys has MANY assumptions on one another and being together on the road (just the two of them) allowed them to get to know each other and see they actually have quite a lot in common. They feel stuck with no-where to go for totally different reasons. Both putting up a front to be able to ""play the game"" - the Odyssey as well as the game of life. They don't have it all together, they don't know how to build their future and what it would look like and they are both extremely lonely even when there are people around them.I would have loved seeing how they attempt to figure things out together and the impact their opposite personalities each has on one another but the story dragged and I was just not into it anymore. It was in a way quite repetitive - driving while arguing about food/taking the wrong turn and general ""rules"" Alden has that Conrad couldn't care less about (like not eating in the car) and gaming in the shops around their route. They DID start to open up, their conversations on the road WAS the relationship buildup but the ""surrounding plot"", for me, left the story feeling flat.There is one thing I want to mention and I don't know how to write exactly certainly because it's my personal opinion and I don't know if anyone else would see it this way... Conrad was annoyed with Alden A LOT. Actually I was annoyed as well but not for the same reasons.. See, Alden is said to have ""neurological problems"" but seeing the way he behave he feel quite clearly (to me) on the Autistic Spectrum though high functioning, something like Asperger (not sure it's labeled this way currently).  For anyone NOT knowing how much of a problem he has with certain issues (like how strict he is in routines and adjusting to situations he hasn't predicted) he might feel EXTREMELY annoying and at times self centered. He is NOT. He is having the struggle of his life dealing with this journey. Yeah he willingly went but it doesn't mean it's not hard! But since Conrad wasn't truly aware he has this problem (he just saw him as being ""stuck up"") I was frustrated as well with the whole thing. I truly think that if he would have KNOWN, the whole feel of the story would have been different (for him but for me as well). I understand that the fact they are ""rivals"" on and off the game is the whole point of this book but this issues still rubbed me the wrong way.I stopped reading at 36% where both are still on the road to the convention. There is much still to happen but I felt like it's becoming too much of a struggle. There is a lot I haven't said about this book (especially about the group they are playing in and who their journey together came to be) but I don't think it's the main issue so I decided to leave it out. Sorry Annabeth I'll catch up on your next book (I already have pre-ordered).More @ Ultra Meital Reviews."
"While I may have SOME biases when it comes to Conventionally Yours, I can honestly say that the book is a delight. Conrad and Alden are multifaceted and intensely likable. Their romance has an aching, tender sort of yearning to it--combined with the high-stakes nature of their road trip to the Odyssey card game convention/tournament and the conflict that arises when both of them not only want, but for their own reasons, NEED, to win.I could echo a great deal of what other people have said about this book: that Conrad and Alden are delightful, that the research and the road trip/locations is pleasingly evident and true to life, that the con and road trip experience is one that is clearly lived and loved, that issues like neurodiversity, homophobia, and class differences are addressed (but not slogged through) with a deft hand. So I will! I will say all those things. But I’d also like to elaborate on a few things I have not seen as many reviewers touch on.Other reviewers have mentioned technical aspects of card games and gaming that are featured throughout, either to say that those areas of the story rang true to them or seemed to slog a little. It’s not a topic that’s for everyone—I personally tried Magic the Gathering myself once and I found myself overwhelmed and, honestly, kinda bored. But while I myself have never been particularly into card games, the portrayal of the fictional game, Odyssey, and the fan culture surrounding it rings true to me as a participant in other areas of fan culture. Am I into cards and card games? No, not really. But I like other things! I have that enthusiasm for other areas of fandom. I recognize its base cause: that genuine love and investment in something, even if I myself don’t share it in that same outlet. The opposite is one I’ve seen too many times—tryhard, wink-wink nudge-nudge, often self-effacing and near-apologetic portrayals of geek culture in fiction is something that I’m hyper-aware of when it comes to works that market itself as appealing to those spaces/audiences. In my opinion, they often miss the mark. They can feel either awkward (""How do you do, fellow kids? Video games, am I right?""), or transparently pandering (""Now we will reference Cool Modern Thing/Cool Retro Thing that the reader will recognize for cheap fan brownie points""). I’m delighted to say that’s not the case here. And when it comes to the convention itself, it felt like conventions I’ve been to over the years. There are occasional eccentrics and outright jerks, but most of the time, it’s just a gathering of a bunch of people who love the same thing and want to share that love with others.Another point I want to elaborate on: secondary characters are well-rounded and likable—and if not likable, at least believable and resonant. One of the secondary characters that stands out to me most vividly is Payton. Payton has flaws: Payton is blunt, an unrepentant partygoer, a gossip, often blasé. Payton is also nonbinary. Not only is it a delight seeing an unapologetic or didactic portrayal of a nonbinary person in fiction (There is no hand-holding aside about Payton's identity or pronouns; they simply are presented without comment and the writing trusts you to either accept it or Google what you don't understand), but it is a delight to see a nonbinary character that is their own person and not an idealized token. In cases of representation, sometimes it seems like characters in underrepresented or marginalized identities are ""too perfect"" or ""pure"" in an effort to portray them in a positive light—in ways that ultimately end up further othering them or putting them on unnecessary pedestals. Payton is a PERSON, first and foremost. They are not perfect. They are human. And that means a great deal to me as a nonbinary reader.For anyone looking for a lighthearted-but-not-shallow, occasionally-niche-but-not-alienating, sweet and sometimes-sexy romance in the New Adult/Romcom genre, I would definitely recommend Conventionally Yours."
"Things I really enjoyed about this book:- the way the enemies to lovers progression occurred;- that it was actually enemies to friends to lovers;- the incredibly clever game universe created for this story;- that a character's neurodiversity wasn't glossed over or glorified;- the pacing of the story;- I genuinely liked the MCs and the dual narration really helped me understand Alden and Conrad so much better; and,- all the secondary characters were interesting and not just copy paste facsimiles of secondary charactersI'll be really interested in hearing the narration of this book as I feel between Kirt Grave and Joel Leslie Froomkin they'll add additional layers of nuance to these characters and this story.I'll be looking out for the next books in this series. A solid 4 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐ for me."
"Annabeth Albert is a wonderful author and she was so kind to put this gem on sale so I grabbed it :) This is a wonderfully charming and sweet book with adorkable characters, gaming adventure and road trip. Conrad is the boy next-door type with a charming and charismatic personality. He is popular and seems to have it all on the surface. Unfortunately, Conrad is running on his last leg of luck because everything bad seems to be happening all at once. Not only does he have to figure out how to keep a roof over his head, but now he has to deal with his enemy, Alden, who games with him and gets on his nerves.Alden seems to have everything under control, ambitious, brilliant, and hates Conrad. He and Conrad always clash over Odyssey at their weekly games. What people don't seem to realize is that he has anxiety and feels a little broken inside. His perfectly planned future by his moms is going nowhere and he has no idea what he wants to do. Alden wants to win the Odyssey tournament to prove to his moms that gaming could be a future for him.Needless to say, both men are less than thrilled when they discover that the other is joining the cross-country road trip and have to deal with each other in the same car. It sounds like the beginning of a miserable journey but along the way, they bond and quickly grow closer. This is a sweet and adorkable enemies-friends-to lovers cross-country road trip. I don't game but I do enjoy conventions and meeting other people so this was a perfect read for me to re-live my Dragon Con trip :) I'm so excited to hear that Jasper's story will be released in 2021 and I can't wait to read it because he needs his HEA :)"
"Conventionally Yours by Annabeth AlbertContemporary romance. M-M. Enemies to lovers troupe. Alternate chapters POV.I expected the whole to be at a convention but this story starts much earlier with friends playing games together where they live and their lives changing as they travel together to Vegas and the ultimate convention for the gamers.The friendship grows as their time on the road continues. Each allows a bit more of themselves and their situations to be shared. They deal with past hurts and uncertain futures and what will get them through today. The card games they play and the people they meet along the way is a bit of a metaphor for their lives. That’s stretching for me because as a general rule I don’t read beneath the surface.The book has surprising depth as Conrad realizes, or at least acknowledges his pain and anger at his father and mother’s rejection of him.Surprising for me, I loved their growth, their realizations and healing.Not surprisingly, I also loved the HEA.  Because romance is my jam. I will give a warning that this book is very heavy on gaming strategy but don’t let that get in the way of the relationships or romance.🎧I listened to an audiobook version which was done by two narrators from the different POV’s. There voices were similar but just different enough to tell which character was up. They both did a good job with tension and other emotional stress.I purchased the version I listened to but I do have to thank the publisher for a paperback copy a few years ago that I just never had time to read. Good romance read @Sourcebooks and @DreamscapeMedia."
"Conrad and Alden are part of an LGBT gaming group for a card game called Odyssey. They gained some notoriety on social media because of their brilliant play and antipathy towards each other. When they both score tickets to a Con in Las Vegas, it could mean big changes in one of their lives as well as a chance to get on the pro circuit. Both guys have reasons to want to win, but the only way to get there is a road trip from the East Coast.This is a sweet slow-burn romance with a nice twist at the end. Both Conrad and Alden are misunderstood and seem to be opposite personalities. It's fun to read how their car trip across the country allows them to become friends and then more than friends. It's not a flashy romance, but this is a solid story set in a world not often explored in romances (gaming). I admit I thought it was going to be more League of Legends than Magic: the Gathering before starting to read, but either way it was just fine. The author does a nice job of explaining the Odyssey game without being too complicated for newbies.Alden and Conrad are a lovely couple and complement each other in so many ways. I especially like how they build each other up and encourage each other. Alden has anxieties and Conrad has a bad life situation, yet they take care of each other in so many subtle and overt ways. It's very sweet. All in all, a lovely read."
"As I was finishing ""Boyfriend Material"" I spotted an ad for this book; being a fan of m/m love stories, rom coms, and all things nerdy, this book seemed like a perfect match for me. It truly was. I DEVOURED this book, desperately turning pages, anxious to find out what would happen next. The two main characters--Conrad and Alden-- were both super likable;  I was drawn more to Alden. Though not Jewish, I suffer from anxiety like he does, so I know what it's like to  constantly be stressing about the small things and to have everyone think you're bossy and stuck up when in truth you're just trying to keep order in the chaos of your brain. The story takes over  week or so, but the budding romance between the ""sworn enemies"" comes to fruition realistically organically, and I found myself rooting for them as a couple more than I have for a book couple since Arthur and Ben in ""What If It's Us?"" I would definitely love to see this adapted into a movie, even an indie flick. This is the first gay themed book I've read that included a non-binary character; I'm all for inclusion so that's an extra brownie point for the author. One of my favorite things about this book was the illustrations. Illustrations are usually hit or miss with me, but I felt like the ones included added to the story and were used appropriately. I'm hoping that we'll get more adventures with Conrad and Alden in the future."
"2020 has been a bit of a year, and one of the things I miss most is going to conventions to spend time with fellow readers and writers and gamers. Even though my gaming is mostly on the computer, the social aspect mixed with the competition is familiar enough to me that this book sucked me in and didn’t let go. The card game Albert develops for this book is simple enough to not turn off those unfamiliar with collectible trading card-based games while also being sufficiently in-depth to bring real drama to the gaming scenes.The trick is how well Albert mixes the gaming itself with the mental and emotional states of the point of view characters, whether Cam or Alden. Their gaming styles are even aspects of their characterization that heighten the relationships between the men. While not exactly “enemies” at the start, their gaming styles clash enough to show how they obviously would never work, despite any fleeting moments of attraction that might prove otherwise.But in the same way that a road trip can make or break an established relationship, the cross-country road trip to a gaming convention is precisely what’s needed for Alden and Cam to develop a bond outside of the gaming table. Secrets are inevitably revealed, and I couldn’t help but cheer whenever the characters grew closer. This is one of those books where some of the plot points are entirely predictable (only one bed in the hotel room! They have to face off against each other at the gaming tournament!). However, by this point, I cared enough about the characters and their developing relationship to enjoy the journey immensely.The ultimate ending is not entirely as predictable as you might think, and it’s all the more satisfying for it. My biggest quibble is that a significant amount of the “comedic” aspect of this romantic comedy appeared to come from the unique way in which Alden sees the world and his different reactions to things. Cam is never anything but supportive, and there is absolutely no subplot of anyone trying to “fix” a neurodiverse character, but some moments just happened to fall flat for me. Other readers may have vastly different experiences, and I still highly recommend this book to anyone looking for gamers living their best lives (with a bonus happily ever after)."
"Alden and Conrad have been gaming rivals over the years of playing Odyssey with the gaming group one of their college professors have put together. Who also post the games on his YouTube channel, Gaming Grandpa. Alden thinks Conrad is a typical college student. Partying every night and getting by in his classes. Conrad thinks Alden is a privileged stuck up know it all. Following in the footsteps of his moms and becoming a doctor. Little do they both know, they are both incorrect about each other. Conrad is struggling to stay in school after he was kicked out by his parents for being gay. Alden's dreams are completely different than what his moms want for him. Plus he struggles with social anxiety and just fitting in. But when Professor Tuttle gets tickets for them to compete in a gaming competition in Vegas, they can't refuse. It's the perfect escape for both of them. So they agree to road trip together to said convention. Along the way, they open up to each other and realize they are not much different.Most of the book is the guys road tripping and just getting to know each other. I'm not a gamer, but Annabeth Albert wrote in the game perfectly to where you can understand the just of it and don't get bored in the book where they are gaming. I was worried about that. But it's done perfectly. And the book centers mostly on Alden and Conrad's relationship. Which I appreciate very much. It was fun and cute and I loved the little illustrations in the book. So cute.If you are looking for somewhere to start as far as MM Romance. I highly recommend this book. It's a very light MM Romance."
"Sweet, wholesome, and lovely! I'm a big fan of tabletop games and gaming/comic-book stores, so it was easy to fall in love with the characters' story and their journey from semi-stardom with their roles in their friendly gaming vlog to playing with the ""big boys"" in a major gaming convention on the other side of the country.As a parent of a child on the autism spectrum, I sympathized with Alden right off the bat. And as someone who has had to decide between eating and paying for medicine, I sympathized with Conrad just as much. Both had nearly as much to lose as they did to win.I rooted for both guys equally from the rocky start to their road trip, their romance blossoming at each stop, all the way to the Con at the end, and throughout every Magic-the-Gathering-esque tabletop battle in between.A charming, geeky story with an endearing cast of characters and a satisfying HEA. Loved it!"
It’s a good story and has a lot to teach us about acceptance and not judging a book by it’s cover. It’s also a sweet love story. The characters are all good. It’s also long enough that it doesn’t seem like boom they’re in love. They get to know each other and it’s a nice relaxing read. I enjoyed it.
"I definitely enjoyed this story! The road trip was my favorite part. I loved seeing Conrad and Alden together and see how their interactions and opinions and feelings changed throughout the story. One of my favorite parts was the photo booth, so simple and sweet. I’m not a gamer but was able to follow along well enough to not be bored with that aspect of the story."
"I enjoyed this cute gaymer romance! The characters felt realistic and fleshed out, and they paired well together. At times the pacing was a bit slow for me, but the engaging characters kept me reading. The story also almost veered multiple times into a romance trope that I LOATHE and always feels forced just to create conflict, but it steered clear at the right moment so YAY! :)"
"3 stars!I wanted to like this one more than I actually did. It was incredibly boring and I found the circumstances of the trip to be less organic than I would have liked.I did like the ending it was cute.Overall, an ok story but not the best I've read."
"This book was fantastic! It started off a bit slow, took a few chapters to really get in there and see where the story was going. Once it started going, it was like a rollercoaster of emotions and feelings. It was very well thought out, the character development was superb. Cant wait to read any other books by this author!"
Loved the writer's character development they were complex but relatable.  I know nothing of the gaming world and enjoyed being given a glimpse through this  book.  I truly loved the authors ending and the characters growth.
"Some of Annabeth Albert's best work. I thoroughly enjoyed this story, and I loved that sex took a bit if a backseat. I felt it left more room more relationship & character development and the story definitely benefited. I'm looking forward to book 2!"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Alden and Conrad are such total opppsites with so much back story (family issues, esteem issues etc )that really powered the plot. I loved the idea of the road trip and the finale in Vegas. And the artwork. A great touch. And just steamy enough!!"
"Wonderfully written,believable characters.Great book to share with people who are trying to understand LGBTQIA+ relationships, also the world of gaming."
Sweet story about adversaries to lovers with some serious subjects mixed in. The author does a great job dealing with some more serious topics. This book isn't high on action/adventure but A++++ on compassion.
"Technically new adult, but felt like young adult.  We had two mid-twenties protagonists but it really didn't feel like it.  Also:  the romance was just ""meh"":  ""we totally hate each other... hey he's kind of cute... let's be super-nice to each other while angsting.""  It's a shame, because the opening scene (where the protagonist was narrating the game he was playing but as if he was actually living it) had real promise.I listened to the audiobook and it really depended on the actors providing depth to the text.  Had I read it, I think I would have abandoned it.I realise that I'm talking myself down from a three star ""okay"" review!"
i thought this book was very sweet and worth a read. the characters were great but the plot was a little lack luster but i considering i suck at creative writing im not overly qualified to complain. also im 16 and probably would recommend to anyone much older than me.
"Here we have a group of card playing guys that occasionally meet to play and record a popular vlog run by their teacher.Alden and Connor are our MCs. Since they first met each other they didn't fit: Connor is a complete extrovert while Alden has 0 social skills. Alden is too direct for all of them, and Connor feels like he belittles him with every comment and correction he makes. At the same time, Alden kind of envies Connor's easygoing attitude and secretly admires his ability to improvise.One day, Professor Tuttle, the creator of their vlog, tells them he has tickets for a convention all of them want to attend. Tickets are not cheap and that's a opportunity no one wants to let go. But not everything is easy... Alden can't fly and Connor, even though no one them is aware of his situation, is nearly homeless and doesn't have much money to spend. When the Professor suggest road tripping so that they can stop in different game shops to create content in their way to Vegas, our guys are not sure that's a good idea. Is the con worth the pain of being trapped together in a car for days and days?The answer is yes, and so their journey begins.I'm not going to say more about the story from here on because this was barely they first chapters and you should discover what happens to them while reading. Obviously, both Alden and Connor will have the chance to further know each other and will discover they are not who the other expected.Closeness and getting to know their real shelves will change things between them and their trip to Vegas will not be as they imagined. What's really important? Winning? Enjoying life? That's something they will have to decide.This kind of couples do it for me. Not gonna lie. I love how open Connor is, how supporting and easy to be with. And I love even more the awkward and insecure Alden. It's a powerful mix that works so very nicely.Seeing them go from sworn enemies to start being affected by the other's proximity, to start noticing how cute they are and wanting to touch, kiss and to be an emotional support... That's what made this story so cute.Also, this was not only about two guys falling in love. It was about facades and what we think of other's lives vs. reality. It was about not being perfect, about families, about good and bad parenting. It was about deciding our future, about discovering what we like and what we'd love to do in the future.If you are looking for a sweet read with charming characters, you should check this one. I'm definitely reading the next one. I'm waiting for it to get to my home and I'm reading Jasper's story as soon as it's on my hands."
"Conventionally Yours was really quite sweet. The 2 main characters Alden & Conrad are both guilty of assuming they know the other and making judgements on those assumptions, when they really don't know each other at all. Conrad appears more confident of the 2 but really he is hiding his troubles and worrying about where his future is headed.Spending time together as they travel to a Convention to compete in a gaming tournament is really quite the eye opener for them both, and their attraction to each other grows quickly. Alden is so endearing, he really grew on me across the storyline as his personality starts to shine more. He is an over thinker and gets anxious very easily, but he was so sweet and supportive of Conrad.Couldn't resist upgrading to the audio once I saw the narrators - I enjoyed the performance of both narrators, Kirt Graves and Joel Froomkin made for a very easy listen."
"Diese 'Young adult' Geschichte macht Spaß und reißt mit, vor allem, wenn man den 'enemies to lovers' Erzählstrang mag und gerne 'road trips' liest. Auch für Fans von Sammelkarten-Spiele wie Magic ist das Buch von Interesse. Die beiden Hauptcharaktere sind extrem liebenswert und sehr detailliert beschrieben, auch ihre Gefühlswelt. Das ist der einzige Wermutstropfen: Der Leser weiß immer genau, was in den  Charakteren vorgeht, haarklein. Aber der Stil von Annabeth Albert ist kurzweilig und flüssig, ohne je platt zu werden. Im Gegenteil, das Buch ist außerdem sehr durchdacht und gut recherchiert. Die Entwicklung wirkt auf jeden Fall glaubwürdig. Eine absolute Empfehlung."
Little too much gaming and totally predictable but cute and inclusive. The characters bonding over empathy for each other’s imperfections was lovely. This was a nice story
Loved this book! So happy with how it played out and was written. The way the characters grew and took on the challenges they faced was awesome. Can’t wait for the next one!
Pleasant and light reading. Nice plot interesting way of writing and cute characters. There are some cliches but I would recommend it. Read it within 3 days
This book was part of the Christmas present for my granddaughter.  She has read it and liked it very much.
"I literally loved this book! Didn‘t want it to end. The characters were so lovable, especially Aden won me over immediately."
"This book is a religious experience. There's no other way to put it. Sierra's writing is so fantastic, nothing else even comes close. The journey for Aiden and Elijah, but mostly Aiden, had me weeping hysterically at times. And even though I knew they would end up together, that's not what the story is truly about, it was just such a satisfying end. I loved this book more than I can even describe. A million bagillion stars!"
I’m amazed about all the research Sierra Simone had to do to make this hot little number! I also admire how respectful this novel is to monks/Catholics/priests but still is hot as hell. I loved Aiden and Elijah’s story. The MM relationship was so raw and natural and beautiful and sexy. I loved the concept of monks making beer 🍺. It was so original and Aiden’s torment leaped off the page.Sierra Simone is an automatic I will read everything she writes and this one was another winner!
"OMG! this book was awesome and sensitive and teary and all the feels.You never knew which way the story was going to take you and truthfully, it didn’t matter because it was going to end the way it was going to end.Being on this journey with Aiden and Elijah was spiritual (for me), loving and breathtakingly beautiful .I loved this series in all its honesty and I would most definitely recommend."
"I loved the previous books but this book is Perfection! Absolute Perfection!! This is the best of the entire series!! It takes you on a beautiful journey of sacrifice and a live  that transcends both in love and life. This is such a testament to love, acceptance and bravery.Even if don’t normally read M/M this would be an amazing book for you. I can’t say enough how beautiful this book is. Aiden will make you fall I. Love with him and his devotion both to God and his love for Elijah. You will feel such contentment and satisfaction with the journey through this book and the appreciation for monks and beer! The acceptance they receive are what I wished the world would do the same."
"Absolutely loved the story of Aiden Bell! He and Elijah were made for each other.  I'm so glad for the way things worked out.  Sierra, we definitely need a story about Father Jordan!  I mean seriously!  I lift my eyes to the hills.  That alone warrants a book about him!!! I would also like to know Ryan better, the last bad boy Bell!!!  I love your writing Sierra.  I love your books like everything!!!!"
"It was through booktok that I came to hear about Sierrra Simone and her book Priest. I gave it a chance because everyone raved about the alter scene.What I did not expect was to fall in love with Bell brothers and their journey. And I can say with confidence that my love for Tyler has been replaced by my love for Aiden.Aidens story brought tears to my eyes and touched a part of my soul. His journey with mental illness shadowed my own. But I also envy his love and devotion to Elijah and it made my heart soar to see him be able to follow his vocation and realize that Elijah would always be an important part of his life.Where Tylers and Seans story was a whirlwind of lust turned love. With Aiden we experience what love is once you've known the person. How intimate, romantic, but also filled with lust it can be. By far my favorite of the trilogy."
"WOW!!! Saint is emotionally exhausting, in a good way. A slow burn story with so many facets of character, plot and depth. I couldn't put it down, but forced myself to slow down because I didn't want it to end. Sierra Simone has created  a vivid, heart wrenching world with such grace and eloquence that I feel my words of admiration fall woefully short. 10 stars, must read!!!"
"I’ve been patiently waiting for Aiden and Elijah to come to life. And this was well worth the wait. This book was beautifully crafted from start to finish. And, yes, though there are the hot moments, it’s Aiden’s struggles that hit me in the heart. So many of us can relate. So, thank you for those beautiful words. You amaze me with every book you write."
"I did not think that Saint was going to be able to live up to Sean's story in Sinner, but boy was I wrong!!! This story made me laugh and cry and holy daaaaaayum......is it fantastic. Everything about Aiden's journey and his relationship with Elijah is layered, nuanced, intimate and of course it is HOT AF!!! Love, love, love this story!!!"
"I cannot put into words the depth and beauty of this story. As a person who has lived with lifelong depression, and has carried “it” along for many years, this resonates deeply with me.This is a must read if you want beautiful characters in exquisitely written prose and places you can almost feel around you."
Wieder ein tolles Buch innerhalb der Serie. Sehr bewegende Geschichte.
As usual the author gives us heat and conflict with personal choice. I love that her books give hope because they do not have to be happily ever after but they are.
This is one of the best series I’ve read. Made me laugh and cry all though the books. If I could have given these books more stars I would. If you love a series that keeps your intrigued this is the one to read. Will miss Patrick and the rest of the characters. Thanks for all the great books you gave us can’t wait for more!
"This series is amazing and this book was a perfect ending. Everything was wrapped up nicely and the characters can finally live in peace! And for a mythology nerd like me, this whole series made me feel like a cat rolling in a patch of catnip. It. Was. Perfect. Best urban fantasy series I've ever read."
"Wow. Great story and end of an amazing series.Everything leads up to the epic fight that Patrick always knew was coming. Patrick, Jono, Sage, and Wade have to hold the line against the Hells so that Patrick can finally pay his soul debt.  The stakes are high but the cost is is even higher."
"A fitting end to the story of Patrick, the  pack, and the Gods of Heaven and Hell.  A new beginning for them all with the end of Dominion, and theirs to live as they choose.There are no words to describe the series's brilliance of story telling and mythology.  Gods, demons, heroes, legends, and virtually no culture, faith, or storyline left behind.  Characters familiar and new come alive once again to be remembered as the legends they are with new stories and a new faithful."
"This really has been an amazing series, I'm sad to see it end. This series has so many ups and downs and this book is no exception. Epic battle made for t.v., great characters. I do hope we get a little bit of Happily Ever After novella for the pack and friends though.."
Not the ending I was expected so much unhappiness and the epilogue was just okay. I was hoping for so much better for Patrick after all he gave there is no way after it all would his sole ever light the death of his sister and mother would weight forever
Saying this book was exceptional would be an understatement. This book tied everything together and even though we lost a few along the way the end was absolutely wholesome. A wonderful ending to a fantastic series. Well done Hailey Turner
"I laughed and cried at parts of this. Stayed up too late reading it over two days. I didn't enjoy it as much as the first 6 probably, Pat was lacking some snark maybe not as bad ass as usual. The character seemed tired which fits the story. Enjoyed the series more than this individual book. Overall the series was great!"
I love this series. This was a good ending to an awesome series. I do wish we had got to see Patrick interacting with his family after his return and I am sad Setsuna died right as they were starting to understand each other.
"I thoroughly enjoyed this series and the latest book is no exception.  I couldn't put it down.  I know the current character pair's story is at an end, but I'm hoping that the other characters get stories too in the future."
An Amazing and enjoyable series by Hailey Turner. I am glad that I picked up this book. It was Incredible. All books in this Series are.I Cannot Recommend this book and this Series enough. A Must read for all Readers.
This book was an amazing conclusion to the series. This book was everything I would hoped it would be and so much more. I’m so glad that Patrick and Jono get to live their lives for themselves and with their pack.
"Oh wow what an epic ending to an epic seriesThis is not a standalone, and I’d also say rereading the first six books might be a good idea.This book, and this series, shines when Patrick and Jono are together.I don’t know how to review this without spoilers so I’ll simply say: read the entire series and prepare for a saga fit for a modern mythological adventure. But this one is a romance. Oh and it has a dragon."
"I loved it! Hands down, it was all that I wanted it to be! All the loose ends were tied and Jono and Patrick got their HEA. The road was a whole lot thornier this time but they made it! What an adventure this series has been! I am a little sad I have to say goodbye to my favorite snack eater Wade and Sage the best dire, but most of all I will miss Patrick and Jono's shenanigans and their love. I enjoyed the magic, the intrigue and the mystery that were the Gods. Unputdownable! Copy received for my honest and unbiased review."
"This is a splendid end to a spectacular series. It’s jammed packed with action, gods, goddesses and monsters and both Jono, Patrick and the rest of their pack has to fight to keep the world from ending - and try their hardest to keep themselves from dying in the midst of it.Hailey Turner manages to write a book that gives off the feeling of an end. That’s not to say there couldn’t be side projects (give me some more Spencer and Wade, please!), but this is the end for this show and she writes it magically.It’s hard to give a review without giving spoilers and every reader of this series deserves to read the book without having to guess from reviews. But (of course!), it takes its twists and turns - some you might have guessed, some you would never have seen coming.Love and sacrifice. Hate and self entitlement. Arrogance. Belief. Relief. The books moved through the feelings of it all and every important character gets an ending - whether happy, bittersweet or just merely an end.If you haven’t read the Soulbound series yet, now is a great time to start.Personally, as someone who has swallowed both The Metahuman Files and The Soulbound series, I am eagerly awaiting the next masterpiece from this author.ARC received for an honest review."
"All Hail-ey!!! This series has been nothing short of incredible. I cannot begin to tell how much I have loved these books. From the different gods and goddesses to the villains and demons, the description of magic and the way it works, to the plot and pacing, the story arc and the love between Jono and Pat - this series is truly  a work of art.“When you stab someone, pulling out the knife doesn’t fix the wound left behind.”  The response - “Then make sure the wound is deep enough to kill.” This quote is so succinct and on point in describing this series of books!Unlike so many in the MM paranormal genre, this series isn't focused on the love of the main characters but rather by the plots and action around them. Their love has been a slow burn in a unique way. Pat's journey to being loved and loving Jono has been a steady and wonderful thing, so believable and touching. Both of their issues were not glazed over by insta-love but rather explored and explained all while their hectic action driven lives didn't pause for them to breathe.I am sorry that this is the last in the series....Pretty Please could you do a spin off on Wade's character. I LOVE that food guzzling, attitude driven, clueless, adorable, heartbreaking, terrifyingly powerful teen dragon. He has a story I would kill to read. I can imagine a prequel explaining his trafficked days to further stories of where he goes after the end of the last Soulbound Book!!!So very highly recommend this series!!!! Thank you Hailey."
"I came to this series late, and read the first 5 books straight off. It totally sucked me in and I've loved every minute of it!A definite 5 ⭐and I would've given it more if I could.This is the perfect ending for the series. Everything has been so, so well written, and the world building  first class. As I've read each story, I've felt like I understood every characters' decisions and thoughts. Hailey Turner has created a beautiful, magical, sometimes harsh world for the reader to enjoy. So many emotions experienced! The stories have also been meaningful and touched on some big issues in life. Through the characters, it's clear that not everyone is good or evil, life's just not that straightforward. It makes you think about real life, and how people treat others. I'll miss Patrick, Jono and Wade (mustn't forget Wade!), so much. Bravo Ms Turner."
"For seven books we have been waiting to see if Patrick and Jono will finally defeat Ethan and The Dominion Sect, what happens to Hanna,  does Patrick finally tell Jono he loves him,  does Patrick pay his soul debt or will he still owe the Gods, who is the character that gets killed off (we had been teased about this before this book came out) , is Wade even not eating and does Patrick ever make it finally to Maui. All these question and a lot more are answered in this book.It wraps up this brilliant series beautifully. I loved this series from the very first few pages in the first book. I will miss Patrick, Jono, Wade and all the other. I can thoroughly recommend this series."
"Simply amazing 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟. I took as long as I could to read it, but all good things must eventually come to an end 😕. Thank you Patrick, Jono, Wade [God of Snacks] and every other fictional [and non-fictional] character that made this series such a compelling read, but most of all thanks to Hailey Turner. I may not have enjoyed your Metahuman series, but you absolutely knocked this one out of the park.New series The Infernal War Saga, The Prince's Poisoned Vow already pre-ordered."
"This was one of the very best series I’ve read and the ending did it complete justice. Nothing was left to wonder about what did this or that person do, it was beautifully written for you. I can understand why it took years to complete, but you should definitely be extremely proud of this fantastic story, it’s even better than the Metahuman files. I’m quite sad to let this book go as it was an absolutely  brilliant book, don’t miss out"
Great book with great characters. One of the greatest cute meets ever. Laughed my ass off.
I was delightfully surprised at how good this book was...the depth and complexity of the plot and characters kept my interest through the entire book. Lots of surprises without stereotypical characters. I want to read more of this author.
possibly the best written book in the history of the world.
"I really loved how this shifters story unfolds... It was like being in a dream, humans being a part of a park and working together, bonding  is so unconventional but this book made it right, amazing and adventurous... I loved being a part of this adventure."
This book gave me tears.. lots of epic funny moments and a sigh of finally ! I loved this book!
This series is awesome and made me feel all the feelings!
"This book was so wonderfully written that it was hard to put down and remember real life going on around me. Klune knows how to spin a tale to leave you so satisfied, yet wanting more and more. I think I might have steadily cried through most of this book! Oh, but it was worth it. I cannot wait to see what comes next for the pack."
Best book I've read in a long time.  Full of heart wrenching emotion and unexpected joy.  The only thing bad about this book was that it ended.  Loved loved loved!
"This wasn't just a werewolf story! It's been a very long time since I read a love story that could make me laugh one minute and cry the next. Congratulations to the author on pulling this off. I don't get emotional about much of anything, but you accomplished it!"
"I love love love this book!!! It has it all, it made me laugh and cry!"
Another great book and great read from T. J. Klune.  I hope there will be sequel.
"I wasn't familiar with TJ Klune before Wolfsong showed up in my recommended list. I suspected what it would be like after reading the description and I thought it just might break my heart. Klune's writing is poetry in the best possible way. And it will make you feel. I don't know how many kleenexes I went through while reading this. Every time Ox hurt, I hurt. Every time he cried, I cried. But there was laughter, too. And joy. I honestly can't remember the last time an author made me feel this much while reading a book. And I read a ridiculous amount of fiction. Ox and his little tornado are going to stay with me for quite a while."
Another great book by TJ Klune!
This story was so awesome. TJ Klune did a wonderful job with this shifter story! I could not put this book down until I read every last page!
"Werewolves are always a fave of mine and I like how the author turned over the ABO dynamic completely. The truncated, repetitive style of writing was difficult for me to get around (but the sex scenes weren't written that way, odd) and the antagonists felt like caricatures.At one point I was a little tired of the recriminations and blaming, especially when the main character went and did more or less the same thing that he had been accusing someone else of.First person POV is one that I really dislike reading, because it's so internal and intense, and with the aspects of pack and bonding, there's SO MUCH to process."
Very engaging and thrilling. Written in a way that allows the author to explain things without sounding overly messy. I began feeling for the characters almost immediately and I need to read more about Wulfric Beleks Bane!!
"I really enjoyed this book, but man was it long. At first i wasn't sure how well I'd like it because of the writing style, but I eventually got used to it. My one problem with the book was that it was just super long. The story was good and I enjoyed all the characters. For me this wasn't the greatest book in the world but I did enjoy it a lot."
The premise for this book intrigued me and I kept with it in hopes of something that for me didn't really quite come. For me this was too long and repetitive and IMO fell a bit flat. I liked the characters but everyone's back stories were just thrown out there with little substance leaving me with little connection to any of the MC's.
"I liked the story it very much.I think in 10 years or so his style will be his own. I felt this novel needed a bit more editing though. Secondary characters need a bit more work, especially female characters. This will come with experience I hope.The first chapters feel written with more care, probably reviewed more times."
"Well written and good plot, but way too drawn out for me. Too much build up with too little climax. Also not enough focus on the romance aspect."
"This book is probably my favorite for 2021. I took my time and just enjoyed every emotion I felt while reading. Ezra's story is just heartbreaking and yet he's still so strong and full of life. He needed Josh! From there very first encounter. It was fate because he needs him to heal. I could go on and on about this book because I just loved every beautiful word of it. It's long yes..But Thank you for that. It could have been two, three books easy but then there would have been cliffhangers (🤬). It was too good to have to put down and wait. 5 stars is not enough!"
"Rarely do I write reviews and I will be brief.  Best book I’ve read in a really long time.  I missed two nights worth of sleep because I couldn’t put it down.  Who needs to go to work well rested?  Apparently not me.  This story grips you from the start and just keeps pulling you along for the ride. It is Soooo well written.  If I recommend just one book this year, it would be “Wrath”!!  Well done Ella James. 10 out of 10."
"I honestly wasn’t sure what to expect, but this book had a bit of everything in it.  I really like most of the story line it had a lot going for it , some parts were a bit to dark for me.  Although I have to say it was written very tasteful.  I’m not sure why I can’t give it a full 5 ⭐️ but I just can’t.It was kind I long and some parts dragged a bit but it was really good,  if you are into this kin of book that takes you on a roller coaster of emotions then things your book."
"This book! I knew going in, it'd gut me. But Ella promised a HEA, and she delivered. This book is written to perfection and handles things so well. I cried (which takes a lot for me), laughed, swooned, and got those awful cramps and tightening of the throat when things were hard. This is not an easy read. But there's enough happy to balance things out. Since V and Luke's series, Ella has been a 1-click author for me, and Wrath has cemented that even more. I highly recommend!!"
"Grab the electrolyte drinks and Advil because this book is going to give you the best hangover of your life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!700+ pages of angsty romantic bliss perfection. And I still want more.of these boys.How am I supposed to just go about my life now?This is what I call a masterpiece. I would love to see this book as a movie. Or better yet, a Netflix series.Why are you still reading this review when you could be reading this book? Get out of here! You have ten hours of bliss to tackle baddies! Enjoy- I'm jealous you get to read it for the first time again. How long to I have to wait to read this again?"
"Truly an emotional roller coaster! I’m glad I made it to the end but it was difficult! The intensity was too much at times but so worth! I feel like I’m shouting, on the inside, as I write this review because this story has me angry, energized, happy and triumphant that Josh and Ezra have won!Ella James is a master of her craft and I am one of many fans for sure. This story though for me is a keeper that I will revisit many times over."
"First, please head the trigger warnings. Those triggers are real, and they are intense. But they make what could have been a fluffy pseudo-taboo story about stepbrothers who get closer than close and turn it into a epic journey.Yes, it's 712 pages, but believe me when I tell you  I have read 300-page books that felt longer. This story flies by in a flash of heat and passion, sweetness and tenderness.Highly recommend!"
This book has everything. A lot of ups and downs. Every feeling there is you will feel with this book.
"This book was absolutely phenomenal! I can usually read a book really fast,but it took me two days to read this due to the length and the fact I didn't want to miss anythingMy emotions were all over the place while I read wrath,and I can't say that about too many books. This book definitely took me on a journey that I'm glad I went on! The best book I've read by far in 2021"
"I love Ella Jame’s mm books. I also love the fact that the book was all in one book and not 3 separate books like some withers do now that drives me nuts. I thought Ezra was a bully at first. Sweet Josh falls for him anyway.  I was very curious to find out why Ezra was the way he was. His story did not disappoint. I laughed, I cried, I swooned. This book caught my attention from the beginning to the end."
"Seriously. Totally amazing. The blurb is only a tease at what’s to come. I honestly had NO clue what journey these characters would take me on. And what journey it was. I’m astounded at how much more complex this book was than I expected after reading the blurb. These boys both wrecked me in their own ways, but thankfully the healing and rebuilding did take place. Eventually.This book has some of everything. Conflict, heat, humor, pain and suffering, joy and love. Some mystery as well. I enjoyed it so much I preordered Ella’s next book. The main character is seen in Wrath and I instantly loved him, too."
"This book is so much more than I was expecting, I loved the characters, even though sometimes I wanted to yell at them. I loved the passion and the emotions that this book showed, I cried more than once but it was a good crying, I didn’t realise how much I needed a good cry and this provided that.This is one of those books that stays with you, the characters, the circumstances, even the magical way with words that Ella James has with words. I know that this one is one that I will read again and I know I will love it just as much if not more as this time i wont be chasing the ending but I can savour each word."
Josh knew his stepbrother was moving in but he didn’t expect Ezra. They start picking on each other like all siblings do. Ezra needed new surroundings after everything that he’s been through but will this be any better? Josh is gay but isn’t ready to tell everyone. Ezra picks up on it right away. Josh is attracted to his stepbrother but will he ever act on it? Can Ezra escape his past?
"This is definitely one of my favorite books of the year. This book gets you emotionally involved. I cried a few times and laughed a few times throughout the book. Josh and Ezra are just perfect and adorable. Absolutely love them. I devoured this book, I couldn’t put it down. This is an emotional steamy MM story that will have you hooked right from the start. Highly recommend!!"
"Absolutely beautiful growing into love story. YA is usually not my jam, Wrath transcends the ages of the characters. While it is an extremely well and thoughtfully written story of  a MM relationship. To me it’s more about interpersonal relationships. There are emotional triggers written so well by the author, and integral to the plot. The characters are so well developed, I fell in love with them and was totally involved and invested in the outcome of ‘their’ story. Not just a ‘Romance’ novel, Wrath is an incredibly well written life story novel.  A top 5 star read for me this year."
"I don't even know where to start when it comes to singing praises for Josh & Ezra's story... My words never seem to meet the bar Ms. James sets with hers. There's some definite rough stuff to get thru, but the depth & breadth of strength and unconditional love throughout transcends the pain. The emotions she conveys in her characters is truly amazing!These boys will forever live in my heart! Wrath was a 4 day binge for me as I reread immediately after finishing the first time. If I could give this more than 5 stars, I must definitely would!!"
"I received an ARC and devoured this book!!!  This was the best book I have read so far this year.  After reading Communion, I couldn't wait to see what was in store for Miller.  I really love how Ella tied Miller and Ezra's story in with Luke and Vance's story.  I'm always happy to see what is happening with characters I have read about in previous books.  Ok, back to this book............I have such a soft spot for good guy Josh Miller.  One of my favorite characters after Vance Rayne.  The ups and downs of this book gave me all the feels.  Happy, sad, angry, mad and devastated all at the same time.  You will not want to put this book down until you finish it."
"Overall, easily one of my favorite romances of all time probably. I just fell in love with Ezra and Josh’s story. Their love was cute, adorable and just freaking real. If I don’t have a love like that in the future, I honestly don’t want it. This one is not a cutesy one though and I wouldn’t go into it expecting that. It def is more dark and serious, however it is a romance that is very real and feels real.What I liked:🥺 this book gave me ALL the feels. It’s cute, adorable, steamy and gosh Ezra and Josh’s relationship was all of these things. However while their relationship was all of these things, it was also incredibly real and flawed at the same time because these people are two imperfect individuals with issues of their own (primarily Ez)📖This one is a page turner. I started off just wanting to read one chapter and ended up binging this in a week. Like how did that even happen? I’m still not sure tbh. I didn’t want to stop reading this once I got started🤔This book definitely dominated my thoughts for most of the week. It definitely reminded me of RW&RB in that regard because I couldn’t stop thinking about those characters when I read that book. Same here with Ez and Josh. I could not stop thinking about these two and their relationship.💙 I don’t want to spoil anything, but I loved the representation of mental health and other issues. I spent the entire book wanting to hug Ezra and Josh. I also had tears in my eyes at multiple parts. Def one that stabbed me in the heart.What I didn’t like:📉This one is a CHONKY book. In fact, it’s the longest book I’ve read this year. Part of me doesn’t mind it being long because I truly did love these characters and didn’t want the story to end, but the book did not need to be this long. It would have been fine if it was like 200 pages less and ended with an epilogue. Things seemed a little too perfectly wrapped up at the end and I agree with others when they say that some things are better left unexplained.Overall Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️💫Steam Rating: 🌶🌶🌶🌶CAWPILE: 8.97/10"
"I’m in awe of this book, it’s been a while since I read something that gripped me so much. I loved the length of this book, it meant the characters and story were so well developed. Ezra and Miller, sigh, I love them both so much.This book made me cry, made me laugh, and made my heart break and then be sewed back together. It’s a roller coaster that ends on a beautiful HEA.You also get some Luke and Vance in it too, who are also a wonderful Ella James couple.Read this book, you won’t be disappointed!"
"This story is a epic journey that perfectly explain a bulled, forbidden and second chance love story. This story is a emotional mess that will have you falling apart and putting you back to pieces a little at a time. Their is just so much emotion in this story that you will need tissues and a quiet room to absorb this beautiful story."
Characters to love and literally die for and a plot that entices and tortures! Thank you for fantastic and fun reading.
"When I finished volume 1 I instantly rushed off to download volume 2. Once again, I was not disappointed. The action, the storytelling, the romance keep you hooked until the final page where now all you want is volume 3. I can't wait to see these characters again, to be once again be captured and not wanting to be let go."
"Such a good book, it baits you with little nibbles of delicious tidbits that leave you wanting more and more, knowing the end will be oh so satisfying!!!!"
"I NEED the rest of this series. I bought the first one 2 days ago & am now finished with the second one and, seriously, life cannot go on until the rest of this amazingness is released. Damen and Laurent are now my new favorite couple of the world of literature. Please, I don't know who to beg for this, but PLEASE give me the rest!"
"Read one and two sooooo freakin fast, not realizing three is not out.  So I concur with one of the other reviews that said nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!  please finish soon."
One of the best books I've ever read!
One of the best books I've ever read. A new favourite.
"Intelligently plotted and written, this is one of my favorite series ever, and definitely my favorite slash fiction. The first book is great, but the second is FANTASTIC. I would totally recommend it friends and strangers alike, if I wasn't too embarrassed by the erotic fiction label; so here's my (somewhat cowardly, but no less sincere for it) shout from the rooftops: buy the novels, read the novels, make sweet, deliciously UST-filled love to the novels."
"The second book in the series, this definitely lives up to the first and introduces new twists. Very enjoyable and I look forward to the last in the trilogy."
"The tension builds in Volume 2, the plot is complex and the characters are original and interesting"
"A lovely, poignant story of middle-age love, and the plight of many single women in the 1950s left looking after a demanding parent and condemned to a restricted life.  No wonder the next generation of women fought against this prison-like existence, and indulged in the swinging sixties.  The book has echoes of Barbara Pym, and is very evocative of the austerity of 1950's Britain - real austerity, not relative poverty.  I vividly remember the news reports of the Lewisham Train Disaster, even though I was only 9 at the time.  A few months later I was taken to London for the first time and we stayed with a friend's grandmother in St Johns, Lewisham - so this book has a real resonance for me.  I have now read it twice, and it will remain a favourite on my shelves."
"Sometimes a book comes along that you just can't forget, even long after you have turned the final page. Sometimes a book comes along that you can't stop telling everyone about, or buying for people as a gift. Sometimes a book is so pitch perfect that it consumes you totally. Small Pleasures is that book. Huge pleasure reading it and now off to investigate Clare Chambers' backlist."
"Thirty-nine-year-old Jean Swinney has “spent a liftetime on the sidelines” and goes about her admittedly limited life with an unassuming manner and stoic dignity.  Her life is one of small pleasures, from the first cigarette of the day to loosening her girdle at the end of a long day.  An intelligent woman and a local newspaper journalist, Jean moves between her working day as features editor of the North Kent Echo and a routine at home that revolves around her demanding mother.  That her sister is a married mother living overseas and has escaped the shackles of a life spent at her mother’s side in South-East London suburbia is a source of rancour but for the most part she bears her lot with little complaint.  Even her job sounds more glamorous than it is, consisting of women’s interest pieces (by virtue of being the only female on the team), household hints and recycled recipes.  Accepting that she has missed her chance of love, Jean certainly isn’t expecting things to change any time soon.Life gets shaken up when a rather sensationalist headline to an article on parthenogenesis in fish attracts a postbag of readers letters.  Above all, one letter stands out from twenty-nine-year-old Swiss woman, Gretchen Tilbury, now living in Sidcup whose letter states that she believes the birth of her daughter to have been without the involvement of any man.  Jean is assigned to interview “Our Lady of Sidcup” and finds Gretchen a straightforward and sincere woman but the story of her supposed virgin birth becomes ever more curious when she reveals that she was largely bedridden in a nursing home and sharing a room with other girls at the time of conception.  Setting out to investigate Gretchen’s claims, whilst accompanying mother and daughter for hospital tests to confirm or refute the claim, Jean strikes up a tentative friendship with Gretchen and her disarming daughter, Margaret.  Gretchen’s unprepossessing older husband, Howard, does not make an immediate impression on Jean but as her friendship with the family blossoms she finds herself drawn to his intelligence, kindness and dry wit.As Jean pushes on with her investigation, already complicated by her friendship with the family and the possibility that there is worryingly more to Gretchen’s story than initially meets the eye, her flourishing friendship with Howard seems to offer them both a last chance at love.  But can either party accept the guilt involved for their last opportunity to find fulfilment?  Jean is a terrifically well-crafted and sympathetic character and perhaps what impressed me the most about Clare Chambers portrayal is that it never veered into melodrama.  Modest and dependable Jean made a strikingly memorable impression simply by virtue of living a modest and ordinary 1950s life that is depicted vividly in all its quiet mundanity.  The portrayal of late-life love is exquisite; so accepting of what has come before, natural and wonderfully unpretentious.  Affecting, emotionally engaging and a gentle story that is worth savouring.  Whilst the ending has divided readers I found it only added to the poignancy of this quietly devastating novel."
"Well written and some beautiful moments and I was intrigued and drawn on but the ending is just jarring, as someone else has said. Felt like I was left stranded in the middle of a journey. Felt cheated. Very poor to leave a reader high and dry at the end like that"
Wonderful book. First time I have read anything by this author and was attracted to her because a reviewer said if you like Anne Tyler (which I do) this is similar.  The author captures the time and place so accurately.  It is so well written I can not recommend highly enough.  I have immediately purchased another novel by this author.
"This is a very intriguing novel and I  quickly became immersed and enjoyed the poor protagonist Jean, who as a 1950s should have been enjoying freedom and independence, is very down trodden  by life and her mother. I thought the idea of  Jean investigating an Immaculate Conception for the local newspaper intriguing and original. Initially I enjoyed Jeans journalistic inquisitive  nature, however I thought the plot  of The Tilburys and the conclusion became predictable.I felt the ending was rushed and lacking so  much  of the brilliant description which had gone before, so for me I was left disappointed."
I enjoyed this book a lot but there were a few things that let it down. I think the author got stuck on the idea of including both the train crash and the virgin birth story but the train crash was not necessary in my opinion and it spoiled the story for me. The revelation about the conception was too abrupt and clumsy. Also I would've ended the story with Jean's final letter to Howard and had him go back to Gretchen for Margaret's sake as she thought he would. The Jean character could have been a bit more likeable as well. Basically I think this was a good read but with better editing and a bit more work it could have been a really excellent book.
I am really annoyed with myself for wasting my time with this very slow novel which turns into a  Mills and Boon woman's weekly special .  I did enjoy some parts but I think it is massively over rated.  If you like romance and slow books you will love it.
"Jean is a journalist in a small Kent paper when an opportunity present itself to her in the form of the letter from a woman claiming a boring birth. After meeting Gretchen and starting the investigation, Jean starts to believe the woman's claims especially when the medical side is backing her up.Small pleasures was an easy read with an interesting storyline - the claim of a woman that her child came from a virgin birth. The details and capture of the feel of 1957 was wonderful BUT for me the story went off onto main tangents of relationships rather than the main story of the virgin birth."
Why would you write a love story and kill off the man just as things are resolved and a life is there to look forward to? Madness! I’m crushed. Has left me with a horrid feeling in my chest when I should be happy. Am sickened by this ending.
"This is my first Clare Chambers book, but it will not be my last.I found I could not put it down….the story of Jean, her awful mother, distant sister, lowly job at the newspaper suddenly becomes a riveting story with the unexpected arrival of a woman claiming to have had a virgin birth.The development of this newspaper story & the story of how it  changes Jean’s  life propels the reader through this novel.The era , 1950’s & the location , Kent , add to the interest of the story. An excellent read."
"A well-written, intriguing tale of good people wasting their lives doing the morally right thing, while denying themselves the love and care they deserve. They are forced to re-examine their life choices when claims of a 'virgin birth' are investigated. Sympathetic, believable characters set in an evocative atmosphere of an era of sexual repression and social deprivation, where a picnic on a sunny day or a home-baked biscuit are small pleasures to be savoured amid the bleakness of duty, work and secrecy."
"This is the first book review I have ever left on amazon.I loved the book and the writing style, after investing my time in reading it, I was totally disappointed by the ending. The author invested a lot of time developing the characters especially Jean, and then the ended felt rushed and unconsidered. I wondered if the railway disaster was really necessary to the story. I think the story would have stood better without it with a more considered and less abrupt ending."
"This was intriguing and I was completely invested in the story, but as other reviewers have commented the ending let it down.  I saw the 'solution' to the virgin birth coming early on, but the main issue for me was the  final 'twist' at the end which felt both unnecessary and jarring.  In fact, that ending absolutely ruined the book for me, it was what I was left with and I can't see the point of it even with the explanation of the 'true story' link."
"I didn’t know much about the author or the story apart from a very brief synopsis I’ve read online. The book is beautifully written, however I was a bit worried when halfway through I still didn’t know why the cover has oranges/tangerines on it.I enjoyed the characters, Jean the journalist who is still living with her mother and how she makes friends of the Tilburys. At first I must admit I was a little bored with their days out but I assure you it will get very exciting at the second half of the book.The mystery keeps you on your toes until the end and the complexity of the characters really makes it a wonderful read."
"I liked the way this novel invoked the atmosphere of the 1950s. It reminded me of the food,the clothes and domestic arrangements such as shopping and transport. The storyline was interesting and somewhat intriguing in the. Main. I certainly was carried along by it. My only disappointment was it seeing the outcome for the principal character of the tragic rail crash. I would like to have known how she came through. An excellent read which I really enjoyed."
"This is a book, written with great sensitivity and compassion, about people whose emotional turmoils pass beneath the radar of public attention. The bleak post-war dullness of the 1950s is beautifully captured, as is the flickering to life of a romance between two unglamorous individuals. What a pity then, that the subtlety of everything that has gone before is diminished by the grafting-on of melodramatic ending."
"Enjoyable, easy reading little story, due to a non fiction event mixed in with this story. Surprised myself liking it, as it's based in the 1950's with the females weak, the males chauvinistic and everyone terribly polite. Thank goodness times have changed."
"This was an excellent read and most of the characters were well-drawn. The ending, however, was disappointing. It was if the author had run out of steam! Readers were therefore obliged to  make up their own endings. A lazy finale to an otherwise interesting book."
"The first few pages of this book, hinted at the mundane chores of everyday life. Little did I know about the epic story that was about to unfold. Beautiful descriptions of daily life in suburban and central London post war, solid characters that give way to complex affairs and heart rendering historical occurrences ( I knew little about) provide a colourful and masterful backdrop to this story.  A must read."
I loved this book from the outset. It felt like going back in time and I felt a connection to my old great aunt who was one of those women born in the 1910s caught with lost loves who ends up the maiden aunt. The descriptions were so evocative with a brilliant storyline keeping the threads together.
"An unusual and gripping tail of mystery and forbidden romances. I  was desperate to know the ending but equally, sad to have finished it."
"A really nice story. Interesting characters, fun in the sun. A book I did not predict. A great book to read with a cuppa and a biscuit."
Well drawn characters painting a vivid picture of genteel near poverty. An attempt to get past that destroyed by ill fortune. Sombre
This was my first book by Chambers and I adored it. An intriguing story cleverly told. I've since added further titles to my kindle.
Absolutely loved this book. Couldn't wait to read it each night and the ending... I loved it and now want to read her other books.
"What a beautifully written story. The words flowed smoothly creating a clear picture of the lives and feelings of character's, described perfectly."
"Enjoyable and interesting plot, but rather long winded and not in any way as good as previous novels I have read by this author."
Although a nun was most unlikely to have been called Sister Maria Goretti before the latter had even been beatified- the only carp.
An unlikely premise but gripping story set in 1950s Britain with all the conventions of the age wittily portrayed.  Recommend .
Wonderful book enjoyed it from beginning to endVery well written and thought provoking
I couldn’t book this book down. Although the author didn’t live in this era it was beautifully observed. A good story!
"This is the best novel I've read all year. The story doesn't sound like much, but the way Clare writes is exquisite. It's funny and clever, with a gentle but intriguing story and complex, likable that keep you interested. I recommended it to my mum, too, and she said exactly the same."
"At last a book to really enjoy, excellent storyline and beautifully written. Evocative of a time not so long ago but certainly not one we’d want to return to. Anyone born in the late 50s will recognise so much of the attitudes and norms that run through it."
"I loved this book,beautifully written  and would have given it 5 stars but the end was so abrupt and disappointing. So now I'm left wondering what happened to all the characters."
Could not put this book down.  Characters well draw I found myself thinking of the actors who would play them. This would be a great choice for a book club read
Chosen by my book club. The pace was too slow. Not a page turner. Wouldn’t recommend to friends this time.
Loved this book. It really gives the essence of the 50s. A romance with a twist. I cried and I smiled.
"Truly absorbing read, very pleased to discover this new ( to me) writer."
"A story of two women essentially set in suburbia in 1957. One who maintains she has had  ‘virgin birth’; the other, a journalist,who sets out to prove her wrong."
Don't waste your time.
"I recommend this book to true readers. People who love a good story where they can easily see themselves and friends as characters. I won’t spoil the ending for you, but it made me smile. Author!Author!"
"Fun with a sweet ending, but amateurish & forced throughout most of the book. I want to have loved it so much more, but the story lacked credibility at every turn."
Characters were well defined but book did not fit criteria for a modern version of Pride n Prejudice.  Similarities in the storyline were few n far between.  The main players left me cold and the story was flimsy and predictable.  I have read other modern versions and continuations and enjoyed them very much.  But having read Val McDermuid continuation of P&P this is not in the same league.
"I loved this book. The Bennet Women is one of those rare books where you get immediately swept up in the story, and you want to go on reading until the very end. In spite of the fact that the setting is unfamiliar to me, I felt at home right from page one.I loved the way that certain key events and themes from Pride and Prejudice were seamlessly woven in, but the book was very much its own story.I really liked the characters, EJ and Will especially. I loved the supportive atmosphere of Bennet House. I loved the central friendship (EJ, Tessa, and Jamie).I highly recommend this book, both to lovers of Pride and Prejudice, and those who have never read it. I look forward to reading any further books from Eden Appiah-Kubi."
"In some ways the main story was about EJ and how she asserted her independence as a black, female professional, making her way in a life that wasn't her first choice but breaking down barriers and showing what sacrifice was really about. It was also a story about the coming of age of women and how they handled relationships, how they supported and looked out for each other and called each other out when they crossed boundaries.  It was a love story without all the mushy bits or graphic detail which can be so prevalent these days, which just enhanced the story's appeal.  It treats the reader with the same respect and mutual consideration as one of the characters.  These are strong, empowered women but at the same time also have a desire to be accepted for who they are and to be loved.  A remarkably perceptive insight into women of today."
"Such a good modernisation. As satisfying as the original, but for different reasons. Some of the pop culture references were very American, which made the start of the novel a bit confusing as a European reader, but by the middle of the book they die down as the scene is set. The ways in which the twists of the original are adapted are clever and current and invoke the same sympathies you'd have for the original P&P characters. Well worth a look."
"I hoped this book would evoke the ambience of the original Pride & Prejudice but unless you have a detailed knowledge about the ins and outs of US University life AND are very young, then you will very quickly learn that you are completely at sea with the whole thing.  Sadly, I gave up after struggling through the first third of the book."
"There's a real talent to tackling some difficult issues without it being preachy, condescending or stereotypical. This book on the surface is a fairly light rom com. But on the underside it deals with a lot of hard to talk about areas phenomenally well and underscores the reality which is we are all the same, we love the same, we make mistakes the same.Honestly - I bloody loved it."
"This book gave me moments of joy, with its stories of solidariety and comprehension among joung women and men. It is very contemporary, with a fast pace, but also has something of Pride and prejudice in the narration. Lovely."
"I absolutely loved this trilogy! Some of the best books I've read in a while! The only thing that really bothered me was the abrupt ending. I feel like Pacat just decided to end things once the issues were resolved, which kind of had me feeling a bit cheated. Hopefully her short stories provide some closure. But regardless, it was still a great trilogy!"
I wasn’t expecting this when I picked up this book. I had been told it was nothing but slave erotica. That couldn’t be further from the truth. It was truly a dangerous line that author played but they danced on the line well creating a sweet slow building romance between the most unpredictable of people. I will absolutely be recommending this to all of my friends.
"I'm so sad that this is the end. I love this trilogy so much. It was full of passion, betrayal, hatred, and compassion that I couldn't put this series down. I loved it all. I wish there was more to this story because the three books wasn't enough."
"Spoilers for books one and two.I would actually give Kings Rising a 4.5, simply because Books 1 and 2 just knocked my socks off even more.  I am awed by Pacat's subtle but fair writing that sets up the twists to her narrative.  I have read, loved and admired prior examples of the 'oblivious narrator', as Damen is here.  This may have given me an advantage over other reviewers here, in that I picked up two of Laurent's secrets early.  One near the start of book one, and the other horrifyingly sure of by book two.  This is not to say I wasn't blindsided by other surprises.  I too was fabulously surprised again and again by Pacat and Laurent.  This trilogy sits as a detective novel and thriller in my head for this twist-based plotting.I can't remember being more satisfied by an author setting up her plotting in advance.  Reading books one and two was distressing and shockingly intense.  And thus of course all the more satisfyingly intense when connections were being made and things were going well for our heroes.  Pacat's creation of the decadence and cruelty of the court of Vere pulled no punches.  I was almost physically sickened by the treatment of Damen and other slaves in the first two books.  That disgust was cushioned for me by my knowledge of two of Laurent's secrets and I cannot imagine the conflict set up for other readers as Damen became attracted to his abuser.Being away from the hothouse of Vere is one of the reasons book 3 was just that tiny bit less intense for me.  There was more overt fighting.  The psychological cruelty and mental fighting between individuals in books 1 and 2 was not so thick on the ground here, although the bouts were more important.  Pacat made me feel sorry yet again for an enemy with unexpected depths and motivations.  Some things I had seen coming.  Others were utter surprises, and then twisted again.King's Rising has consequences that are explored in luxurious detail.  I am in love with this story partly because Pacat has taken the badly over-used and frequently not-well-done enemies-to-lovers trope and treated it how it is meant to be done.  With slowness.  With agonising internal and external conflicts that do not go away easily or quickly.  With consequences that reach far beyond the primary couple.I enjoyed very much seeing more of Akielos culture on the road. I enjoyed moments of Laurent being culturally befuddled, and moments of Laurent being culturally wily.  I enjoyed moments of Laurent's and Damen's hard gained physical prowess.  Moments of Damen's innate goodness, and his moral compromises forced on him by rule in a time of war.  I enjoyed moments between each king and his respective subjects, whose love, dedication and loyalties are tested, betrayed, and won.  I loved especially the two plot pivots where Laurant is stripped completely bare of all his mental armour.  Utterly naked, defenceless and powerless.  And how these two complete losses win Laurant the two things he wants most.  I could never be sure of the outcome.  I certainly could not be sure of the road to get there.  And I loved every moment of it."
Loved it. I'm always surprised by how very clever her characters are and how intricately she plots her stories and how deftly she allows her characters to grow.
I had heard a lot of good things about this series and I still wasn’t prepared for how much I enjoyed them. I read them first on overdrive through my local library and immediately had to buy my own set.
"I liked this book.  I think it helped that so much time had past since I read the first two that I didn't really remember much, so the inconsistencies pointed out by others didn't bother me.  I think that an epilogue would have been great and made the book better, but it still was an enjoyable read for me."
"I only started reading the series for the romance, but it has become my favorite book ever because the story is just so good! The first book is the hardest to get through, but if you keep reading you will get obsessed. Now that I finished the series I appreciate the first book even more and love all three (but the second is my favorite)."
"Loved this. There was a moment near the end where I stumbled, thinking that the author was going to go for a pretty well-used plot trope, but she went in a different direction, and I enjoyed that a lot more. I loved this whole trilogy, and while I think I liked books 1 and 2 slightly more, this was a very satisfying conclusion."
"4.5 starsThere is no way to write a review that will do justice to this series.This whole series has been like a chess game. The intricate moves that were at the time small and seemingly meaningless played a part in the big game and when revealed had me thinking yeap makes perfect sense.Laurent is a master manipulator, out of necessity, moving his human chess pieces around. He was hard to get to know because you never really knew where his head was at. Damen was his opposite. He was honest and didn't play the games well. If someone as an enemy you faced them over the battlefield until it was done. That was how he was taken in the first place, he never saw the betrayal coming.Together with both their strengths working toward a common goal they were magnificent.One of the reveals didn't sit well with me and I think the character got off easy but overall this whole series has been a pleasure to read and I know I will re read again at a later date"
"Perfect amount of detail, twists until the very end, and a poignant and genuine love story that everyone has been waiting for."
I only wish there was an epilogue. Wanted it to be longer!
AMAZING!! I could not put the book down!! Even after a marathon of three books in three days I could have read three more!! A must read 😍😍😍
I loved this series but i wished that it would be longer. I hope CS Pacat will write books to satisfy my hunger.
Worth the wait.  A fitting end to an absolutely amazing trilogy.
"Definitely read the two books before this. This was by far the strongest book of the three. By the end, you'll wish there was more."
Pacat had me enthralled from the very beginning of the series. Very excited to read the short stories! Endless admiration.
"After the long wait full of anticipation, the end of a popular trilogy is never going to satisfy everyone--but it satisfied me.  The only vision that counts is the author's, and we have trusted in her through the first two books.  People who have read the first two and enjoyed them will read this, so reviews are a bit pointless.The main thing is that people SHOULD read this... and see for themselves.  And they should also read the first two books and see for themselves.  This isn't rocket science.  It's extremely engaging characters and situations with lots of twists and intrigue and battles and adventures.  Pacat likes to leave a lot of things up to the reader, so don't expect things to be spelled out in great detail.  There is room left for a lot of things to be puzzled out and possible.  And indeed, it is part of the fun to re-read and go over the book and figure out what actually was going on after knowing how it all played out.  It is rare to have a book that elicits so much passionate discussion.  Read it and experience it!Damen and Laurent grow as characters, while remaining true to themselves.  Their relationship is as complex as their personalities.  We love them and hate them, but mostly love them.  Theirs is a beautiful and exciting story... one of those things that make a reader's day or year or more.  Where you want to thank the author so much for sharing their vision (and time and effort and dedication), with you."
Amazing finale for a breathtaking series!!
"amazing  trilogy, the ending just seemed a Little too rushed and i would of killed for a epilogue. Only reason 4 stars and not 5"
There are three stories included in this presentation. Carmilla is great because it introduces vampirism for those who qre interested in the subject. The other two stories are very well developed and suspensful.
Somewhat different take. I enjoyed reading it
"This is an excellent story that keeps moving nicely. It keeps you hooked and wondering what exactly will happen next. I was very interested in the differences between the original story and the made for TV movie version, which was done with Meg Tilly playing Carmilla. The book gives a nice back story the movie does not, but both are equally good in their own way. The one thing about the book was that with so many interesting and startling images that were created throughout the story the ending was lacking any real dramatics. It seemed to end to quickly without a very detailed description of the last events. It is however an amazing and interesting vampire story, much more realistic as compared to some the ones written today. Short synopsis:A vampire story about a lonely girl and her father who have the fortune or misfortune of an unexpected house guest who apparently is not who or what she appears to be. Bringing mystery, danger,intrigue."
"Very typical gothic story, but that's not to say it isn't wonderful.  It's always nice to read a vampire story where the vampire is actually dangerous."
"Joseph Sheridan Or Fanu proves once again why he is considered the father of the modern ghost story.  Carmilla in its time no doubt terrified, tantalized and likely offended.  Carmilla a lesbian vampire' s tale is recounted by her intended victim.  Despite the gothic narrative the story reads quickly still has suspense and entertainment."
"Loved this book , couldn't put it down read it at one sitting!  A classic horror story. Well worth the read!"
I had been meaning to read this for years. I've had a copy for half a decade but finally downloaded and read it. I'm so glad I did!
"this author does quite a bit of research into vampire legends from other countries as well as his footnotes. interesting step into irish vampire history...the story itself is familiar to me, having read it before.  Carmilla loves female victims to the death..."
"I can't believe they made a children's school reader out of Carmilla, including teacher led discussion activities and quizzes between chapters. I ordered this book for the illustrations, which are very nice. I'm very pleased with the book."
This book was the very first vampire story that I ever read.  I read the first part and was unable to finish it when I was younger.  I have finally finished the story some 36 years later.
This is such a good vampire story! I found Dracula difficult to read and follow. Carmilla is a simple narrative that builds suspense. Excellent read!
"one of my flavourites already, I am quite pleased to find this volume contains much of the original material plus other sim vampire novelettes accounts.  one of my better knights in vampireland...thanks!"
"Very enjoyable gothic horror. Well written, interesting story."
Love it
It kept me reading but was pretty predictable.
"Short story ,in my opinion,but intrinsic and a very new view of the seduction process of the vampire.Short but good"
"I have viewed the web series Carmilla, by KindaTV on YouTube, and was curious to read the original novela.  I Enjoyed it."
This compact book is excellent for traveling. The story is a classic and I'm so happy to add it to my collection.
"Before the vampire became a subject of ridicule (here's looking at you, Twilight), there was creatures of the night like Carmilla and Dracula. This book is short, beautifully written, and reminds me that vampires were beautiful, seductive and did not, in fact, sparkle in the sun. But the best part of reading it is knowing it inspired Dracula. Truly a must read."
"Carmilla is a classic tale of a young woman desired by a vampire. A lesser known classic, Carmilla predates Dracula and is worthy of equal consideration. A must read for fans of vampire stories."
This was just brilliant. I simply couldn't put it down once I started. Ryan is on his way to becoming a world famous Hockey player and he wants to spend one last summer with his best friend Jamie. The only problem with this scenario is that Ryan has always had a crush on his straight best friend and one night together as teens four years ago had him running for the hills.Seeing Ryan again after no contact for years and not knowing what happened to end their friendship so abruptly causes Jamie to revaluate everything he thought he knew about himself. Their journey from best friends to more was beautiful to witness. It was told from both points of view and I felt everything they were going through. Jamie's sexual evolution was told with such raw feeling that at times I just wanted to hug him as he worked through his emotions.Side note: How awesome is Jamie's family?  I loved every minute and can't wait to see where their story goes in US.
"I purchased this book because it was co-written by Elle Kennedy, one of my favorite writers. I've only read one other m/m romance before this, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, although I did know Elle's Out of Uniform series was pretty darn hot. But holy cow - this was not just a hot, wicked read, it was also a great story about friendship, sexual identity crisis, and a statement about how those in the gay community are still being discriminated against.The passion and build-up in this novel was beautiful...it kept me reading and wanting to know how both Jamie and Ryan would handle their rocky road of friendship, which had taken a turn years before. Although hockey wasn't the central topic, both the writers included enough of the jargon to build a realistic background for the characters.Both Sarina and Elle did an amazing job in creating these characters, whom I fell in love with. The angst between them was palpable and creating such crackling chemistry that I couldn't put the book down. I'll definitely read more of both these authors!"
"This book is amazing. Him is the first m/m book that I have read. I am so glad that I took everyone’s advice and made this one my first m/m read. I will definitely be reading more.Wes just blew me away. I fell instantly in love with him. I felt so bad for him and the struggles he went through. I was not sure how I felt about Jamie in the beginning, but he quickly won my heart too. There were just so many things in this book that just won me over. I loved the box tradition. I loved their banter. Jamie’s drunken jealousy was amusing and I could totally picture that happening in real life. I loved how coach handled the tense situation that came mid story. He was wonderful. And the side of Wes that Jamie brings out just slayed me. I was completely enthralled in their relationship. I just can’t say enough good things about this book. I cried through a few parts, screamed through some, but mostly my heart just fluttered throughout the book. I absolutely love this story. I am actually scared to read Us because I’m afraid I will get my heart broke with the outcome. READ THIS BOOK – YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!"
"I have a habit of buying new releases and then shelving them for quite some time until the hype dies down. But with this one I just couldn't wait and I am so glad I didn't. I absolutely loved it. I don't know much about the game, Hockey (Football fan here) and after reading the book I still don't. My complete focus was on these boys, Wes and Jamie. UGH! LOVED them. Adored Jamie and totally book crushed on Wes. These two were SO good together. So if any technical terms or rules of the game was mentioned I was totally oblivious to it. LOLWes's dad was a tool and I am glad he didn't get much book time. Jamie's family though were amazing and I would really have loved the boys interacting with them a bit more. They were loud, funny, loving, and more importantly, accepting. I would have loved if they had more page time.I can't express enough how much I loved Jamie and Wes together. They were just so good for one another. They were completely honest with each other until it came to sharing there real feelings for one another. That is their biggest flaw in this book. But eventually one of them leaps and puts themselves out there and I got my HEA. =]The book is low on angst and I was so greatly appreciated of that. I was not in the mood for it and I was so pleased this book had so little of it. I honestly wouldn't mind seeing another book starring these two. I would lurve a follow up book. Hint-Hint, Wink-Wink. LOL ;]"
"I really loved this book. It is very well written to the point you can really feel like you know the characters Jamie and Wes, what they are going through as they discover the depth of their longtime friendship. Enough sizzle to not be overdone like other MM romance novels. Fully describes struggles and challenges I imagine one may go through discovering their sexuality and coming to terms with it. Loved this book. Very well done."
"Him was a very well written and a great read. First I will say that first person stories really aren’t my favorite. I don’t really like reading every single thought that goes through a character’s head. The character’s always come off as being a little whiny or arrogant even if they aren’t really. That being said I loved it for this book once I got use to it and I don’t think it could have been written any other way. I liked getting Wes and Jamie’s perspective on how they were feeling and what they were experiencing. It helped shape them in my mind more clearly. Plus it made for some very hot scenes.Throughout the story Wes and Jamie deal with different discoveries about themselves, each other and their futures. Wes knows he is gay but Jamie on the other hand thinks he is straight with some lingering confusing thoughts about Wes. It was interesting to read their different thoughts about each other and their relationship as it changed and progressed. Wes and Jamie have some serious chemistry going on. They have an easy going friendship that turns into an easy going intimate relationship that I think most people would envy. There are of course some bumps in the road for the two to figure out and to overcome by themselves and together but they will figure something out right?Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy did an awesome job writing this story. This was a really well written story that I enjoyed every minute of. I know I will probably end up rereading this book many times over."
"I have a new favorite. Or rather, I have two new favorites, Jamie Canning and Ryan Wesley. This book is staying on my Kindle because I'll make sure to re-read it very soon.Jamie's and Wes's friendship has been steady and solid for years. They met at a hockey training camp and have spent every summer ever since.When they spend another six weeks at the camp, they are both eighteen now, something happens that makes Wes give up on them and walk away. Jamie is left in the dark about the reasons for Wes's disappearing act.After four years, they both play for their respective college hockey team, they meet again. Wes hopes for a chance to make things right with his former best friend and after Wes confesses what made him disappear all those years ago they fall back into their funny and comfortable friendship. Wes is surprised at how easily Jamie comes to terms with Wes being gay. Jamie, as straight as they come, however, doesn't know that Wes has been in love with him since their first summer together.Wes is a snarky, cocky guy, the best lines in this story come from him - I laughed hard, sometimes to the point that tears were running down my face. And sometimes the tears came from a burning place in my heart.There is something about the friendship between two guys the majority of us women will never have or completely understand. That relaxed relationship, the banter without inhibitions, the straight-forward companionship. I think this is what appeals so much to me about the MM-genre. I envy guys for that. What I'm starting to become aware of now after starting to read MM and I have to admit, I never really thought about it more deeply (possibly because I'm tolerant and open-minded and never questioned it): It is hard to be gay. The realization, that you are more attracted (or exclusively so) to your own gender, the acceptance of it and then coming out of the closet is mostly a painful process. I love how Jamie doesn't shy away from his feelings, he struggles, yes but unlike Wes he doesn't run.I am so incredibly happy I have made the step into the MM world. Not only does it open up many more possibilities, it also makes me learn about myself."
4.5 Stars!What a lovely friends to lovers sports romance. Wes and Jamie have a wonderful love story. Friends to lovers is my favorite and you can really feel the friendship between these two.The hockey in the book is great and I like how Wes's and Jamie's connection to the game is shown differently.The banter is fun and while the sex is smoking hot this is a tender book that is clearly a tale of deep and abiding love.There are so many wonderful details and moments in the book which you should expect for the excellent writing of Bowen and Kennedy.I think we get to understand Jamie a bit more than Wes and his actions make more sense and more repair needed to be done for his actions but such a grand read overall.Not to be missed if you are a Sports Romance fan or friends to lovers fan!
"Let me start out by saying this is a romance novel, so the plot is predictable and the characters are likable. Things fall rather neatly into place in the end. However, it is one of the most fully realized and enjoyable M/M fics I've read, mostly because it simply gets on with the story. The characters are not obvious stereotypes this genre tends to serve up. In particular, there is no male character standing in for the female in this romance, taking the submissive or emotive role too often given to the female character. The story is definitely about two individuals who have well-realized personalities. They also have ambitions and goals that develop and a past that is realistically rough and tumble. This is a novel that takes it for granted that anyone you know might be gay. It isn't just the sensitive and flamboyant musical theater buff that everyone suspects, it can also be a hockey player. And it suggests some people might be okay with that. Without being overwrought or preachy, the book takes a stand for bisexual discovery, too. It addresses some of the feelings bisexual people have in committing to either gay or straight relationships. I believe this book is a very well constructed M/M romance and I think anyone who likes romances, and can accept the steamy aspect of the many love scenes, would enjoy it."
"This is a beautiful easy flowing story. Not in the sense of a ‘tame’ novel, but in the sense of a story in a setting where love has the upper hand. As how it’s supposed to be. Except for Killfeather sr. of course. 😠 And the angsty-ness of Wes. But as I was saying, Sarina and Elle delivered AAA quality again with this series and I’m getting ready to joyously listen to Teddy and Jacob narration of US. In the meantime I recommend Him, which is a solid 5 stars level story!"
"I finished it, so it wasn't terrible. But there was way too much forced dude bro culture, misogyny, repetitive sex scenes, and  not enough character development. It reads like high school fan fiction sometimes, which can be entertaining but ultimately feels pretty trite and shallow. Think I'm done with this series and these authors."
"Glad I got this book and also ""US"" they are both beautiful. The love and all the hardships they went through and the most important the support from one side of the family members, it's an amazing book and I am very glad the I read the series. I admire a couple who loves and continuing doing it without being scare. Hopefully I can read more of this kind.  If you haven't buy these series, you should give it a try, just have an open mind, because it doesn't matter who you love, the most important it's the real love change people whether its a love between a man and women or man and man or woman and woman."
I don't even know where to start. This book is my absolute favorite MM read. I have listened to this audiobook more times than I can count. I absolutely adore Wes & Jamie. Their love story is beautiful and holds a very special place in my heart. Excellent narration by Jacob Morgan & Teddy Hamilton. #Wesmie Forever!
"This book one of the 2 volume ""Him/Us"" is a gem.  Sometimes I feel timid reading such goings on in new adult fiction, but forgive me I'm 72.  Love the story, though.  The book made me laugh and cry, scream and shout! Our two heroes, Canning and Wesley are the greatest!  Especially as Wes faces a change in lifestyle and Canning has demons of his own to confront.  Actually makes me jealous of today's gay youth.  We certainly didn't have such freedom in the 50's and early 60's.  I highly(is there higher than highly)  recommend these 2 books to anyone who can read, or is in need of some uplifting of the old spirit."
"HIM Book One.Jamie Canning and Ryan Wesley have been inseparable since they first met at summer camp. However, before going to college Wes bets Jamie for something more personal than money. After that night, Jamie doesn't hear anything from his best friend again. Wes cannot forgive himself for manipulating Jamie, but when they are soon to be pitted against each other in the Frozen Four Wes knows he has to break the ice. Can their friendship heal over another summer at hockey camp?If you're looking for a hot summer with hockey and two pro players, this is the book for you!"
"Him was exactly the type of book I love to read. It was romantic without being sappy, incredibly hot, and the characters were wonderful. So many romances have characters act in unrealistic or unkind ways ways in order to manufacture conflict, but that didn't happen here. I loved both Wes and Jamie - each character treated the other with such respect, and even when there was conflict it never crossed the line into ""enough already."" This book had two sexy Hs that were each a catch, they were warm and interesting and the dirty talk was excellent, and I ended up so wrapped up in them and their world that I honestly didn't want it to end. I was never bored, nor did I ever get so exasperated with the characters that I needed to stop reading for a while (that happens more often than I'd like in romances). Between the hot s*x, humor, and unexpected depth and sweetness, this is one of my favorite books recently. Definitely a re-read."
"Oh Wes and Jamie definitely stole my heart from the get go. I could really relate to Wes and his background - minus his wealth - and how envious he was of Jamie and his family.Wes and Jamie's story melts your heart little by little and their journey on discovering themselves as well as navigating their feelings towards each other in the relationship.Their journey was not easy since being attracted to another comes as a shock and as a surprise even more unsettling is how your friends, family and other people are going to react to that fact and how they are going to treat you.Both of the guys were trying to determine where to go with their hockey careers and how it will affect their lives individually as well as together.I loved every moment of reading this book, it's 4:43 AM and I couldn't put the book down, Wes and Jamie were scorching hot and steamy and there were times I really needed a cold shower.I would highly recommend this book if you are looking for a sweet and sizzling love story to read."
"LOVED LOVED LOVED IT!!!! My goodness! I don't even know if I have the words to convey how much I enjoyed this book. I have been on an M/M kick lately and this book totally f***ing did it for me! Everything that I would've hoped to read in an M/M romance was all contained in this mind-blowing story.Jaime and Ryan will take you on one hell of a whirlwind story jammed packed with all the emotions. I was entranced from the very beginning and becoming more and more consumed with the turn of each page. Steamy, hott, sexy, sweet, funny and I can go on and on. From emotional drained, the eye rolling to a whole helluva lot of hot and bothered!!! Jaime and Ryan totally had me transfixed. Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy did a fantastic job and I highly recommend."
"Oh my the hotness in this book was off the charts. Chapter 40 had me giggling through the entire scene as did other parts of this book. The story also had me sighing and falling in love with Jamie and Wes. Amazing storyline, really well developed characters for two men in their early twenties and great secondary characters in the Canning family!"
"I love NA romance, and this is a great friends to lovers story in the genre. It's M/M and I really appreciated how Sarina and Elle told Wes and Jamie's story. You can really feel the love between them. I enjoyed the whole series, but this first book is going down as an all-time favorite."
"Just wonderful!!HIM was my second m/m book after The Understatement of the Year. And somehow I knew from the very beginning that I would be falling in love with this book.The FEELINGS!!!! It's one of those feel-good books, everything worked, fit, made sense. The romance and feelings were spot on. The characters a real JOY.The entire book was beautifully written and wonderfully composed. Both authors but especially Sarina Bowen have made it onto my auto-buy list. I love her writing and can't get enough of it."
There are no words to describe how much I loved every page of this book. Each character was superbly developed. Jamie and Wes were so honest with each other and they were really meant to be together.
"It's my number one m/m but also in my top 3 of all time.I have reread and relistened to this story, it's sequels, and subsequent wags books so many times that sometimes I think about writing to Sarina and Elle begging them for more.I'm not really sure what to write in a review other than I loved it!It's really well written and edited for a dual author book and I will continue to come back for more."
What a fantastic read! I'll put it out there right now I've already purchased the next book US. Not that HIM felt incomplete at all I just want to read more about these two.I'm not a big reader of M/M but this got some hype on social media and I'm a regular reader of Ms. Kennedy's work so I thought I'd give it a go. Man I'm glad I did. I'll also be checking out MsBowen's work based on this read.Wes and Jamie's story is a realistic look at young love. As sweet as it is hot. And the Canning family I just loved them.
"I wanted to experience this book a second time, so I listened to the audio version. It was just as good as reading it the first time. I loved how the narrators brought this special story to life."
Everything about this story was pretty damn fantastic. I’m looking forward to the next book with these unforgettable characters.Great storyline and great execution of focusing on feelings.
"I was not sure I would like this story, but holy crap was I wrong. Oh my God, first off where to start. This story is about two guys, and while some of you might turn away from that, I have to say that the angst, and chemistry for me was a huge hit. Some story lines lag and others just write to put something out, this was so much more than I bargained for. I was hot and bothered and dying to see what would happen next. If you are looking for some great heat and some very hot mental pictures this is for you."
"2.5 Stars This book seems to be on everyone's must-read mm list, so I purchased it even though I rarely read anything except KU.  The book was fine, with a cohesive plot and likeable characters, and I can't put my finger on why I didn't enjoy it more. Maybe I'm too old for college romances?  At any rate, I would read the sequel if it was KU, but would not purchase."
"Before this book, I'd never read a gay romance but after finding it on a list of Bookbub recommendations in my inbox and reading the blurb I couldn't say no and now I couldn't be more pleased that I decided to give it a go as it's now become one of my favorite romances -straight or gay- of all time. I love it! I also love m/m romances now too because of it! Highly recommend <3"
I bought this book blind. I saw the author had great reviews and decided to read one. I did not read the blurb or anything. I was quite surprised to find it was m/m. It was pretty good. I liked the characters and the story kept my attention.
"The book was hot, steamy and full of new romance. This is only my second MM romance and it did not disappoint. There was some angst, a bit more tension, and a whole lot of sexy times throughout - which made for a great read.Alternating between the audio and ebook, I found that I really enjoyed the narrators in this story. I've listened to both in separate books before and feel like they were the right choices for this."
"I initially avoided this but then I read Good Boy and realized I was really missing out. Bowen and Kennedy have written a realistic story of love in our times. It isn't always about a man and a woman. The story of these two men is heartwarming, sexy and doesn't shy away from the problems gay couples face without making the story a political statement. It is a fantastic love story. I've read Us but would love to see them revisit Jamie and Wes! If not the WAGS series gives us great doses of them!"
"5 stars!This book is EVERYTHING! It is hockey, it is romance, it is a breakthrough of stereotypes about gay/bisexual men. It is a journey of discovery and a journey of acceptance. I just love this story. I've read it countless times and highly recommend reading the whole series. WESMIE 4EVA!"
"I just couldn't seem to get into the characters until 3/4 of the way through. Yes, the sex was pretty steamy but I just wasn't feeling it (no pun intended). I don't know if it was because it took so long to work up to the two of them finally admitting their feelings but, it just wasn't a page turner for the longest while. I'm still going to stick with it and read Us and hopefully, I'll enjoy this book a little more."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this one.  The character  development was excellent as was the relationship development and dialogue.  Both guys were intelligent, interesting and believable, and acted like I would imagine young hockey players would.  I've read Books by each of these authors and liked them, but I thought they were even better together.  Truly top notch writing. I read and loved the sequel too and hope they keep writing together- they are even better as a writing duo IMHO."
MM hockey romance that was written perfectly!! Wes and Jamie are nothing but beautiful. Their friendship and relationship is inspirational. I can’t wait for more of these two studs!
"I’ve been meaning to read this for a long time. Not sure why I waited so long. But I do know, I’m now kicking myself for it. This book is everything. That is all."
This was one of the sweetest books I have ever read. I love childhood friends turn lovers.And who doesn’t love to read about 2 hot hockey guys. Wes and Jamie are the perfect sports couple.
What a great story.  Love is love and boy do that have LOVE for each other…can’t wait to read US next.  Couldn’t put this one down until I finished it.
I loved this. I can't believe I waited so long to read it.The characters were well fleshed out and both the story and characters felt genuine. I like that we got both and Jamie's and Wes's points of view and got to experience both of their feelings. I will admit that I'm a sucker for Friends-to-Lovers stories and Bowen and Kennedy hit it out of the park.
"This story is so freakin' cute! I love how their relationship develops from friends to more than friends. I really enjoyed the openness they shared - you really get to know these guys along the way. The internal monologues were hilarious. Funny, sweet, and all the heart-lifting feels... a real winner. Bravo!"
"I wish there was a way to give it more than 5 stars.  It was so sweet and well thought out.  The characters were likeable, and you related to their struggles.  The sex scenes weren't uncomfortably descript, but still hot.  The ending feels complete, but it still leaves you wanting more.  I liked this book so much, I downloaded this authors other books (ALL OF THEM) as soon as I finished ""Him,"" and I'm in the middle of the Ivy Years now.  This may be one of my favorite books."
Wow. This book was great. I wasn’t sure what to expect but I definitely wasn’t disappointed. Wes and Jamie were both incredibly well written characters and you could feel their chemistry and connection on every page. Their love was epic and true and I enjoyed seeing them find their way to each other and fight for what they want. A must read for m/m fans.
"I can't say enough about this one. I don't usually read a book more than once, but not only did I read it as a Kindle unlimited, I went back and bought it to keep.  It's one of a very few I've read over and over.  It's a very heart warming story of love, commitment, and self-sacrifice.  Happily they decided the love they shared was worth the risk to their careers."
"I decided to read this because I have enjoyed a few of this authors other books. Even though I'm a straight woman, I really enjoyed this book because I really liked the characters. This proves that developing your characters is the key even in erotic romance! I didn't get into the ass play love scenes as much as in other books, but I found the story very enjoyable."
Another book that draws you and keeps you interested for more. I'm glad I found a book that had a sequel that continues the story. Enjoy the book a lot and finished it in 3 days. An excellent read.
"Wonderful, beautifully told story about the friendship and then love between two hockey players. Bowen and Kennedy  knew what they were doing when they wrote this one. Amazing, very adult read. Rita winner, which is a recommendation all by itself."
Loved it. It was a fast-paced read and just what I needed. Those who love MM romance will appreciate it.
I LOVE Sarina's writing. I LOVE Elle's writing. I LOVED them together. It is VERY hard to believe this book was written by two authors. Everything is seamless.This book. It was simply amazing.I loved Jamie's journey. I loved how Wes learned to let go. I loved the hockey. I loved the comradery between them. I just ... this whole book. Love. Love. Love.
"Didnt know what to expect when I decided to read Him.  I've got to admit this book grabbed me, couldn't put it down. Love at its best, Jamie and Wes made me see that it can exist .  Many emotions I felt for both of them, just a fun story that I would highly recommend. On to book 2... Us!"
"OUTSTANDING! Loved the hockey action, both Ryan and Jamie, and the development of the story was just captivating."
I thought it was sweet and heart felt and I loved the ending! And I just found out there is a sequel!!!
"Couldn't put this one down! Wonderfully romantic love story and molten hot, too. Lots of interesting hockey references, but not overloaded with them-- won't alienate a non-hockey fan."
"I loved this book. The story is well written, the main characters have depth, and even the supporting ones are great! Wes and Jamie are meant to be, and I can't get enough!"
"This book was beautifully written and was an immense pleasure to read.  I couldn't stop reading and ended up staying up all night to finish it in one sitting.  The characters were well-rounded and the hockey-related passages were intelligently written and included seamlessly.  There was a good mix of humor, angst, and smut throughout.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of sport-related M/M fiction."
Wow what a ride. I absolutely loved this story. Sexy guys and hockey and a great storyline. So many great momemts. I didn't want it to end. Must-read.
"I greatly enjoyed this book. I like that the character development was gradual, and that the characters were very human and complex. Erotic scenes definitely get an A plus, but I commend Bowen and Kennedy for having such a great storyline with characters that manage to get you thoroughly invested in 'Him'. One of my favorites! I'm looking forward to the sequel."
What a way to start the series. The development of their relationship and how much they both cared. Loved it and will read on.
I adored this book even though I wasn't really sure about the m/m story. It was marvelously wicked and sweet at the same time I will never ever look at purple skittles again without thinking of Wes and Jamie
"First book by this author and I really enjoyed it. Both main characters were well developed, very real and easy to relate to. Hot hockey sex too!"
"I love, love, LOVED this book - a perfect read for Pride month. It was so unbelievably romantic yet also so witty. I loved how both Cade and Selena were both so insecure because they thought the other was so perfect and way too good for them. It was truly adorable. I look forward to more books by this author.Thank you to Forever and Netgalley for my complimentary ARC. All opinions are my own."
"Obviously, I loved it - I rarely  give a full 5 stars. There’s a novel, creative, refreshing way to bring the MCs together. And what a fun cast of characters inhabit this book. It’s well written and of course it’s HEA. I got this as an audiobook. The narrator is new to me but I thought I would try it anyway. Karelia Stetz-Waters does a great job and I would go for audiobooks narrated by her."
"This book is phenomenal. A beautifully written work of art depicting the love story between two women and their journey in sexual awareness. It’s refreshingly sex-positive in that the levels of experience between both protagonists are vastly different but validating.It’s a quick read, hangover cure story. Very fluffy, and has that opposites-attract feel that is a personal favorite. I can’t say more except: READ IT ASAP!!100/5 recommend. You NEED THIS in your life.Triggers: Mentions of weed, alcohol, sex (a lot), emotional abuseThanks to NetGalley and Forever (Grand Central Publishing) for the ARC in exchange for an honest review and the opportunity to read this work of art."
"Cade and Selena are forced to work together after they each inherit 50% of a failing sex toy shop owned by Cade's aunt and Selena's mentor, Ruth. They have they're own reasons for trying to avoid the attraction that is building between them.I loved the way the grief Selena felt after Ruth's passing was handled. It was a really beautiful story of love growing in the wake of personal tragedy."
"Thank you to the publisher for the free book!The characters in this one are so lovable! The same way you can’t help but love Ted Lasso; you will love Cade and Selena!🥰Really Liked \\ 🔥high steam🤟Genuinely funny, heartwarming, opposites attract trope.📚Boyfriend Material + The Roommate🎶Simply Irresistible by Robert Palmer"
"Thank you to @readforeverpub for a copy of this book. I love the premise of this book with the idea of 2 complete opposites inheriting a sex shop. There was a lot of sex positivity in the book which I think is so important. There were a few laugh out loud moments too, a perfect rom com!"
"Satisfaction Guaranteed follows Cade and Serena as they navigate the tumultuous chore of keeping Ruth's feminist sex shop afloat after she passes. There are so many things this book does well. Discussions on female pleasure, the easy inclusion of sex toys in non-het relationships, and life after loss. This is a beautiful and funny sapphic love story."
"SATISFACTION GUARANTEED is an enjoyable read. The characters are fun, the story is cute, and certain parts are laugh-out-loud funny. A great pick for fans of lighthearted romantic comedies.Disclosure: I received a free copy of this book."
"Very cute sapphic story!It was a great setting, love that they had a quest. Saving a sex shop? Please sign me up!I enjoyed the characters, how silly they were, and how cute some scenes are.Would have love something else for this book but it was okay!"
"I loved this story, not least because the characters were relatable. Everyone knows someone like Selena, everyone knows someone like Cade and her parents. Not everything works out the way it's supposed to, and that's wonderful"
