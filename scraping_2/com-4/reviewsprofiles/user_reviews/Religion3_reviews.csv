Review
"My book was shipped with minimal packaging and it arrived damaged, and I never did hear back from the seller -just so you know.As for the book:Manly P Hall has played a BIG role in my journey; after listening to many of his lectures I started acquiring his books, and I’ve come to regard him as a properly motivated voice of reason. At the age of 46, I feel legit in saying that Manly P is “a teacher FOR all ages”.Surely you found your way here and are reading these words for a reason; not that I'm qualified to give advice to your personal journey, but I invite you to take-in the words and works of Manly P as a man with an astoundingly comprehensive understanding who speaks generously on behalf of truly honorable human potential. He uses big words and employs complicated concepts, but you should know that he's calling-out the best part of you while also morally-encouraging the stubborn parts of you (just in case the best parts don't wanna play), so keep your wise ears on and stay humble as you can.There are lots and lots of options out there -books and lectures and gurus and sages- in my search for stuff that tickles my intuition I’ve learned that I can always come back to Manly P and peel yet another layer from the onion of his life work and find relevance, affirmation, and humbling insight …I’m dazed anew by the tricky wisdom he hides in plain sight that I see only as my attention-span matures. HUMBLING!There's a reason religion exists, and philosophy, and even ignorance. Wisdom knows and history shows that the part we feed is the part that grows.It's easy like pie to believe we're more advanced than our ancestors, but for perspective, 'personal accountability' is the moral glue that holds any social structure together, and accountability isn't exactly trendy among the masses these days, in fact, it's tough to imagine an age more morally ignorant than we are today, and a society that makes a profitable virtue of its own self-destructive trends is the empirical opposite of advanced ...but don't take my word for it, read the book, then ask your untrendy conscience.With that said, it's no trendy set of circumstances in this day in age that lead a body to the likes of Manly P, so I don't suspect it's a stretch when I make the most admirable of assumptions about your motives and say ...it's an honor to be counted among you.-Best a luck out there!"
"If you're reading this review, then you already know about Manly P. Hall, so I won't get into that.The best edition to get is the hardcover University Edition printed in 2008. BUT if you want a cheaper paperback, make sure you get the authorized 2000 reduced facsimile of the 1988 Diamond Jubilee edition from the Philosophical Research Society (PRS). It's the only edition in print that is a true reprint of the original typography and illustrations in their correct places. All other editions are re-typeset, and some cluster all the color illustrations together rather than at the beginning of each chapter where they belong. The Reduced Facsimile is also the only edition that was authorized by Hall when he was still alive, and the only edition that contains ALL the original illustrations.The 2000 edition from PRS is very good quality with a sewn signature binding printed on heavy photo paper. DON'T get the Dover edition or the ""Readers"" edition!! Much of the value in this text is the beautiful typography and illustrations. It's not worth owning it otherwise. A cheap used copy of the facsimile edition can be easily found for under $10. I got mine for $2.99 and it's beautiful."
"The paperback includes almost nothing that the original book contains, non of the pictures nor explanations.The text sizing is microscopic and crammed together, the paper quality is the same you'd find used straight out of a home printer.This version is printed by ""Pacific Publishing Studio."" the lowest budget version of this book I have ever seen."
"Fantastic revelations about the occult traditions of the West, frequently and unfairly demonized by Christianity. Very clearly explains how the ultimate aim of the occult and hermetic teachings is the moral perfection of man and the uplifting of human consciousness in order to be able to spiritually commune with the divine through direct experience, and ultimately attain the true purpose of life."
"For kindle edition, get this one as it has images while other do not:https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B018TNRCOG&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_VtUjzbKZ8YZ2T"
"The blue hardcover is the Jubilee Edition with the proper illustration placement, in color, non-pixelated"
I bought this as my second copy to see if it was worth the price. My first copy is the one that Amazon sells for under $20.00 and that copy is amazing it has pictures and it more presentable as a book. This $10.00 version of the book seems as if the publisher bought an e-book then decided to print the e-book to make a profit out of it. Don't Buy This Copy unless you like to throw away money.
"This review is not for the book which is excellent, but for the cheap public domain reproduction I got. Comparing it to another copy, there are several entire chapters that are missing (why?). They are particularly interesting chapters. Also my copy has zero illustrations. Wish I could return this crap but it’s too late. I think it’s a travesty to print any book with multiple missing chapters. Shame."
"So the point of this book was the photos, the art along with the explanation. as autobiography of a yogi explains certain concepts can only be explained with art, as a function of a bicameral brain.I only bought this version because a different review said it had the art.No art, then the very idea of how the ideas were to be conveyed in the item is missing."
"This book is very well researched. Though it is from the early 20th century it is elaborate and well crafted. It is surprisingly thorough in it's coverage of aspects of occult history that has been lost in recent decades. Many essential cosmic truths are presented in a way in which, obscured by other sources, this book clearly and plainly lays out. The discussions of profound and archaic material open up to any reader effulgent examples of inner workings of mystery teachings and traditions. The conceptual accuracy and adherence to the referencing and modern (of it's time) analysis of historical periods makes for a desirable continuity and an understanding of those things intended to be passed down unobscured to initiates. Some of the stories have not been told since those times, and in chaotic repetitions at that, and this has lent obscurity to the study of this divergent and misunderstood doctrine. It is well worth checking into if you're a seeker of the psychic domains, if you pursue illumination,or are just a parapsychology buff. There is something here for the serious student and for those who like to explore the entertainment of readings on mythology, powers of belief and superstition in ancient societies. There is enlightening from the close contrasts on scriptures and the gospel and holy writings as the sophisticated structure of the period pieces that parallels the traditions of other locales and times and associated sources alluded to and isolated instances of realized prophecies. This book places in context the vastly hidden and enduring affinity some have and share in the realm of antiquity and for a book to do that it has to be enormously able to counter and contradict the dispellings of the skeptics and consequentially present the unvarnished (and varnished) truths that have substance and that are never divulged to the mundane and secular world. This book would be a welcome addition and contribution to any library and is a unique treasure."
"That it is a hefty volume, in new condition, delivered promptly, is what earned it its two stars.But the book itself is a massive disappointment - one could even call it a hack job - as there is so much content from complete versions that is missing.  The Bembine Tale of Isis, Fundamentals of Qabbalistic Cosmogony Ain Soph; The Tree of the Sephiroth; The Fraternity of the Rose Cross; both parts of The Theory and Practice of Alchemy; Bacon, Shakespeare, and the Rosicrucians; the Mysteries and Their Emissaries; and all of the color plates that contextualize the images Hall seeks to describe are missing from this version altogether.  In terms of information-per-dollar, I suppose it's worth the ten bucks, and Amazon did their job here, but I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this version as the right place to start with this line of reading."
Excellent book on occult and magick and the whole nine yards.  A great one to read to introduce yourself to the occult.
"you can buy this item brand new at the philosophical research centers website, i was unaware of this and overpaid for a used copy. still amazing book"
"I wish I read this 20 years ago. It was engrossing and fascinating. Secret societies (primarily freemasonry), ancient to modern religions, and their connections.... symbology, wisdom, flaws and accomplishments. I just finished and I plan to read it again."
"The book is what I expected, but some parts of the book came damage because of the way it was packed. In that sense very disappointed."
"Like some of the other reviews have said, it did arrive damaged because there was no packaging in the box. Aside from the front cover being a dog-eared it seems to be in good condition. Very excited about this purchase."
There's a great deal of info in this thick book.  Very happy with my purchase.
"Manly P. Hall's writings are, in my opinion, stupendous. I highly recommend reading the majority of his works and a great place to start is with The Secret Teachings of All Ages. This book serves as a wonderful encyclopedia and introduction in to all sorts of topics ranging from symbolism to ancient ways of thought. I highly recommend this book. In fact...buy two. Once you read it you may find that you want to give one to a close friend. It is an eye opener."
"One of Manly Hall’s best works. Caught this on a sale and it came plastic wrapped in pristine condition. Works well as an encylclopedia for those with little to no base knowledge and more than enough info for the rest. The color plates look great. Note that this, the university edition, and the diamond jubilee facsimile are the only copies with all the plates in tact and in proper order."
"Great book. Two points to make that have nothing to do with the core message of this book. There are no illustrations so do not expect there to be. Second point is most likely this will coming through USPS and they have a knack for bending things up as you are aware, I am sure. Great for any lover of Manly P. Hall's content such as myself."
Took me over two years to finally finish this book but it was a worthwhile journey to take. The introspection invoked by reading was truly rewarding and worthwhile.
"True knowledge proofs timeless facing the ages of mankind- Be ready to be taught to be- Be ready to remember how to be- Be ready to know that you areNo matter the price, continue your journey till the end as good awaits for you at the conquering of every step!"
"This was a great read!! The in depth exploration of spiritual philosophies,from culture to culture as expressed historically, and geographically gave me the understanding that through out time and across the globe the common threads of spiritual thought and often expression persists in human consciousness,sometimes, seemingly, with little or no physical contact. Which leads me to believe that there is an innate understanding that true seekers into the nature of human existence eventually arrive at. How the tennants,and parables, of all major religions find their roots in the ""Pagan"" spiritual disciplines demonstrates human connectivity on a level that seems incomprehensible.The universal ""Flood"" story is just one example.  The secret societies formed the spiritually intellectual brotherhoods to propel humanity on an upward trajectory by recruiting bright,intelligent,worthy youth capable of absorbing, continuing, and advancing the traditions, concepts, and philosophies. I imagine this might have been tremendously difficult due to the fact that living, and surviving in the earliest part of mans history depended on spending an inordinate amount of time hunting for food, drinkable water, building and maintaining adequate shelter, and fending off enemies. Literacy levels were extremely low. Who had the time to really consider the mysteries of life when you were consumed with just trying to live.What I discovered that was really exciting for me was the fact that man, in and of himself, is truly incomprehensible.Capable of incredibly expansive concepts, and more importantly accomplishments. As someone who thinks of myself as a struggling seeker this book is inspirational. I'm more than certain that organizations like the Free Masons, and perhaps others that have remained unknown continue these traditions which with the current state of the world leaves me hopeful that we can eventually move beyond the fragmented circumstances that plague humanity and strive for a more worthy unity of man. I highly recommend this book."
"The printed version I bought here is the same one I found at my library. A perfectly respectable reprint. B&W graphics are fine, colored middle section graphics are fine. Saw a lot of complaining about the ebook in the reviews but the physical printed soft cover version being sold atm is great"
"No Pics, tiny font, not even encyclopedic. This feels like someone's pet project. I imagine some dude at Kinkos,  running off copies."
"do not buy this book. it is a terrible reproduction saturated with spelling errors and all of the necessary illustrations have been removed. TERRIBLE> get the original, it's only several dollars more."
"Accomplished synthesis of various esoteric teachings, often in relation to their contribution to freemasonry.  A true classic."
Amazingly well researched book and a great staying place for anyone looking into mysteries cultures. Remember that there are three meanings to everything and you'll learn more from this book than any single secular book you've read.
"Review of: ""The Secret Teachings of All Ages: An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy,"" Paperback – March 21, 2011, by Manly P. Hall  (Author).This is an excellent text which provides an overview of esoteric research authored by the eminent Manly P. Hall.  Background: ""Manly P. Hall (1901-1990) founded the Philosophical Research Society in 1934, a non-profit organization dedicated to the dissemination of useful knowledge in the fields of philosophy, comparative religion and psychology. In his long career, spanning more than 70 years of dynamic public activity, Mr. Hall delivered over 8000 lectures in the United States and abroad, authored over 150 books and essays, and wrote countless magazine articles.""This text investigates and provides an scholarly article on each of the following subjects as descending order chapters:  ""The Ancient Mysteries and Secret Societies Which Have Influenced Modern Masonic Symbolism,"" page 1.  ""The Ancient Mysteries and Secret Societies, Part Two,"" page 7.  ""The Ancient Mysteries and Secret Societies, Part Three,"" page 11.  ""Atlantis and the Gods of Antiquity,"" page 16.

The articles as published in this work are written in smallish font (10?) and are packed into 205 pages.  What is missing in this text from the original publication of 1928 are the numerous plates.  The original text was repleat with art and photographs to assist the reader in comprehending what Mr. Hall was explaining.  This is still an excellent resource and reference and I will not remove a star for the lack of art or photo plates.  Well done at five stars."
I have been chasing the grail for a great number of years and purchased this book because numerous folk have asked me for a basic book that discusses the traditional mysteries of life.  You simply cant' beat Hall.In fact I have an old friend (Alchemist aged 95) who grouses to me all the time that when he was compiling his own library Hall was beating him to all the used book stores and snapping up all the occult literature.If you wish to pursue this line of inquiry further you might consider buying William G. Grays books and if interested in the Tarot then the master is Paul Foster Case.  This book of Hall's will give you a good overview and is well worth the money spent.  Keep On Questing.
"Manly P. Hall's work is phenomenal!  However, the version (shown in the picture) published by CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform; Reprint edition (March 21, 2011) does have errors/typos and lacks the beautiful illustrations that the 1988 Diamond Jubilee edition from the Philosophical Research Society (PRS) has.  Nonetheless, this version is worth having for everyday use."
"There is A LOT of information in this book and it can take quite a while to get through, but it's such intriguing information. I found myself reading a paragraph or two, re-reading it and then just contemplating it - sometimes for minutes, sometimes for days. I'm a fast reader, but it took me a long time to absorb the information. Learning the allegorical meaning or the real-world figures behind these stories was amazing.The one complaint I have is that this edition doesn't have pictures like the other editions do."
"It seems to contain all of the original info, but has no pictures. It's made in a clunky format - large pages with small font. So it can be crammed into 130-something pages. Don't buy it from amazon by the way. They have cretins working at their warehouse and your book will get bent, due to poor packaging. You'll have to return it."
I thought it would be smaller like a 8x10 photo but it's more like a 10x12. It has small words but covers so much. I am excited to start reading.
"If you subscribe to ancient history, then find the original or the dated reprint of this book by Manly P Hall (The Secret Teachings of All Ages). This copy is worthless."
"I purchased this book in hardback many years ago. It’s a classic. In hardback it’s a beautiful book. However, it’s so beautiful I hated to thumb through it because I wanted to keep it in perfect condition. Now I can enjoy it fully in my Kindle version."
"This is an excellent text for anyone interested in Esoteric teachings from ancient times onward.  The author covers just about anything you've heard of and probably a lot that you haven't.  The color plates and illustrations  are excellent and there is an amazing amount of information packed into  this book.  One problem arises, however: some of the information is  outdated when newer discoveries are taken into account.  The author wrote  the book something like 80 years ago and though it's been through  revisions, it still contains information that probably should be updated.  That is a rare instance however, and I'd say 99% of this book is accurate,  right on the money, and DEFINITELY worth the price.  You probably won't  find another source that covers as much as well.  Buy it, borrow it,  whatever, it is worth the time to read."
"The Kindle version of this book is terribly exhausting to read. It skips many pages, and is full of typos. I'm having a very hard time making it through even the preface."
"This encyclopedia is a must have. The amount of knowledge in here is tremendous. Our 'education' system no longer teaches the wisdom or cultures of the ancient past, yet that knowledge forms everything around us. This is a wonderful journey through the ages and a must have for anyone that loves to learn and exercise their brain beyond the mind destroying dribble that is passed as knowledge today. Enjoy!"
"Much better than the ""readers"" version. Immense."
Great reading
"The author gives a very detailed chronology of information. Much of what is written is based on information that may now not be published. It is quite interesting though. The reader will need to be careful and prepared to understand much of what is written. I have found it difficult to plough through, yet quite rewarding. If you are interested in understanding many of the symbols and meanings given in the book, be patient."
Very interesting
Very nice edition. Includes foldouts and color plates not found in cheaper editions.
Vey informative and easy to digest so much information
Still reading. So far great book. Very informative
Awesome thanks
Not one picture. Extremely small lettering. Will shop again on another site.
"Large book, small writing"
"There is nothing wrong with the contents of the book,  I would havepreferred a thicker book.  This copy is difficult to read, the lines are to long and the print to small."
"Still didn’t finish reading it, full of information, a great book that I’m grateful to myself for buying it"
"Among the many books that hall has written, this is a tour-de-force. It is plodding in places, due to the nature of the material and Hall's desire to fully cover all aspects. However, the reader with patience and perseverence will be well rewarded with this book. It enlarged my horizons significantly."
"Product itself arrived as expected, but the enclosed invoice showed 50% of what I was charged, so it seems someone skimmed $60. Would love to be issued a refund for the difference."
"I had a paperback copy of this book years ago.  I loaned it out and never got it back.  The Kindle price was very low so I got it on Kindle.  There is more information in this book than I will be able to read in the rest of my life, but it's good to have it as a reference book."
Print is way too small in this addition and the pictures are all but gone
"Great book for masonic kabbalists. However the print is small, due the vast amount of information inside."
"Excellent source of information.Information that religions are based on but, never before have the basic building blocks of religions have been thoroughly discussed. Also, gives you a small glimpse inside secret societies. Long read but worth every ounce of reading!"
"This most wonderful book arrived impeccably in all ways; within the time frame expected, wrapped cleanly in plastic, and having a nice new crispness to the pages as I opened this marvelous book. I would highly recommend anyone interested in esotericism and any of the healing arts to get this for their collection, AND to order it from The Philosophical Research Society, where this book is published from.Thank you again, Nathalie"
"Great book!, I took away one star for the font size.(very small) I cant read the book without a magnifying glass. The art work is great and content is awesome as expected of Mr. Hall. This needs to be a larger book."
"This book combines esoteric information from many different schools of thought in one massive volume. The information is in depth and also has many illustrations. Quite the reference book! If you cant find something on it here, it will be difficult to find elsewhere (or at all). A must have for anyone interested in this type of knowledge!"
Great  read
This book will change the way you perceive the world
Are you open to new things? No honestly are you ready to go beyond that wish you think you know? Come on I dare you? Go for it
"This note is for readers who might be thinking of purchasing this book and wonder which version they should buy. At the time of this writing, the best easily available complete version of of the original work is the hardcover volume published by Philosophical Research Society in 2008. This volume has 54 color plates and over 200 black and white illustrations. Unfortunately, this book is quite large and heavy and also expensive so this is the version that will hopefully be produced as an ebook some day. The current paperback version published by Tarcher in 2003 has only 16 color plates and approximately 100 illustrations but the text is not abridged, and I assume that this is also true for the Tarcher Kindle version that is now available. Some other printed or ebook versions may have no color plates or illustrations at all, so be careful and try to be sure of the book's contents before you buy."
"Decent book for anyone interested in esoterica. Was disappointed because this book was without the illustrations that make it such a special book in first place. Difficult read, especially without illustrations. I expected more for price."
"I'm a big fan of Manly P. Halls books, I've got quite a few and would have everyone if I could - a very may well have if I live long enough... the man is obviously a genius and should be read by anyone in search of the truth... I recommend it, of course!"
Awfully long and not a lot gained. I could summarize thus: All the major religions are simply derivations of the ancient mystery cults.
"It contains alot but it is an edited, downsized version.  Missing probably at least 5 chapters. The book itself was clean, in excellent condition and a nice size for reading.  Just unhappy with getting an edited version.  When I want a specific book, I want the whole book, not just part of it."
"Whether it's all fact or not, this book is good stuff for serious students of Freemasonry. Richly thoughtful material. Wow."
"A veritable condensed version of the original publication, not illustrated, but complete textual chapters. I leave it on my coffee table with a few select books for guest exposure. Manly P. Hall is one of the greats for contemporary study in a broad and eclectic field for the serious student and teacher.  Kudos!"
Great book
"A note about editions. The CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform; Reprint edition (March 21, 2011) contains no plates or illustrations.Two other versions, both for sale on the Amazon website, contain the plates and illustrations. I prefer those."
Thank you!
Too deep thoughts. It's hard to understand and follow it.
"I have chosen this book to be the top raffle item in our bi annual meeting.  It has so much information that I have not even scratched the surface. For the modern mystic, this is a good reference."
Thank you!
Lots of perteninent information. Surprisingly published almost 100 years ago.
Good review and information on teachings.
"I have  been reading this book on kindle. The electronic book lacks the illustrations and that will make it little easier to understand the concepts. I ordered this printed version because the reviews says it is full of illustrations, many in color; but many are black and white and tiny. I wonder if a facsimile of the original publication have more illustrations or at least they are full page. The typeset on the book is medium size and the book weights 2.21 lbs.The content of the book is a primer on many belief systems and practices throughout the history of mankind. It is a good starting point for identifying and directing the beginning studies of many philosophies."
A Master piece. Have the Jubilee edition.A must own for your library
A+
"Be warned, this edition has  NO ILLUSTRATIONS!  There is only the type-written copy."
A must read  😁Even if just for the historical content. Manly is an inspiration.  World would be a better place with more like him.
Interesting
"The reviews for this were very confusing as they implied that the paperback had pictures.  There is not one picture in this version, which was the main reason I purchased this book.  Very disappointed."
Still reading. This book provides a lot of background insight into the life issues wi like to ponder. The book also inspired one to dig deeper and ask more questions
I am building a library of unusual books that teach me unusual things. I thought this would be an excellent addition to my library
"Giving this one star.  I've had other editions of this same book but have loaned them out and never got them back, thought it'd be great to have a copy again, but this edition has zero illustrations.  That was a major part of this work so having zero illustrations really sucked.  So the people loving this and saying ""great illustrations"" must not of gotten this one, Pacific Publishing Studio, 2011.  Totally disappointed.  They left out one one of the best parts so I feel I was totally ripped.  No where in the description does it say this edition has no illustrations."
"Struggling with what to rate this. The delivery was very fast. The product looks like it WOULD HAVE been fairly priced for what I would have gotten, but the back cover has been ripped off, mangled, and glued to the box."
"Very nice book, and fast delivery"
Everything was great
Mint condish.I recommend anyone interested in this work to order one of these older hardback editions. Paperback editions are small and have low res illustrations. I have both paper- and hardback and the difference is huge.
Very sacred and full of mystical knowledge for the initiated into the hidden mysteries.
Amazing
A very informative (sometimes too informative) and interesting history of philosophy and religion. Manly Hall's book is THE authoritative text.
"Excellent book..Hall delivers a lot of crucial info for the serious student of lost knowledge and occult learning...highly recommended....and remember to ""read between the lines""..."
Just started reading this book. But I just wanted to comment on the graphics. The illustrations are not that good in this version. I saw the 2003 version at borders ($25) and the graphics in that one is in color and is easier to see. I am purchasing the 2003 version for my library.
Great stuff if you're a confirmed mystic and are prepared to wade through all the fine print.  Not for the casual reader.
Literally just buy this book and read it.
"Manly P Hall is genius, If you're looking for a book that will open your perspective then this is it!"
"Great read, take your time."
It's a hard read but really good.
"Excellent source of esoteric knowledge. With this Kindle version, there are diagrams missing."
I like it
I'm still reading the book but it's a masterpiece!
Thank you.
I learned much from this book!
"The book itself is good, but this is a terrible edition. From my count, there are ten missing chapters plus a missing introduction. That is probably a third of the content of the original book. Also, this edition is devoid of any illustrations."
Really interesting book!
"Great service, haven't finished this one yet but so far very interesting to me!"
Greeaat!!!!!!
No hard cover. Print level of a primary school. Sad.
"Not your everyday read for everyman, or woman, as the case may be. No pretty pictures. No richly illustrated charts. No funny jokes. Nothing to break up the old thought train. Just pure knowledge. The kind of bread that carries deep down nourishment. You are pretty much guaranteed to discover some new insight into old concepts. And, you are pretty much guaranteed to rediscover what you thought you already knew in a different light, so to speak. No, can't say this book is for everyman. However, I am sure glad to have it in my hands. I think this is some of Manly P. Hall's very best work, and I am sincerely thankful for that."
Didn't realize I was buying an outline. Was hoping for more information!
Wonderful book! I thoroughly enjoyed!
"good, informative reading"
the best book ever...
"If your into the occult or esoteric, this is a must read text."
"Wow! I am an artist and poet and always looking for symbolic relationships within nature and society. I first checked this book out at my local library and had to have it!  It is interesting what people believe and how they came up with these teachings. I am glad I could find them all in one book, even though it is an overview of many teachings I do find it entertaining. I loved that it had a selectable table of contents and other features that others did not have. But the Holy Bible is still My favorite book for knowledge and understanding of man and Society. This book has some funny interpretations of it. Don't get me wrong this book has some stuff that will blow your mind!"
A+
as expected!!!!
"Good content, but badly put together with poor quality illustrations"
"cool book. glad i bought it. if you find occult symbols interesting, this is ur book."
good read. i like it
i like it
I have just started reading the book. However it does promise to have the material I am looking for. One of my hobbies is the study of ancient text.The book itself is very well made. A very good price and value. I plan to buy more in the future from this source.
Great seller. The book is in great shape.
"I bought this book after having read a mixture of secret society, esoteric, and hermetic related works. I am one of those who, though christian, has a genuine interest in the ""real"" purpose of religion and Manly Hall's book was an intense wake-up call to the fact that humanity has, for ages, been practicing the same methods of worship and rituals still used today. Hall details how certain familiar themes and stories have been used in all types of societies from Egyptian, Greek, Persian, Christian and so forth. This book will be very interesting to any Widowed Son, especially those with questions of where practices like being raised by the ""lion's paw"" grip or the immense importance of the Great Pyramid come from.

Very Good(needed) books
The secret teachings of all ages is still a classic. Manly P. Hall revealed a great deal of truths for those seeking knowledge
Interesting
This tome is astounding in it's ability to clarify the obscure and to ignite the creative imagination. Modernity has been characterized by a loss of the transcendent. Manly P. Hall's book offers the receptive a way to reconnect with what has been lost.
"My negative review is not for the content as far as the information, but for the formatting of this edition. It is a large book, probably 8 x 10, with a small font size. I find it difficult to read. It would probably get a 5 if it were more user friendly.I read a great deal of nonfiction and this is by far the most difficult to read from a set-up perspective. Dissappointing."
"I have tried for several years to abtain this book, I finally was successful, it is a true treasure, amazon has them right now for $132.00 dollars. The best deal I've seen in years, while they last. Book seller's like ""BLUESKY"" will try to pawn them off for $250 dollars.  At the cost of several books that the amazon book seller's, said that they had. Anyone want to buy a different copy, let me know. I have several of them, that I didn't order, several hundred' s of  dollars latter."
excellent!
Genius.
the work is the most comprensive study of the genre bar none. A must have for the library of any budding scholar!Mr. George E Haynes
Good
"The book certainly has an exhaustive amount of data.  However,  I'll probably get the most out of it when I can have someone read it to me.  The print is just too small for easy reading and makes what should be an enjoyable experience into a labor.  I do not understand why the publishers present the text in such a hard format to read."
I enjoyed.
"When buying a book that discusses symbols and symbolism, it would be nice to see what the author is talking about. This book is NOT the real Secret Teachings. It's a rip off that only has the text. Buy the Reader's Edition here on Amazon. It's not that much more expensive."
I really enjoy reading this book. It gives a lot of good book references.
fascinating
"Let me start of by saying this is one of the best books ever written, a truly astonishing compendium of far flung information, strewn about millenia and continents.. one wonders at his own library! I will be referencing this book for ages and lifetimes...it's a great reminder that the rabbit hole keeps going and going.Unfortunately this printing, pacific publishing studioThere are NO photos, none of the prints diagrams, sigils, drawings, illustrations that are half of the importance and grip of this book, I ordered it specifically because I assumed this was the correct version.[note: there is one small tetragrammaton]I do like the typeface, and large pages and everything but if the images are important keep searching, it is a good reference besides."
I love it
"This is an awesome book and everyone should own a copy for themselves.  The only problem with this particular one is there are black and white pages.  I wanted the color copy, but this is still a very informative book."
If you enjoy readings about teachings that are not taught to you unless you find it yourself than this is your read. The copy I had has some miss spellings and bad prints but it's small to the size of the text.
"Pieces of the truth are in this book. Let's not share, instead let us seek those with the sight, and learn."
Highly recommended
It's an incredible book worth reading. Manly P Hall is an astonishing writer. This book is an eye opener !
Not bad at all.
Quite enjoyable and educational
"The createspace edition of this timeless classic is the worst thing I have ever had the displeasure of laying my eyes upon.  No illustrations, tiny, cramped, illegible text and misspellings make this the first book I've ever seriously wanted to burn.  Budget conscious buyers should get the Reader's Edition.  The createspace version is a travesty.  Shame on you createspace.  Shame!"
"Please, please, please DO NOT buy this version.  Listen to the other reviewers and buy the other edition.  This was so full of typos, no pictures, font meant for head-aches.  Love the author but whoever put out this edition, just threw in the towel and did about as bad a job as possible."
"I owned a leather bound copy of this book about 20 years ago when I became a Mason. Somewhere along the way I lost the book, and now most copies are cost prohibitive. At this point I'm just enjoying have this priceless wisdom on my iPad. This book is a treasure trove of philosophic & metaphysical information, and this ebook does it justice."
found it to be very insightful. would purchase more of these books.
Interesting the overall book was very interesting to say the least.I found myself questioning a few topics and doing a little more research to find the truth or the reason why it was written in this mannerWithout telling you the secrets nor spoiling the book I would say pick up a copy and read for yourself.
"Incredibly hard to read!  Extremely small print...pictures left out!  Original was over 600 pages, and this one has a little over 200 pages!  Get the Readers Edition!  Horrible purchase!"
"This book is printed in small font, like size 8, and narrow margins on the pages as if to pack the maximum number of words per page. The book looks very uninviting to read and I have placed it on the shelf and ordering another version, The Secret Teachings Of All Ages, Readers Edition, Illustrated and over 700 pages."
"This is amazingly insightful book, well worth the money and the time that you'll put into it. The facts are great, the images, symbolism, explanations are all great and are made simple to understand. The only reason I rated this a 4 rather than a 5 is because of the Author. Obviously Manly P Hall was fairly brilliant, but some of his assumptions and oppinions are questionable. Read for the facts and you wont be dissapointed."
"I am giving this a premature 4 Star due to the density of this book. I was excited when I got it today, and then I flipped through. The text is...you'll need readers if you're not 20/20. I actually feel as though that is putting more information into what could be a much larger and costly book. I've only read a little thus far. Seems like an intense, yet easy read. Being that this is a subject I'm into, I could be biased on content. It covers a bit (I skimmed a page or two from each section) and I've already purchased other books on my main interests, so I figure I won't mind any generalizations. If I hate it in the end..I'll be back to share."
"This is an abridged publication that looked like someone printed from a cheap source. DO NOT buy this edition, follow the advice of the other reviews and get the Reader's edition. I started reading this particular publication and because of the font, the barely visible pictures, the typos, edited text, I was a bit turned off, for the subject material was interesting but it didn't make sense that the beginning of the book was left out [among many other parts] that I had previewed on a full online publication of the whole book.Get the Reader's edition, the one with the Phoenix/Aquila illustration on the cover. That one is the real copy, not this one."
Very interesting and thorough overview of esoteric teachings.
This book was very interesting
"This book is filled with nuggets of knowledge.  It is a long read, but well worth the time and effort.  It has some archaic spellings and words, so patience is required if you seek further information on topics via the internet.  Overall a very satisfying read which answers many questions.  Highly recommend."
Love the information available here in one book from this author. A must for the library of those seeking to know more and thyself!
Great read! Very informative!
"Tiny printing!  One needs a magnifyer to begin......p l e a s e!Informative book of ancient teachings, however insufficient, to gain full knowledge....whets the appetite and lists additional sources in bibliography."
Love it. Dense reading material - love all of it!
"This is an OUTSTANDING book that is well documented, has great information and beautiful color presentations.  This is a wonderful book for research purposes.  The time and talent invested is awesome."
I can't take the 2011 version seriously with all the typos.  I don't know how a book can be published in this quality unless it was done poorly intentionally.  Find the old version.
a treasure in my library
"In a simple way, If you are looking for an EXCELLENT book on occultism and ancient wisdom...BUY THIS BOOK NOW!"
Fantastic
Great book
"Being the pragmatic person that I am --- reading this very esoteric book ""The Ancient Teachings of All Ages"" and trying to correlate or reconcile anything useful in respects to present day knowledge is very difficult.  The sagas and stories he relates in this tome are somewhat confusing with all the different foreign words and names unless one has a ""good background"" in these esoteric works.  Therefore this book may be difficult to follow for the average layman. On the other hand we have this young writer-- Dr. Joseph P. Farrell's whose works although highly speculative seem logical both materialistically and spiritually today! Farrell is also a prolific writer as was Mr. Hall-- with a slew of books relating to varied subjects such as alchemy, genetics, physics, transhumanism as well as the study of esoteric knowledge.""The ultimate question is no longer ""who am I"" or ""why am I here."" These questions were answered in the earliest civilizations by philosophers and priests. Today we live in an age of such rapid advances in technology and science that the ultimate question must be rephrased: what shall we be? This book investigates what may become of human civilization, who is setting the agenda for a trans-humanistic civilization, and why.The modern Victor Frankenstein holds a high political office, carries diplomatic immunity, and is most likely funded by the largest corporations worldwide. His method is ancient: alchemy. His fraternities are well known and their secrets are well kept, but his goal of times past and present is the same; he dares to become as god, genetically manipulating the seeds of the earth, the beasts on the fields, and to claim legal ownership over humanity by re-creating it in his own image. This is no fairy tale, science fiction, or conspiracy theory ... it simply is!Transhumanism, a Grimoire of Alchemical Agendas by Dr.'s. Joseph P. Farrell and Scott D. de Hart lifts the veil from the macabre transhumanistic monster being assembled and exposes the hidden history and agenda that has set humanity on a collision course for the Apocalypse.Joseph P. Farrell, PhD, is the author of the best-selling Genes, Giants, Monsters, and Men: The Surviving Elites of the Cosmic War and Their Hidden Agenda.""Farrell's works are based on speculation but Farrell's books offer's very good documentation to support his theories/axioms or assertions. Manly P. Hall appears not to want to go where Farrell has and has keeps his works relative safe within the accepted dogma of mainstream thought of that era or even with today's dogmas!One caveat however, is when I listened to one lecture given by Manly P. Hall in his twilight years that was posted on Y-tube -----I was quite impressed how he had changed his outlook or views. His philosophies were changing and he reached out to expand his horizons and discussed ET's, Atlantics, as well as other matters relating to mankind's very ancient history and beliefs!(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGduJ-d3p5s). Who says you can't teach old dog new tricks? I have and have benefited from new concepts!Manley's' works are masterpieces of the various cults, religions, and sects that may have existed eons ago but hard to fathom in view of today's knowledge as well as technologies. Nevertheless, it is a worth while read and enlightening as to how mankind interacted with regards to the religion, cults, and secret societies from the prospective of his time line with material that was available (1927).It is interesting that the MASONIC BROTHERHOOD conferred the covet 33 degree on him without him ever be physically initiated into this ancient society.I think Hall's teachings have merit and should be studied but be prepared to research a multitude of places, people, events and things----a virtual roller coaster of a ride---one can get lost within the labyrinths of his prose! It actually merits a 5 star rating merely because of the exhaustive researching this young man did backing 1927.Incidentally, take the advice of some of the other reviews and get the book with the colored illustrations-----its like the Chinese express---one picture is worth a thousand words!"
"The CreateSpace paperback edition is an absolute disaster -- This is a NO STARS review. The book is full of typos, is hard to read, and there are NO illustrations. This could have been a real buy, but the problems make it very difficult to read and understand. I'm sending the copy I just got back for a refund. I am extremely disappointed."
It was almost totally unreadable because of the bad formatting. Just pay the $3 for the version that is readable on a Kindle.
"I bought the paperback CreateSpace edition and it is NOT the same book that was full of wonderful illustrations.What it is full of are typos! It reads like someone scanned a copy of the older book and then used bad text recognition software to throw this together. No wonder it's so much cheaper. BEWARE of this version!!If I could give it zero stars, I would. :("
Amazing work of knowledge about some of the greatest ancient civilization on earth. Definitely not for close minded people that are not open and don't deserve the treasures of the greatest truths of mankind. One of the most extent and professional research put on one solid piece of work.
"Really amazing information, written in a very un-academic manner. I keep finding myself wanting to have some sources to research some of the author's claims deeper"
"you know i love reading mythology and ancient mysteries. So, it is just fine with me. It is just me, and it is my life style."
Too cursory...not enough information given on any of the traditions...kind of rambling.
A roller coaster of dense philosophy coupled with engaging historical events and stories. The conclusion makes for a great preface. I suggest starting there.
Interesting publication. I would guess these teachings are no longer secret. I wonder why.I may have to read it again.
This is one of the most impressive philosophical works of all time!
A good overview of cults through the ages.
As always Manley Hall has shared good information
Anything Brother Hall has to say is worth listening to.
"Disappointed with this version. I ordered the book based on reviews I read on here stating that the book contained illustrations. Also the text looks very hard to read, the leading is just too close between sentences and there seems to be no break or breathing room. Will be returning for a refund."
love this book
You should read this book
yes
This is a great book and I appreciate the seller also.
A very good book!
Very nice
All that I expected it to be. I firsts canned it now I reading for more insight. May I will give a further review upon completion.
"I was looking forward to having a nice hardcopy of the Secret Teachings, as I had read some electronic versions in the past.  The book has a nicely styled cover and exterior artwork - and that is all I can say good about the book.  Typeset is very, very small - which is a trade off in print production, but isn't very easy to read.  Also there are so many text problems that it really does seem to be unreadable.  I am not sure if an OCR was done on a previous text or what the problem was but there are misspellings, word replacements, etc. that make this book a waste of time and money for me.You are probably better off finding an electronic copy and reading that."
"The book was in great condition and this was the version I was looking for, with the illustrations large enough to view and the colored pictures are beautiful!"
This book is a great example of how secret societies are heavily tied into esoteric beliefs and the lucifarian agenda. I do an internet podcast and a vlog so this works out perfect for the purpose of pointing out some of the beliefs of the masons.
"I bought this edition because of the price, and got what I paid for.  It does not contain the original ""Introduction"" chapter, it has NO illustrations, and contains typos.  I returned it and ordered the ""Readers Edition"", which is actually authorized by the PRS.  It costs a little more, but is worth it.This edition is published by CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, and is taking advantage of the fact that the book is in the Public Domain."
"I love reading this book, and owning it--I can put notes in the side sections. Very interesting!"
Not a single illustrations of any kind and just text.  Wonderful since the book deals with symbols as well.  It is NOT a copy of the original book.  Do not buy this book.
"Written a hundred years ago, but the Mystery remains..."
It is a good book for thinkers.
"Great read, so in-depth and detail, love it"
"It is truly a one of a kind, often imitated but never replicated, It's a must have in one's esoteric home library."
"I perused an older hardcover copy of this book at a lodge brother's house and was so impressed, I ordered it on the spot.It was full of full page color plates and numerous illustrations.  I immediately deemed it a necessary component of my library.I received my copy today, and there isn't a single illustration or plate that the version I looked at had.Since it is a book on symbolism, symbols would be a nice addition.My advice would be to try and find an older edition.David GeorgePalo Alto Chapter #93Los Altos Lodge #712"
Great gift!
This is now my favorite book!
"I purchased this edition of Secret Teachings for a friend, who will actually understand it!Excelllent condition! I prefered the hard cover."
Not what i expected of this book the letters are to small and the writting is not so to read from you can better read the readers version which has more details and photos th show
I didn't receiveby his book
Manly is the man!
I ordered and paid for this book but never received it. I will never order from here again.
"This is a huge, heavy, incredibly detailed, impressive looking book. The print is tiny, as tiny as it gets. And the illustrations and footnotes, which are extensive and constant, are even smaller print. I have 20/20 eyesight but still could not read this book without uncomfortable effort. So how about the value of the content? Couldn't tell you. Wanna buy mine,.... cheap?"
Seems a bit dated and not up to scholarly standards.
Very happy with the book as it is exactly as described.  Delivery time was fine too :)  Recommend this seller.
Upon reading this I thought it was enlightening. But once I started to do some honest research I discovered that much of what he claims is actually fabricated and not true.
"This review is for the 'Diamond Jubilee Edition' of ""Secret Teachings of All Ages"" paperback issued by the Philosophical Research Society in 1989 (1st pb edition - all b&w) and reprinted in 2000 (54 illustrations are in color - the rest in b&w). This is the best trade edition available of this incredible book. This edition has all of the illustrations from the original text reproduced in good quality (all in b&w in the 1989 edition - 54 illustrations in color and the rest in b&w for the 2000 PB edition). It also includes a couple of foldouts and a vellum overlay.There are many facsimile editions out currently with no illustrations, or with poor reproductions of them. If you want to truly enjoy this book, seek out one of the authorized editions that made an effort to reproduce the text with the incredible illustrations intact. The original hardcover limited edition is a few feet tall. The edition that I saw was hand-bound and hand-colored, apparently intended for a Masonic library. It would break your coffee table. It was issued in 'reduced size' - still not a small book - in hardcover and in this paperback edition from the Philosophical Research Society. These are the editions that faithfully reproduce the original. I can not speak for the other editions, but I've seen enough complaints to want to advise buyers to seek out these authorized editions from Philosophical Research Society, and to avoid the rest.Philosophical Research Society's Diamond Jubilee Authorized pb edition ISBN is: 0-89314-830-X(ask the bookseller to check the ISBN if the listing isn't clear about the edition - don't get fooled into buying a bad facsimile!)These are some of the authorized HC reprint editions issued by PRS over the years, any of which are worth buying. I've not seen each edition, but it seems they have color illustrations that are reprinted in b&w in the 1989 pb 'Diamond Jubilee Edition':1977 Hardcover Edition (13 x 2 x 23 inches) from Philosophical Research Society ISBN is: 0-89314-538-61978 Golden Anniversary HC edition from Philosophical Research Society ISBN is: 0-89314-539-42008 reprint HC edition (12.8 x 1.8 x 18.5 inches) from  Philosophical Research Society ISBN is: 0-89314-546-7AVOID THE CREATE-SPACE EDITION (ISBN: 1-46101-313-5)! It is really bad, full of typos and the few pictures that are included look awful. The 'reader's guide edition' in PB from Tarcher (ISBN: 1-58542-250-9) only has half of the original illustrations, but has the unabridged text. There are a few other editions available that I have not reviewed.So, if you are ordering online, ask the bookseller who the publisher is and check the ISBN before purchasing. This book is available in many, many editions, some are humungous and gorgeous books- some are poorly reproduced and edited."
"compressing over 600 pages into this is quite a feat; that the color plates are so well reproduced is outstanding! The hard spine may not hold up against time and repeated openings, but you'll never find another edition at this price (Amazon: $58.00). Superb quality, so for the extra bucks over a bad OCR paperback, here's the philosopher's stone and looking good.Line art and illutrations are small, but crisp and clear. Undeniably one of the last great occult resource books of all time."
"This new edition of Hall's masterwork is one of the most complete, informative, absorbing and well-illustrated volume covering western philosophy, mysticism, and religious and occult thought, but it is in drastic need of some updating.Hall's general thesis is that in following a materialistic path, western man is turning his back on a history rich in thought, tradition, beauty and revelation; that all of this is to some degree related through symbology.  As such, he builds up, in chapter after chapter, the various individual strands, and in this way one can see how the rich inheritance of western thought, worship, belief and practice were built up.Besides mythology, philosophy and religion which eventually leads to kabbalah, magic, and freemasonry, Hall takes a number of detours through animist practices, animals, plant life, etc.  Some of the chapters are much more interesting than others, and some are badly dated, with material that is either now demonstrably false or has been largely debunked.  But Hall is no longer with us to revise the text, and the whole book is now considered such a classic in this form that it will likely never be altered.Finally, there are the illustrations.  If you buy this book, make sure you are getting a color copy and not the black and white; further, there are many editions where the print has been reduced and the pages are simply facsimiles of the original work, page by page.  The original plates are in many cases (not all) gorgeous, rich in symbology, massive works, in particular of alchemical or magical themes.  (One wonders what todays Islamists would think about the portrayal of Muhammed.)  They repay hours and hours of careful study.If the book would be brought up to date it would be worth a solid 5 stars.  Still highly recommended."
"An detailed overview of all esoteric teachings.  It is a reminder of how much all the worlds religious teachings have in common, not just the Judaeo-Christian religions.  It is over a thousand pages and well worth reading.  For example, the symbol of the cross is traced to every single source: Egyptian, Judaism, Paganism, Greece-Roman, Persian and Native American, not just Christianity.  This is only one example.  It is a sensitive work with a theme of religious tolerance that was unheard of at the time it was written, a hundred years ago.  Despite the fact that it was written so long ago, the writing is easy to follow, and the book remains relevant for the current day seeker."
"Manly P Hall was a great scholar. I had the wonderful experience of hearing him lecture at his Philosophical Research Society in Los Angeles shortly before his passing in 1990. Having read classical and comparative philosophy and religion for many years, my impression - shared by my betters and many scholars - is you really cannot do better than this book. There are many editions available, even a paperback edition currently in many bookstores.If you appreciate Joseph Campbell but wish to pursue the more mystical side of religion, Manly P Hall is an excellent resource. Whereas Campbell was a self-proclaimed ""maverick"" with no particular allegiance to any one form of religion, Manly P Hall was a thirty-third degree Freemason, and clearly sympathetic to the theory that in our ancient past there existed a system of mystery religions in which invocation of deities and angels was practiced and actually achieved. (Classic example, if memory serves, being Plutarch's tale of the invocation of the Neoplatonist Plotinus' guardian angel in the Temple of Isis in Rome by an Egyptian priest.) Hall breaks ranks with Christianity's declaring such entities to have been demons, and views them instead as our good buddies in the spiritual neighborhood. That said, to Hall's credit, he never minimizes the great perils of seeking gratuitous spiritual experiences.If you are sympathetic to ""the old religions"" and want a sympathetic scholarly accounting, it is hard to imagine how you could do better than purchasing and studying this book. If you are someone who believes in the Bible as the inspired word of God, you will have to come to your own conclusion whether Hall is worth your time, as he inevitably delivers a philosophical interpretation of the Bible.Those seeking a deeper prayer life, consult

"This review is not about the content. I'm enjoying the content and, though I'm still reading, I'm certain I love this book. This review is for anyone debating whether to invest in a hard copy or an e-copy. If seeing the images, charts, diagrams and other illustrations matter to you, then do not buy the kindle version. The reason I know they're missing is because the captions/illustration titles are there but NO pictures. Very disappointing."
These customer reviews are extremely misleading.Not because there is anything wrong with the reviews themselves but because amazon brings up the same reviews for every edition of this book.So the very good editions get the same reviews as the terrible editions.I read that there are 19 editions of this book ranging from a beautiful hardcover edition for big bucks to crappy reprints without illustrations and tiny text - they all have the same set of reviews.
"I remeber the first time that I was shown this tome nearly twenty years ago.  My father pulled this volume down from his bookshelf and let me read through it, watching my expressions as I beheld its beauty.  I was left with a thirst of wanting more.  His copy was an older paperback edition that he acquired in some little esoteric bookstore and at that time this was not an easy book to find, now its much easier (for better or worse) to gain secrets that were once privy to the few.Since I first beheld this magical book, I was able to procure the large (very large) hardcover limited edition signed by the author - the true gem of my library, priceless.This is a masterpiece of esoteric literature, one that you'll never part with.  Truly a must have volume that belongs in the library of every Freemason, Kabbalist, or Rosicrucian.  The title says it all.  You'll spend hours upon hours in reflection and enthralled at the details of the text and illustrations.  The full color plates are beautifully rendered and will literally leap off the pages.  Now that this volume is more easily available and you are at least looking for it (or you wouldn't be here, now would you?) I have one suggestion - BUY IT"
"Last week a friend and I were sitting in my home drinking awful green tea, when he asked, ""Where do you think Astrology originated?"" Immediately I stood up a retrieved my ""The Secret Teachings of all Ages"", and looked Astrology up - the answer was right there - query answered.Thinking back, I've owned this book and must have read it through more times than any other book in my library. Especially, when I'm on some quest or research project on the school of the Esoteric.If you are interested in this subject matter, I can suggest any book by Manly P. Hall...and the man was a prolific writer, and he certainly did his research.Do you want to know the story of Pythagorus, the Pyramid Mysteries, alchemy, esoteric symbology, or if even Pagan Christian mysticism, this is your reference book.My copy has yellowed and a little worse for ware, but this is only a sign that it has been well used.Like me, if you are a seeker, philosopher or simply curious, this exceptional text will be your encyclopaedia.Good hunting."
"Never, to my knowledge, has such a compendium of wisdom and knowledge been revealed to the public. Like Isaac Asimov, another prodigious genius of our century, Manly Palmer Hall boggles my mind; I stand in awe of such a mentality. How is it possible for one man to know so much? (And without a computer!) From wherever his brilliance derived, there is nonesuch alive today, and the greater our loss for it. Our treasure is the inheritance of this one book among many of his, The Secret Teachings of All Ages. I have used this book for reference and for study when I felt I was being boondoggled by other occultists. I always felt I could trust him even when he stepped around sensitive questions that may have revealed too much. I owe this man a very great debt."
"Manly P Hall fulfilled an important mission: to inspire the people of North America, to point out the unmistable presence of a Secret Doctrine and Tradition, and to lay the foundation for the Revelation of that teaching.  This book is the spear-point that he used to break through the first line of combat.  But Manly Hall was NOT authorized to reveal the teaching itself, and while this book is incredible in it's beauty and comprehensiveness, it does not and cannot reveal directly the practical and essential nature of the teachings.  There is no doubt whatsoever that Manly Hall knew and worked with the Mercury, the Salt and the Sulphur.  There is no doubt that he worked with the Fire.  There is no mistaking the knowledge of a true Alchemist.  Read this book, study it, absorb it; it will prepare your mind and heart to comprehend the Real Knowledge when you see it - but to recognize that true knowledge you must be sincere and humble.  Arrogance and pride will keep the doors closed to you.  It is unfortunate that these qualities are so enthusiastically encouraged by our modern culture, qualities that every genuine Master strictly condemns.  Be humble when searching for Wisdom, and having found it, be more humble still.  To discover the essential and practical knowledge that Manly Hall pointed toward, read the works of Samael Aun Weor available at the Gnostic Institute zshop here on Amazon.com."
"I bought the 1977 edition (Golden Anniversary Edition, reduced facsimile) in Johannesburg in 1983.  It is a large-format (9"" x 13"") soft-cover and has great illustrations. I wanted to buy a Kindle version for my i-pad for quick reference: many thanks to everyone for all the warnings about the e-book version."
"Very disappointed when I received this incredibly poor and lacking printing of a most wonderful book. Having made the mistake of only going through the reviews after purchasing/receiving the book there appears to be a division in good/bad ratings. Just beware, I would not wish for anyone to receive the copy I bought. Absolutely no illustrations, riddled with spelling and grammatical errors, the print is tiny and the paragraphing is virtually non-existent making it very difficult to read with any pleasure. All in all its clearly been produced very very cheaply, spend a little extra and get a decent copy that will do the original work some justice."
"********** ""The Secret Teachings of All Ages"" is, without question, the most wonderful book I have ever owned! I spent hours slowly turning the pages and looking at the Very Well- Produced Artwork!!! You will be amazed, when you first open the book. The printing is also very stylish and sets-off the Mystical nature of the very large <this is a ""reduced"" size?!> compendium of knowledge. I have been studying Masonic & Hermetic Philosophy, Psychology, Anthropology, Astrology, etc. for the last ten years....and this book just left my jaw hanging, in wonder and rapture. You will see what appears to be originals of many ""occult"" images that permeate the mass-market. This is high-quality art that begs to be placed on even the wealthiest person's coffee-table. Even if you only purchase this book for it's superb artwork and Masonic / Hermetic / Kabalistic illustrations, pictures/paintings & Alchemical drawings, you will not be disappointed!!! I recommend this book to people who do not like to read and to those who Love to Read! Either way, you cannot lose. I am particularly interested in the ""man with four faces,"" because of a Vision I had in 1991.... Looks like I am not the only person to ever draw The Conundrum.You will be enthralled with the Artistic Quality of this massive book and you will treasure it's contents forever. This is an absolute ""must-have"" for all Students of ""The Secret Teachings of All Ages!"""
"this book of mystery and occult history has the most impressive collection of information i have ever seen. I bought a hard-cover copy in leather at an old book store in New York.  Many hard critics say that it is only an encyclopedia of facts. But I would disagree because it neatly compiles information. The diagrams, which are on the small side, can be at least form part of one's jumping board toward getting at the legitimate signs and diagrams of occultism itself. I highly recommend this book for those who are interested in the mysteries of knowledge and also to those are interested in bridging the gaps that the West has failed to bring together."
"This is a great book available for folks who are interested in esoteric studies, however potential readers should take some precaution. Understand that the book was written in 20's, so by now it's nearly 100 years old. Whereas a lot of the information is fascinating, some of it can be misleading and is outdated. Manly P. Hall LOVES the pantheons of antiquity (especially the Romans), so most deities, regardless of which civilization they came from, are referenced by their antiquity counterpart (and sometimes he switches names mid-argument - for example, Bacchus and Dionysus). Another good example is his retelling of the Sumerian myth of the goddess Inanna's descent into the underworld. Those familiar with the story probably know that Inanna's counterpart in the Babylonian myth is the goddess Ishtar. In Hall's retelling he uses the name Ishtar as his protagonist, but references Greek gods for the rest of the story. This observation is not the end of the world. It certainly shows the similarities the Greek, Roman, Sumerian, and Babylonian/Assyrian mythologies shared. But if you didn't know the difference between these mythologies and civilizations, this retelling could be very misleading.He also states the Celts worshipped Mercury and Isis. No, the Celts did not worship Mercury and Isis, per se; they worshipped the Dagda and Boann, which are similar but not the same."
"I must agree with all the positive reviews I read before buying this book. It is indeed replete with beautiful artwork, chronologically laid out for easy-to-follow topics, and an in-depth analysis and discussion of each topic presented.  I cannot praise this tome enough---for it is indeed a tome, not just a mere book.  To paraphrase another reviewer, if I were to have just one volume for my collection of esoteric information, it would be this one.  It's, as subtitled, an encyclopedia, therefore a reference work.  Thus it can be read at any one chapter depending on the reader's interest at the time.  The immediate reaction I had on perusing the book was that it appears to be a lifetime of work on the part of more than oneauthor.  This, of course, is not the case, but it still is that comprehensive a volume to be Manly P.Hall's life's work.  I cannot praise this work enough for anyone, beginner or adept, to have this reference work in his/her library."
"while this book will offer you an amazing wealth of knowledge about a vast quantity of subjects, i do not recomend it for the beginner as it is a bit difficult to read. if you have a bit of knowledge about the subjects you may be able to get through it, but you may also become frustrated. it has beautiful pictures inside that almost make it worth the price alone. i was very pleased to see the newer copies that were softcover; before then this book may not have been affordable to all who sought after it's information. i bought it mainly for it's information on masons, a belief system that has always creeped me out a little:) it still creeps me out but i'm educated as to why now:)"
"""The Secret Teachings of All Ages"" is the greatest work to ever have been published or to be published. So many people have helped to complete this book and they surely deserve their recognition. I truely believe that it is the greatest opportunity that any one will have. If you 'know' certain things that dont need to be said and you will know if you know them, then this book has a far greater meaning than anyone will ever be able to tell you. If you truely want to have 'true' knowledge and wisdom then read this book from the first page of the book to the end and then read it again. Read the Prefaces and Forewords and the footnotes of illustrations. This book is not for everyone. If this book is for you then you will know before you get through the prefaces and forwords. It is truley the greatest work of all time and still to come for probably a long while. This book is for the person who seeks far greater knowledge than any school or religion or book can teach you. True wisdom is neither great nor none, it is true. This book has too great of a value than anyone can ever tell, but only if you let it. I thank you Manly P. Hall to the fullest with the greatest respect and all who have contributed to the making of this work of knowledge. I thank all who help to awaken the world in this time of ignorance and skepticism. The world today has forgotten too much of the secret teachings/knowledge that were once so great in value to everyone. I thank everyone who knows the greater purposes and is willing to help everyone know. One is better than none.Custodians and watchers of the force of man's bondage,ready to loose when the light has been reached.First and most mighty,sits the Veiled Presence, Lord of Lords,the infinite Nine,over the other from eachthe Lords of the Cycles;Three, Four, Five, and Six, Seven, Eight,each with his mission, each with his powers,guiding, directing the destiny of man.There sit they, mighty and potent,free of all time and space.Not of this world they,yet akin to it,Elder Brothers they,of the children of men.Judging and weighing,they with their wisdom,watching the progressof Light among men. ~Tablet II The Halls of Amenti~"
"All right, I'll admit that I am a fool for this book. I love it. It is definitely worth more than what I paid for it. *Seriously.*This book has been an invaluable source. Puzzling over a symbol? It's in there. Wondering about the Grail? It's in there. Certainly, not *everything* can be in there - realistically - but it certainly is close to it. Masonic, Qabalistic, anything Hermetic ... it's in there.You'll be surprised. The book isn't physically thick, but it is  chock-full of valuable content.It's one of my favorite reference books."
"For as old as the book is, some knowledge is timeless. This serves as a wonderful example. It may even be a little advanced for the novice seeker of esoteric teachings. But that is a good thing, as it plants the seeds to drive one to learn more about an idea that is only hinted at. Bright blessings to you on your journey!"
"This book changed my life. It introduced me to a more profound way of approching ""religion"" problems and inconsistencies. The book first overviews the prevailing materialistic philosophies, and then  outlines the elements of secret knowledge residing in what might otherwise  appear to be but psychological archetypes in the mythic tradition, the  misunderstanding of which has given rise to materialistic philosophy. But  there is indeed more to our western traditions than is generally realized.  Inside the myths and allegories of all ages is a truth that very few  appreciate. This book outlines in lucid detail, those truths that the world  desperately needs, and that have been destroyed by time, wars and  arrogance, and consolidates them under one cover. The books physical beauty  alone makes it one of the most impressive books ever published. The plates  make great meditation mandalas.  The bibliography list is devoted to source  works that have been neglected--many still not in print or even translated.  To actually read the book is equivalent to a college course in the  mysteries systems of antiquity, which were indeed the first schools in the  historical record. The book is but an outline focusing on the  ""occidental"" mysteries..but a very profound one. Not since the  Secret Doctrine of Blavatsky had a book so comprehensibly melded the  western tradition. And not since has a book come close to this one, first  published in 1928."
"The Secret Teachings of All Ages is truly an encyclopedic volume, richly illustrated with masonic, hermetic, qabbalistic and rosicrucian symbolism (the illustrations are breathtaking) and philosophical interpretations.While the book covers wide range of topics, it essentially follows the path of Western esoteric traditions - all the way back from Egypt and Greece, through the famous European alchemists (St. Germain and Nicholas Flammel), and onward to Rosicrucians - as can be expected from the title, but it briefly touches upon symbolism from Islam and Amrican Indian symbolism."
"There are a handful of books that contain the essense of knowledge of mankind.  The Secret Teachings is one of those.  Combine it with Blavatsky's Secret Doctine and Isis Unveiled, Alice Bailey's Treatise on  Cosmic Fire, and Douglas Baker's Dictionary of Astrology for the 21st  Century, and you have a full house."
"Looking to the East I would say this is the tool that open the door to the next level of progress.  To study the occult is to learn what the profane has no understanding of.  The next cycle of life is within reach if you Ask,Seek,Knock.  Manley Palmer Hall  Was known to mankind as the Professor of knowledge which has been past down only through the true mystic of our time.  To my Masonic brother this material needs to be included in your current library as the most important book written.  To become a truth Adept you would need to travel to the next level of time unknown to the profane.  The masonic tree leads to knowledge unknown to the profane.  Manley Palmer Hall open the door to mankind you are given the key to the inner circle of the knowledge.  But to become a  true Adept you would have to leave the material world and open your eyes to the divine Knowledge.  This leads to several degree not written by the profane.  To the brothers of light continue to seek and yea shall find since Mr. Hall chose the tree of life at a early age, he was able to travel from the East to the West to share this wonderful knowledge with all of mankind."
"This is for the Kindle version.  The images are not clear at all and even worse when you enlarge them.  There are so many typos, there would be no way to note them here.  Basically, one per page and so far, there are two chapters where the last sentence is not even completed.  Pretty bad.  Don't buy this.  If you want to have it, cough up money for a better edited and printed copy."
"Manly P. Hall is always a pleasant read. Good book if you really want to go down the rabbit hole and into wonderland. An extremely high dose of history, so read it as a text book and absorb the marvels in history and the mystery religions. Five stars."
"I don't want to go into the reasons , However, I will not recommend this book. It didn't take long to see that I couldn't agree with the authors opinions."
Why read the posers of the original secrete teachings from Ancient Egypt?  It's common knowledge that Greece and Rome learned from the Ancient Egyptians.  So why studied the twisted versions when you can study directly from the source by studying Ancient Egyptians (do not study the 18th & 19th century Egyptologist who tried --and are still trying--to white-wash Egypt).
"The Secret Teachings of All Ages is a must have book for anyone interested in esoteric knowledge.  This is the best version of the book, short of obtaining one of the original 800 hard covers.  It has all of the essential pictures and insets, many of which are absent in the reader's edition."
"If there's any tome of research you must have in your magick library, this is it. Hall covers more in this book than 10 of anything you could find anywhere else.Just make sure you guard it closely. My first copy was stolen  and replaced minus a few pages."
It is an amazing books with excellent knowledge.
"Manly P Hall's work is often cited by anti-masons given the argument that it's a form of esoteric witchcraft of mysticism. Coupled with the secrecy of the fraternity, many accept Hall's work as fact given that he was at one point a mason himself.It's important to note, before reading anything into this book, that Hall was NOT a freemason at the time of writing this. As a result; most of Hall's work in this novel must have been assumption. Hall wrote this book in 1928, but he was not initiated into the fraternity until 1954.It is an interesting read, but you should accept much of it as simple mystic fiction."
DUDE!!!!!!!I think I will take this to to the Tool concert on July 21st
"I ordered this book, hoping for the correct listed size (19.5 x 12.8 x 2.0 inches). What I got was the SMALLER, nearly one third the price, version! When I sent it back for a replacement, stating that is was the incorrect size, they sent me the EXACT SAME book, in return. I did't very much enjoy having to send this incorrectly sized book back to them, not once, but TWICE! I would suggest that anyone wishing to purchase this great book, do so with caution. If you do, measure it to be sure it is the correct size. Oterwise, you can order the LESS expensive, smaller verion, and get the same exact same book while saving money. Good luck, and I hope this review helps you."
Love it
"Whilst this may be a very good book well written, logically building upon the ( recent ancient history of the mysteries) the foundation of the the source of mysteries I have found in the first two chapters only go as far back as circa 3000 years.What is the crucial flaw in the digital publication , at the end of the first three chapters it seems to have some text missing.I would advise against buying the digital version. As one gets settled into reading a chapter only to find that all the chapters of the book are incomplete.A rip off and disservice to the writer and the body of knowledge that is herein articulated."
Save your money and don't buy this version.  This copy omits large parts of the original text and has no illustrations.  The text is so small and tightly condensed you will need a magnifying glass to read it.  A huge disappointment and to be quite frank it's a rip-off.
"The book itself is great. Very insightful especially if you are interested in these subject matters, HOWEVER, I purchased the book from a company called LANGTON_INFO who I believe do not even hold stock of the item. They just source the item you are interested in buying. I though I bought the Diamond Jubilee Edition but it was a 2017 Reprint of the Diamond Jubilee Edition that was printed in China. I don’t know if I have a Rare misprint of the book but there was a page in the book which was blurry like there was a mistake on the printing machine which I have uploaded pictures of. It looks worse to the naked eye & also another page - A Portrait Of William Shakespeare with Francis Bacon superimposed however it seems to have been put in or printed the wrong way. You can clearly see in the photos I have uploaded. In short, double them triple check what you are buying as some sellers do not put all the relevant details in such as it being a 2017 reprint. I won’t return the book due to the fact I managed to purchase it for £85 & the prices for the same edition have doubled, tripled in some instances & even more expensive from other selllers."
"A marvellous piece of work with a broad spectrum of ancient teachings,  philosophy, symbolism and metaphor.  This book will broaden your mind, although it can be heavy going in places.  A must have. I would love the big version in hardback to appreciate some of the illustrations. Not a quick read but well worth the effort"
"So happy to receive my book. However, the print is extremely small difficult to read. Il have to find a different copy."
"Probably the most insightful book I have ever read. Hall was an exceptional individual with a captivatingly easy manner. This was an absorbing read. Having said that, I had thought that I was suitably prepared for this having just studied Blavatsky's writings on Isis, but I frequently found myself putting it down, but only to take notes, lest a morsel of the accumulated knowledge in this great work should elude me. It's difficult to believe tbat he was so young when he wrote this, because knowledge and understanding at this depth, is more consistent with a lifetime of searching for and finding such ancient pearls of wisdom."
Complicated narrative that needs clearer demonstration of relationships and time line.
I was very happy with the service and my order Thank You!
Interesting and thought provoking.
Arrived  in berg good condition.
Excellent product at an excellent price with an excellent service.
Shhh! It’s a secret.
Doesn't have all the illustrations that earlier editions had.
"Piece of PDF photo copied crap. No illustrations, No bibliography, incomplete chapters.Don't buy. Even the cover is poorly photoshopped stretched text."
"Fantastic educational read, challenging at times and very interstng read as wellArrived on time and in good shape, why order new when second hand does the job and helps the Earth :-)"
happywith thepurchase and i recommend it
Interesting book
"H P manly, is one of the best. His egostic knowledge is second to none. Excellent book truly fascinating a must read"
I have to say that the book did not meet my expectation as it is not the same book i was searching for. i ordered it overseas on global priority shipment with other god books but this one really disappointed me. my  advice is to get the other book in its extended form.
Absolutely fantastic reading matter. Very focused and accurate. Written before any new age distortions of ancient beliefs. An absolute must read for any spiritual seeker.
"pretty good review of the subject, comprehensive but necessarily concise given the size of the volume, proof reading was not great and there are a few errors in the text but nothing one can't read around. Good introduction to a number of topics."
Good book ruined with missing content .Things end mid sentence in places where parts of the book have been cut out !!I don't know if this effects the paperback and hard cover version but the kindle version has been edited to cut down on size ? I have no idea.
"Like a bible in and of itself, prompt deliver, quality print"
if you have an open mind and a need for feeding it then this book will teach you more than your whole school education
"I am still going through its pages and must say that so far it is a very informative book that dips into historic facts, philosophy and religion in a accessible manner so that the lay man would also benefit from it."
The most informative collection of the mysteries and search for truth I have read so far. I give thanks for finding this book.
I found several of the chapters brilliant and some not to clever deffinately a good book for someone wanting to no a little about the masons but he dosen't give away any important stuff.
thank you
Received on time & good product thanks
"seems that this is some kind of cheap reproduction of the book. The bibliography is completely missing, there are no pictures in the book (which are mentioned in the prologue) and appears a much abridged version in general."
Good read
"Packed with mystery and mythology. Very interesting to read, though it may take a while to finish the whole book as there is always an urge to skip to the pages which interest you most. All in all, super book. Thanks!"
"Anyone who is interested in how 'all things got started' with regard to the esoteric hidden agenda for the world, need look no further."
It took me five weeks to read this behemoth of a book but i can't help thinking I'll be reading it again someday as there is so much to know and so many subjects within.
All the illustrations are missing - inferior copy
An informative book.  Quite a read. I like this book as it puts all the things in the one place.Would recommend for people interested in this topic.
What I've read so far interests me greatlyAnd I give it 5 stars on that basis.a very interesting book 📚
Poor print quality and small text.
Very happy with service and product
"A magnificent contribution to mankind, A one stop destination for all of your questions regarding the history all things religous, spiritual and esoteric."
great book
A thoroughly enjoyable piece detailing the major aspects of the world's esoteric traditions. A great read. I couldn't put it down :)
"a very interesting read and at points a little difficult as well, but it is exactly what it says it is, but to anyone who takes in this knowledge the book itself will open new doors for you to explore a sure must read for anybody interested in growing there minds"
Its a great book
If you're interested in esoteric philosophic teachings and mysteries than this is the book for you - absolutely blew me away
concise and always interesting - great for referencing and showing off at dinner parties
Worth a read
"Get a better over standing of the big pictureThe information is quite remarkably mind expanding. Prepare yourself, and remain grounded."
A very interesting and illuminating read.
"don't get me wrong, the book is brilliant, and I am going to buy me a real edition.- This edition from  Createspace (*) is simply unreadable - the font size is about 7 point, and the A4 format makes it very difficult to read, no pictures, simply a digital print in a bad font.(*) CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform; Auflage: Reprint (21.

"I don't care for all the accumulations of establishment-opinions: i want functional truth!Update: i just discovered how helpful-in-understanding the""Fundamentals of Qabbalistic Cosmogeny"" chapter is......having made several attempts at understanding the Jewish esoteric kind of thinking, this shows how sane it, in some ways, can be ( :Tarot section... get instead Elisabeth Haich's""Wisdom of the Tarot""( i have never succeeded in falsifying anything fundamental in Elisabeth Haich's instruction...Do remember she was born Hungarian & wrote in Swiss German: we have English translations,& she was working in the mid-1900s )For Rosicrucian esoterica & Tantra, again Elizabeth Haich: ""Sexual ENERGY & Yoga"".( get also Dr. David Frawley's ""Yoga for YOUR Type"" )& for those who want a taste of the ancient knowledge:Elizabeth Haich's ""Initiation"" is like this work but without all the accumulated gumph...& Nicolai Notovich's ""Unknown Jesus"" book ( or is it Unknown Life of Jesus??Look upNotovich Jesusand you should find it...also trashes some accumulated gunk:Jesus laced-into ANYone who hoarded privelege/authority through religion!Brahmin, Zoroastrian, Roman, Jewish, he didn't care!I love the guy...As for this book?Useful as a resource for what seems involved in any specific-subject...But, as i say, for each specific domain, if you can find a source for unadulterated-truth of that domain's kind, stick to that!Ramakrishna Vivekananda's Complete Works would also be a good investment in one's life, to read through ( it is on kindle )...Namaste!"
"This book has very small font size making readability difficult.Also, this book has ZERO IMAGES. The original contains many images of esoterica that should not by missed by the reader.I have a PDF on my iPad that has the images, but I would like a printed edition for easier reference as it extremely informative and illuminating."
"I got the Dover edition paperback, says printed in US.Good: I buy books by the kilo so all good here folks. Paper is nice; attractive off white colour and good thickness. Looks and feels like a quality publication. Most drawings, though small, are pleasingly crisp line drawings.Bad: Some drawings are so small they're illegible and some are blocked up and dark in areas with heavy line hatching (shading with fine lines) due to the vastly reduced size. The glossy colour pictures would have been better full page, with the written descriptions removed to a separate page; they are very uninspiring at such a small scale. Overall very happy with the quality of this book."
"Please be aware when buying this book.  The one I received had the first 100 (or so) pages printed in backwards order.  So if you were reading it you would have to read the right page first, then the left page, and then turn the pages from left to right to read on.  The second half (or so) of the book was printed normally.  As this was a gift I am glad I opened the book to check.  Not being familiar with Amazon I will try to get a refund, although the low original price may not make it worth the effort."
"In its original format, this is an incredible book - truly a life-changing read. I have read a pdf version of this book which is over 600 pages long. I bought this version to add to my physical bookshelf, and I was hugely disappointed to discover that this version has zero illustrations! Not one! This makes the book only 200 or so pages long, and makes a true discussion and analysis of *symbolism* almost impossible. Such a shame. How can we appreciate the intricate symbols and embellishments of ancient and secret societies without any illustrations? My advice would be to avoid this incomplete version, and find a copy with illustrations."
"A lot is to be learned in this book. There are also many misconceptions and dangerous perversions. It is valuable, but watch yourself when you're reading it and don't take it as gospel, as you should with anything you read."
"I highly recommend this book to anyone already fascinated with the subject and also to anyone new to the subject. The style is in an « encyclopedic outline » as it says on the back cover, it makes a very informative, compelling read, it is hard to put down. You are in for a treat, it’s a big six hundred page brick full of lack and white illustrations and a central section with colour plates!"
"The book is absolutely interesting and filled with a lot of great insights into the occult and symbolism. The only problem is that Amazon messed up the packaging and it arrived with the borders ruined and the front cover with a scratch, nothing excessive but really bothered that they just sent a book in a cardboard box without anything to protecting it from shakes or scratches."
"The Secret Teachings of All Ages: An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy by Manly P. HallAcclaimed by Publishers Weekly as ""a classic reference, dizzying in its breadth,"" this volume explores the themes underlying ancient mythology, philosophy, and religion. Hundreds of entries range from esoteric elements of Islamic and Christian history to arcane rituals practiced by Druids, Freemasons, alchemists, and other secret societies. 16 pages of color plates, 100 black-and-white illustrations."
"The most incredible book I read, it has become a basis of everything in relation to knowledge to me"
Bardzo uboga wersja książki napisana nieprzystępnie małą czcionką. Nie polecam a nawet ostrzegam przed nabyciem. Książka podaje się za interpretację oryginału.
Interesting read and very informative on the esoterics. Came very fast delivery.
a great book but you really have to use will power to read it.
"Disappointed. This is not the book I ordered, and I can prove it as I got a the sample through Kindle. However This book is also an interesting read and I'll keep it. I'm still searching for the one I ordered."
Hall was a very informed man and has influenced many people to profound thought!
buon prodotto
Awesome book.  Manly Palmer Hall is and absolute genius as you can plainly tell as you read any of his works.  Book also arrived the day before it was supposed to.  I'm very happy with this purchase.
"A Great Sage, history of the world and philosophy."
Using as a reference guide to esoteric topics I've been researching
"Only for those who have an open mind in pursuit of the truth, dogmatic individuals should avoid, unless they are open to having their world view shattered."
"this is one big disappointment, and not worth my Time."
"It is very interesting and still important to read Manly Halls timeless masterpiece in our time, around hundred years after the first publishing. Go and find the philosopher in you!"
Not many pages but a lot on each page.
"A beautiful Book, written in a way you will never forget"
Extremely disappointed there wasn’t a single image in the whole book also after it arrived I found a free copy on cia.gov website lol but still good info
Really cool book about a huge variety of subjects. Great price as well.
This book is an advanced read. Your mind will be pried open!
"Cet auteur est hautement recommandé dans cette discipline.Le format kindle est acceptable, vu le prix.Il y a quand même quelques erreurs dans l'ordre des paragraphes (les légendes s'immiscent dans le coeur du texte)."
There are many typos but the book is a necessity for us all today.
Interesting
Perfect addition to any library of knowledge
One of the best books Ive ever read
"When your conciousness finds that level, you will need this book."
"Only a small section on what i was interested in, most of the book is based on speculation and is the opinion of an illogical thinker."
Thank you for a fast shipping! A very interesting book.
Excelent book for those who are begining to explore esoteric knoweledge. This book has aa general view of most subjects and references to deeper knoweledge.
The quality was okay
good!
The item is excellent
Great book
"As mentioned in the title, this covers everything without going into details. If you want to elevate yourself on higher realms of understanding you will enjoy this book."
"an excellent, in depth , compendium."
will use again
Can be used as an inspiraional device to go further in the quest of the meaning of all... Very recommendable.
this is a great book
If you have a curious mind this book will blow your top. If you are looking to experience a mental orgasm buy and read this book. It is the most in depth book on the unknown ( now known) I have ever read. Harry the Wiccan
This book bridges the gulf between ancient teachings and modern life. Rather overwhelming in some parts but perseverance pays off.
"The book arrived promptly in good condition.This book is excellent. It gives a good insight into the ancient philosophies, mysticisms and symbols that have shaped our world."
"This is terrible. There are no illustrations,which completely negates the point of the book, as a huge amount of the information needs illustrations to get the various points across, or explained correctly. If I could get a refund I would!! AVOID."
not to keen
"very happy, service and product perfect. thank you"
"The book is great but this edition (Createspace March 2011) is unreadable, unless you use magnifying glasses. Even if you manage, it only contains the text and none of the very interesting original illustrations.Make yourself a favor and get a better edition. I recommend the 1976 P.R.S. edition which contains the original illustrations, but the Tarcher edition is good (and inexpensive) too."
Weird but interesting book on occult history.
"I have struggled manfully through the first 200 pages of this volume so far and it is excruciating.This is not in any way because of the writing of Manly Hall, which is a staggeringly erudite treasury of what I suppose could be termed Western esotericism.  The fact that Hall wrote this at such a young age and in so short a space of time makes this book even more impressive.  The title is kind of correct - this is an encyclopedic outline - but the book's scope takes in just so much that limiting the title to Hermetic, Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian symbolic philosophy doesn't seem to do it full justice.  If you're looking for a one-volume esoteric reference then you should consider The Secret Teachings......published by someone else.This really is by a country mile the worst editing and proofing of a book I have ever seen.  It should be recalled and pulped because every page is absolutely littered with the most horrendous errors that you have to fight your way through the text, translating, transposing, reconstructing, head scratching and second-guessing.  I suspect the fault here lies with the production method of Forgotten Books which, I'm guessing, is using some kind of OCR scanning of original texts and then publishing books digitally on a 'print to order' basis.  This is potentially an exciting new way to publish perhaps out of print and niche books but the OCR software isn't very good, the printing quality is shabby (all illustrations are pixellated to the extent that they make little sense) and the proof reading is nil.The result?  Bizarre punctuation, with commas, full stops and capital letters interspersed at absolute random throughout the text, tripping up and confounding any possible flow.  Typos EVERYWHERE, some caused by obvious poor scanning software ('modem' appears a lot in place of 'modern').  Paragraphs just petering out...literally just ending mid sentence leaving you searching the page for where the text might be taken up again but, no, it's just disappeared.  Sub-paragraphs to explain illustrations and figures appear 'in-line' with the main body of the text...not in a box, or indented or in any way separated from the main text, so the notes to accompany a diagram (which you can't really discern any detail of anyway because of the pixellation) may appear half way through a paragraph of regular text.Oh, and my binding started to give way as soon as I opened the book.Honestly, if this book is anything to go by, avoid Forgotten Books like the plague."
Print very small!
Excellent book
great
Well chuffed and happy with it.  A A A A A A A A A A A + + +

Top seller. A+++. Thanks Pi
Very small print and no pictures or diagrams. Put me to sleep in 5 minutes.
Indepth overview
"It was disappointing.  It did not match the hype.  There was nothing in the book that is not GENERALLY known.  Nothing was explicit, everything was vague and general.  Not worth the money."
excellent thanks
"Smooth transaction, speedy delivery, many thanks. A+++ eBayer will use again. A+++"
Lies!!!!
"This is a great book. But it doesn't really get into ""The Secret BEHIND The Secret"" so-to-speak. ""The Master Key System"" by Charles F. Haanel still is, and will ALWAYS be, the greatest book on this subject that has ever existed. It is ""one stop shopping"" and explains it all in a very simple and easy-to-read book that is almost a hundred years old. This book was the third I got from Esther and Jerry Hicks, and was not a bad read for what I knew at the time. But ""The Master Key System"" was TRULY the life-transforming book I needed to read. And THAT was the one that changed my life. This one goes into WHAT The Law of Attraction can do. But not really HOW or WHY."
"I have known of the Law Of Attraction (LOA) for many years, and first went to hear Abraham in the early 1980s, but I considered the LOA too simple a formula, too cute, to be all that Abraham says.  But, after another 35 years of spiritual study, I found myself once again back at the LOA.  Only this time with a realization: the LOA is the gravity of the Universe.  Perhaps not in a purely physical sense, but by analogy, it is exactly that  Which brought me to this basic statement of the fundamental Abraham teaching.  And what a fine, excellent book it is.  It explains so many things, why things are the way they are, why we keep trying to change things, but keep winding up with the same disappointing, unwanted results, and how to change the way we tell the Universe what it is we truly want.  I read, study, digest a couple of hundred books a year, a lot of them very good.  But The Evolution Angel (Todd Michael) and this, The Law of Attraction, are the number one and two books of all-time I've read.  And Abraham and their voice, Esther Hicks, are priceless."
"First let me say, this is Phil's wife and I ordered the book. I'm rather embarrassed to say that I did not read through the reviews thoroughly and assumed somehow that this book was based off of the Biblical Abraham. Shame on me for not doing my homework. I did try to read through the first 25 pages, but I cannot continue with the theme of spirit mediums.No fault on the seller here."
"Do not get this book confused with other ""Law of Attraction"" books.  Have read others but did not get it.  This book explains everything you need to know about the ""how"" to attract to yourself what you really want.  You will not be disappointed."
Astonishing book for everyone to read. I had been long looking for a book that not only explained spirituality but one that can be easily adapted and can start noticing a positive change right away. I wish that this is something that we’re taught in schools. This would change a lot of people’s perspective on life.
"I ordered the CD to help make useful time of my work commute (approx. 2 hours per day). I Had also ordered Matthew Kelly's ""Resisting Happiness"". This cd was NOT at ALL like the latter. I found it to be very SALES PITCHY?... like being trapped in one of the endless ""FREE"" timeshare seminars from the '80 & early '90's. I had hoped that it would help me to redirect the sometimes toxic energy from my work environment. It did not .It was NEW AGE & HIGHLY UNORTHODOX...not my tastes. To say the least, I was surprised/shocked/disappointed to find this was not, IMHO remotely akin to ""BIBLICAL ABRAHAM"" :(  I had NO DESIRE to continue listening. Next time I will read ALL the reviews before my purchases."
"Here is the gist of this book: everything that happens to anyone is, in the realm of this book's reality, their own doing as each person ""attracts"" all events, items, people, status, etc.Examples include: robbery victims (and we can clearly apply this to mean all victims of any crime ever) are co-creators of the event because they attracted the robbery to themselves, according to this book.  Similarly, prejudice isn't entirely the fault of those who in the words of this book ""dislike"" others, it is ""more often the one who feels discriminated against"" who is the ""most powerful creator"" of the prejudice.But, don't worry folks! **Insert infomercial voice here** If you follow this couple's teaching, you can turn everything around no matter what in 60 days or less!If you want to pretend that genetic conditions, sexism, racism, war, poverty, accidents, violence, illnesses, etc. only happen to those that ""allow"" them to, I guess this is the book for you?If you're looking for actual advice not rooted in pure unadulterated victim blaming, this is not the way.Please buy something else. So thankful I bought from a third party reseller so I didn't give these people money"
"Is there Heaven on earth? If you can fill your day with thoughts and images that raise pleasurable emotions; your relationships, daily interactions, environment, and life will improve. Wouldn’t you rather face positive and pleasant experiences than to focus and dwell in negativity? What have you to lose, except the bitterness within yourself and the world?!"
I purchased this book because I thought it was teaching from Abraham....from the bible.  It is NOT a biblically based teaching at all.  This is a book about OUJI boards and summoning spirits!!!!!!  Buyer be ware.If i could give this book negative stars I would. I am giving one star because it arrived as expected.
Awesome book. Teaches one how to get what they want from the universe. I wasn’t really sold on the idea but I’m amazed that it really works. These lessons are life changing.
"I cannot get into this book. I thought it would be something completely different not summoning spirits through the ouiji board and ""non human entities taking over peoples bodies to deliver messages and answer questions"" which is how this book is said to be written. Abraham takes over Esther's body and writes the book according to my understanding. I am a strong believer in spirits both good and bad and after reading a few pages of this book ""something"" scared my daughter in my home and I've been told by many people with gifts that she can see spirits and that was not a good one that I feel let itself in after I read this book. If possible I will be returning the book if not it's going in the trash. This book definitely gives me a bad vibe."
"While some of this advice is practical, some is not.  Short on specifics, repetetive and kooky at times.  Super victim blamey.  You would think Abraham would be a little more articulate.  There are other books and authors who approach this who seem more genuine and legit.  I listened to some recordings of ""Abraham"" after reading a lot of the book which convinced me this is not at all  real.  My inuition was was really kicking in so I curiously investigated which led me to others leaders of thought work and vibrations and putting out what you want to receive who seem far more authentic.  The covers alone should clue people in."
"I sent this book back after just reading the introduction. I was deeply disturbed by the fact that the co-author invites her body to be possessed by a demon. No ma'am Pam! I'm a follower of God and I don't accept that kind of crap into my spirit and mind. I could not continue to read so I closed it and showed it back into its delivery package and sent it back as soon a I could! If I have to read something that consists of a demon possession then thats not what or where u would like my wealth to come from. It actually put me in perspective of the truth within me... I have no strong will or want to be rich for the Lord says ["" its easier for a camel to walk through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to get through the gates of heaven!""] Matthew 19:23-26"
Very weird book. They lost me when it seemed that they were getting their enlightenment from something that would come and possess the wife.
"My appreciation for your books is undeniable!!  Abraham, Esther, Jerry thank you. Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much has been cleared up and clarified for me. I'm so over the moon grateful that you chose to share. IT MAKES SENSE. Yes, even the parts I wanted to and still to some degree still want to deny, but you are right(maybe just or just so is the right word) to say we call every single one of our experiences to us. It begins. Also thank you to ""Winner in every sense"" from the Abe forums. If it was not for your words, I probably would not have read this and the other books you suggested. I relished them. I didn't win the lottery yet but I did win something more...JOY and deliberate creation. I am not an aimless cork in the ocean. I am not a victim...to fate or anything else. Thank you. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I could take up the rest of this review with ""thank you's."" Thank you."
"I have been an avid lister of hay house radio for a little over a year. They authors and radio hosts will talk about the teachings of Abraham and I just never knew what they were talking about and I didn't bother to look into it.I chose this book because of the title. I've read several law of attraction, positive things and self help books. I started to read the book and to my astonishment this book was in sync with one of my favorite books many lives, many masters. I read this book and it was validation of how I live my life. Enjoy!"
Breaking law of attraction down into 4 simple areas.Law of attraction itself - what we put out is what we get backDeliberate creation - think about and focus on what we prefer & desireArt of Allowing - choose to focus on feeling good and get off the topics that do notSegment intending - many times throughout the day calibrate to focusFrequent Segment intending is super helpful
This is the most amazing book i have ever read i am reading it and taking notes and im just so in awe how these principals that i am learning just fill me to where words cant express how grateful i am that God brought this book to me. I really cant remember how i heard about it by i am so thankful that i have it .I sleep with it thats how much i believe its teachings and am appling them to my life. Every person who has a dream a vision a heart for God and the supernatural this is absolutly a must read book. If you ar ea teacher of any one you must share this with your students or the ones you love . Thank you so much for the heart wisdom and inspiration in sharing this with the world. Amen too you Hicks. I believe and declare this is the truth . This book needs to be read by everyone who desires and knows the truth . The law of Attraction !!! best book i ever read.
"Until about a little bit over a month, I wasn't aware of the existence of Esther and Jerry or Abraham, however I have always wanted to get straight forward answers that make sense about how we create our own reality, since I In my deepest ""me"" have always known that we do so, but just needed a teacher to tell me how personal creation works, (I thought I would get answers until my time on this earth was done) but no! I got my answers in the present,  this book is amazing at clarifying how attraction works and has made me aware of how I have managed to attract my personal situation and gives me hope and reassurance that I can change the things I don't like about my own creation.Best book about law of attraction."
"Coincidentally, I was incredibly resistant to listening to the teachings of Abraham, and then one day, something inside me told me to give it another try. These teachings has hence changed my life. My own experience with with resisting Abraham's teaching, helped me to look further at other resistance that I hold,and what is preventing me from going downstream. My life is an awesome, miraculous journey. I love how this all came about and now I realize it wasn't a coincidence, it was meant to be."
"This is not the At all spiritual as biblical spiritual pertaining to Abraham in the Bible. This lady has a fake voice acting as if a spirit from another world is talking through her revealing the secrets of the law of attraction. Why can’t you just write a book about the law of attraction instead of putting on the stupid theatrical BS. This is nonsense, and a borderlines demonic worship. Never again will I buy one of their Books."
"We are what we attract, or so it says in this book. I initially purchased this book for my husband and it does offer some interesting reading material, just not really what I thought it would be after reading so many glowing reviews about the book. Clearly, one does have to be open-minded when reading this book, but also take it all with a grain of salt. It more reminds me of ""The Secret"" and all of it's hype when it was so popular. According to my understanding of the basic concepts of the book is that everything that happens or lack there of begins in our own minds. Yes, true, that ""as so a man think, he becomes"". The value of this book is in promoting the idea that you have more control over your life than you think. The mind is capable of a lot, including how your body lives, how you present yourself to other people, etc. When you have a positive train of thought, you will have better health, better prosperity and better life in general. That simply is true and cannot be denied. I think this book is a good stepping stone on where to begin, but is seems reminiscent of Napoleon Hill's, ""Think and Grow Rich,"" or  James Allen's, ""As a Man Thinketh,"". What the book doesn't tell you is that when negative things happen to you, your positive attitude can turn those things into far less tragic events. There are other books that will make this more clear."
"This book is the key to your future joy and peaceful abundance. Did you know thoughts and words  that you focus on, visions of what you fill you mind with , will be drawn to you. You choose what your future is by your thoughts and words. Intend what you want, remove the negitive and create your future, create what you want. Choose your happy. I have created a new future."
I would recomend getting Victoria Gallagher's book on the the law of attraction.
"I plan to keep this as a reference and re-read often.  How you can manifest whatever you want into your life, by thinking about it.  I've read some other books on the same subject, but I think I got more out of this one, and understood the principle a lot better.  A must read for bringing good health, abundance, and other things into your life."
"This book is amazing. I suggest applying these laws into manifesting just becoming internally the person you want to be at first if you feel like if you haven’t reached your highest self, then start manifesting other things. This book is helping changing me reality in every aspect. I feel like my perception of self is changing for the better, my relationship and friendships are thriving, and my world is getting bigger and better."
"I am really big on the LOA. I’ve had read many books including, The secret; that’s my favorite. I wanted to explore more books with the LOA and stumbled on this. I was taken back the first 30 pages when ester states Abraham speaks through her. I wish I would of done my research, because I don’t believe in people being possessed."
"I finished this book about 6 months ago.  It was my first taste of Abraham, which I would not have found without my roommate's interest in Ramtha.  Abraham's material seems to sit much better with me than Ramtha.The incredible thing about this book, is that I could feel the truth in it, and my emotions and desires improved significantly as I read through it.  It was almost like getting a taste of what it was like to be a kid again, when you have that pure desire and unbridled energy and passion for life.It was just a taste of that, but enough to know that so much more is around the corner for me.  After reading this book, and since having listened to their audio and video materials, I know that I've found the key that I've been looking for my whole life!Nothing else that I investigated in life ever quite fit the bill:  Religion, agnosticism, and various 'new age' ideas.  They all had a piece of the puzzle, but not the key.Well this is it!  And it is so simple, and so mind blowing, that I can fully understand why most will not accept it, and instead choose to mock it.  But this IS the secret!  We must COMPLETELY unlearn everything we've ever learned, and become like children again, in the heart and the mind, because when we entered these bodies, we were still pure and connected.  Only through negativity training our entire lives have we lost our way.Somewhere in the bible, Jesus said something like, ""You must become as the children are"".  I believe this is what he meant."
"Scanned the reviews through fakespot.com and reviewmeta before purchasing since I know about fake reviews. While other books have a 23-78% altered review percentage, this book came up as having ONLY 2% altered reviews, decided to purchase. This book offers waaay more tips than The Secret by Rhonda Byrne and was worth the read.Thank you Jimmy, I learned so much about the Law Of Attraction that I didn't even know before!!!"
"I liked this book a lot...I really did! I just found some of it to be too vague and repetitive for my taste.Maybe it's just me.  Maybe it's because I've been searching through this topic longer than I realize.  In fact, an acquaintance of mine says things that remind me of the book's content, has been for as long as I've known him, and it's only now that I'm realizing it.If you're interested in the Law of Attraction, this is DEFINITELY a book to read! I have a feeling I'll be downloading the rest of the Hicks' books as well as this seems to be my path at the moment."
"Where to begin?  There have been many reviews written on this, but I had to give my two cents worth.  First, I totally believe in the power of positive thinking, birds of a feather, and misery loves company.  I am only 2/3 through the book, but I find myself writing notes with BS written by some of the answers.  4 glaring things I found so far...1) we can do whatever we want (the fishing example and depleting the streams)but don't worry about others--it is an abundant universe.  Really?  What would Abraham have to say about the elephants and their dwindling numbers in Africa due to poaching and killing for the ivory in their tusks?  Abundance?  How will more elephants be created just because we want it? Their numbers are going down not up.  It is NOT an abundant world with endless resources.  2) We can all be what we want...really?  So, when we are all CEOs of companies, who will be the janitors, garbage collectors, maintenance people, policeman, teachers, etc? All chiefs and no indians, so to speak. 3) Clearly, the world would love to be rich.  There is only so much physical money in the world to go around.  It is physically impossible for everyone to be a millionaire.  For that to happen, more money would have to be printed, which would mean hyper inflation.  And if everyone is a millionaire, then everyone is totally equal, which means everybody has the same thing, which comes to zero.  We're all millionaires but the cost of milk is $300 per gallon? And 4) my biggest gripe...Jerry asks if others negative views about us can create negative experiences for us...answer 'no'.  They can affirm what we already feel, but it is up to US to create our own positive or negative emotion.  Fine.  So, why does Abraham say that WE can create serious illness in our children???  Totally contradicts what he says prior about how we can only create in our OWN lives not others.  I think these things that I mentioned are very serious concerns and it upsets me to read this.  Also, the book is very redundant...every page gives the definition of the law of attraction as well as other things.  For the positives in the book, I would give it 4 stars--such as positive thinking and believing in the best for yourself and others.  I am sure there are many other great books out there that focus on the positive.  When a book like this comes around and says to do what you want because the universe has endless abundance and resources, and that we create our childrens' illnesses and deaths, it should be given a negative 10. That is so irresponsible.  How about it's as simple as living a good, positive life, being a positive influence in others' lives, living with integrity (doing the right thing as opposed to letting someone get beaten up on the street--where's karma fit in to that?), and being an asset to this planet rather than a liability.  IMO, we are given this life to learn during our short stay here...it is a gift to learn and to grow and to learn to coexist peacefully...where does ""I want, I want, I want"" exactly fit in to that?"
"In years past, I wouldn’t have considered reading a medium produced book. I’ve realized help from the higher wise spiritual helpers can only give another perspective on life. It fits. Thanks for caring about us!"
"Don’t be lead to think this Abraham has anything to do with Christianity, just the opposite. This is real junk. Writers are either sorely mislead or are laughing on the way to the bank. Their main source of info is probably the Ouija board."
"I find it real hard to believe what these authors wrote.  This entire book is based on a conversation between husband and wife, while the wife is channeling essentially a spirit. I'm not saying it cant happen..but I was looking for a book that could explain what LOA were while giving me a straight answer. This book didnt do that. They even do a poor job explaining what/who exactly Abraham is- other then saying it's a group of people. This isn't the book for me..and I wish I would have known the flow of the book before I purchased it."
"Beginning the journey of enlightenment, peace, and positive vibrational focus has to start somewhere and I'm glad this book was made to do so. One of the many great books out there (aside from the bible) that teach you what you put out is what you get back. Focusing on doing, being, and feeling good is an amazing feat and this is a great book to start you on that path."
Interesting concepts but I don't agree with all of the content. It's one of those things where you have to pick and choose what seems plausible and and ignore what is a little off the mark. Interesting nonetheless.  Definitely worth reading and pondering.
"I love this book. It has definitely helped open my eyes to a new way of thinking and viewing life's crazy curve balls. I reccommend it to everyone, especially those who struggle with a negative attitude about life!"
"I have followed along here and there with various bits of Abraham over the years turning up in my life.  Finally, I decided to just sit down and read the book and try to get a more complete understanding of the spiritual laws.This books is very coherent, succinct and intelligent.  It makes perfect sense out of the Universal laws that both govern us and leave us very free to express our creative will in our lives.  The laws are simple, but the way we live in our lives makes them way more complex than they need to be.  I have work to do simplifying my life to make it work better.I recommend this book as a terrific philosophical and practical position from which to live life."
"The best thing about Abraham's loving wisdom is it's verifiable practicality. As with any Reality-based Principle, validation comes with application and the results can and have, produced a whole new world of unlimited possibilities for those who use them. What more Amazing Gift could there be?"
"Whether you believe that there are non-physical beings or not, this book is a great example of how to change you’re attitude for the better and live life more confidently. I am so glad I gave it a chance!"
"This book changes your life perspective from ""my life is out of control"" to ""I control everything in my life."" Yes this simply stated and easy to undersyand book can help you do this"
"Please carefully consider rather this book is for you. As a Christian woman, my book club and I QUICKLY decided this book is not for us. There is mention of ouji boards and speaking to “spirits” and allowing them to speak through one of the main speakers. This book has nothing to do with the Abraham and Ester from the bible"
"Loved this book, it’s like a breath of sun or maybe it seem that way to me because I was not in a good place when I read it.I go back to it now and then to see if I find a new perspective in it."
"First, I will state that I do not agree with some the belief systems in this book. However, I am giving it 5 stars because the information in the book is something that can be applied and produce desired results.  I have already experienced results from the techniques and lessons provided.  I will be ordering another book by these authors because the lessons and techniques are absolutely DOABLE & THEY WORK.I do not believe that we are the creators of all adverse experiences in our lives.  My friends sister was killed by a drunk driver.  She was not responsible for the actions of the drunk driver that killed her when she was driving responsibly.  Young children are not responsible for the kidnapping, torture and murders of themselves.  Unwilling slaves are not responsible for their capitivity.  The blame should be placed where it belongs - on the perpretrator, otherwise these intellegent authors are passing judgement upon innocent people.  These are only a few examples of this type of thinking which I believe is adopted from beliefs that people who have bad experiences are living a another life of sacrafice for the sins of their previous lives.I DO AGREE, that regardless of the circumstances that we encounter in life, it is our responsiblity to change unwanted conditions. We cannot expect someone else to do it for us. If we don't have the understanding on how to do it, then we should seek it until we find it.  THIS BOOK WILL GIVE YOU THAT KNOWLEDGE AND THAT IS WHAT IS IMPORTANT."
Love the book. Must read if you want to understand why your life the way it it ... lol
"OK, I'll admit that The Secret got my attention, and that the idea of a ""channeled"" book kept me from reading this seminal book for some time.  Forget about woo-woo stuff!  This is the real deal.  When I was a young girl I wrote one thing in my ""diary"" that was very odd:  ""I believe that we are here to remember eveything we have always known.""  About 10 years ago I stumbled on that old diary and thought how strange it was for that to come out of my 10 year old mind...but...there it was.  I cannot think that I was given to philosophical thinking at that age!  It wasn't until I read this book that I found the echo of what I had written waaaaay back in 1952...and there it was in black and white.  All I can say is, read this book!  We really do ""know"" a whole lot more than we remember consciously."
"To be honest, if I had known 'who' was giving out this information I never would have picked up any of the Abraham books or DVD's - wouldn't have touched them with a 10 foot pole. Per my deeply religious background, this would not have been recommended reading, to say the least.  Fortunately for me, I picked up one of their books about the power of emotion and read it before I knew about the source of it, and the truth of their words resonated deeply within me - immediately.  I had to know more.  Then I discovered where this information was coming from and my first thought was to reject it out of hand; but I could not deny that I had felt the truth of the words I had read and so, almost against my 'better judgement' I read another book, and watched a DVD - just waiting for Abraham to trip up, or not be able to answer a question because it was one of those mysteries we shouldn't ask about.  It is now 6 years later; I have read a dozen of Abraham's books and watched two dozen of their DVD's and attended 3 of their seminars, and I have yet to encounter a question that Abraham couldn't answer immediately, confidently, and to my satisfaction.  I am just a regular person, not into any 'weird' stuff.  I am, like everyone else, searching for happiness and fulfillment and the answers to life's questions; and I will say without any hesitation whatsoever, that this video and all the other DVD's I've watched, and the books I've read from 'Abraham' have been the catalyst for some very basic, very positive, changes in my life.  It didn't happen overnight (I read the first book in 2007) - although the sense of hope that I felt came immediately -  but gradually over the past 6 years those sharp edges in my life have been smoothing out, my questions have been answered very satisfactorily, and I can say with confidence that I feel more peace and joy now (and I've gotten more 'stuff' that I've wanted) than in my whole life (of 56 years) before.  This DVD, and the others like it, are not for everyone; not everyone is at a place to be able to hear it right now.  But for those who are drawn toward it, who have open minds, and feel a tug of interest, I would highly recommend this DVD and all the other information from Abraham, via Esther."
"I loved the thoughtfulness of Jerry’s questions.  I’ve “accidentally” used LOA to achieve more than was ever expected of me by ignoring being called stubborn, weird or a big dreamer. That was way better to me than staying stuck in misery!"
"This is ago of book to start with if you haven't read any of the Abraham books. It is also a good one to go back to if you read others when they first came out. Whether you are comfortable with the concept of channeled information or not, read this book. If you look at all that is said by Abraham, it is all clearly how it is. Pay attention to your life and you will see it."
"I'm loving my new spiritual practice of incorporating the Law of Attraction w/ other spiritual beliefs! Adopting a more positive life outlook has greatly changed my life for the better. I now wake up happy & inspired instead of worried about what I don't have or what task I didn't complete. The book is a very easy and comfortable read. At first I was taken back by the talk of being able to conjure up a being and allow it to speak through a person;  however, I continued to read for better understanding, and I totally received it. My spiritual awakening is new so I'm taking baby steps to heighten my spiritual growth and this book, among others, definitely helps."
The first book I read was Ask and It Is Given.  The Law of Attraction goes into greater detail and explanation giving you a better understanding of our lives here.  A couple of decades ago I was into reading the Seth books and have a series of recordings (that I obtained from a friend) which I treasure.  So I was very delighted to find that Jerry and Ester were also interested in the Seth books.  This really clinched it for me and I know that I have finally found the answers to what I have been searching for so long.  The adventure has only begun!  Thank you Esther and Jerry.
"It doesn't get much better than looking to Esther and Jerry for a no nonsense look at the laws of attraction and how it works in your life (whether you are ascribing to this belief or not)........it IS what is happening in your life.  You are broadcasting your ideas, wants,hopes, desires, whether good or bad and they indeed (by LAW) are returning to you.They do an excellent job of returning you to YOU.Sincerely hope everyone and anyone reads this for a better understanding of how you are creating your own life.Kris Rawson Robinson"
I bought this book thinking I would learn something new about the Law of Attraction but I really didn't. While I respect the work that Esther and Jerry Hicks do and the teachings of the Abraham I find that it is just not for me. The Abraham is too general and broad in the meanings. This is a good book for a beginner of the LOA but for me it didn't help much. Too many words that said nothing almost like a book filler.
"This book is life changing.  You must read and get to the parts of you that have challenged your process to think you cannot change,  you will see why the change is necessary. So amazing!"
"Excellent, practical information on guiding your own thoughts and the realization that you actually can control and direct them to useful, positive outcomes."
"This book will pull you in fast and have you not wanting to put it down. All of your natural born instincts will come to light and common sense thinking will take a front seat, permanently."
"I very much enjoyed reading this book, which is written in a very clear and pleasant style. The Abraham teachings on the Law of Attraction have been helping me and countless others to create a better reality for ourselves. I recommend wholeheartedly all the Abraham-Hicks books, which I have found extremely valuable."
"I wish I would have taken the time to have read a preview of this book prior to purchasing it.  To be honest, I'm a little embarrassed that I read it.  However, being that I was eager to get some insight into the Law of Attraction - I bought it on a whim.  (The price of the Kindle edition is pretty low, so it wasn't so bad.)One of the reasons that I rated this book with 3 stars is because this book reminded me of a sales pitch.  (I didn't feel comfortable with Esther claiming that a being named ""Abraham"" speaks through her.  I suppose anything is possible, but the whole thing reminded me of one of those 900 number psychics.)  If you can get past that, the book will help teach the basic premise of The Law of Attraction.I also took some issue that this author maintains that there are no victims and that all people are capable of creating their own destiny.  I read the author's reasoning behind it and I still don't buy it.  I could go on about this, but I'll leave that subject alone.Anyhow - for most of us in developed countries, I can definitely believe in the power of positive thinking.  I recall that when I had periods of depression, it seems like negative things would follow.  However, I also have MANY stories of things just falling perfectly into place like magic.  (Don't we all?)  The book does give some good tips on helping the audience realize that they deserve good things and teaches them that they can achieve their goals.All in all, it's a decent book to get a start on learning how to change your thinking and bring positive vibes into your life.  I don't regret my purchase, nor do I regret the time I spent reading it.  However, there are other books on this subject that may be a little better."
"I came to these basic views on my own through a series of synchronicities...then was recommended this book which after reading, solidified all I was thinking.  AMAZING BOOK!"
"I’m not really a fan of this book seems like I bought, the wrong author!!! Totally different!!! But my parents are kind of into this !! So now that I read the book I understand my parents ideas !!!"
"I've read several books that made mention of the Law of Attraction, and several others that pertained to the power of spirit to create, through this, .I received a strong inner prompting to actually read what the Law of Attraction is all about. I didn't know what to expect when I opened the book, but after the first introduction to Abraham, the teachings resonated truths that seems to jump off the page and into my new consciousness. This book has already, in the short time I've explored it, change my thought process immensely! I've learned that I truly can intend my day, and thus intend my world.Like life itself, it is a process to re-train our consciousness to think and believe as the book suggests, but isn't that what life at its core is all about, belief... The Law works whether one believes or not, but having knowledge and belief in the Law makes it work FOR you. I truly love this book, and I was just thinking the other day, that I need to go back and re-read it again! It is most definitely a keeper, to be referenced again and again!"
For anyone seeking answers to life questions and an understanding of life experiences. To be read with an open mind if you want to learn lessons from it.
"If you read, ""The Secret,"" you can consider this the next step when looking up information on the law of attraction.There are some pitfalls to this book. If you believe in LOA, then as the book suggests, you have to believe that those who suffered from racism, (as mentioned in the book) attracted that type of interaction. That is to say, there is no racism, it's all just a response that you brought upon yourself.I do not believe that to be true or correct, but that is the way they perceive the LOA to work, including how a child would attract a negative situation. (The argument is that our negative thoughts are soaked up by young impressionable children and they are thinking thoughts even as infants. If all the baby or young child is exposed too is positive stimulus it still doesn't seem to explain how something such as child abduction can occur.)I also felt that at times this information could have easily been read in the previous mentioned book.The conversational style of the book is a bit jarring at first, but eventually they make it flow. I like that they expanded on certain topics concerning LOA and answered questions that ""The Secret"", didn't quite explain in full detail.Esther and Jerry Hicks also have an intriguing background, that makes you wonder about Abraham (the spirit(s) that speak through her) and how the connection occurred. People tend to argue that the Hicks took the idea from the Seth books, which I can't confirm or deny. (Although, the Hicks have admitted to reading the Seth books.) What I can tell you, is that by using Abraham as a platform, it allowed more people to be willing to listen to Esther's (or Abraham's) ideas as to how LOA functions in this world.It's an interesting read for those wanting to seek out more information on the law of attraction. Now, whether you agree with the ideas presented is up to you, but the information is there for you to make your own conclusions."
This is a wonderful book. I wish I would have read this book years ago. This book is full of wisdom.
"It was much confirmation of things I already know about the law of attraction. I love the simplistic ways that could be easily followed to live the life of joy, and prosperity."
It changed my life 😁
"I loved this book! I wanted to learn more about spirituality and how to take my own life into my hands. This book was so eye opening and so many things in life started to make more sense the more I read through it. I highly recommend reading this, it isn't a very long book so it's easy to get through it quickly!"
"The book was advertised as new but it's clearly damaged, has bent pages on the inside (someone marking where they were reading) the spine is slightly damaged and it has stuff written with a pencil on the inside.Not cool because it was a gift."
"This is the one that first cleared up some of the answers my questions. I had read and studied a LOT of the Jane Roberts Seth books and have much gratitude for them to opening my eyes, heart and experience, but they can be difficult to read and understand. The Abraham/Hicks books brought a lot of the personal reality information down to an easier level to use, understand, and share. They just ring true with some inner knowledge that I feel I have always known but have ignored or forgotten."
"This was a beautiful book. I appreciated the repetition as it helped me understand and learn so much better. By the end of the book, I felt that I had a good handle on it so much so , that I could transform my life just by reading it. That was the goal right? So with that, I would say job well done. I know how to do things here on out for my betterment and I feel great knowing this. Thank you so much."
"Very helpful & useful book in terms of understanding what life is about and learning to navigate ""reality"" effectively. Far more sophisticated and profound than most critics of the ""law of attraction"" concepts seem to appreciate. Perhaps some of have not read it all the way through."
"If I were stranded on a dessert island and could only take one thing with me, I would choose to take this book. It is truly eye opening to see how we make life so much more difficult than it really needs to be. I am forever grateful for this book and all of the knowledge I have learned for it. Even if you have a hard time with where the information is coming from, continue to read, because the material is worth it."
Keeping it short and to the point– this book is life altering in the most magnificent way possible. Invest in yourself by bringing these teachings into your life.
If you’re ready to understand why your life is the way it is with an open mind and heart this book is for you. Create a beautiful life for yourself.
I couldn't put this book down. It answered many questions I've had these past few years of introspection. I highly recommend this book if you are ready to deliberately create.
"After having read many 'self help' books, this book showed up for me a couple of times in a way that caught my interest. I read a few pages and decided to give it a try which I don't regret, this book summarize and explains to me many of the unanswered questions I have had for many years. Thanks to Esther abd Jerry  and to Abraham! Highly recommended to all that are open minded."
I sent this book to my daughter in love.  She told the book is in great condition.  Fast delivery too
Hippy dippy stuff not based in any real science or research. Based on ouija board nonsense. Skip this book. How did this get published?
It’s a good read
"I have been on a journey to make substantial changes in my life since events in October of this year forced me to examine my current state of affairs and my level of satisfaction. I have read a course in miracles, enrolled in a Synchrodestiny course and watched and meditated to numerous youtube videos by Wayne Dyer, Gangaji, and Louise Hay. They have all been of benefit but The alaw of Attraction has been the most accesible and doable teachings i have encountered so far!"
"The only take home message of the book can be distilled down to “positive thoughts bring positive actions”, the rest is not worth reading"
"If I could give this book zero stars I would. Absolutely NOT what it says to be and not worth any money. It speaks of nothing but lies. this is NOT what the law of attraction is and these people should be ASHAMED ashamed of themselves for making money off of this. Sending heavy Heavens Gate vibes and if you don’t know what that is, I recommenced researching it. DO NOT BUY"
"I Loved this book! Life changing to read about the Law of Attraction. Powerful. So easy to understand, now it is time deliberately  create ! 🌟✨💫"
This book helped me realize how important it is for me to be aware of my thoughts and emotions. This will bring more of the same whether it's positive or negative so I need to stay focused on the things I do want to attract them. I highly recommend this book as a positive motivation to achieve the things that you do want out of life.
In the past few months with all the events happening to the world it made me question why is it happening and what is the significance of this events and made me think that there must be another way and I intend to find out. And i came across this book and it answered my questions. What I intend i get!!
"Such a great book and such a clear way to view life and lifes troubles. I truly enjoyed this, it gave me some better, more positive ways to handle situations and how to approach everything. I will be purchasing more Abraham books."
Zero stars! This book is awful!  I tired to read the first 40 pages and tossed it away. I should of stopped earlier when she said that Abraham was talkings I her by using her nose to right the alphabet. C’mon!
"I've bought this book in the past and it got misplaced somewhere. I love the concepts inside, but after studying the LOA for as many years as I have, realized that something is missing."
This book was very helpfull in helping me manifest changes in my life. I was very interested and couldnt put the book down. Every page had my full attention and captivated my imagination
"This is probably the best book I have ever read on the subject of getting what you want out of life.  It is very specific in the steps a person should take to acquire good health, prosperity, and satisfying relationships.  it also relieves guilt you might feel if you think you are being selfish; it's okay to be selfish because you set a positive example for others and the universe is limitless - we can all have it all if we follow The Law of Attraction."
"Interesting theory, difficult to put into practice, but I’m trying."
Esther hicks is by far the best law of attraction author. She changed my life and will influence anyone's in a positive manner who reads this. I bought this just to give away. Awareness is key and we are our own creators through thought and energy management.
"This book is sooo good! It explains everything you need to know about the law of attraction, and you can immediately benefit from it in enormous ways. If there’s only one book you ever read, let it be this one. Oh and maybe The Power of Emotions by the same authors. You will not regret reading this. And if you’re not ready for it, keep it on your shelf for when the moment is right."
Some parts were alittle hard to understand but I enjoyed it
AMAZING!  Love this book!  Life changing!  Highly recommend if you want change and happiness in your life!
"By this book (and the others in the series and look honestly at your own life to date as you read. You will be amazed to realise that the positive things you have created, came about because you focussed on them for long enough and followed the teachings that Esther provides, and that the same is true of the negative things that you have experienced.These are great books and the DVD's are also (to my surprise) incredibly useful and insightful. If you let them, these books will change your life for the better in ways you cannot even begin to imagine yet."
Great book if you need to quit kicking yourself in the butt and be more positive.
A wise book ... bought extra copies to give as gifts so my loved ones can manifest their dreams as well.
"Borrowed it from my local library, loved the message  and bought a copy because i needed to have it at the ready.  Changed my life perspective ."
"Vibration, Vibration, Vibration... Your are source energy. You are a creator. You are here to live a happy life. Clarity - that is the biggest prize you are looking for. To feel clear, sure and stable. Great info from all her books. I love all her CD's."
"This is one of the best books I've read, and it launched me into a new place in life, and the start of my Abraham-Hicks experience.It will either resonate with you or not, and if it does, get ready for a great ride!I marked mine up so much I couldn't loan it to anyone, but have bought a few more to share.I have not regretted it for a moment, this book. It is perhaps, one of the best things I've purchased."
"I bought these because I'm on a journey of discovery and though they were interesting and there was thought provoking information, Wayne Dyer, Wallace Waddles & Neale Donald Walsh, The Secret - all of these say similar things - what we think about is what we bring about.  So they're great for in the car while driving - you will get helpful insight but nothing new."
"Returned because arrived smashed case,then the next one also arrived with broken case but kept it anyway"
The book broke down the LOA into understandable bits and pieces. It answered many of my unanswered questions. Great collaboration
I just started this book and already feel better!
"When the couple explained their back story, and how they came to creating these recordings, I only got more and more skeptical. Even as I listened through into the first proper chapter, I doubted. But the more I listened, the more I realised just how intrinsically RIGHT this all felt to me. My intuition recognises all said as correct, while the ""logical"" (aka, taught) part of my mind still wants to disbelieve. But hour by hour, I'm feeling it more.This is clearly where the people who created The Secret got a lot of their information from - but that is so blatantly retail in comparison. And I came here after enjoying The Secret! This is, hands down, outstanding in comparison. Put aside your mundane ""logic"" and listen to your heart and intuition. You'll find this audio book incredible."
I like how clear this book illustrates the concepts of the universal law of attraction.  Reading on Abraham Hicks’ teachings is a life changing experience for me.  This book is amazing.
"Talk about uplifting ... You won't want to put this one down. In fact, I plan to start reading it again from the beginning tomorrow. So practical!  I'm excited to start practicing what I've learned."
Learn about law of attraction
"I love this book, I read more than ten times, and I fully recomend this book. This book make me understand about life, and how to get all we want, sometimes I said we could design our succes and even design our destiny, If we understand and applied what Abraham said. Because thats the lawa of universe."
Excellent reading
"I haven't finished it yet but so far it is just what it says and teaches, I believe and trust in God it is real, the power in Jesus is inside you . But it's humbling just like with Jesus.. All I can say is please read it and decide for yourself."
"A very fine book that teaches the Law of Attraction in a unique way that is truly different from ALL the other books out there. Go behind the scenes of the universe and your own mind and see how and why The Law of Attraction works, and most importantly, what NOT to do and think! Believe me, I've read them! Hicks/Abraham teach clearly and the book is a pleasure to read."
That book change my life!!! I realize importance of my thinking!!!!
Cool stuff!
Awesome read
Absolutely love this book! Life changing for me. Will read over and over!
Great book
"After reading this book, I feel as though I have some control over my future as well as my present and even in some ways my past in the way I perceive it. It's as though the teachings of Abraham have always been a part of me and I just needed someone to point them out.  It all makes so much sense and feels so right.  I am so greatful to Esther and Jerry Hicks for bringing this book to the public.  I have just ordered another one of their books and can't wait to read it.  One ""small"" thing I learned is to say ""thank you"" everyday for what I have.  This very act has become so powerful to me and it is just one of many, many teachings that are so powerful in learning the laws of attraction.  I highly recommend this book."
"I don't know why the authors of this book bothered to tell us the material was channeled from non-physical entities, other than, I presume, to claim authority beyond their own selves (or just to tell the truth as they see it, perhaps).  I'm not a believer in channeling and that's why I was reluctant to buy and read it, but I persevered, and I have to say that the material stands on its own.  If the authors had just written the book as a work of fiction (which it may well be, in reality), it would be just as good.  Read with an open mind, the material just rings true.  Surely we've all noticed that complainers tend to hang together, optimistic people tend to hang together, gamblers, jocks, etc.  That's all a result of the fact that they have common interests and viewpoints and the truth is that if you want to jump levels from one plane to another whether it be financial, social, spiritual, or whatever, you won't find access through your current circle of people who are all living inside a similar agreement reality as the one you are in yourself.  You need to break out and be assimilated into groups of others who can help grease the wheels, steer you in new ways and who will support you in your most wanted endeavors.  How to do that is what this book is all about.  I have been using the advice in the book for several weeks now and I am shocked at how my life is changing.  Instead of taking two steps forwards and three back and sometimes the other way around, I find that I move forwards all the time, and other people support me in my endeavors, now that I'm speaking my future into existence as suggested in this book.  So if you're a skeptic and you don't believe in the channeling,  like I am, read it anyway and try it out.  It's well worth the effort whether it came from a group of non-physicial entities or a couple of people who just wrote a book.  Read it, follow it and win."
"Personal quest-tough read, very heady, but that's a good thing. Challenges belief systems"
Changed my way of thinking therefore it has changed my perspective on life.  A must read for everyone who wants to live all their dreams.
It took a lot of practice. A lot of overthinking and skeptical pondering. Slowly but surely understanding comes when you're ready. Happily ever after.
Very good. Glad I purchased it
Love the Q&A format. Helps to clear things up. Super easy to understand the concepts and apply the principles.
♥️
"I am a christian, and I think that Esther's claims of being spoken to by a ""non-physical entity"", or group of them, called Abraham, is bunk.  However, the message in the book has truly changed my life, and I hang on every word.  As I am reading, and I grasp and embrace each concept, and each ""law"" as they label them, bible verses come to me, and I slap my forehead and say, ""THATS what that meant!""  It's amazing, and if everyone doesn't get this book and change your thoughts, thus changing your entire world, you are sadly missing out.  Get this book!  Read and practice it's teachings!  And fellow christians, don't worry....its all biblical as far as I can tell, except when ""Abraham/Esther"" claims that there is no Higher Being who has put these laws into motion, and no ultimate Creator who fashioned us after His likeness.  We all know better than that."
I'm not sure I 100% agree with what she teaches but I think there is truth in this book.
Good book regarding our ability to set intentions and attract.....
"I love this book!  I toggle it between my nightstand and breakfast table and read it in little pieces because it's packed full of inspiring thought provoking ideas.  If you are familiar with the Abraham materials, this will help you consolidate the biggest and best Abraham ideas.  If this is your first foray into Abraham's teachings, it's a great place to start.This is the kind of book you could read over and over, each time getting more and more out of it.We all want to know how best to improve our lives emotionally, physically and mentally.  This book will help you get what you want.  It is clear and conscise."
I’ve never read a book faster than this one.
Amazing book
"This was enjoyable, I haven't seen results yet. The idea that you produce what you constantly think about makes a lot of sense. I give put his book a ""should read"". The source of the information was a little hard to grasp but I will try to be open minded."
"Ideas so simple that seem easy and obvious, yet that will bend you mind and change your life experience. You will want to read it more than once!"
"Good beginner's guide to LOA concepts.  If the reader is familiar with LOA info, this book may seem repetitive in places, but I believe that's intentional as the attempt is made to say the same thing in several ways in order to get the point across; different people will ""hear"" different messages from the passages presented here."
"This book is so very inspiring and informative.  I believe it is like magic, for it will tell you HOW to change your life for the better.  I read the Seth books, and I was excited to know that we create our own reality... but this book, The Law of Attraction, tells you HOW you do it and how you can change your life if you do not like what it is you have created in any particular area.  I will keep this book with me for many years for reference.  I absolutely loved it."
"If you have stumbled upon this book, you have attracted it through The Law. Your answer is inside. Somethings may take longer to digest than others, but if you will allow yourself to receive your answer - you will receive it. My answer was “Joy is simply a choice” and I gained much more."
"For those who already share an interest in spiritual reading and information, and especially those who don't, this is a fascinating book.  The authors share their knowledge and experiences with a spiritual guide offering answers to questions about how the universe really works.  It is a great book to read if you find yourself wanting more peace and abundance in your life. Circumstances are more in your control than you ever believed and this is a great way to begin."
"Hands down, best book on Law of Attraction out there!  Straight foreword and to the point. Hard to put down. Make sure you allow yourself ample time to digest and manifest!  Loved it!"
This is the best book I own. This book came at the right time in my life. All the answers about life you have ever sought are answered in this book. This is a book that brings great relief to you. Easy to read and easy to understand. No matter how many times you read it you get more each time you re read it.
"Esther and Jerry Hicks's books on the teachings of Abraham have inspired millions already. For those not yet familiar with the Abraham teachings, this book is definitely where to start. It is the perfect introduction to how we use our thoughts to attract what we want or do not want into our lives. For the current student of Abraham, there is much that will enhance and clarify past teachings.  The section on segment intending, setting forth your intention regarding each segment of your day, is especially helpful. Abraham also speaks with common sense upon such topics as the power of our emotions, whether evil really exists, and why we cannot control other people.The book is a must read for anyone who wishes to have a happier, more enjoyable life. Having been a student of Abraham now for two years, I have seen results in my own life from these teachings, and this book only makes me feel more clear and calm in my wanting process.  Read The Law of Attraction, and when you have finished, read The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent and Ask and It is Given in that order so that each lesson will continue to build on the one before.  Attract Good Into Your Life!- Tyler R. Tichelaar, author of Iron Pioneers and The Queen City, available on Amazon"
"After reading several of their books, I've come to the realization that I no longer resonate with their material."
"If you are like me, you have read many books on the subject.  This book does what all the other books did not.  It is written in a question/answer format.  I am sure you will find within it an answer or two to a question you have.  The information as it is written will resonate with you.I can honestly say if you are looking for how to apply the law, this book will make it simple for you to align with things you wish to manifest."
"In this book, the Hicks’ offer a great plan for managing the “unexpected”. It clearly teaches how to gain control of what life presents to us."
"I am grateful for Esther and Jerry Hicks and their long commitment to Abraham and his teachings. I have studied their material for many years and listen to their guided meditation daily. Even if you think you understand the Law of Attraction, I recommend this book. Read slowly. Allow the wisdom to sink in. Each time you read a paragraph, you will find new meaning and depth."
"I've read several self help, spiritual books and started following Abraham about 6 months ago, reading three books and several recordings. This book more than met my expectations. So glad this was my first of their books followed by the book on emotions and Ask and it is given. Change for what I am experiencing is an understatement. A must read if you are ready to be a deliberate creator of your own life."
I listen to it constantly.
"Gave me a sense of  peace and freed my heart of some serious weight and disappointment...Loved it, totally recommend it...❤️"
this book is a little out there for me but I do feel like a lot of great information is shared.  If you can sort of ignore the methods to which they claim to have received the information then its much easier to swallow.
"This book is absolutely perfect for everyone. Especially those looking for clarity on how to use the Law of Attraction. It brought me so much peace, joy, comfort and understanding. I highly recommend this book to everyone!"
"I watched the SECRET which somehow lead me to this book and Abraham's teachings. I can say that this book confirms questions I've had since childhood. It confirms feelings, thoughts and incidents that have occured throughout my life. This book is wonderful, very informative and has given me a new, more positive look at my life and life around me - forever.I look forward to reading/listening to more of their books."
"If you liked the movie The Secret, this book will take you deeper into understanding how to really make this powerful law work in your own life.  I recommend this book frequently to clients and use it in my coaching and speaking work to emphasize how each of us really do create our reality.  Now that I know how the Law works, I have become able to stay much more positive and trusting.  It amazes me how things fall into place as they never have before.  The principles within the book are ageless and timeless.  We benefit from the refresher course nonetheless."
"I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK, BUT READ IT WITH AN OPEN MIND."
A must read.
What an amazing dvd set.  It kept my attention throughout the entire 5 disc set...I feel inspired and at peace. I would recommend this to everyone
Taught me a simpler form of meditation
"The Law Of Attraction CD is an excellent tool for ones growth. In my opinion, It is a necessary compliment to the book because I find it beneficial in hearing the words-it seems to give the material more power.  Arthur Ford said that ""THoughts are things"", and Edgar Cayce exclaimed that ""The mind is the the builder,the physical isthe result.""  THoughts do create your existence, whether positive or negative, and this CD re-inforcesthis claim.  It is an abridged version of the book; however, the authors cover the subject thoroughly.  Abraham, the group which channels information through Esther Hicks, explains plainly and simply how one attracts both positive and negative events into their life.  The teachings are broken down into categories:  The Law Of Attraction; The Science Of Deliberate Creation; The Law Of Allowing; and Segment Intending.  I find the CD helpful in reinforcing the written version of the same title.  I highly recommend both the book and the CD."
"I like this book and have been returning to it over the years.  It's one I keep and revisit as the concepts take time to be fully grasped or integrated.  If you can put aside (if you have a problem with it), the idea that all of the information is channeled to Esther Hicks by an ""entity"" named Abraham there is much to learn.  It doesn't matter if you think that's weird or even if you think it's ""wrong"" somehow.  Put judgement aside and see what is applicable here for your life.I purchased the perpetual flip calendar too and enjoy having a soundbite of inspiration every day to improve my outlook and to remind me to reach for better feeling thoughts."
"I'm finding the concepts in this book very helpful. I find meditation difficult (mind wandering, etc.). The ideas here are used in a system where one needs to focus attention on positive ideas you come up with on your own (based on concepts from the book), and so far, this has helped me toward more positive living."
I really enjoyed reading this_ it underscores what I have believed for a long time the importance of visualizing what you want in life. It explains in detail how to go about this. We will see if it works!!!!
"I found this book to be inspirational. It teaches the benefits of positive thinking and, it helps the reader to understand that their own basic attitude dictates the happiness in their own life. But this book would also have you believe that people actually get cancer and other vicious diseases just because they thought about it; while I fully understand the benefits of positive thinking I found that part of the book to be kind of ridiculous as they suggest the blame lies on parents and children's thoughts that cause even little kids to be born with diseases . That being said I would still recommend this book as a guide to remaining positive in life, each reader needs to take from it what they feel is acceptable, and reject what they find to not make much sense."
"This book was so worth the read. It helped me manifest multiple people and events into my life that i desired, and quite quickly at that. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to increase their manifesting power."
"I have read a considerable amount of books on success and most were good while some seemed to get off the subject and put emphasis on things beyond or outside your control...this book does just that.  It talks of spirits that are at work around you and how you can link with them.  I believe that I am in control of my destiny not some spirit to which I might link with.  And, if that wasn't enough it is not one spirit but many.  You are supposed to link to these many spirits and work with them.  Well there are many attitudes (or spirits) ones can have during life.  One can give themselves to that spirit or to many spirits or one  can decide what is right for their life and head in that direction not blaming others or looking for fault but truly working on becoming a better person while focusing on attracting to themselves what they need.  We can all do this without being caught up with mystical spirits from the netherlands..."
"""The Law of Attraction: The Basics of The Teachings of Abraham"" by Esther and Jerry Hicks is a book that offers unique ideas on accomplishing plans.  The following is a small sampler of what is written:Page 41: A creative workshop techniquePage 87: A deliberate manifestation principlePage 145: Why the memories of past lives are sometimes challenging to access (for those who believe in reincarnation).The only reason why I give the ""Law of Attraction:The Basics of The Teachings of Abraham"" by Esther and Jerry Hicks four stars is due to the reason for why prejudice occurs (pages 57-58).  This is because I respectfully disagree with the idea that racial discrimination is caused solely by the law of attraction.  Additionally, it would have been good to include at least one idea on how to prevail in the face of such tests. Yes, I understand that self-confidence is essential to prevailing in the face of racial discrimination and any other forms of prejudice.  It is just that it would have been inspiring to include a story or two of how someone used the law of attraction to overcome the preconceptions of others.  Aside from this caveat, ""The Law of Attraction: The Basics of the Teachings of Abraham"" by Esther and Jerry Hicks is a fun book for those who crave ideas on channeling thoughts with personal objectives."
I was pleasantly surprised to find an audio of a recording of a workshop at the end of the book.
Realmente una lectura que debes hacer mínimo 1 vez en tu vida.Entender la “operatividad” de la vida a través de este conocimiento es un profundo paso en nuestro desarrollo personal y como especie.
"This is a Great book, it is very inspiring— makes you have hope. Would definitely recommend to friends and family!!!!!"
If you learn nothing else in life....learn this!
Good book
Refreshing eye opener.Wish I had this earlier in life.
"Excellent excellent book. Can totally change your life.  Takes time to relearn conditioned thinking that we have al grown up with, but so worth the effort.  Practice makes perfect."
"If you are interested in the Law of Attraction but know nothing about it, this is an excellent place to start.  Much of the book is written in an interview format in which Jerry Hicks interviews Abraham, giving the book the feel of watching a talk show with a skilled host.  While reading the discussion, I began to have the distinct impression that the book was written for me, personally.A well-constructed index at the end of the book makes it easy to find answers to specific questions.The first part of the book discusses in depth the concept of the Creative Workshop.  The Creative Workshop is a valuable tool for changing one's attitude toward life, since a large part of it is affirmation.  ""The Law of Attraction"" could indeed be a life changing book for someone who wants to change the direction and focus of their life."
"I am only a few pages from finishing this book, but couldn't wait till I was done to write a review! Like all of the Abraham-Hicks teachings, this one was just as miraculous! You will find yourself reading along, and all of a sudden, you will get this amazing insight. All of the insights you will receive throughout this book will change the course of your life. It has changed mine."
This was the first book I read of Esters'. It made such a big  impact in my life I have purchased it for family and friends also!
Easy to understand
Absolutely love this book it should be a law for everyone to have it and everyone should read it 📚 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
I absolutely love this boom and Abraham Hicks. I have grown so much since I started reading Esther's books
"I know not everyone is ready for this book but if you do read this book you will find the treasures of the Universe expressed in a simple, clear and exhilerating way. Exhilerating because when you put these 'laws' into practice, you realise that your life is not the result of circumstance, other people, upbringing, bad luck, good luck or any other 'out-of-yourself' reason but it is a result of you!! In this book Abraham explains it all so perfectly. Read it slowly, and if you have to savour one sentence at a time, so be it. It's worth it."
GOOD BOOK
circuitous.
"love the ""Abraham"" books - this is by far my favorite - also bought the audio version and re-read and re-listen often - very inspirational as well as educational - thank you Esther"
"great book, quick delivery"
"This compact disc focuses on the basics of the Law of Attraction.  If you believe in the Law of Attraction and you want step-by-step instructions on how to put it into practice, then this cd and the book by the same name are for you.  Even if you don't believe in the Law of Attraction, the ideas presented here might get you to think more positively about what you can create in your life and the world around you if you put your mind to it.  It's worth the investment."
A must if you are serious about changing your life for the better.
"Excellent read, a concept many people have 'outgrown' but really should try to apply!  The world could be a much better place if these principals were exercised with regularity."
This book truly explains the Law of Attraction. I will read it again and again. I am so happy that I bought it.
A gift for a friend just getting the idea of the power of thought.
"You don't need to believe what is written here, just start practicing the laws explained in this book and watch the magic appear in your everyday life."
I have read other Abraham books and listened to many of the recorded sessions. I found a lot of good info in this book and was happy to use my highlighter in the Kindle app for iPad.
"Really enjoyed this book. Like the short chapters because they get to the point quickly. Thank you Esther,Jerry n Abraham"
great read
I love Jerry & Esther Hicks; i suggest reading as much as possible but i love their audio tapes.  I listen to them all the time on youtube; and they are my favorite meditation/type to listen too; i can listen to esther for hours & hours; i just love her!!
This book gives valuable information. It gives you another perspective on how you can look at things. If nothing else motivation to always try to find your calling in life.
I recommend reading this book before any of their others. It’s a great start to LOA. When I was reading it I can just feel that what Abraham is teaching makes so much sense and comes from a place of wisdom. This is a book worth studying and referring back to.
"I have studied the Law of Attraction on and off for most of my life. This book clarifies the processes described in both Rhonda Byrne's ""The Secret"" and Shakti Gawain's classic,  ""Creative Visualization."" I read this book twice to absorb all the information inside it."
Interesting book.
"I love this book, its a great explanation of the law of attraction and intention/manifestion. Both concepts can be hard to TRULY understand, and Esther, Jerry and Abraham spell it out in plain english.I recommend reading this book FIRST, then moving on to ""Ask and it is Given"" for clarity sake.  I read ""Ask"" first and had to re-read it over and over to really grasp the concepts. I think ""The Law of Attraction"" focuses on that fully, and the ""Ask"" book focuses more on implementing the laws and exercises.I recommend both books very very highly and you really can't go wrong with either one!!"
"This old classic hums right along on a streamlined track that helps the reader identify, visualize, and pull his desires into being. Abraham explains his single-minded program plainly, and practically guarantees success. It sounds like a simple way to establish of life of comfort and prosperity.  Abraham has you constantly visualizing and planning your future, never content, and declares that, “If you are only able to see what-is [the present], then by the Law of Attraction you will create only more of what-is.” Maybe so, but he just blew off the Zen ideal of living in the moment.  Then about three-quarters through the book Abraham advises that if you feel uncomfortable when confronted with what you see as injustice and pain in the world, just recognize “that it is not part of your experience. And that, in most cases, it is truly not any of your business. It is not your work. It is the creation; it is the attraction; it is the experience of the others. Rather than trying to control the experiences of all others (which you cannot do no matter how hard you try), instead, intend to control your own participation within those experiences. And by setting forth your clear image of the life you want to live, you will prepave a smooth and pleasant path for yourself.” (p. 137)  That’s it for compassion, altruism, and the Golden Rule??  Abraham, we have a problem here …  Let’s face it – once you identify flaws like that, the rest of the premise loses its luster and falls under suspicion. I do think Abraham’s methods are sound, but cannot agree with his aims or context. I’m sure his Law of Allowance would say I am free to assist others, and he would cluck that in doing so I am thwarting my own prosperity by diverting my attention to lack and error. All right, then, I won’t be recommending this book to anyone who might not have the discernment to question its broader principles.  Abraham offers a simplified and potent teaching, but it is not a high teaching. Similar texts agree that we concentrate on our goals, invest them with emotional suction, and operate with intent. But besides accommodating our fellow man, they also include standard advice to express our gratitude as well, even gratitude in advance of the manifestation, because this participation completes the loop. Abraham doesn’t mention anything about giving thanks – a serious omission.  A sounder approach can be found in “The Nature of Personal Reality” (a Seth book by Jane Roberts) and “Conscious Life” by Alexander (channeled by Ramon Stevens), both of which discuss the subject incidentally within the greater picture. While Abraham encourages you to change your thoughts, Seth goes a step further and pushes the reader to identify and change the BELIEFS behind one’s thoughts. And for a truly spiritual perspective, try one of the books by Bartholomew (channeled by Mary-Margaret Moore), such as “Planetary Brother.” #"
"Offers some good insight on how to attract the positive and avoid negativity. This was quite a surprise, tbh; I did not expect to like it as much as I did."
This book (and others that I have read by Jerry and Esther Hicks) is a logical and sensible look at the other side and how we can learn to live our lives in a much better and positive way! I have enjoyed their information and am a much more positive person learning to think bigger and better every day!!!
"This is a great series.  The story line is very good.  There is a good amount of romance and suspense.  I started with book one and have just purchased book five.  Each book stands alone and there is enough back ground to to start in the middle, but to get the whole story start with book one."
"I love this book. Although I don't agree with everything said, I have changed a lot of my negative thinking."
I'm just sorry it had taken me so many years too discover this book.  So many things resonated with me from this book.  Never really been a fan of self help books but this didn't read like one at all but in its essence it is!  I'm paSsing this on to my daughter who is an avid reader as well.  She will be 14 and entering high school in a few months.  I think it could be off great benefit to her in the coming years.
"I originally bought this book thinking it was about something else (actually about the original Abraham) as a present for my husband's brother for his birthday.  Well, there is no doubht it (the book) was attracted to me for a purposeSince reading the book, and beginning to put into practice some of its teaching, I can testify to the fact that it is A MUST for anyone, even a sceptic, wanting to improve their thinking, their life as a whole and to enjoy prosperity.  Margot"
Skipping
This book has literally changed my life! Everyone needs to read this book!
This is a great read. It is simple to understand and simple to apply. I would recommend it to everyone.
This book is one of the best book to help you understand how the Law Of Attraction works.  Esther Hicks with  basics of the Teachings of Abraham is the best to me.  I have all her books and they have helped me a lot in my life.  I highly recommend this book to everyone.
Thanks
A must read for those assessing their life
Everything by Abraham Hicks is astounding.
good
"Love this series, teaches one how to take back their life and begin a positive life."
It's OK...but I preferred her other book...Ask as if is giving
Great book on the basics of law of attraction.
This book opened my eyes and gave me a new look and outlook on life in general.
Great book!
"I love the book, I love the message, I love what it has helped me achieve."
Use this book to learn who we are and how to be the best person we can be. Highly recommended this book...
We have read numerous books on Law of Attraction.  This reading has been the most productive and has led us to a better understanding of our potential.  We are now more prepared to move into a greater level of Life achievement as a result of this exchange.Thank you so much!
"It has opened up my eyes to a totally new way of looking at life. I have always been a positive person, but this has all the reasons why we should think positive, and be positive. Very helpful, and inspiring to a new way of life. Thank you Jerry and Esther Hicks for bring us the teachings of Abraham."
Very easy to read and understand the law of attraction
"Remember others. Let them be more important than yourself. Ask questions and don't talk about yourself or personal problems, past bad relationships etc. Avoid negativity at all cost.Number One Rules = Common Courtesy and most of all, Smile A Lot.There, now you don't have to buy the book."
I've known the law of attraction for a long time but never  found a source so detailed and specific as this book. This should  be taught in schools. Must read!!
I had borrowed this CD of this book from the library. I had to purchase it.. Cannot wait to delve into it and working through some of the exercises.
"After reading and applying the knowledge in this book,my life began to soar.The last chapter in the book is the easiest one to apply and can be used anywhere and any time during the day."
"Though, for me, the ideas expressed are not new, they are presented in a powerful  and useful way. This book can change the way you think about everything in the best ways."
"I am not sure about the theories in this book yet. So far, they are not working for me."
Loved this book. It was odd at first reading how it all started with Esther and Jerry. But I just accepted it and kept reading. This answers SO much for me! I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking information and needing answers!
"Dear Jerry and Esther.  I know you guys have an awesome life because you found each other.  To have a soul mate in the Earth Realm is an amazing and beautiful gift.  It was hard for you two to start telling people about your magical gifts because humans that have been slumbering don't like to  think there was magic right under their noses while they were missing out.  So you are gifted and brave.  Well Esther is gifted and Jerry is a hell of a writer and a great, one of the best, husbands.  You two helped me when I really needed some clarity.  Abraham does a really good job of explaining simple concepts.  Even a huge fool like myself will have the concepts sink in, and then i will suffer no more.  Hope you two are enjoying your success and good fortune and thank you for taking time to leave a legacy with humans of all types that are suffering needlessly."
"I enjoyed this so much I have since recommended it to two other dear friends.  It's pretty much common sense but information that once you hear it, and listen to it regularly, it is life changing.  Great value."
I was skeptical when someone suggested I read this book.  However in just a week of following the practices... things are really changing.  I feel happier.  I am much more positive.  I feel good and that things really are possible.
Life changing way of thinking. Help to change old ways of thinking that can manifest a new life.
Good addition to my library
Love it tons of information if put to good use
This book was extremely helpful for me in putting the pieces together about how I attract and learning how to just accept people for who they are. I feel like a better person after reading this.
More than i expected :)
A friend suggested this series to me and after the first chapter it was like everything clicked into place.  Changing my world by changing my thoughts and what I attract into it.
"Abraham has freed me up spiritually!!! I ""kinda"" knew in my soul that when we leave this world that we just reconnect with the part of ""me"" that didn't come with me.  Confusing?  Been in ACIM for 15 yrs.  Read the book.  It should do the same for you.  To know the ""source"" or ""God"" what ever name you choose, is EVERY where!!.  We are connected REGARDLESS of what you think or believe.  Religion has really done a number on us.  It is a business now...wanting only your pocket book and that is not is required for us to ""get into the pearly gates""  Nothing is required as we are spiritual being having an earthly experience, BECAUSE we wanted this.  We have lived many lives...Had De ja vu?  Nothing can be stronger as some of that memory leaks thru and YOU know that you have done this before.  What a life changing amount of info, spiritually, & bodily, Abraham has given us.  I have never experience such happiness and ""joy"" in my life, as I know that my future is what I make it.  Thanks to Esther and Jerry....Many thanks that Esther recognized what was going on in her life, and is sharing Abraham with the world."
"Loved this book. It is a great introduction into a few of the many Universal Laws and a great guide to improving your thoughts and life. I bought an extra one and gave to my niece who just graduated from college.  My husband read it on a trip - only because he lost his favorite book, The Secret.  He reluctantly agreed to read this one instead - which was a great stepping stone for him on his somewhat hesitant, yet progressing spiritual journey.  He absolutely loved it and I think it is now his new favorite book.  Highly recommend for anybody who maybe is feeling surrounded by negativity or in a 'rut' - and can't get out of it.  This is a great little life line for those willing to grab it!"
I gave this book to my Sons and Fiance.
Great book. This is must read book.
Product came on time from Amazon. This is the book to read if you believe in universal energy to help shape your life. I also have audio CD's that I meditate with almost every morning from Jerry and Esther.
Life insights you have always felt but no one else is talking about. NOT FOR ENGINEERS OR CHRISTIANS!
"You want to know about the law of attraction read this book. Keep your mind open and explore a whole new life, I enjoyed reading this book and I have started training myself (by the method describe in the book) to be a happier me. If you want to know more you would have to read the book.😊😊😊😊"
"This book further clarifies many of Abraham's basic teachings.  Law of Attraction is an important concept in almost all spiritual philosophies  and this book helps you understand it is your core vibration, HOW YOU FEEL, that brings everything (good or bad) to you.  You don't have to monitor your thoughts - just pay attention to how you feel!  I encourage everyone to read this book, if it does not speak to you it will have at least left you with good ideas and a pleasant experience.  Sounds simplistic and it is - probably why we all need so help understanding it.Any fan of Wayne Dyer, Neale Donald Walsch, Louise Hay, Deepak Chopra, Doreen Virtue, John Gray, Christine Northrup and many others will see a kindred spirit in Abraham.  I can not recommend this book enough, it not only changes your life - it teaches you how to makes life wonderful!  This is my Christmas present to everyone this year!"
Interesting
Love this book so much I read it twice. It’s a must have book. I bought it for my mother-in-law.
Good intro to her works.  Gave me a better understanding of her work and how it became to be.
"This book has put me on the right path. As the Forward says, ""this is the only personal development book one needs""."
I suggest anyone who wishes to gain deliberately control of their life read this book. It's a power House of charged affirmations that resonate with the innate intelligence that we all Have.
I have bought 2 copies of this book since I gave one away to a friend. I have gone back and re-read it. It is a life changer reading this book.I highlt recommend
"The information in this book can be a life changer.  The Law of Attraction will explains how the Universe works. Have you ever wondered why some people seem to ""get what they want"" most of the time? This informative book will explain why that happens and gives you the information in a clear and direct way, while leaving the hocus pocus abstract ""could mean a hundred things"" words out."
"It was not so much the subject of the book that had me ""worried"" after I began reading it, but the author's claim that it was written through channeling an entity by the name of Abraham. It was a bit farfetched in that regard but like other reviewers have commented (and I didn't read the reviews before I purchased the book, otherwise I would have passed on it), the book contains a lot of what I would consider wisdom so I really began thinking about the ""non-physical being"" i.e. the ""Inner Being"" as I read through the book and actually now have given serious consideration to the possibility that there may be communication from another dimension!"
"The book is written by Esther and Jerry Hicks.  It is a very interesting book, not for entretaning purposes only, but for education.  What you put in life it comes around, says the saying.  The book talks about the dialogue and conversation of these couple have with Abraham and the instructions he gives about the attraction we can have in our lifes.  The thoughts of thinking positive and being in touch with our inner being.  I have read the book in both languages, English and Spanish and it is fascinating.  I keep with me all the time to see what I can do to improve my life.  It works."
This is a concept everyone should learn to have a happy and fulfilling life! Buy it now and begin to live as you desire.
"This is a great book! It opened my eyes to various things/situations in my life that I had the ability to change, but didn't have the heart to.  I now understand that I am responsible for my own happiness and life. I can create the life I want to live, by simply focusing on all the things my heart's desire."
"Fast delivery, perfect condition.  This is a very educational short book."
Excellent book!
The most repetitive book I’ve ever read in my entire life.
This book changed my life. As every book I read. But I feel as tho all of the self help that I have been seeking has come to pass. This book has turned me into a creator. I have already begun manifesting the reality I desire for myself
Love it....
Def a great read. Stop debating and buy it now. I def recommend this book. It will change your whole outlook on life
"We long for sage advice from ""the other side.""  We feel disconnected, sometimes lost.  As if we are somehow out-of-touch with the energy of Spirit.  Abraham, via Esther and  (in this case) Jerry Hicks, reminds us we are not so disconnected as we believe."
Not at all what I expected. I was not prepared for so many supernatural occurrences.
Great read!
Lots of insight into how we achieve our own realities. Been practicing it for the last month and I am noticing differences
I found the book opening my mind to possibility that I had not considered before. Thank you for expanding my mind to new potential.
"He text shows someone how to create the life that they desire by watching your thoughts,actions and reactions to life's experiences. Not too heavy with philosophical perspectives but just good common sence."
LOVE it. I'm not one for spirituality but holy crap does it have some important points that EVERYONE needs to meditate on
"This is the only book you'll ever need to understand the Law of Attraction and how to utilize it for your own good. You don't read this book once or twice. It is a reference guide to be read over again and again. You'll find yourself going to certain chapters for information and encouragement. The book is never far away from you!I just love Abraham, Esther and Jerry!!"
There are some very simple laws that govern how lkfe unfolds for us here on Planet Earth. In very easy language The Abraham Teaching shares this wisdom and how to acheive it. A must read for those just newly exploring New Paradigm thinking.
I will definitely read the other books in this series! I found it to be an easy read and very interesting.
Delivered promptly. The content of the book is insightful and helps you gain a new perspective on attracting your desires
"Each and every product has brought so much positive into my life there is no measure of how grateful I am for finding them. Life is good and when you have a challenge (or two) their books, tapes, and cards, will set you right back on track.  Have gifted many of Jerry and Esther books/tapes to others."
"I love Esther Hicks and all the ""Abraham"" material.  It was good to go back to the foundational Law of Attraction series."
"The CDs were recorded in a quite formal lecturing/workshop atmosphere. The listener will find many inspiration statements between Abraham and Mr. Hicks questions and answers in the CDs covering some of the very question of life and existence. I put all the CDs in my car and listening to them most of the time when I am travelling alone and I will recommend to anyone who have not get themselves familiar with The Law of Attraction to do the same. I believe these CDs will assist you to become familiar with the Law, and subsequently they will become your subconscious act and will activate automatically in what ever you want to experience in this life time."
The book is so interesting and well written.
One of my favorites
"If one is ready for this direction, it is most amazing.  I learned about Abraham-hIcks a few years ago, but I was not ready until as few months ago.  Now it is my main go-to approach to life."
"No mentions about sport, grades and variety of topics on how to use it practically! U will enjoy it. Good book though"
This book is absolutely right about almost everything. I have been living to this book for years and it is a great help. Maybe the best printed book you can get on the subject of getting success in your life in the history of humankind.
This book single-handedly changed my life and I would recommend it to anyone looking to really learn how to pay attention to their thoughts and understand the power they have.
"I recommend this book to anyone who is ready for a life of joy, adventure and pure bliss in this life...for a better life"
All the Abraham teachings are so simple and so logical.  It is nice to have them in writing in addition to being able to watch so many things by them on Youtube.  I recommend both to everyone.
"This book explains how this life works and why my life is the way it is, both the things I love about it and the things I would like to change...and how to change it. I'm already seeing results as I put the Law of Attraction into deliberate action. I highly recommend this book."
So true.
"Quite possibly the best book ever done on the subject matter. The fact that it was done by channel renders it all the moreoutstanding. Simple, concise and clear enough to be entitled spirituality for dummies. Taken to heart and into practicethe principals imparted here are life changing. Highly recommend."
Learning about the basic laws of the universe definitely helps with everyday life.
Fantastic book...it will truly change the way you view the world.  I had to read this book for a yoga teacher training program and found it to be a truly eye-opening book.
This book has helped me to focus more on the positive aspects of life in general and to give priority to what I really want. The more I read the more involved on the law of attraction
"I am a mental health counselor, university professor, and life-long student. I have experienced many of these phenomenon before (thinking about something and it actually happening). This book teaches us how to do it and at the same time explains why we experience the things we do. Positive attitude, self-fulfilling prophecy, call it what you want...it works. Great book. :>) Sonja"
Love the book. I think it is the best book on this subject out there. Whatever I can't understand is easy to reinforce with their youtube videos.
Unfortunately you did not upload the book and so I did not have a chance to read it I'm going to reorder it today
very interesting.
"This is a great book!  Definately will read it many times over.  Decided to read this book after reading the secret, definately goes more in depth of what the law of attraction really is and how to apply it to your life.  Has definately changed my life already, and so excited about no longer living my life ""by default""!!"
Hard to get through at first but makes sense when you keep going
Since I’ve purchased this book it’s change my life to the next level
Love this book.
Great read
"A wonderful book, delivered quickly to my device, provides a wonderful introduction to the law of attraction.  I love the humanness of this book, imparting solid spiritual wisdom woven together with the people, Esther and Jerry, who deliver it."
"However, it is easier to say what you would like for your life and let God provide it.  This book focuses you on future events, your desires for your life, so to speak.  It makes you plan ahead.  Rather, why not let our creator arrange our life.  He does a perfect job.  The essence of the book is to relinquish control over others and your outside experiences.  Good idea in many ways.  Focusing on the good you want in your life is what we should all try, right?  Positive begets positive and negative brings more negative. I don't want to work this hard when God wants us to just ask him for help.  Makes more sense and less work of rearranging yourself so completely."
"I bought this audio cd because I kept hearing how I should learn about the law of attraction. I'm not giving this a low rating because of the message it delivers but for more in the way it was delivered. It seemed like I was being yelled at and we are all stupid people for not knowing and learning these for rules. Abraham sounds very angry at times seems annoyed at the questions he is given. I didn't finish listening to it because of the way it was delivered,  maybe if I buy this in print I will like it much better."
"I'm really enjoying reading this book. I'm not sure if it is tongue in cheek, but so what if it is?  The premise is well done and so far I agree with it! If nothing else it will lift the Eeyores up out of their gloom!"
"A brilliant introduction to the Law of Attraction.  Perfect for anyone who has ""heard"" about the Law of Attraction and wants to know what it is all about."
This guide contains the Laws of the Universe streamed from ABRAHAM to Ester and Jerry Hicks. Theirs is a unique adventure to help mankind understand what is going on. Your life will be changed.
- I would recommend this book to anyone who is ready for more out of their life. All things law of attraction and more.
I had already read the book and wanted to be able to listen to it again..and again...while driving.  I knew what I was getting and am pleased to have the same iformation in book form and in CD form.  It is helpful to me for absorbing the information.
"This talks about manifestation, beliefs and how they influence us.  What we think does create our experiences.  It is very convincing."
Arrived in great condition and there was nothing wrong with any of the CDs Thanks for the savings!
This was a wonderful why and how to book to create a deliberately happy life.Thank you Abraham ans Esther.
"I like the cd's, or I should say I like when Abraham speaks, I'm not big on Jerry Hicks selling the cd's or talking about his own experiences and what he thought when he was younger.  My feeling is we are not buying the the cd's to listen to him talk about himself, we paid to hear Abraham communicating the rules of the univese to us."
"One of the best books out there. Thank you Esther, Jerry, and Abraham!!!"
"I am not only absolutely convinced that the law of attraction is ""how it is"", but I feel great love for the energy of Abraham."
Very interesting read. Goes in depth I would recommend this book or advise those who wants to know law of attraction to this book
"All you need to know to get happy, and tools to return to it when you slipp from time to time!"
"Great Book. I liked it best of the similar ones I bought. Reading it helps me catch myself thinking about what I don't want, instead of what I do want. That helps me stop creating more of what I don't want. I like the structure of the material."
"Just heard about ""Abraham"" Very interesting"
The basis of the Law of Attraction is to watch your thoughts.  Thoughts shape our world and well-being.
"I really enjoyed this audio book and it came fast, although the CD case was broken and it had a scratch other than that very very happy"
"I know other people who find the ideas presented in this book as old ideas for them, which they have been practicing already, but for me it is one of my most prized reads.  I found the way Abraham phrased and explained to be just what I've been looking for all these years.  You should definitely see the movie ""The Secret"" by rhonda byrne as well (even though they cut Esther Hicks out of the movie.. she was awesome and the movie isn't as good and complete as the original with Esther!)."
Simply excellent introduction to these laws of attraction. Great way to educate any person on subject matter
It contains great information for those who are open minded.
Law of Attraction is the best thing to ever happen to me. It will change your life and bring everything you desire.
Love this book more than any other LOA literature I have consumed
"I am reading this now for the third time.  Such simple, but profound, information in this book.  Highly recommended"
I've listened to the CDs and was a bit perplexed but this book helped me align with the foundations of Abraham's lessons.  Recommended for the seeker of truth.
Quick and easy!
Everyone needs this book to stay positive and keep yourself having a great life.
Great book!
Powerful.  I am truly enlightened.
"Abraham has a clear, direct message that works.  Simple and easy to understand.  The tools can be effective in bringing about a feeling of inner prosperity, no matter what the outer looks like.  The inner reflects the outer and that is where we need to begin."
"The book was in better than expected condition, and arrived sooner than scheduled."
Very good book for anybody who wants top have everything they want in life.  I'm looking forward to consciously creating my own life.
Good book. I liked it. Arrived in good time and good shape.
Great book...
"This has become on of my favorite cds to listen to in order to help raise my vibration and alignment.  It's clear, informative, and obviously completed connected.  I recommend it to absolutely anyone who's even gone as far as to read this review."
"I purchased this last week and have finished listening to it. If you are like me and have tons of their DVDs, CDs, & Books you will be more than satisfied with the material in these 5 cds.  There is lots of information I heard that surprised me and expanded on info I already knew. Processes that I found helpful for goal focusing. No matter where you are in the learning process these cds will be of benefit and the more you listen over and over it will only get better. The irony is that I purchased their books ""A new Beginning"" Vol I and Vol II.  Volume I with in the first 2 chapters contained some of the same info the cds had. I highly recommend this CD set. My only issue was that I like to burn my audios into my laptop so I can put them on my phone and listen to them everywhere, I was only able to burn CDs 1,2, & 3... (4 and 5 couldn't be burned, not sure why). I will ck back for comments if anyone has more pointed questions."
"I read this book and it changed the way I think, love , live and let live. I have achieved joy, stability in eve r aspect of my life so much that many people in my circle have commented on it. .I have given this book as gifts to four people.it is the best gift I could give the people I love an then some, I recommend it ."
A book I go back to many times to remind me to live in the flow of life.
I'm only on chapter 3 but love this book.
love it
"I've found this book helpful in my study of the law of attraction.  Thorough, easy to read.  Redundant and wordy at times but it actually helps to reinforce key points."
One of the best books ever written. Really makes you look at things in a different way for your success.
"I enjoyed the book. It is convincing, but there was far too much repetition for my tastes. It is a good foundation."
"This book has changed my life.I practice the principles every day, and have seen a dramatic shift in my life.I am so grateful that I was turned onto this book by someone I greatly respect."
Esther Hicks is an easy way to get into the Metaphysical world thinking. Good book to introduce yourself to this world.
"I have been following the teachings of Abraham online, but this book opened me further. While the premise may leave you skeptical, you'll quickly find the logic in it as you apply it to your past experiences and your future. Truly changed me for good."
"I would recommend it to everybodyIt is just extremely powerful.Thank you so much""Money and the Law of Attraction""I gave it as a present to a friend.He will let me read it laterAm still reading ""The Astonishing Power of Emotions"",which is totally amazing,and which I have suggested to a few friends already, some in FranceThank you again.Daniele Romer"
"If you want to understand what the Law of attraction is and how it works this is it. I love the simple exercises and also the view point of Abraham. What can I say, I am a huge fan! This book gave me relief and I know the LOA works really well. I really recommend this book."
"This is now a classic in the genre.  If you follow the instructions you start looking at things in a new way, a more productive way"
This book is perfect
Trying to live by their teachings
"This book provides guidance on how to think about things that you want in your life and stop thinking about things that you do not want in your life by redirecting those negative thoughts back to the positive thoughts of what you want.  I agree with this concept and plan to follow this in my own life from here on.What I do not agree with in the book is that it basically says that all of the bad things that have happened to us, we caused ourselves, by thinking about those things.  This does not make any sense in most cases.  For example:  The noisy neighbor across the street that wakes me up every morning at 6:00AM with a blast from the muffler of her old car.  Before this started happening, I was not thinking about a noisy neighbor with a loud car and then poof, the rude girl appeared and started waking me up from a deep sleep every morning with this noise!  I'm sorry but there needs to be some clarification on this kind of situation."
"Even if you don't understand the law of attraction, there are a lot of valuable messages in this book."
Arrived quickly and in excellent condition. The book itself is a little weird. Not what I was expecting. But the price is good and it's not a terrible read.
Thank you!
I just loved this book and plan to read it again.  It is full of wise insight and gives me a wonderful way to use the Law of Attraction in my life.
Great book!!
A must read! Everything in this book is true life and I believe that we reap what we sow. This books gives you a lot to think about. Its deep and real. Do you have the open mind to read it?
"Boy has the book and DVD of ""The Secret"" gotten terrible press! This is the book that The Secret was based on (actually stolen from, I believe). This is a reasonable book among these sorts of new-agey self help books and practicing the positive expectations it teaches about can only do good. Read this one and not ""The Secret."""
Love it. I needed these words. Almost finished with half of the book.
Love this read!
great book on cd
I understand now the exact definition of the law of attraction and the universal laws.It reinforced a theory that I developed for myself more than 30 years ago about the significance of everything.
Absolutely the best explanation I've read for how the Universe works -- if you care to believe it :-)
Arrived very quickly! Good read. My boyfriend suggested this book to me to help me motivate and inspire me while I was going through tough times. Love the book.
This book is amazing at sharing ideas I have never heard before and making those challenging parts of life that much easier
Great book
I wish I read this book 10 years ago
Very good
Came as expected and quality beat expectations. I'd purchase from them again.
Item received as described and expeditiously. Highly recommended!
loved this book.  I found it was a good simple question and answer book for me.  It helped to really get done the most important basic Abraham teachings.
"I bought this book used and was surprised at what great condition it was in when it arrived.  It literally looks brand new with no marks or folds of any kind.  The price was great - very inexpensive and the shipping was immediate -- received the book two days after I ordered it.  I'll definitely buy from this seller again.As for the book itself there's no need to go into detail.  It's a classic that's helped millions around the world.  Easy to read, understand and apply to real life situations. It's the type of book that takes quite a bit of time to read and digest and something that I will refer back to many times across the years."
Great read for beginners to Law of Attraction
This book and the information in it has changed the way I think. It has improved my outlook and my life.
"Actually I purchased this book for a friend - I have had a copy for about 3 years and it is an amazing book (and one that I have next to me at work and never lend to anyone for fear of losing it, and re-read at regular intervals!!) - I bless the day it was given to me, which was totally by accident - it really is an amazing book - which is why I purchased it for a good friend."
Great
Love it
"The words of Abraham are brilliant and incredible.  We need to find our vibrational patterns, and this book can do nothing but help anyone seeking to improve their life."
"If you want to take charge of your life, this is a great book to read. An easy to read and understand, no-nonsense explanation. I loved it and would recommend it to anyone seeking improvement in their lives."
Hmmmmm is all I have to say
love this lady and all her books!
A stepping stone.
help me understand things already in my life!
This book has truly opened my eyes to the vast possibilities of creation. I will be going forth in my journey to create a new life. I do. Recommended this book to whom ever is open.
Love my book
"This book changed how I see the world.  I was going to retire early due to job stress affecting my health.  I read this book which tells you how to apply the ideas of ""The Secret"" or affectuating positive change in your life.  It is so simple.  I'm a much happier person because of this book."
I liked this book because it gave me practical advise and steps of bow to create good situations in my life
"Don't kill the messenger, just receive the messages and remember. The messages within will help you be a better human while your here!"
good reads!
I wanted to have this book to help me remember to always think in positive ways. And to keep the thought that anything is possible if you hold the intention.
"Excellent book, everybody should have this book as reference!"
"Really good book and self explanatory , with many answered questions we all have or had at some point in time in our lives ."
Hell yes
love it
"As soon as this product arrived, I tore open the wrapper, popped it in the CD player and have been listening to the 5 CD's for the past several weeks.I totally connect with what Abraham is saying and the more I listen the more I hear things that I didn't understand or finally received the ""aaha""moment.Some people will find Esther channeling Abraham a little strange if they do not understand or believe that there is another realm besides the physical one that we are currently in with the human body.I tell people that are listening to it for the first time to have and open mind and connect with the message, not the process of how the message is sent.I can think back in my life and reflect on what I did and did not attract to myself. I realize it is hard for most people to take responsibility for all that has been good and not so good in their lives.I have already started to see a shift in myself, my work and how I ""choose"" to focus my thoughts on positive, uplifting and foward thinking ideas, wants and goals. I can and will have a great day, everyday.I believe that God gave everyone ""free will"" and allowing us to set our course for the results in our life.Abraham confirms this in The Law of Attraction."
Thank you for teaching me how to use the powerful laws of the universe. Im ever thankful for your explanation about the subject
"I have learned so much from each reading or listening I do of this work! This is one book that I will always keep nearby because I learn something new with every reading.Best,TMS"
"Amazing! I've always knew that there was more to The Power of Thought than what I had already been taught. Abraham-Hicks has an extraordinary way of relaying this information in this book. I recommend it for those who are having a hard time coping with General Life. You won't be disappointed. For some, they are able to grasp the info instantly & for others, it may take two to three readings of the entire book. I'm on my 2nd read because by the time I reached the end of this book, I had a DNA Explosion on what I had just learned & I'm yearning for that feeling of awareness again!  ****A MUST BUY****"
Saved money and got a great book
"Book helped me. Not sure if I believe every single aspect of the book, but still a good read"
I believe it to be true!
Like it and still working with it.
"The Law of Attraction is well written, informative and very interesting. It is a must read if you have any concerns about the present state of our country and the world."
"I bought this as a gift, they loved it and recommended it!"
happy with item
Love this book. I have had to get my own copy as I keep lending it out to others.
"I truly enjoyed this book because it embodied all of my cure t beliefs.  There were things that I felt as a spiritually connected person, that I couldn't put into words and this book was able to explain it clearly.  I would recommend this book for positive people looking for more clarity and for negative thinkers in need of a better way of doing things."
"Absolutely mind blowing, life changing!!!"
"This book is a wonderful read,I believe in magic again, I believe in my fellow human beings again too.If we could all practice what is in this book we would be so much happier."
I bought this book as a gift for a friend.I believe in the message but have not read the book myself.
Great condition
Esther Hicks is a powerful channel of positive energy.
This book is a book that is hard to put down after you start reading it. And i am not a big reader. But i love this book. It has given me alot of clairity to my life. And i recommend this book to anybody who is searching for answers about themselves and just life in general. Thx Amazon your the best.
Gift. Friend liked it
I really enjoyed reading this book. It was very motivational! I'm glad that I purchased it! This was definitely a great find!
"Law of Attraction teaches you valuable tools in over coming the pitfalls we all experience with negativity, which inhibits our ability to attrack that which we really want. It is clearly written and contains wonderful exercises and affirmations. This book has helped me to shift my attitude in a more positive direction."
gave to son as a gift.
simply awesome book to understand all there is about the law of attraction!thank you Esther.
Awesome book!
I love Easter Hicks and her important work of helping people live better lives. She is amazing! I just love listening to her!!
Easily read and understandable. Love the story and guides as described by the book. Highly recommend to all who are looking for guidance
"Have now read this book four times and will read again, opened my eyes to some things I had not thought about before."
"Ordered for a gift. This is the third one we've had. Excellent birthday, and or holiday gift. Stocking stuffer. :-)"
"I had already read the book an it was great.  I purchased this CD for  a friend of mine plus I purchased a 3 CD set of the LOA for another friend.The book was easy to read, and covered excellent concepts which I had already seen manifesting in my life.  The book clarified what was happening an why, and how I could manage my thoughts in the future to accomplish the goals that are important to me.The most interesting concept I got from it, is not to think any negative thoughts, as all thought sends out vibrations to the universe - but the universe does not decipher if you want what you are thinking of or if your thinking of something you don't want!  This is how we can end up getting what we don't want.  An the more emotion you attach to any thought, the quicker whatever you are thinking of will come to you. The more belief and emotion you put into the thought, the quicker it will become reality.  Like the old saying about having faith, it comes quicker when u have faith it will happen.One of the best books I have read in decades and the most clear and concise on the topic.  Other books cover the same idea but this book covers it best, in a interesting, non time wasting manner.Highly recommend this book to everyone who wants to improve their life."
The whole concept at first it is something weird because it contradicts with our commonly held beliefs. I found reading this book really interesting since it teaches you Sth different.
A great book! Well explained! Worth reading!
"Any information from this Source, will always be remarkable.  They are dependably correct and insightful.Whatever they suggest always turns out to be right for me."
"I returned this book after reading that the author ""Channels"" a dead spirit.  Not to be disrespectful but I do not believe in a human's ability to speak for the dead.  Also after reading what the Channeled spirit tells this woman was totally against my personal belief system. This goes against my beliefs and I could not in good faith read it. I do believe in the power of positive thought and the law of attraction."
Read the whole book...take your time....no rush and check out the easy meditation workshop on page 42 to help set up your day!!
Interesting !!!!!!!!
"An enjoyable book, channeled thru spirit  entities called Abraham.  It gives a stepwise approach to achieving your goalsRecommend it to anyone interested not only in self advancement but also to live in a peaceful manner"
"Great book especially if you follow Jerry & Esther Hicks ""Abraham"" books."
I love the perspective and it has given me a chance for great growth in my life.
Loved it! Definitely worth it
Great
"""You cannot have negative emotion about yourself and be in the state of ALLOWING yourself ... And we will tell you, friends, ALLOWING is the most glorious state of Being you will ever achieve on a long, ongoing basis. For once you are an ALLOWER, you are spiraling upward and upward, for there is no negative emotion to balance you out and bring you down.""What a great gift this book is. The basics of the teachings of the acknowledged greatest teachers on the planet. I bought three of these books myself! After all, gift-giving time is coming .... If one is looking for a teacher, why not go straight to the Source?"
It's a great book!
"I think that everyone can get something valuable out of this book. I think there is a lot going on and I personally felt overwhelmed at times because there is so much to take in and retain, but I believe in it and want to be more deliberate. It will take practice and mindfulness, but it is attainable if you want it to be. It is definitely a book to revisit from time to time."
Easy to follow and much to think about.
"Simple, easy to follow directions to take charge of and live a joyful life!"
"I LIKE THIS, GOOD READING"
"This book says it all, read it and you will find out all the answers to life.  It's changed my life and I'm really grateful that I've found this work."
Great
Excellent
"Some may have a problem with the new age sounding of dialogue in here but the fundamentals are rock solid and timeless. If you are struggling with life or your perspective on life this is a invaluable guide to how this world works. Simple in theory but the physical world would scream at you that it's backward. Read it and change your life, you will see it work. It really is about you! and you can change your world!"
Love this book. I have read it multiple times and bought this one as a gift for a friend.
Great Read!
All of her books are excellent.  It's for people who want growth in their lives.
"If you really want to get into the law of attraction, this book can give you what you need. If the thought of channeling bothers you, I'd advise ignoring it, and read the message given. The framework for starting on a better life experience is here."
"A great book and let's you know that like attracts like, and it is me who brings about all that is going on in my life, world, and affairs."
"This is a very good book whom anyone could benefit from. Although it may be metaphysically oriented, the concept is explained in a way that everyone should be able to understand. It is a plain common sense philosophy that can help make life more enjoyable and prosperous for many who follow the ""Law of Attraction"""
"Okay so I just began getting into yoga and this book is a fantastic compliment to my new hobby.It allowed me to really get into the idea that we are the creators of our future and it is the energy that we create and surround ourselves with that impact our thoughts and feelings.One world, one life, one body!I love all this stuff."
More spiritually based than I expected.  Slightly difficult read.
The Law of Attraction is an excellent book to introduce a person to the most important law governing the universe.  I highly recommend this to any person seeking answers about lifes most important questions.
It's OK but one has to get through the spooky demon that Esther is talking for.  Still good information
"I love this book. When one gets into it, they will look deeper into their relationships with other people and see if they fit together or not. I would recommend this book to anyone who is confused with their friends or even family."
It's rather strange how the book talked to me. Sometimes it just makes things that are happening in the world seem more understandable. It gives knowledge on how to steer clear of the negative's or evil things in this life.
A great read and a perfect way to live your life.  Every page has nuggets of wisdom.  I'm reading again!
Everyone should read this book. It's helpful and important to know how you can attract the things you want in life.
"I loved this book. I was a positive thinker before this book, or so I thought! I realized the things I was saying because it was reality, is not what I should be saying or thinking. Just focus on what you want!"
You get what you want whether you want it or not.
Changed my life!!
I listened to all of these and some twice.  I learned a lot.  I takes some time to get used to Abraham speaking through Ester.
Fantastic book!! Have been able to get out of a long funk by using the creative workshop. Doesn't disappoint.
it works....for real
I consider this a MUST read piece of literature.  I wish I had read this book sooner.  It illuminated my spirit within and has given me the much needed boost of encouragement that I so dearly needed right now.  I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a way through dilemmas.  It opens ones eyes to a fresh view of the world.  Anything is possible and you can make it so!!!
I love this book. It has changed my life for the positive!
Love the Book!
"I have read all of Ester and Jerry Hick's books, yet this one defines clarity in so many ways! I encourage you to pick this book up as it WILL definitely provide an uplifting and positive perspective on life and the REASONS you get what you get in and out of life!Keep thinking positive! Allow yourself to focus on what you are wanting..."
Great positive book! Fast shipping
"Product on time and a great product. Would shop with user again, highly recommend for someone looking for great service."
life changing
I have learned so much from this book. This is a must read.
This is the first of many books by these authors.  It is amazing how simple the plan is yet difficult at the same time.  Has changed the way I think and makes sense as I have seen it happen in small ways.  Highly revommend.
Very interesting CD's. The voice is a little distractingbut the information is of great value. It's fascinating to be introduced to Abraham.
"This book changed my life. I put the practices to use in my daily life & have seen the results. A very easy read. No matter where you are in your spiritual development, you will have no problem comprehending the subject matter discussed. I have bought this for friends looking to expand their awareness & view life from a different perspective."
great product thank you
"Much like the other books, but it is all good stuff."
Awesome read it's hard for me to put this book down
"This is a fantastic book for anyone who is looking to enhance their life. I love it and I hope you will, too!"
I really enjoyed this book. It has been very enlightening and thought provoking. I'm have been using some of the practices for years now and I'm looking forward to adopting more as I move forward with clarity and purpose.
No problems
"Amazing, must read!"
Great book......
best reference book on law of attraction.
Arrived as described and on time! Thanks!
5 star rating.I really liked the simplicity of the principles written about.Recommend this book to anyone interested in making themselves a better person.
A well thought out logical approach to the law of attraction. A must read!
Wonderful!!!!
Everything was great!!
I love this workbook! Has changed my life.
Common sense.  You are what you think.  Makes you pay close attention to what you are thinking.  Worthwhile. Highly recommend.
"I would recommend this book to anyone interest in the law of attraction. It is easy to understand. This book is life changing,"
Good read. Definitely makes you think in a more positive manner.
"This also includes a CD, which I play in my car on road trips"
This book changed my LIFE! I already studied the universal laws for a couple of years but nothing I've ever experienced regarding universal law has been more clear and precise as this book.
"This book may be a little bit way out for some people as it refers to the supernatural.  However, if you take only what you need for the book and be tolerant of the rest this book is useful on learning how to cultivation a more positive mindset with emphasis on gratitude."
"Started this book yesterday and am in LOVE with the self healing techniques!  I practiced a few last night and my pain levels are already so much better!!! It's also very easy to follow, I'm really excited!!!"
This book is fantastic for the witch who wants to learn more about her craft but doesn't know where to start. Each subject is broken down into easy to absorb bits of wisdom without being overwhelming. A great jumping off place to decide where to dive in deep next.
"I appreciate the sequence in Practical Magic for Beginners.  It all starts with energy and Maggie easily explains the source of our energy and how to clear blockages so that your magic can be more effective.  She then leads you into a journey of divination.  Here are the tools to help you understand yourself and what is happening in the  world around you. Next, Maggie starts you on the path of meeting your guides and creating your first tools.  Finally, she gives you a starting point for creating your own magical spells.  Practical Magic for Beginners is easy to read, easy to use and a great book to have in a beginner or advanced magical library.  Thank you for blessing us with your creation, Maggie."
"By Far Favorite Book I Own Right Now. It’s Such A Great Reference Book. The Other Books Give You This Extensive Long Winded History Lessons & Blah Blah Blah. Their Formats Are Terrible. I Zipped Through This Thing. Comes In So Useful For Anything That Could Possible Pop Up On Your Mind. It Does Provide Backstories To Things But It’s Not An Overload Of Information, You Find Interesting But Really Are Not Trying To Study. So Happy I Picked This Book Over Some Of The Others I Was Comparing It To. This Entire Book Is Straight To The Point. Gives Examples. Love It.Furthermore Upon Continuing To Read Through.... Under Crystals, Scorpio Isn’t Listed. That’s My Birthstone As A Scorpio So I’m Curious About This. I’m So Confused Lol. Anyway The Pages Can Handle A Highlighter Which Is Nice"
I bought this book and absolutely love reading it. It’s well written for a beginner and gives helpful ideas of ways to start incorporating magic into your life. Maggie you did a beautiful job! I Am excited to continue to learn more and see your next book!
This book is absolutely incredible! I can’t even put into words how much I’ve learned from this book and without being pushed into one way of doing things or another. It’s truly an invaluable learning resource and it’ll be in my library forever!
Beautifully written. It's easy to understand and gives a lot of good information. Love all of the pictures and art as well.
Love this book!! So comprehensive!!

   i got this book as a beginner/baby witch. i had started researching last year, but i knew that a lot of the stuff on the internet was wrong, especially when cross checking stuff. so, i got this book. i didn’t realize how AMAZING this book would be, especially for someone who was wary of what was on the internet.it first starts you off learning about auras and chakras, which i definitely needed a refresher on. it then dives deeper into crystals, divination (has a huge tarot AND palmistry section!) which i definitely appreciated!this book is definitely easy to read for younger witches wanting to get into the craft or anyone who is super busy. do remember though, it’s is definitely for beginners, and not for the more experienced. it’s a basic learning book!"
"For new witches that don't know anything at all, this book is great... But if you have a basic knowledge of witchcraft, this book is kind of useless. I would call myself an intermediate witch. I know all the basics but I wanted to learn more and this book didn't really teach me much more. It's still a great book to have on the shelf and to have for reference so it wasn't a total waste, but unless you're completely new to the craft I wouldn't completely recommend this. There's also a lot of things that they didn't really cover that I wish they would have or if they did cover it, it was very vague and I wish that they went into more detail.Overall, it just gave me the sense that the person who wrote the book doesn't really know anything about the craft at all and just found the basics of everything online and put it together in a book. It's not a bad book but it could have been better."
I have purchased many many books and read many I also use audiobooks on this subject and all subjects around it and this book is so simple to understand and easy to read and learn I’m not a beginner in the practice yet i enjoyed it very much I also never write reviews but I was compelled to write one now. One thing I always wanted to learn more about was chakras I obviously knew some but this book really breaks it down to start the journey and get into actually practicing and moving forward.
This book has a little bit of everything. I think it’s a great staff to a magical life and has some great information.I would have given it 5 stars if I could see the charts on the e-book a bit better.I took my time reading it and spent a couple days going through each section to make sure everything sunk in and I thought it was great and totally relatable. I absolutely enjoyed the book and would be happy to purchase the physical book for future reference.I would most definitely recommend to any baby witch and anyone interested about learning a few things about the magical life.
I love this book! I really appreciate that it’s not dogmatic and is strictly informational. Every subject is brief but loaded with enough information to get you started. I have been trying to learn tarot for about a year now and I wish I had found this book sooner because I learned more about tarot and how to read it intuitively in this little book than all other sources I’ve found combined. I can’t recommend it enough to beginner practitioners.
It' s a helpful book for learning the basics. You can then go into each topic more in depth on your own. helps you to identify where your interests may lie based on hos you respond to each section.  Would recommend for a newbie
"Well written, easy to use guide that introduces new practitioners to many different topics. I didn't agree with all of her views and I didn't find all of the topics to be my cup of tea, but that's okay. They were explained well, and I felt like I got a good enough understanding of them to make that decision definitively. Absolutely would recommend as a good intro book."
This is a really nice quality book. It is jam packed full of information. I’ve only flipped through it but I am so excited to dive in more.
This book is really great. I'm a beginner so this was a great introduction to all things magic. I would definitely recommend to any novice or someone that wants a nice reference book.
Maggie made everything so easy to understand and the book is so beautiful!! 10/10 would recommend again!
it was a lovely book with lots of basic information. this is definitely for beginners and it does give good background. definitely something that helps explains things more when it comes to divination.
Good and well-organized beginner book. Gives info on lots of topics that new witches will need to know.
This was for my daughter and she loves it. I have even enjoyed reading it.
Great book. Perfect condition. Came quick.
Honestly the delivery driver made my night. He was so sweet and delivered the package earlier than expected. Anyways the book is amazing. Very easy to understand and great for beginners
Amazing introduction to magic. Use it all the time as a starter into a new hobby. Easy to read and hard to put down. I use it all the time as a reference
This book was amazing!! Completely hooked after 2 pages in and finished it in less than 24 hours! Worth it. Soo much information inside
"I have read so many books on ritual,  spell casting, divination and so much more and I feel that I took so much more away from this book than all of the others combined. Cannot recommend this book enough!! Read it!!! You'll be so happy you did"
Can't wait to start reading and doing spells. Being out of the craft for years. Then coming back in. I hope this book can refresh my mind so I can get back to where I was before
"this book is quite useful for people who want to get into witchcraft. it’s very informative, teaches you basics, etc. it also has lots of color and interesting info which helps the reader be interested. def recommended"
Loved the book great refresher for me I will highly recommend to all baby witches and great price just great
This was a very well organized and easy to understand introduction to practical magic.  Would recommend to anyone who wants to better understand the applicability of magic to everyday life and living.
"This book was recommended to me by a friend, and I'm so glad I got it! It has an information on so many things, a good intro to many different topics."
Looks good not read it yet!
"Fast service. Not a bad book, had some useful ideas. Will have to re read to get more detail"
"I love this book! It's packed full of fun things to do. It's easy to understand. It has very quickly become a favorite of mine. As an added bonus, the paper is beautiful, and artistically presented."
Very informative book. I found a lot of information I hadn't really seen elsewhere.
This is perfect and it explains everything amazingly especially recommended for beginners
I have just started to read it and I already have so much more information than what I can learn on the internet this book is very informative and it will be of great help on my spiritual journey.
Same as the other books
"Nicely worded. Academic, yet, interesting."
Really easy to understand and covers all the bases of the craft. Perfect for beginners.
"It had a lot of information and very interesting, good details and i love the feel of the cover, recommend it."
"I am a beginner at witchcraft and this book was so engaging and so much fun to read. The author did an amazing job,  I am very happy I read this book. You should for sure buy this if you are a beginner and wanted to know the basics of everything."
A perfect introduction to many forms of magic. Absolutely essential to have.
"Perfect for beginners, and easy read. Really enjoyed this."
Awesome to gift for my magic lover for christmas!
"Maggie does a beautiful job making magic easy to learn and accessible to anyone.  If you’re interested in anything in the mystic realm, definitely start here! This book truly has something for everyone."
this is a great start to learning witchcraft
my niece loves it
Great book & very informative and easy to understand. I read it all in 3 days.
Haven't read my cooy yet. Friend I bought a cooy for said it was an ok read.
So much valuable information!!! Easy to understand and fun to read. I love how simply complex and ancient ideas are laid out. Thanks Maggie for such an amazing resource.
Easy to understand and very readable for me who’s always distracted with everything else lol. I enjoyed this book and I’m about to make the money jar inside. Blessed be everyone.
Love the breakdown in the book and how easily things are explained
Great book. Very multi informative. I very much look forward to putting into much use.
It’s a great book with some really good info my only complaint is that the pages randomly fall out half my book fell out while I was reading it. I’d buy it over again for the literature any day tho.
Great book for beginners
I’ve been into Tarot for quite a few years and have been wanting to branch out into more. This book is exactly what I was looking for and helped me feel exactly what I am most connected towards. 100% recommended.
What a fantastic book!!
they are a great way to really begin your practice it teaches the basic and need to know things
Has literally everything you need. Amazing for a beginner.
Very good beginners guide. Touches on a decent variety of magical topics.
I bought this book and loved it! I started listening to her podcast and it’s really good to! Totally recommend
Loved this book read it in one day and found it to be very helpful. Cant wait to have fun and get back to being me.
I love this book so much information and all of it is very helpful for a beginner like me
The only problem I have is some of the pages fell out
10/10
"I received a copy of this book directly from the author/publisher in exchange for an honest review.I'll be frank… I think this book was miss-titled. I went into this book expecting a guide to, well, witchcraft - spellwork, incantations, maybe a little herbalism, something about the history of witchcraft, moon phases… basically, the usual witchcraft kit of information give or take some personal views.That isn't what this is.The book is well written, incredibly thorough, if lacking much of a personal touch, and covers a wide variety of topics - don't get me wrong. It's a useful book to have on your shelves… it's just not so much about ""magic"" and witchcraft as it is general mysticism. Very little in this book is about the topics mentioned earlier. If you want to learn about Tarot, crystal healing, palm reading, or divination, this is a great resource, and those practices can certainly be an aspect of witchcraft… but recognize going in what this book is, and what it isn't."
"I was provided with a free review copy. Maggie Haseman's first book is divided into easy to read chapters. Each of the chapters have great information to help fire-up your interest into the subject. She gives an easy to read and understandable explanation of what each subject is about. Colored pictures of crystals and easy to read charts for us that are visual learners and at the end of each subject there is an exercise to help you use what you just read and learned. The spells and rituals that Maggie shares give an explanation on why and when to use the spell and rituals, the ingredients or supplies are not expensive and most will be found in your cupboard or drawer. Each spell and ritual are broken down into easy five or seven steps; making it easy for those beginning their witchy path and giving confidence into continuing on that path. The Chakra section even has affirmations. Includes a great reference section for more information if any of the chapters or subjects resonate with you. The index section makes it easy to find what you are looking for. I wish this book was around when I started on my witchy path...but I'm glad it is there for those new to their path."
"I suppose there are different avenues of magic that one can pursue: ritual or ceremonial magic or divination magic. This book explores the aspects of divination magic which is using an item imbued with a certain type of energy or symbolically amplified with a specific meaning. Your unconscious holds the understanding and meanings of you to draw out its message. So through chakras, palmistry, tarot, crystals, astrology or other types of means of ""talking to the spirits"". Each section gives a brief overview and instructions on how to conduct the spell or to ""activate"" its energy. It touches upon other areas briefly, like meditation and spell working, but does not really cover the aspect of ceremonial magic. There are enough options in this book to choose something that speaks to you, you certainly do not need to do all of it, however, what is offered is just a surface and could be delved into deeper. While the book seems to be thorough in its topics, I find it on the New Age side of things. Yes, it is for beginners and should serve well to someone who is new to the study."
"I really enjoyed this book. I wish it had been available when I started on my journey. It has something for everyone and more. I found the charts in each section and or the catalog of elements to be especially helpful for both the very new to magic and to those who are more experienced.The exercises after each category get you excited while getting you started.  It will give you a feel for that particular element and if it’s something you want to dive into more.Practical Magic For Beginners gives you insight into each element of magic in a easy to understand way. If you were just curious about magic before Maggie’s book, after reading her book you will be hooked. You can tell a lot of thought and love went into writing this book.I was provided with a free copy for review and will be ordering 2 more copies for my girls who are drawn to this path and want to see what magic the universe has to offer and don’t know where to start.I am sure that I will be referring to this book and suggesting it to many along my path."
"Let me start by saying I don't consider myself to be a witch or into magic all that much ... BUT this book is the best for those who are starting to explore that side of themself. The author's writing is so approachable. Not once when reading this did I feel this was out of my comfort zone. I love how easy the exercises, rituals, and spells are to do. Magic isn't just for those born with a special gift or real-life Harry Potters ... magic can be done by people just like me. I can incorporate these practices into my everyday life. You don't have to read the book cover to cover (unless you want to!) you can skip around and focus on aspects that appeal to you in the moment. I think my favorite section is the ""Plants for Every Purpose"" - I can use herbs from my garden!  I definitely recommend this book for anyone looking to explore the magic that you can bring to everyday life."
"This is a very basic introduction. It provides rather superficial coverage on a number of topics including astrology, palm is try, spell casting, crystals and herbs. Not much depth but enough to get a novice started. My favorite portion was the section on tarot. Her descriptions of the meanings were non-stop threatening, usable and helpful.  The less experience you have the better this book is. It is accessible written and nicely illustrated."
"Practical Magic for Beginner's is a straightforward & easy read for those of us who are interested in learning more about modern witchcraft but are overwhelmed by the internet's infinite resources. As someone who can spend a lot of time going down a rabbit hole, I felt like this book was telling me all the important details I needed to know to get started in the mystical world. The book impressively covers a wide variety of subjects - energy healing, divination, signs & spirits, and remedies, recipes & spells. It can be read from beginning to end, or you can jump to a section that piques your interest. If you are a beginner interested in learning more about how to integrate magic into your modern life, this book is for you. Disclaimer: I was provided with a free review copy but all thoughts are my own."
"I'm new to reading about witchcraft as a whole, although I've been interested for close to a decade and done some research on certain aspects of it. As with all things, when you start out, it's easy to get overwhelmed or to jump into complex subjects which are too well, complex, for a newbie to understand. I liked that this book seemed simple enough for a newbie like me to understand and it is.The way each topic is explained and written about makes sense for anyone who does not understand said topic. There were topics in this book that I already understood and had knowledge about, but others that I did not, such as chakras and palmistry. I was able to learn about those topics in a way that made sense and was not too complex.The book was enjoyable and I liked that I could jump from section to section without feeling like I needed to read it from beginning to end. The author's writing style was also good. It was not at all dumbed down and I felt that things were explained well enough for me to get the gist of them without being overwhelmed. Then, based on what I've learned and have become interested in, I can learn more. So, essentially, this book allows you to create a foundation.I will definitely be keeping this book for a long time to come even as I expand in my practice and knowledge of witchcraft."
This is perfect for a beginner. It has everything you need to get you started or to understand why some things would be black magic and how intention is the key to spells. It is so organized. There’s chapters listing ingredients like herbs and what they are good for and what spells to use them in. Basically things in your kitchen. This book explains how it doesn’t have to be expensive or you don’t have to go out and buy a lot of new stuff. There’s a section listing what essential oils to use for what effect. And explaining about crystals and their meaning and use. I was so impressed with this. I will keep it always.
"I love this book! It is so informational and organized in a format that is very easy to read and keep your interest. It covers any topic you could imagine that will guide you to bring forth your spiritual side. It covers topics such as chakras, spells, tarot, herbal remedies, crystals, auras, palm reading, astrology, and more! The author Maggie Haseman succeeds in delivering this information in easy to digest and to the point paragraphs, which I am grateful for because I can't stand long-winded unnecessary explanations, my attention span is not built for that. It also makes it fun to just read a quick chapter when I'm taking a break from work. Great book, thank you for your wisdom and for sharing it!"
"This book is really fun! It's packed with information about spirituality, herbal remedies, crystals, and more - all designed to be in more of a beginner fashion. Now, I wouldn't consider myself a devout believer in this kind of stuff, but it was very informative about why certain things are perceived the way they are. Like crystals, for example. The different properties they are believed to have. I can definitely see the draw in the ""practical magic"" side of things! Even the information given on the herbal remedies is helpful because it makes everything seem attainable. I'm happy to have this book to flip through and learn more."
"Maggie has done a beautiful job of presenting the basics in a concise, dubious manner.  I love that she didn't just go into spells and foo foo like most authors.  She laid the foundation for practical magic.  Magic isn't about casting spells, it is about aligning yourself with a greater source to bring about manifestation in your life through set intentions and rituals.  Maggie has focused on that in this book, and it would be a book I would proudly present to a beginner who wants to explore their magical side."
"This book has so much great information for the beginner.  It's divided into four parts: The Essentials of Energy Healing (Chakras, Auras, and Crystals), Divination (Tarot, Palmistry, and Astrology), Signs and Spirits (Sigils, Dreams, and Spirit Guides), and Remedies, Recipes, and Spells (Plant Magic, Herbal Remedies, and Spellcasting).  Each section has color pictures and photographs such as for the crystals and herbs and tarot cards. Everything is laid out well and clearly.  There's also a great listing in the back of references to continue your studies."
I chose this book to be part of a larger general reference library I am building on Magic and the history of magic.  It’s well written and laid out in a thoughtful manner that guides the reader through basic concepts.The binding is standard modern trade paperback binding with middling to average shelf life possible.  A hardcover would last longer.I find that it is helpful to purchase the e-book editions for research purposes because you are able to do key word searches very easily.
"I really enjoyed reading this book. I am not new to the world of magic by any means, but I still enjoy reading new books where even I can learn new things. This book is very modern, and the artwork is trendy. I like the layout of the book and the tone of the writer. It feels like they are an experienced friend who is guiding you through the exercises and rituals and information. This book has a lot to offer and presents it in a way that is attractive and easy to understand for the new witch. 5/5"
"The title says it all: this is a hands-on book if you want to learn about magic and become a practitioner.  Maggie is a gentle, savvy, and smart guide through the mysteries of the magic world.  She will not lead you astray."
"I received a free review copy and I absolutely love this book. It's laid out into sections that you can flip through or read cover to cover. Not only does this book give lessons on earthy things- minerals, plants, etc.- but also things related to your inner self- auras, palms, and your spirit.Maggie's book isn't just for witches- It is a great way to step into yourself and the world around you with new perspectives.Highly recommended for anyone searching for self reflection tools!"
"Author Maggie Haseman keeps ""Practical Magic for Beginners: Exercises, Rituals, and Spells for the New Mystic"" simple, informative and easy to read. The explanations are understandable. The exercises and such are reasonable for the practical label. I do like that there are photographs of items when helpful, but it never gets cluttered. Overall, a nice book for beginners."
"This book is a dream and not just for beginners. I have been practicing magic for many years but this book caught my eye. It is so increasingly in depth and packed with information. It goes into so many different topics. Crystals, auras, divination, and much more. It even has pictures of everything! Highly recommend and when I say run to go get this, I mean it! You will not regret it."
I absolutely love this Practical Magic for Beginners book! Each and every page is filled with wonderful knowledge paired with the most beautifully vibrant photos. This book is great for beginner practitioners of practical magic! I would recommend this book to just about anyone just starting to learn or just wants to know more about the everyday magic the we hold within us.
"This book has a little of everything! From Chakras and Auras to crystals and healing herbs, palmistry, tarot, dream interpretation and so much more! I highly recommend book as a beginners guide for all things......magic 🔮"
Maggie is a life long learner who makes every effort to learn everything she can to throughly understand any topic. This book is a culmination of many years of study and exploration. It's a perfect guide for anyone just entering the practice or a seasoned practitioner wanting to brush up on new information or learn something new that they've never worked on before. Maggie has taken the time to be sensitive to different cultures' traditions and appreciate open practices while honoring closed practices. A true labor of love and a well written guide.
"A great introduction, this book has a lot of info right at the start for any beginner to learn all the basics, but in a quick and easy to understand way. Very concise and overall a good book to have around, even after learning the basics. It covers a lot of different things, so you can really find out what is best for you."
"This is the best book that I have found on this subject. It is really well written, and written so that total newbies can easily understand the subject matter. I also love that it covers many different topics and while just an overview it gives a ton of information in each topic to let the reader decide what they do and don't want to explore more. This is fantastic, thank you!"
"It was a great read I couldn't put it down and read it all the way through, which is hard for me sometimes lol I'm a practicing green witch for a few months now so this was more a refresher for me but I enjoyed it and I def recommend to all others interested in practicing magick"
"Bought this for my 9 year old son who is in to warlocks. It is a bit much for him, but I think its fabulous. I will probably keep this on my nightstand for a year or two and then try moving it back into my sons library. If you are looking to release your inner magic, or in my case, restart old flames, I highly recommend this book."
This book is filled with a nice basic understanding of Wicca Theory.  It holds a bit of info in many of the questions someone starting a journey down this road would be asking.  Overall its an easy to follow read and does what it claims to do.
"The pictures and graphs in this book are super helpful! Most of this information I already knew, but I got a few good notes from this. If you're looking for information on chakras and meditation, this is definitely a great book for that."
"This book offers a good introduction to divination magic and a great book for someone just getting started. It is well written and illustrated. The author goes over a number of different topics such as astrology, tarot, crystals, palmistry, etc... It's not an in depth dive into any ONE type of divination, but a good overall to give the novice a clearer understanding into it."
"This is a useful book for those looking to try their hand at some rituals. The higher focus is on some truly practical excercises, though those looking for more focus on theory may be disappointed. Still, this makes a fine trainer for those who just need someone guiding them through some exercises and spells.  It's clearly written and well-organized to find what you need."
This is such a great book and perfect for those just beginning their magical journey! This book is very easy to follow and covers multiple areas of interest. A great reference guide for those just learning about witchcraft!
"Tons of great ideas, tools and information. A great read. I enjoyed the format this book is written in the letters are clear to read on the kindle/phone version."
I had fun reading this book and was amazed by  extensive content and coverage.  It covered everything I was ever curious about and read many books about.
"I was provided with a free review copy, just finished reading a second time and I absolutely love this book. The guide is very thorough yet the information is presented thoughtfully and organized so as not to overwhelm. I appreciated the layout of her different chapters. Two of my favorite chapters were Chakras and Herbal healing - skills I've been interested in but felt nervous to approach. I have already ordered a copy for a friend who I can't wait to share Maggie's words with."
This was one of the easier reads in the genre of spiritual learning that I have read in a long time
"Simple, legible text, and informative. Great to have on hand and nice to have on the coffee table."
I freakin love this book! Any and every spell in it can be tweaked to suit you and what you have!
Good basic primer. Doesn't go into a ton of detail but enough to get into the basics.
"Covered all the basics, well written and easy to follow.  Tips and explanations very practical (exactly as advertised in the title)."
This is a great all encompassing book for beginners or anyone that needs a refresher. It's very easily digestible and easy to understand.
"Really great starting point! Loved the explanations, definitions, references, and charts.useful and to the point. Nice visuals as well of set ups"

Great magical guide. Maggie touches on everything you need to know. Great reference guide to use again and again. I really enjoyed this book and recommended it.
Would recommend
I love it! Great book to get started in my practice.
A good book for a beginner good info
I found Maggie about a year ago now. Her content is amazing. Naturally I was excited to see her new book and learn all the things. Witches support witches. This book is perfect for any person wanting to expand their magic at any stage. It's a perfect book to keep for reference and beyond. I love it so much! I highly recommend to purchase for the bookshelf.
"I have ordered several books on this subject and they have all been quite good. However, I am only a little ways into the book and it has already included so many subjects that were not previously covered in any other books on witch craft. I'm blown away by the sheer amount of information so far and I can't wait to see what else I learn. GREAT book for both beginners and seasoned practitioners alike!"
"While I enjoyed the book, I did struggle with whether or not I wished to return it. She covers a good range of topics but it all lacks depth. If you’re looking for an ultra beginner book briefly introducing you to different topics in the “witchy world” this is for you. I consider myself a beginner but found I already knew most of this from just browsing Instagram and TikTok. I think I’ll keep it as a quick reference book since it’s got some good information but overall I do think it lacks substance. I’d describe it as a quick reference book to insta/TT witch content.I was also disappointed at the quality of the paper. It feels like cheap printer paper. The cover is a nice matte feel and the font/pictures are nice though."
"Another beautiful deck by Alana! I have been using meditation cards for 30 years and I've never found any as insightful as hers. I am convinced it's channeled information, as it's so accurate and intense. I love Doreen Virtues cards too but they are child's play compared to Alana's, imho.The WhiteLight deck is my 7th deck of hers, some of them resonated more than others with me.  The ones that didn't, simply found their way to people I care about, that they did resonate with and they make wonderful gifts, I've ordered at least 4 decks for friends and family and given 3 decks of my own away. My personal favorites are the Sacred Rebel, The Divine Circus, The Inner Goddess and The LightWorkers decks, and now I will add to the mix the WhiteLight deck. The book is bigger with this deck, perhaps because the information is even deeper and more profound than her previous decks, (which I didn't think Alana could even do), as mentioned her previous decks are so amazing. This deck I even had a very interesting experience with, right out the gate, that I will share:The first card I pulled was the last card in the deck, #44 The Lion Gate 888Hz - I have never even studied what these Hz frequencies were or meant; however, the card was amazingly on point (as expected). The next thing I did after I read the card, was go to my Youtube to listen to Abraham Hicks, another wonderful teacher I give a little bit of my day to every day and normally that's the first suggestion in my list, but today the first video in my suggestion list, is one called 528 Hz Mandala of the Heart video... and I must say, my heart skipped a beat when I saw it, so I hit play of course, and it is these beautiful tones and music for realignment, that I can feel instantly is what my energy needs right now. Then I went back to Alana's book to see if she had a 528Hz card in the deck and sure enough she does! It even has the same title - and the card was so fitting for my life right now, it had tears of gratitude rolling down my face as I read it, simply for the mere connectedness of it all.  Feeling like we are being helped along the way is the best feeling in the world to me!Now, I've found several other videos on youtube that align with her book as well and I am adding these to my morning meditations.  The visuals are amazing too.For me it's just more proof that the universe is always listening and ready to respond to me, and all I have to do is remain open to receive it.  The same goes for anyone reading this review.On a practical note, any of Alana's cards will help you to do that.  This review is coming from my own experiences, I have no connection to Alana, other than a vibrational, spiritual one, through connecting to her writings.  She is a teacher of teachers and that's what I recognize in her and appreciate. If you are a teacher of spiritual things, this deck is perfectly aligned for you.  Namaste ♥"
"You can always trust Alana Fairchild to deliver a beautiful and useful, informative ""oracle"" deck. But this offering is above and beyond. A. Andrew Gonzalez' art is stunning yet soothingly beautiful. Alana's messages are insightful, and do not offer any fluff, as so many ""self-Help"" and Oracle decks do. This is not necessarily s sweet ""You can do it tiger!"" Deck, but does suggest how to work with the energy and events in one's life, ways to open the mind's eye view to include other ways of seeing things, and is educational as well. You will find Tibetan Buddhist deities and beings, Angels, Solfeggio Frequency information, Brainwave information, and other beings of Myth and legend from around the world. Very inclusive and again, not soft and fluffy, the deck supports but does not just say ""You can do it!"" over and over. You will see hard questions asked of you in this book!If you are brave enough to accept the messages, as well as discerning and confident about your desire to grow spiritually, and can dive deeper than the pretty pictures, then you NEED this deck."
"I have Alana Fairchild's Isis deck, earth warrior's deck, and now this stunning white oracle deck.  To see she teamed up with one of my all time favorite artists A. Andrew Gonzalez blew my mind.  Dreams do come true.  Andrew and Alana being two very powerfully potent channels together has me smiling ear to ear.  I have used the deck since I got it and it broke me wide open in a graceful way.  I don't cry much but her writing always make me cry in a serene way.  Now to be companied by Andrew Gonzalez's work that speaks to my soul. whoa! Yes!  This is a great deck to help speak to the nervous system of the soul your emotions.  Catharsis invoking for sure... It's helping me greater understand my emotional matrix and help me on my journey of purification and clarity within the heart."
"I REALLY CAN'T PUT IN EXACT WORDS THE HEALING THIS DECK HAS. I HAVE SEVERAL ALANA DECKS AND EACH DECK HAS CHANGED MY LIFE AND OTHERS IN MY PATH. THE TRANSFORMATION AND EVOLUTION THAT OCCUR IN OUR SOULS BRING SUCH WISDOM, AND ALANA BLESSED CALLING ALLOW OUR SOULS TO LISTEN AND REVEAL WHAT OUR INTUITION, INSTINCT AND GOD GIVEN TALENTS ARE RELATING IN A DETAILED AND MORE CLARIFIED WAY!! ENLIGHTMENT FOR THE SOUL!!!!"
"This is the first time buying an oracle deck and I was led to the right one. This review is long overdue but after my fourth reading using this oracle, I couldn't without praises. I absolutely love this deck! From the breathtaking artwork of Andrew Martinez to the deeply spiritual otherworldly truth words from the authentic soul of Alana Fairchild, I am always overjoyed with each reading. Since purchasing this oracle deck, I AM more grounded and centered in life. Because these card meanings touch and resonate deeply with me. I even cried reading these mind-blowing truths. I never bought anything from Alana Fairchild and although I had many tarot and oracle decks in my shopping cart, this one kept drawing me in. I didn't like the Sacred Rebel deck as much and returned it but these light-filled images are nothing short of masterpieces. I'd be delighted to have a poster of each one framed and hung on my walls. Simply exquisite and the oracles are very inspiring to this Believer Witch. The more I frame my world with the Christ White Light, the more my Light can luminate in this world. I highly recommend this deck. Alana uses two methods of 'oracling': The Process of Purification and Session for Sacred Surrender. These to me are deeper than any tarot reading I've ever had. I was told that some felt Alana was morphing into Doreen Virtue with this deck but I choose not to judge any spiritual one. I love Doreen Virtue and I love Alana Fairchild. I AM not afraid or shy sway from Christ consciousness...it is and shall always be the highest unconditional Love Light of all❤"
"Artwork is the most beautiful I’ve seen, so soothing. The guidance that I’ve received using these cards seems to be much more specific than other decks. Very helpful in aiding growth"
"I’ll start this by saying I have every one of Alana’s decks. I am an Oracle and I use cards daily for readings for myself and clients.First, as always the artwork and messages are gorgeous. This deck is absolutely stunning and has a powerful energy.That said, I do not like the cards themselves. I’ve reviewed the same issue on other decks of hers. I wish she would change manufacturers.  Sacred Rebels seems to be the last deck that had a good finish.The finish is not good for shuffling. Cards stick together (even on decks with this finish that I have had for years and have used hundreds of times).THIS deck though, not only has this unfortunate finish, but after one use, several cards are already peeling apart.This deck took forever to get. I sent a message to the seller and hope I can get a new one quickly.I will update this review once I hear from the seller."
.I just received my cards and they are lovely fantastic card stock pictures everything about them is exquisite and the box and book are very nice. I can’t seem to put them down
"When I got this deck I was going through each card and was struck by one card to the point that it made me stop and linger on the the image.  It was 13 Bastet of 174Hz.  The piercing green eyes of the cat pulled me in.  I do not do the standard fan and pick, rather I shuffle and let the cards reveal themselves by falling out, popping up or a clear hard split.  The first time I used the deck I began to shuffle and a card fell out and of course I was not surprised to see it was Bastet.  Yesterday I was doing the 2 spreads in the book and rather than picking the 3 cards at once, I asked the question, started to shuffle and let the card show itself one at a time.  Each of the 3 times I laid the deck down after getting my card and noticed the card on the top of the deck started to slide off the deck.  Each time I looked and each time that top card was Bastet.  I realized this card really wants my attention so I put it in a display block and it is now sitting on my desk.  The artwork for this deck is unbelievable and the messages are wonderful.  The 2 suggested spreads in the book gave amazing results.  I have many Alana Fairchild decks and love them all even though the descriptions can be way too much sometimes.  When they become overwhelming I just read the first paragraph and usually get what I need.  I love that each deck has such unique artwork and this one with it's muted color and matt finish is stunning.  Generally I do not like the new matt cards, they are too thick and harder to let cards reveal themselves but for this deck it seems the perfect choice for the art."
Absolutely beautiful deck with positive vibe 🥰 I use it to give daily oracle readings for my clients and myself. They love it and I love it. 🥰🥰🥰🥰
The cards are of good stock. Explained well in the guidebook. And could instantly feel the connection with them. So much so that I ordered the Isis Oracle from this same person. Thank You for sharing your gift so that we share it as well.
"I am a card reader who is a bit tired of all the hoop-la afloat that everyone needs to explore their dark or shadow side.  I personally feel what is bright and into the Light should be approached and strengthened first and utmost. This is what attracted me to this deck and I have not been disappointed,  Every card has an airy etherial feel that is refreshing and uplifting, encouraging that which is positive in all of us.  Enjoy!"
"these are beautiful cards. i’m glad to have them. the one thing that doesn’t sit right with me is the fact that all of the people depicted in this deck have european features, even if the diety or being that is being depicted isn’t from a european culture. this deck uses religious symbols from a wide range of cultures. so why are there only white people on these cards? very disappointing as it is a great deck that i like to use but every time i pick them up I can’t help but to think this. it’s bothersome."
"Amazing deck. Helpful with letting go of the past, opening and healing the heart and stepping into your path with grace and courage. I love Alana Fairchild's work. She has a gift for getting to the root of the matter. The card stock is lovely. Smooth and easy to shuffle. The artwork is exquisite. They look more like sculptures than paintings. Beautiful work by A. Andrew Gonzalez. This is a transformational deck. Work with it to ignite true change in your life. Just began using this brilliant work of art and I feel empowered. The Sacred Feminine is strong here. It's a deck of Light, but the skillfull practitioner can also use this to tap and recognize the dark aspects of oneself that needs illumination. Phenomenal deck. I'm very happy with this purchase. Allow this deck to assist you on your healing journey. Many blessings abound.Suggestion for cleansing the deck: Run each card through quality Sage smoke saying a personal blessing over each card to clear the energy and prepare the deck to be infused with your personal energy. You can also anoint each card with the oil of your choice *(ex: Frankincense, Myrrh, Holy Oil, etc)*"
"Alana always makes the best oracle decks. I own 12 of her decks and this one is deffinetly one of my favorites. Like other reviewers said this deck has a very high energy and is divinely channeled. It is a very powerful, beautiful and accurate deck. It feels very different, energetically then her other decks because to me it feels like it was channeled by really high light energy beings (not saying her other decks aren't either) It is very calming, and whenever I work with it, usually when I am feeling uncertain, aftaid or upset, I always get a perfect card for my situation. The artwork is absolutely stunning, everything about this deck is perfect, including quality. Thank you Alana for creating this deck and to the artist for the beautiful artwork and not leaving out the publisher Blue Angel!"
"So, I love working with Oracle cards alongside Tarot and other forms of cartomancy. This deck specifically called to me, and OMG. As soon as I got in my hands, I felt like I was holding a vile of light. Beautifully constructed and the guidebook - TO DIE FOR! I normally don’t read guidebooks for Oracle decks, but this one is rich and deep! Totally recommend for anyone who wants to experience upgrades, furthering their awakening, and tapping into the Collective of Light!"
I love this deck or I would return it because of the state the packaging was in when I got it which was quite damaged. This was supposed to be a brand new deck but a corner of the box had a pretty bad ding and hole in it and another corner was crumpled. The contents of the box are gorgeous however. And the deck feels amazing and I can’t wait to use it. I do not however think they sent me a brand new deck which is pretty irritating to say the least.
"So this is my first deck by Alana Fairchild....and it may be my last. I was drawn to it by the artwork- which is beautiful. The cards are oversized, great for art but a bit difficult to shuffle. I was thrilled to find an oversized manual/book on how to use the cards (usually they're quite small. Until I started reading it....35 pages in and the author still hadn't given instructions on how to use the deck! Close to 2 hrs just to read the author's experience in creating the cards, intro and then layouts- I was exhausted. I finally put the deck away and resumed the next day only to find the explanations for each 3-5 pgs long! Done- no more. Now I just wing it intuitively. At the pace of the author a simple oracle reading to support a tarot could take 2 hrs alone."
"Awesome deck! They looked a bit in-depth as I glanced thru them when first opened. However, I pulled only ONE card as a clarifier/advice card at the very end of a reading I did for a close friend. The specificity to her situation referenced in the accompanying guide book was mind-blowing to put it modestly. If you are familiar with Alanna Fairchild Oracle decks, you're aware of the detailed insight contained in the guide book.She always suggests an exercise, meditation suggestion, release (Healing Process) for each card's energy. This is part of the charm as well as an added bonus for her Oracle decks. I love it!"
"These are one of my favorite Oracle Decks for a myriad of reasons: firstly they have the Hz frequencies on the cards; secondly, beautifully designed, gentle energy; thirdly, non denominational and great with all belief systems and clients.  You can see pictures of them on my Facebook page in a reading: Spirit Blossoms Psychics of on my YouTube Channrl"
PROS:The artwork on these cards are absolutely beautiful.The energy of them feels really good.The book and card interpretations we’re definitely  channeled from the heart and with so much passion and love. (that’s important ) I appreciate that.CONS:The only thing I dislike is the size and material. They are hard to hold and tend to stick together.Other than than this is a beautiful deck that deserves nothing short of 5 stars!
"Over the years I have met and discarded many choices of Tarot. If someone is going to delve deeply enough to have serious insight and generosity of spirit to create a new deck of Tarot, I really want it to be worth the time and effort of the journey into this new land.  This is it!  The text is insightful and sensitive, the art is aware and benevolent in its portrayal of some very complex ideas.  There is obvious skill of both Author and Artist! Worth the money and the effort!"
"These cards are gorgeous. I'm enjoying them very much. You can feel their vibration and it's wonderful. The guidebook is fascinating and has great insights. My only complaint is the cards are on the thinner side and they are a little big to shuffle easily in my hands. I understand why they are larger because the artwork is so beautiful and really needs to be seen, so I'm adjusting. The box they arrive in is very well made, as is the guidebook. I'm really enjoying the White Light Oracle cards and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND them."
"WOW!  This deck has blown me away!  While I was expecting some insights and beautiful artwork, this deck took me totally by surprise.  The artwork is ethereal and caught me right between the heart and soul.  the guidance is spot on target.  BRAVA!"
"Stunning cards with healing energy.I saw reviews complaining that this was not a diverse deck. I am of Nordic dissent & many of the cards pulled are based on Norse Goddesses which of course I was blown away my first three readings. The artist last name is Gonzalez, In many of the images it appears to be two or three of the same females drawn. Maybe sisters?For me, this deck is magical."
"Just flipping through these cards gives me a sense of tranquility and peace. The illustrations are amazing, the  card stock is fantastic (so buttery and smooth) and the size is great. The booklet is the longest and most detailed of any of the Oracle cards I have. Don't hesitate, get these!!!!"
"I absolutely love these cards & are my first oracle cards.  They are very inspirational and set the tone for the day as you apply its message in practice.  So much wisdom as they open up your mind and a beautiful new way of thinking.  Every word resonates with me.  I highly recommend this deck, and feel that they enhance & enrich my life.  Thank you for sharing your gift Alana Fairchild and years of hard work.  I will take the cards to my spiritual energy circle & share the messages with my spiritual family every week."
These are beautiful and my new favorite cards. They are incredible. I have loved the artists work for years. We have a mutual friend in common and his work speaks to me. But the card messages are so detailed and perfect and so accurate. I totally cried when I gave myself the first reading. It was exactly what I needed. Thank you for such a gift.
So far it’s very optimistic but not overly so. The images on the cards are “smooth“ and ethereal. Also the meanings and descriptions for the cards are very very long in depth and profound. I love all of the frequencies involved in the deck.
I love this Oracle Deck.  This is a nice stock of paper and beautiful card deck with a beautiful book to go with it.
Photos are ok. I don’t care about looking at them . The messages in the guide are more important. I see this book for spiritual reading if you have a bigger question that affects different dimensions. Be in good vibe before using it . My 1st use gave me the answer I asked in 3 cards.  FB@tarotreader511
"Beautiful cards, you have to seriously mess with them to get them easier to work with, but the reading was very accurate, which is all I care about, connecting and communication with the deck 😊❤️"
"very stunning deck, truthful and very self healing. Fast shipping is a great bonus!!!"
This oracle deck has been piercing my heart to the core and helping me so much with healing and trusting spirit and the process of healing. Best deck I own. The book it comes with is a literal short book but don’t let that intimidate you. Each card has about 3-4 pages description and healing so you can fully understand how to open your eyes to knew ways of thinking and truly be kind to yourself and heal! Also the illustrations are breathtaking
Beautiful
They gave me an amazing reading right off the bat. The cards themselves are very thick and soft. The art is beautiful and I felt a connection the second I opened the box. I have small hands so it is a pinch difficult holding them.
"These beautiful cards are a good quality, with book included. They shuffle nicely after you work with them for a few minutes. Shipping was super fast. I'm pleased with my purchase."
"Very beautiful artistry and design.  Book is complete, sometimes even too wordy but gives good instructions and descriptions.  Seems like sturdy paper stock.  Would recommend."
"I love these cards! They are absolutely beautiful, and the book contains a summary, detailed explanation, and healing activity for each card. Perfect!"
Would recommend!
Big cards nice quality.  I've been wanting these for a while. I have used them just a couple of times and I found the messages very beautiful and powerful.
Lovw it so excited I am glad I got the deck box was damaged but deck was good I been using it for moon ceremony so excited
"One of my favorite decks, the quality of the cards is amazing i wish all the decks were made this way. Beautiful artwork and messages."
Description is for the card deck and 240 page book. Received a deck with no book and a QR code on the bottom that does not work. I emailed Alana Fairchilds team because I didn't know why the QR code doesn't work. They told me it is not a genuine deck.
"This deck has been the perfect companion for my crystal oracle deck by her also, which is the most amazing deck you could ever own! It is beautiful, direct, and lovely to work with."
The cards are amazing and fast shipping
The art is somewhat repetitive and far too much reading for just one card. Be prepared to spend 30 min on a 3 card spread.
I love these cards. The cards are beautiful and the descriptions for each card are amazing.  They are a deeper level with terms from Latin and Greek.  I highly recommend them!
One of a kind. I felt an instant connection with the cards as soon as I opened the box.
"Looooove these cards. They are so beautiful, high-quality, and the book has so much depth and spiritual insight that I always feel better after I draw a card."
These cards have an amazing healing energy... every time I work with them they are spot on and give the message that is needed at that moment. I love these cards. They are beautiful!
This deck is stunning.  The artwork is wonderful and Alana's insights are (as always) truly insightful.  I highly recommend adding this deck to your library.
"Great illustration, good readings - especially if you are connected to your own intuition, it seem always so spot on"
Beautiful cards!!! The booklet is Inspirational highly recommend this set!!
This is my first deck I’ve gotten of Alana’s and I’m in love. It has such a good energy and is my favorite deck currently. I’m so glad I purchased this! The card stock is very good quality with just the right amount of grip to them. And the 230 page guide book is amazing too!I’m so looking forward to checking out Alana’s other decks as well.
"Love this deck, something calming about the white images."
Alana Fairchild is fabulous!  Love everything she does!
"Incredible deck. Stunning. If you're on the fence, GET IT."
I am in love with the design and the booklet is very thorough. Great deck.
"These cards have a very high vibration, my new favorite deck!"
"Way too many naked pics in this deck, you should show that in the product images. Just sayin."
"Beautiful deck. Was supposed to be new but received a used deck, not shrink wrapped, cards scratched, book torn (see photo)."
Alana Fairchild is one of the best at creating oracle cards. The artwork in itself is gorgeous and with each cards meaning there is such an in depth lesson to take away!
Excellent powerful beautiful cards. Very happy I bought these.  They are special.
Beautiful and well make. Recommend.
"Beautiful cards, Great quality"
An absolutely stunning deck. Card stock is decent. Images aesthetically pleasing.
"This is one of the most beautiful decks I own, the art work and the card stock is so beautiful, it’s a matter/rose pedal feeling ❤️❤️🙊❤️"
"Nice cardstock, beautiful art."
This deck is beautiful and unique.  I enjoy using it for my readings.
"I love these cards, they feel so satisfying in your hand. The energy is very calming and I love the images. Each card looks like a beautiful living statue. The pictures just don’t do these cards any justice."
This is a beautiful deck. Gorgeous! The cards are very large and a little harder to shuffle
Truly shows things that pertains specifically  to you frequently!
This is a beautiful deck with plenty of inspiring text included in the book. Very happy I purchased this deck.
These are gorgeous. I highly recommend these.
I was called to this deck during a very transformative time in my life.  The artwork is beautiful. The message/explanation for each card is though provoking and has resonated deeply for me.  Highly recommend!!
The artwork is simply divine and the guide book that comes with the deck depicts inner feelings and renown healing energy when you read it. You won’t be disappointed!!
They are beautiful and with lots of positive energy ❤️
Beautiful cards!
Pictures are beautiful and has a booklet.
Spiritual learning tool of Highest Caliber! Perfect congruency of Artwork and Writing. Clarity and Palpable Energy! I would not be without it on a daily basis!
It is a beautiful and open mind. When I grab the card a got chills lol. Thank you and Bless you and your inspiration work.:-)
Beautiful Oracle cards.  Love the images and healing messages.
"Comes with a booklet explaining the artist, author, and each individual card"
"Amazing, I connect with these cards so well."
One of my very favorite decks! Beautifully done in every way.I highly recommend it.
Amazing deck. Beautiful artwork with a very detailed guidebook. Highly recommend.
Amazing I connected with them quick and help me a lot . I love the art style it's just so amazing
Stunning artwork
"Gorgeous cards, great energy.Must have for your collection."
Beautiful deck with wonderful healing messaging.
Wonderful and so inspiring!
Beautiful cards and very uplifting!!
Amazing and beautiful cards
Great present for myself!
"Unfortunately Card 22 “Aih Soph Aur” is misspelt. It should be “Ain Soph Aur”.Translated from Hebrew, it means: “Light Without End”.The guidebook on page 129 repeats this error in its title too, but then refers to “Ain Soph Aur” correctly thereafter.What should we do? First off, tell people about it.Does this negate the entire deck? Well, if you’re not a stickler for detail, no. But if you’re using the deck to connect with the Divine, yes.That’s because in Kabbala, “The Ohr Ein Sof” (correct English spelling) is the name of God.It is a doctrine that states that God is never ending, never extinguishing: that in creation there can never be “a nothing”. For even in the darkest, emptiest places we perceive, the Light of God pervades and fills it all.Typos do happen but I’m hoping that Blue Angel Publishing can provide a fix."
"I can’t remember the last time I wrote a review but I felt compelled to let people know this oracle deck is extremely special. The artwork is amazing, the advice is spot on & so extremely profound. I purchased a second set because it’s just that mind blowing. I am a person who can’t connect with every deck easily. This one is consistently profound & I connected with it from the first reading. I tend to agree with the other reviewer that said she thought it was channeled information. I can’t tell you enough how highly I recommend it."
Alana Fairchild is my all-time favorite. Every one of her decks I’ve used has been incredible. This deck is filled with her signature blend of amazing artwork and completely unique cards & guidebook. Her decks will take you on a sacred journey.
I sent these cards to a girlfriend who really needed something nice right now. She loves them and is diving into the book as I'm writing this.  Very pretty cards and soothing right out of the box.
Absolutely Gorgeous! So helpful.
These cards a very beautiful and pure white energy from them. The descriptions are full and insightful and unlike other decks. I love them and feel so drawn to them!
Prompt delivery and Beautiful Energy Product. Very Much Recommend.
Very unusual oracle set but this is a fantastic thing! Everyday I grow from its teachings and everyday I meditate on the healingsprovided for each card. I really love this deck
"These cards are so beautiful, delicious & empowering at once!  Everyone I show them to is drawn to them. I am gifting them to spread the Love 💙"
VERY NICE DECK
"I admit- I am obsessed with tarot and oracles and own over 100 decks. The White Light Oracle has been my top one since I bought it a few months ago. It has been my Guide, my Wise One, it has fathered me and mothered me in these turbulent times. It gave me many insights and new perceptions, new visions and expanded awareness. Highly recommended."
"To the people whining about naked woman, you're obviously not doing the work. If you have something against the feminine form, you need to grow up.This deck is unlike any other, the amount of accurate detail you get is wonderful. The artwork and writing is incredible and a lot of hard work has gone into this deck.The only downside, which isn't really a downside, is because the cards are matt, the friction sometimes keeps them hugging each other, but the card you require will always fall out anyway."
"These are my second deck of Oracle cards, and they have the most beautiful pictures on, to tell you or remind you, of who you are, and what you can achieve.They arrived well packaged, no damage to cards or box.The book that comes with them, is a helpful guide. So suitable for someone, who has maybe not used oracle cards before.My reason for the 4 star rating is purely because they were slightly more expensive, than my usual supplier of tarot/oracle decks. They also had free delivery though, so, definitely better to get them from Amazon, than wait for them to be in stock, with my usual supplier.I do recommend these."
"I'm not one to review products that I've purchased online and I am fairly new to spirituality, tarot and oracle cards. However, I felt the need to leave a review for this deck. The deck itself is sturdy and the quality is superb. The artwork is very provoking in a wonderful way and I was so unaware that it can illicit the reaction that it did. I have connected with this deck and it has helped me heal and soothe wounds that I did not even know existed within me.The guidebook that came with the deck is very informative and helped me delve deeper and understand the meaning of the cards more. There is something truly inspired and magical about this deck and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
"Amazing cards, always giving good advice and making sure that I am looking further to expand the way I think, loving and guiding"
The cards are so powerful and have helped me enormously to see a way forward and put my mind at rest.
Delighted with the reflection within these cards. Just beautiful.
Just love it the artwork is amazing and love the messages so deep
"These cards are beautiful and lovely to use, I am using them for a daily message and finding them really beneficial."
"I like them, I am just learning so it’s a little different for me but I do not like that it’s religious. I didn’t expect it and it doesn’t make me hate it, but when prayers and heaven are used it throws me off. 🤷‍♀️ Will continue to use but will also be shopping for others."
"Mi spiego: è davvero bellissimo il lavoro dell'artista illustratore, ed apprezzo che Alana Fairchild sia così accurata e prolissa nello scrivere. La capisco, io stessa non posseggo il dono della sintesi, quindi la capisco. Soltanto, per chi parla inglese malamente, con un livello diciamo accettabile, medio, il libretto è assolutamente complicato da comprendere, impossibile quasi, se non con sforzi davvero immensi di grande devozione. Per una carta ci metto più o meno un'ora (dipende anche dalla carta e dal concetto)! Questo non succede con altri mazzi in inglese di altri autori. Fairchild ama scrivere, e questo è lodevole; lo fa con molte ripetizioni e sottolineature e con un gergo parecchio sontuoso ed elegante. Lo apprezzo, ma non è per il mio livello di inglese (seppur buono). I libretti in francese che sono riuscita a procurarmi dei suoi oracoli tradotti, si affrontano perché parlo francese quasi come fosse l'italiano, ma in inglese è davvero un'impresa. Me ne dispiaccio. Sto cercando comunque di affrontare un oracolo alla volta a di creare una mia piccola traduzione/riassunto, per mettere un fogliettino per ogni oracolo,  all'interno del libretto, con una traduzione, spiegazione breve.Le immagini sono molto potenti ed il lavoro di Fairchild molto accurato, le guide alla guarigione sono molto ""illuminate"" e piacevoli. Ma con libretti così voluminosi e pieni di concetti, sarebbe meglio creare dei riassunti brevi alla fine di ogni oracolo, per pietà e compassione di chi compra dall'estero. Non tutti nel pianeta parlano inglese forbito, troppo spesso i lingua madre inglesi/americani/australiani ecc., se ne dimenticano. Purtroppo."
"A beautiful oracle deck, thought out and well written.  I always love reading how the author finds the inspiration for her decks and how they finally came about. Of course, after publishing so many oracle decks, the messages are not all brand new. But then, we need to hear things often and packaged differently to finally get it.Anyway, I love Blue Angel decks because they come in a simple, sturdy box with no fancy but impractical features. The cardstock is not overly thick but exactly right, the cards are smooth but not glossy and dont stick. They are on the large size so small hands may need to shuffle upright or sweep them around on the table.The booklet is, as I said, well written if maybe on the wordy side. There is a long introduction and as is usual with Alana Fairchild a text, prayer and/or short meditation or task suggested for each card.This oracle deck doesnt lend itself well for intuitive reading, that is, the booklet and given information are needed. Though of course every picture or eork of art can be used to access the sub/unconscious, so maybe some readers will be able to do that here too.If there's one thing I dont like about this deck it's the plentitude of bare breasts. I'm not a prude and not offended by nakedness, but I also dont think it's necessary to have them on every other card.....oh, and it's Ain Soph, not Aih Soph - proofreading should have caught that mistake!"
"I am a beginner in oracle reading and this deck was my first one: I am in love with it!First let's talk about the cards: Oh my goodness, each card is pure art, it is gorgeous. The quality is fantastic with a matt finish and the design is breathtaking. I felt attracted right away by its beauty and sensuality. They are also pretty big which give the art a superior dimension :)Second, the reading: my first reading was overwhelming. As I said I am new (and english is not my first language) so reading the booklet wasn't easy at first. Each card has a 2/3 pages description (this is also why i bought it) which can get a bit confusing because of all of the details and info. But I decided to not give up and gave it a second try and I have no regret. The reading is getting easier and almost all the time on point.In my opinion this is not a deck for a quick reading, you really need to set aside some time to really focus and do the little exercises for each cards.This deck as a very strong energy coming from it, bewitching!"
"These Oracle cards are stunning but unfortunately I sent them back.  I just couldn't over see the fact these cards are like a thick peace of cardboard (like a coaster you would put on your table to sit a drink on).  Every single card sticks together no matter what I did to try and prevent it and it was impossible to shuffle them because they are very big in size.  After 20 seconds of trying to do so,my hands were actually sore.  The artist did a fabulous job and certainly took her time with designing each card but the stock isn't the greatest and for me, was the reason I sent them back.  However,for some they may be alright and so I would recommend them but they just weren't for me"
I wonder if my vibration is high enough for this deck! They are absolutely stunning. They feel sacred. The messages speak to me directly from spirit.
"Alors l'oracle en lui-même est fantastique. Les cartes sont épaisses. Les illustrations semblent être des photographies de statues de marbre blanc. L'ensemble est très monochrome, dans les tons ecrus, sépia, sanguine. Le livre est conséquent,  et pas dans un anglais simpliste. Il faut être bien à l'aise en anglais, surtout que la lecture du livre est obligatoire pour saisir l'essence du jeu. Il reste une magnifique pièce de collection pour la grande qualité de l'artiste. Je déplore juste que mon exemplaire soit arrivé abîmé (mais ouf, pas les cartes !) Le boitier et le livre sont froissés.... déçue car je collectionne et prend soin de mes jeux..."
"Working with these cards is absolute pleasure. The stunningly beautiful artwork, infused energy and high vibration leave you feel privileged to work with the cards. The readings are accurate and always leave you with greater insight or something to think about. I have never worked with a deck with this energy, you simply hold the cards and are amazed. This is my favorite Alana Fairchild Deck. The cards are matte, sturdy and an absolute joy. The corresponding card descriptions are lengthy but you can tell that great thought, heart & soul went into them. This is my favorite deck that I own. Highly, highly recommend."
"I have bought more than a dozen different decks, and never have I felt such beautiful energy upon opening a brand new deck.  Usually it takes a while to sync with the cards but these just vibrated in my hands.  I can’t even describe the beauty of this deck.  The booklet and descriptions of each card is both eloquent and deeply profound.  Definitely one of my favourite decks, but not for your everyday reading.  I usually pull them out for special occasions.  They are very sacred."
"Absolutely love this deck. I am a person who works with shadow and light and am generally not a fan of all positive decks, but this deck doesn’t read that way. I have always loved the art by A Andrew Gonzales and was thrilled to have a deck focused on his work.  I connected right away with the deck and right now the world needs the messages it holds."
"These cards are beautiful!! I believe they are my favourite out all my cards. Someone commented they were ""religious "", but didn't seem in a good way?  Personally I didn't find them that way. If you read the book that comes with them it's all explained.  More spiritual than anything. Beautiful & uplifting! Exactly what we all need a bit of these days!!"
"These are so beautiful and feminine, they’re matte and great quality. I tried using them for myself and for someone else and I’m totally in tune with them.  I own a few decks and this one stands out for me. I use it for clarifying an energy for yourself or someone else. Recommend"
The readings I have had with these seem to be exactly appropriate for the situations in a person's life.  I liked them so much that I bought a deck as a Christmas gift for a best friend.
"Imágenes fascinantes, te elevan, me conectan con la parte elevada de cada criatura...recibo excelentes mensajes"
"Este oráculo es muuyy hermoso, las imágenes, la calidad, tamaño, son adecuados.Conecte mucho con este oraculo es muy directo y amoroso!!"
As a TAROT Card reader I found these cards quiet different..They were very mystical and mysterious..I noticed my friends were not drawn to themOn social media.
"Beautiful, stunning deck with deep and compelling interpretations. I am naturally rather eclectic spiritually, so these cards are beyond perfect. They have quite a sacred feel, and have made me obsessed with Alana’s work :)"
"I can’t get over the art work on these cards, and the detailed information of each card is amazing! Truly thankful for this deck! 3 days of having this deck and it has become my favourite."
"I love Alana Fairchild’s work and this deck is profound.  I’ve been using it since it was released and then I also put the app on my phone so that I always have it with me. Alana Fairchild speaks in a language that my soul hears , may it be a blessing for you and your journey. 💜🙏💜"
"Este oráculo me ha ayudado a sanar día con día, lo recomiendo totalmente."
"This deck is absolutely beautiful! I have seen it used before, so I am definitely excited about learning to use it now for myself. The shipper was fine. I had no issues with delivery, and the product arrived in great condition."
"Enjoyed this deck, very verbose so if you like simple explanations this might not be the one. I clearly enjoy complexity LOL!"
"High quality robust paper, absolutely fabulous images and artistry. Wonderful deck to work with."
"C'est un magnifique oracle, très inspirant, avec des textes riches et des pratiques de guérison. Je conseille !"
"Artwork is exquisite but I didn't like the booklet, a lot is written, messages are lost and most of the times unclear."
"Comes in the original box, big size cards for shuffling, prints are great and it comes with the guide book. Editorial version, high quality."
"Great quality images and card! The book is really full , I will recommend these healing carda"
This is a gorgeou deck.  You will get the messages your higher self needs you to receive.
This my husbands first deck and he felt it was the one and doesn't regret it.
nice card
"Such a beautiful deck of cards. I could feel the power of the deck & the cards, and the messages are always on point. Highly recommend to all lightworkers"
Finally decided to purchase it and I was not disappointed. The quality and the picture are really great. Love it!
"I like these cards a lot. They have very high- vibrational energies. Good job, Alana!"
I absolutely love these cards. The pictures are stunning and extremely well made. Worth every penny.
"This oracle card deck is incredibly profound,  every single time I use it.  Thank you so much.  Highly recommend."
Me ha encantado! Es mas grande de lo que pensaba pero la calidad es preciosa! Muy recomendable!
I was stunned by the artwork and how profound the messages transmitted. An artwork on every level. 0 regrets.
"Amazing for healing , very inspiring"
Beautiful and inspirational
An absolute beautiful deck so happy i bought it i love the art work
Love this oracle deck and the spiritual energy and wisdom the cards convey …
Stunningly beautifulAwesome quality.Powerful divination tool
"Beautifully made, would recommend."
This book is essential for all humans to read! It breaks down everything you need to know to guide you on your spiritual path. This book was life changing for me in the most beautiful way!
"As a fellow holistic practitioner, it’s so helpful to have tools and resources to pass to clients new to the world of Ascension that mirror what I also teach. This is a fabulous, easy read to help the novice gain their bearings on what is happening, why and how to navigate with basic understandings, tools, and resources to move forward along the journey! Nice job, Kimberly!"
"I love this book!  It's an easy read, with so much helpful information.  This was the first time I found so many helpful lists on various topics, and that alone makes it a great resource.  But with all that is happening in the world right now, reading this book would make the journey much easier."
"I was greatly disappointed after reading this book. The author claims to be a channel of Master Jesus. and states that most of the information in the book came as channeled messages from him. However, the book is replete with inaccurate and misleading information. She should know that Jesus is known as Master Sananda on inner planes and they are not two distinct personalities. Further, she calls Jesus the boss of Christ consciousness. She should know that Jesus and Christ are two distinct personalities. The Christ was no other than Lord Maitreya who holds the position of Christ which is an office or title in the Spiritual Government of planet Earth.  During the last three years of his life, Master Jesus was overshadowed by Maitreya (the Christ).The author has absolutely no knowledge and understanding of karma and reincarnation. She states that karma is a lie and God does not judge anyone for one's actions. She further states that the concept of karma and reincarnation came from Hindu and Buddhist religions. She ought to recognize that laws of karma and reincarnation have nothing to do with any religion or philosophy. They are part of the laws of nature, such as the law of gravity and the laws of thermodynamics, though not yet fully understood by humanity at large.The law of karma was designed so that we could experience what we had done to others. It is the basic learning tool for the School of Earth. All thoughts, words, or deeds draw a return of identical energy. Good, warm, and loving thoughts, words, or deeds are repaid in kind. Positive attracts positive, and negative attracts negative. Karma and reincarnation go hand in hand. They are two sides of the same coin. Our karmic actions lead to rebirth for the resolution of karma. And a new incarnation eventuates the generation of new karma. Karma is energy that gets stored in our chakras from one lifetime to the next.The author further writes that as of 2012, the Karmic Board has been shut down and karma is not actually a thing anymore. The Karmic Board, also known as the Lords of karma, is a council of eight cosmic beings who are assigned the responsibility to dispense and adjudicate karma, mercy, and judgment on behalf of each soul on the Earth. The Lords of Karma are our intercessors, serving as intermediaries between people and their karma. All souls must pass through before the Karmic Board before and after each incarnation of the Earth, receiving their assignment and karmic allotment and review of their performance on its conclusion.I cannot recommend this book to anyone. For a comprehensive and reliable source of all pertinent information regarding ascension in this lifetime, the reader is referred to, The Complete Ascension Manual by Joshua David Stone, Ph.D."
I have been taking Mr David Wilcock’s classes. This book has summarized a lot of the material in these classes and puts ideas in a logical format. Ascension 101 is a great companion book and a great read. It has helped me understand and put in perspective the the path to my own future. The author has done a wonderful job explaining ascension without being bogged down in detail. Well worth the purchase. Thank you. I may be calling you soon.
I love this book! It explains all I’ve known about the great awakening for the past 3 years but also it has some really interesting eye openers! A must have guide for this ascension!
"This was a very open and well thought out introduction to many topics of who we are, what we are and how to get to where we need to go to step into our Divinity as co creators with our maker."
Great all-inclusive book on a simple path to achieve so much. Thank you for this!
I finished the book quicker than I expected. I was filled with some much information some that I was familiar with and also a bunch of new information. This was the first book I purchased as I am on my own spiritual journey and it was such a great beginner book. I will definitely be reading this book again. Thank you Kimberly for the work you put in 💗
Amazing book!!! It was very eye opening and answers all of life's biggest questions.  I let my friend borrow it and she read the first 50 pages and said she had the best day she's had in years.  Its all about a positive perspective and outlook in life.  All the love to you!
I’ve watched Kimberly’s on line work for a while now and know her to be an expert on Ascension. That’s why I ordered this book. It did not disappoint; giving a well-rounded “roadmap” to navigate our changing energies. The book covers a lot of ground & does not talk over your head. I find myself still going back to reference certain parts of it. Grateful to have this book.
"What a practical, no nonsense guide for those of us trying to gain understanding.  Well organized and a great reference to look back at or read again.  I bought the kindle version, but may have to get the physical version as well, just so I can make notes!  (I try not to clutter my space with physical books).  Thank you, Kimberly for this wonderful gift."
I really enjoyed reading this book. My energy and positivity was definitely higher while reading. And I found myself having a very meaningful meditation experience during my journey through the book.Lots of accurate diet and exercise information in the book as well. Always good for the overwhelmed omnivore.
Absolutely nothing new in this book. Was anticipating a learning how basic  but nothing but observation. Def better books out there. Am returning
"This book was helpful and resonates truth, common sense truth.  I gave this a 4-star because it doesn’t teach how to go within.  So much knowledge and yet despite all I have done, I’m still not there."
Well written book to help guide you and wake you up. Easy to follow.
A must have in order to navigate the ascension process. We'll written and an easy read.
"I am reading Kimberly's book for the 3rd time. Yes, I get something more from it every time. I feel this is the best book to explain the Ascension, how to raise your vibration, why we are here, etc...just so easy to understand. I wish I had a book like this 20 years ago. Highly recommend it."
"Ascension 101 book are great and very knowledgeable resource for higher vibration. It helped me a lots to get through out the journey and looking forward to ascension. Highly recommended this book! Thank you, Kimberly Palm."
Found this book after Kimberly Palm did an interview on YouTube. This book gives good information on ways to help you along the journey to becoming an overall better person and guides you to getting to 5D ascension.
This book held so much informative details. It was simple and easy-to-understand. Kim has put together a lot of major life questions and helped sort through the answers.
If people want to better the health and wellbeing you must read this book
"A really lovely book that can help to open yourself to the big awakening. Easy to read.Some of it sounds too much like a lecture, with instructions being repeated in different chapters.All over I enjoyed it very much and can highly recommend it."
Kimberly Palm is a very kind soul who really cares about peoples soul journey.
Very enlightening and informative and so relevant to what’s happening in this age of ascension. So much of what Kimberly shared in this book will resonate with you.  I keep it on my nightstand and refer back to it often.
"Not worth the reading, Waste of time"
ABSOLUTELY loved this book...the attention to detail and the delivery of how she delivered the message is effortless and easy to understand. HIGHLY RECCOMEND.
"is absolutely amazing, caring, positive life streams assisting in connecting with your higher self, a road map how to evolve, when divinity touches your heart, a break away from dark forces, a book that gives you many answers to what you have you been searching for. You feel understood. I recommend Evrybody to read this book. I love it, it has been very very helpful to my journey. I bought 5 in paper to give others, those in need, very powerful & with gratitude."
Wow well written eye opening thank you for your help with my journey 💗
"if you are wondering whether or not to get this deck, i say yes! go ahead and buy them. if you like this type of thing then you will be glad to get this deck. these are fun cards. they are inspiring. they are cute. they make you think positively. they are great gifts. i got a deck for a friend for a birthday present, and i got a deck for myself. they are well made and should last a very long time. they feel like quality. the cards are also kid-friendly in my opinion, at least i haven't read anything on them yet that i would not share with the kids i know. the cards are for adults though and teenagers. anyone that can grasp the concepts of self-esteem and talking to yourself in a positive and loving way. i think i will also eventually get some of the other decks this author has made. the price is nice too."
They came in a really nice box and have really cute images. They are also all well written and have great positive messages on each of them. I love to look at them and read one daily!
"I love these quirky cards. I work in a busy department in a hospital. I had these LESS THAN A WEEK when they mysteriously disappeared from by desk drawer at work. We enjoyed them so much, I didn't hesitate to order them again (waiting on second delivery now). These are great reminders for me and coworkers when we start the day. They also serve as a pick-me-up if someone is having a bad day."
"I wasn't sure about spending the money on these cards. However, they have been a great investment for my anxiety attacks! I put them in my ""Calm Box"" (a shoebox that I've painted with clouds) along with essential oils, photos of my cats, etc. I tend to feel a little awkward with the super Zen ""daily affirmations"" but these feel very genuine to use. They are nicely laminated so a good investment-I expect them to last many years."
"Buy these for your friend, your grandma, your sibling, YOURSELF! These Affirmators will light up your day and make you feel warm and fuzzy! I have yet to see someone draw one, read it, and not smile with delight. You will want to Instagram every single card because they are that good. I am gushing now and I think you get it, so just buy the cards already! :)"
"These are so fun to read and inspiring at the same time! My daughter, who is 11, looks forward to reading a new card every morning before school. A few of them do have cuss words but nothing offensive (in my book anyway). I think they build her confidence level in a positive way and I'm really glad I purchased them."
I love these cards! I worked direct care in kid's crisis mental heath and would use these to open up our first group. At one point I realized there were a couple censorable words on them but I just used them with teens after then. I keep them in my self-care drawer at my office job now and use them when I need a pick me up!
"I bought a few of these affirmators cards to gift to my friends for valentine's day. I bought the original, the love & relationship, and the work one. All of them were really cute. I would say my favorite is the work one as most of them are super relevant to me at the moment. The original one is classic; it is relevant to almost everyone. The love & relationship one was cute too but I would choose the other two before this one (I gift a few of these to friends who were in a relationship). I thought these were universal so I gave one of the classic ones to a friend who is a guy. However, it seems like it's more for women since the illustrations only include women. I wish there was more description on the seller page about this."
"Sturdy cards, matte finish.  Easy to shuffle.  I draw one a day for my daily focus.  Light-hearted encouragement.  Non-intimidating meditation, whimsical artwork for a good cheering up.  Yet, I feel you can take the thoughts on these cards as deeply as you wish to go.  IMO, Ms. Barrett's work succeeds in holding appeal for a spiritually/psychologically diverse audience.  The only critiques are: the box is open at both ends and the interior tends to easily slide out when you are least expecting it.  I put them in a pouch, box and cards, for this reason.  Otherwise it is very nice - sturdy with holographic print that sparkles in light.  One of the cards is printed off-center, front and back.  Other than that, I'm happy with this purchase."
"These are silly and fun affirmations!  I love that my older kids can enjoy them, but I think they would be also great for college kids and young women who are looking for a little pick-me-up in a fun way!"
"These are a slightly snarky yet still sincere version of affirmation cards. Fun drawings accompany the humorous writing. Good for older teens, young adults, and adults. (Cartoon drawings shouldn't be confused with these being for children.) Make a good gift for someone else or yourself."
"I love 💕 Affirmators. I got them to give out to all my caregivers (doctors, nurses, nurses aides, cafeteria workers, lab workers, etc) when I have surgery next week. I am looking forward to being able to say thank you in one small way.If they don’t want it for themselves, my plan is to ask them to take it and share it with someone in the hospital who needs a smile 😊."
"This is the perfect deck for a beginner. It’s also something fun to just have around, maybe on your coffee table in the living room. It’s the perfect deck for anyone to use. Sometimes the problem with decks is that the images don’t represent the text. I find that this deck does not have this problem. It’s always a pleasant and fun experience to use these cards."
I love these cards. The messages are perfect. The illustrations are freaking adorable. The snarkiness and humor is *chef's kiss*.I am an elder millennial who got kicked a lot during 2020 and these cards have helped keep me motivated and grounded. I make my friends draw cards when they are over and the deck always gives us what we need to hear.
"I bought three different decks for gifting! These are genius in the most lighthearted and magical way. Dropping grace with a comedic wisdom we ALL NEED! When you need to stop taking yourself or circumstances so seriously, whilst reading between the lines to get the lesson and move on, these cards come to the rescue. They are good for all ages. Bravo!!!"
"Great motivational language that's great for starting the day. I feel like they're trying too hard to be funny tho. Needs more focus on the words that matter and less on the humor...some humor is good, but I believe the cards can get a little too long winded on the ""funny"" stuff. I find myself repeating only the affirmative few words at the beginning of each card, and skipping the rest of the ""sorta funny only once, but now I never read it again"" parts."
"Such a cute deck.  I purchased it for a friend's birthday gift, and she loved it! Her husband drew the first card, which said he has the perfect partner. What's not to love there? It's turned out to be a great uplifter to 2 wonderful people who really needed a smile."
"I assumed that this was a package of greeting cards, and when I bought it, I wanted to send them to a few friends who were feeling down. I ended up just reading them the deck of cards that were included and that helped them a lot too! I even have used it for myself and saying the messages out loud can really start to help to change your mood :)"
"These cards never fail to make me smile or laugh. I've incorporated them into my daily ""self-care"" routine. As the included instruction card says, I spread them out, close my eyes, then pick one at random and let the universe guide me to whatever comical, uplifting message it has for me that day. Super cute. I would recommend them as a gift or just a treat to yourself! Some really great reminders in there :)"
Used it with my clients and they get a crack out of them-helps as an ice breaker at the start of group session. These cards are Segways into processing for my clients! Highly recommended if you want to chuckle!!
"This deck has a great concept of combining humor with positive affirmations. For me, it misses the mark with the sarcasm and slight cursing. It may work well for other folks, but the language is not what I use or what I'd use in my readings with clients. The card stock is very flimsy--not terrible, but wouldn't hold up with frequent use. I am returning these as they just do not resonate with my reading style."
"I love these cards! Everyday shuffle, select and read a card, then I place it on one of those cheap cell phone holders that holds the phone in a viewing position. I've had depressed days were the cards have changed my moods to something positive."
Not your typical affirmation cards. The cards are often silly and comforting versus overly sentimental and serious. Great for a boost of mental health without the hard hitting messages that can make your eyes roll. Can't recommend enough!
"Great way to start the day. Either alone or with family members, a quite mindful moment before starting a busy day is grounding. And a daily affirmation makes you aware of your thoughts and actions."
"If you enjoy the word ""adulting"", these cards are probably up your alley. I like that they're lighthearted, but I think there's a narrow age range that will dig them (maybe early 20s?). In my opinion this is not the kind of deck you'd return to over and over again."
These cards are really cute and have great positive messages. My gf is picking a card each morning and she loved the present. The drawings are very nice too. All in all its a great gift that's thoughtful and very well made
"These cards are funny and inspiring. I'm a mental health counselor and have been using them with clients and students, and they've been a hit. Took a while to get to me, in fact I had forgotten I ordered them. But when I finally got them, I'm completely happy with them."
This is a great way to do daily affirmations without having to come up with your own. Its always entertaining and helps me stay focused and positive at the beginning of every day.
Self-help and phoney positivity arent really my thing.  In fact I resent just a tad bit because depression isnt usually a choice.  I tend to get a little dark though so I bought these cards to get me out of my own head every day.  They are perfection.  They have adorable illustrations and little blurbs to say to yourself that act as wonderful grounding excersizes.  They are a bit cheeky and never feel corny.
"I love these. They’re so great when you feel like you need a little whimsical help achieving a mood shift without the serious self-helpy bs. These cards laugh at themselves, so they help you laugh at yourself! I also love pulling a card or two for a friend who’s having a hard time and texting them a photo of the card(s) - always appreciated!"
"Love the humor in these cards. Great for my young grandson who is introspective, super different, and also sarcastic. Good to help shake off the critics and nay sayers harping from up in the nosebleeds. The collective narrative of this oracle reminds us to laugh and shake it off - get back in the game and play. Folks in the cheap seats do not matter so much after all."
"Adorable and inspiring. I love the whimsical drawings and the semi-snarky blurbs. Fantastic gift for both the ""woo-woo"" types and those who make fun of ""woo-woo"" types. Also the cards and the box are high-quality and beautifully designed and printed."
Great concept! Item came in perfect condition. I love the cute illustrations! Each one is unique and is extremely uplifting when I'm feeling down. Highly recommend.
I love these! My daughters love picking a card to start the day. I do plan on searching for a second deck to keep it interesting and not so repetitive over time. Everything is 99% perfect. I noticed one card has a weird line fold type defect but it doesn’t take away from the use of the card. I haven’t looked at all the cards. I don’t want to read them all and ruin the mystery. I’d rather read them as they are pulled.
These are super cute and an awesome way to start your day! Will really brighten your mood and the cards are really adorable. So very happy with this purchase!
"These are such amazing cards. I really love them, although, the cardstock is a little on the thin and flimsy side... but, for the type of gentle ""kick in the butt"" energy this deck has, I'll get over that small inconvenience.You can see a full flip through of this deck on my YT channel"
These cards really are inspiring and hilarious at the same time! I use them every weekend for a pick me up to help relax and destress. Highly recommended for persons who want to maintain a positive attitude.
TOO CUTE! What a great way to get your mind thinking positively. My husband and I read one outloud to each other each morning. We get a good chuckle out of them. I’m definitely going to get more sets.
Got these as a gift for home and I bought another set for work! I brought these to work when I want some personal motivation. My colleagues and I love these!!
These are freaking funny annnnnd super cute. Highly recommend. Loved them so much I bought an extra deck to give as a gift.
"I stumbled upon these cards when searching for affirmation cards. First what caught me was the cover. I totally love the unicorn!! Then I began to read the cards. Not only do they impart a little wisdom for my day, but they are funny. I really like that they are not mushy affirmations. They are more realistic and down to earth. I highly recommend these cards! Makes a great gift, too!"
"These cards are fun, easy to use, and the perfect way to start your day! I pull one each morning as a way to set the tone for my day...sometimes my daughter likes to pull one too :) I give these as gifts ALL the time!"
"I work with college students so at the end of every meeting they draw one, and THEY LOVE IT! Somehow it's like they always draw the exact card they need. They are cute and funny and quirky - just right for students and young adults."
"I gave this as a gift to my girlfriend as she is starting her own business. Whenever she gets overwhelmed, we'll read a card and it'll help!"
"These are so great! I’ve struggled with my positive, affirmations. I’ve always thought they were sort of lame but these are so great! Super cute, funny and very positive! Ah I love these!"
These are super cute! I used them in my teen yoga class and the girls loved them. They are positive but also kind of funny.
"These are so fun! I love having them to share with teens and you g adults in therapy sessions. Good processing tool, demonstrates re-framing and perspective-taking skills, and can easily encourage reflection!"
"I won't lie, i thought these were more like postcards I could send to positively inspire my friends. These cards are more like inspiration tarot. I've kept my self discipline in check and not read through all of them at once. The box is small enough to keep in my purse and I have used it among my friends a couple times when we needed guidance in a fun way."
These are so fun and really do work if you let them. Positive affirmations are a great way to begin your day.
I love the thickness of the cards. The colors are fun and vibrant. We use these as stuffers when we ship out orders. Our customers love receiving them in their orders.
"These are hilarious,  especially easy to use if you get annoyed with affirmations... these make affirmations fun"
These cards are amazing! This is the second deck I have owned. My first ones were destroyed by a dog and I was devastated and immediately bought more. I bring them to work everyday and my friends and I pick a card. They are all positive and uncannily timely!
"I use these with the kids I work with and I love that there’s always a positive, funny message that they can relate to."
Bought one for my mom. She seems to like them. Bought a set for my wife. Don’t know whether she likes them or not?
I love these! It's a fun little thing to do at the start of my day. Every day I pick a card and find ways to apply it throughout that day. It's something to look forward to. Sometimes we need a pick me up to remind us why we're here and that there is a reason to keep going even when it all seems pointless. Oh and the illustrations are cute too.
"These are so helpful. They’re not typical “advice”-type sayings, but are realistic and really work on giving one some perspective throughout the day and making it a positive one."
These will make you chuckle. Cute graphics coupled with sage advice. A bit silly (sly with the message) but in a delightful way that reminds me to stop taking everything so seriously. I am giving these as gifts.
These cards are great. They have great affirmations but are a little snarky which makes you laugh. I read one every morning.
I love the look of this deck. The affirmation made me fill wonderful. Just beautiful.
I think these are great affirmation cards. I always recommend them to my clients.
Funny and amazing messages for everyday uplift. Love the design and text. Would recommend as a gift or for personal use.
This deck is amazing. A nice pick me up.  They came right on time. And I truly enjoy the lil jokes. They are warm and welcoming. Will be getting more.
"I have been wanting these cards since they featured in Lilly Singh's vlogs on YouTube.The cards are really nice, lovely quirky motivational messages, I like to begin my day by reading aloud a new card everyday.Happy with my purchase"
"Fun, witty and sweet; I bought these for a gift and will most likely end up buying them for myself as well. A great alternative to 'self-help' books. The affirmations are funny, heartwarming and are a great, quick pick me up once or twice a day."
Makes an excellent gift. I've bought these at least 3 times now (including one set for myself)
Really love these. Use them daily to stay positive and focused
"I put these in an Easter basket for my nephew, along with another Affirmators deck, and journal. He loves them! These are a great, quirky, modern way to remind ourselves of what's important."
Beautiful cards a bit thin but overall  I like the deck !
Goofy and relevant all at once.  I give to my clients - they love them.
I put these at my desk and read one every day. It's become a highlight for myself and my coworkers. They're fun and add a positive perspective to every day. The only critique I have is that there are only 50 cards. It would be great to have more.
Great piece for my coffee table. Friends enjoy reading these affirmations and I know I personally appreciate beginning each day with an affirmation. Not to mention the illustrations on the cards are creative and cute! Great value.
"These are fun, light-hearted, and ridiculous, yet also inspiring.  They make a person smile, which is a wonderful thing."
"Exactly what I ordered, girlfriend loves these."
"I love them!  Light-hearted, humorous, and yet really help me make some headway on having a positive outlook.  I look forward to a new one each day."
These cards are great! They are quirky with the right amount of humor while getting the point across. I bought these for myself and ended up buying two more for friends because I like them so much. They are the perfect pick me up when needed.
Excellent quality. Witty and enjoyable.
"Great way to stop for a minute and reflect. Also, to get to know friends better and share a personal moment.House rules:We draw one, read it out loud, then tell why this applies to you right now."
"My daughter was going through a challenging time and these cards really helped her. She loves them so much, she carries them around and shares them with others. They are inspiring and funny. I had to get my own set!"
"I absolutely LOVE these cards. Love their message, and love the humor instilled in them."
"Fast shipping, would buy again"
Bought one as a gift for a secret valentine at work. It was very well received. I bought another one for a friend's birthday and she loves them as well.
I bought these as a gift for my 7 year old daughter who has shown an interest in my Tarot cards. I love these cute affirmations and positive vibes this deck gives off.
Fun cards with helpful advice. Start the therapy sessions with some of my teen clients with these cards and process what’s on them
Gift for family member who needs some positive encouragement. I found a couple of the cards to be questionable and was glad I had looked through them before gifting
Nice cards nice package delivered in a timely manner
These cards are fun! We discovered them at a cabin we rented this summer. I just ordered a set with Christmas gifts in mind.
Bought these to send weekly for a year as a Christmas gift to a family member and it’s become a ritual we both love and look forward to. The sentiments and illustrations are both 100.
"These are amazing!  They're not your typical patronizingly positive generic affirmations.  I post my cards daily on Instagram and Facebook.  Several of my friends have purchased them due to that, and I've given two more sets as gifts.  In fact, I rec'd my original deck as a gift.  I can't recommend them enough."

   Oooh I Love shuffling them up an seeing what affirmation I pull for the day . Actually brought my coworkers in on the action an had em pull today . These are Gems ! Thank you #Mindful"
"Nice deck, good size cards, good general affirmations"
Absolutely love!! I took these to work and pick a new one daily and set it next to my computer. Throughout the day I’ll read and reflect. Great way to keep an optimistic outlook!
"Super cute, fun way to passively encourage a friend and coworker. We usually end up letting the whole office pick a card and everyone really enjoys the uplift."
Great Deck I use them for my YouTube channel
Funny messages that somehow convey truths with a dollop or more of much-needed humor...especially nowadays.
Uplifting and Fun! I love these and look forward to them everyday. They aren't lame and cheesy like a lot of fluffy affirmations. They are cute and funny and insightful
These are amazing!! They have really brightened my day and helped me to look on the bright side. The ever fail to make you smile and a little more mindful without the feeling of being preached to. Absolutely love them!
Love these cards
"I love these, good quality feel, great messages and I love them ❤️"
Great cards
These cards are awesome! Just enough “pick me up” without being cheesy or like a horoscope. The only thing I don’t like is I want MORE!!! I have to use self control to not read one every day.
These are cute and fun. I put them in a magnetic photo sleeve on my bathroom mirror. Just enough for one per week. . .stay motivated all year long!
Cute artwork with a good message. I bought a bunch as gifts and everyone loved them.
love it! great day to start my day with a new possibility.
These cards are amazing! Glad I follow the singer Jhene Aiko on Snapchat  Who uses the cards all the time so I looked into it because I wanted my own pack. These cards have helped me so much 😊 (Still helping)
These cards are awesome. Somehow able to be inspiring and thoughtful while also being hilarious.
These are light hearted fun affirmations... Its nice to read one per day. Reminds you to be nice to yourself.
"When I'm having a very stressful day, I will flip through a few of these cards. They are funny and do a trick for picking me up."
Cute cards!
Best affirmations EVER!!!!! They've changed my life and I found then thanks to Jhene Aiko (singer) and I've even had a few friends go and purchase their own affirmations cards! They're awesome to share with others!
"Fun, uplifting and pretty hilarious."
Great icebreaker. Magic cards because the messages seem to reach the right people
"I have purchased these cards before and I have to say the quality is a little different this time around. The cards are very flimsy and the box they come in does not stay shut. The inside part slides out as soon as you pick them up. I really enjoy these cards and thought about giving them away as gifts this year, but after receiving mine, I don't think they are in a condition to give away. Other wise they are great cards with amazing sayings! :)"
Bought these for my friend for her birthday.  Very fun.  Everyone wanted to draw a card and the cards fit so well.  Great humor but also some good serious affirmations mixed in.  Love.  May want them for myself...
Great way to start my morning!
Love this deck and its affirmations!This series is one of my favorites and I hope to collect them all eventually!My tarot readings are never boring and bring just some more clarity to my readings!
Perfect! Got one for me and as a gift
Bought these cars for my waiting room.  All my clients love them!
these cards are seriously great 👍
I returned these because they weren't quite what I thought. I'm sure they are perfectly good cards for the right person.
Absolutely love these :) I pick a card every weekI recommend these to anyone who needs a positivity affirmations with some humor
These resonate so well. Im amazed! They give me what i needed to hear at the moment and im happy to say theyve also helped people whom i read for. Beautiful Deck 🥰💕
She loves it.
In love with these affirmationsHelped getting me out of depression
I use these as an opener during therapy sessions and I find them really helpful. They're light hearted but uplifting and open a dialogue. Really glad I found these
Great set of affirmation cards for people like my daughter who needs the daily affirmations but is definitely not the wishy-washy type.  Only drawback is the print on the cards is a bit small.
Love these!
"These have been the best gift I’ve ever received! I love the cute artwork, daily affirmations are key to start your day off anyways to a better day in my opinion and the wit to these are hilarious. I can’t help but smile every time I pull a new card."
"These are the best. Great way to set intentions for the day. I draw one first thing in the morning. I take them to work, and my coworkers love to pick a card too. Positive start to my day!"
"If you need a pick me up that is quick and witty, these decks are really worth getting. Perfect gift to share with family and friends."
These are so cute and fun! I liked just reading them and the illustrations are great. My friend likes to use them more like tarot cards and picks one to set the tone for the day.
I bought these for all of my girlfriends and coworkers this Christmas and everyone loves them. Everyday I walk around the office and see one or two in desks (maybe this says something about our office environment...). I bought the work deck for myself as well and really enjoyed. Perfect amount of self help and snark/sass. I will keep buying these as gifts.
Love these
Super cute & perfect for my business!!! I love the positivity!!!
Well made.  Super cute and helpful

   I like this affirmation card, and use it on my daily basis"
Love these!! I plan to pass them out to my yoga students but anyone would appreciate these if you are looking for positive and uplifting affirmations in a humorous way! I'll be purchasing their other products.
"I bought this because my little sister has one and I really liked it, and I feel like I need more positivity in my life, now I want to buy all the different versions as well!"
as pictured
Awesome 👍
Sent these cards to a friend for her birthday and she loves them! She checks them so often and they really brighten her day! Great gift or something random to make your day better. :)
Great way to start your day and also look at one thing at a time in life. Recommend!
"These tried way too hard to be funny, and failed miserably.  Also, it seemed like they ran out of topics and so were grasping for more and repeating variations on a theme.  Not insightful.  I bought these as a gift but was too embarrassed to give them.  They went in the donation box."
"I love them so much, I bough another pack. I give a card as a gift inside my packages."
"Um I love these cards!!!  for the price they are amazing, I use them all the time!  Just a fun inspirational thought for the day!  A fun stocking stuffer, little extra gift to give to someone who likes fun different gifts!"
Hilarious and motivating. I recommend it highly.
Perfect item to give as a gift
"My kids and I lay these out on the table in the morning, we each pick one. Gets our day started off right. Thanks so much for creating these!"
They are both inspirational and humorous which is the perfect combo.
hilarious for my clients
Cute and I like them.
"I gave this to my roommate as a Christmas gift and she loved it. We both grab one every week and pay attention to the advice it provides, which is always insightful but funny at the same time. The illustrations are super cute."
These are funny and conversation promoting
"The only downside is that the edges bend easily other than that, great product!!! Have definitely changed my perspective for my everyday life"
I got 2 sets. One to use with my students at school (I am a teacher) and one for my daughter. My students are loving it. I have several with mental health issues and many others that are just teen going through high school stuff. Everyone can find at least one card that speaks to them.Highly recommend.
"These are thought provoking and extremely humorous. I was looking for some more and even went to the KnockKnock website, but no such luck. A good shuffle and a random pick each morning starts the day off well."
I love these and they were perfect for a niece in law. Not over the top gushy stuff. Just real and uplifting.
"The messages are beautiful and funny, love them!"
"I love reading an affirmation every day. I love these ones! The illustrations are cute, too. Cant wait to buy the other ones."
This deck is hilarious and the card stock is good.
"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these cards . . . they are fun and brighten my day.  Definitely helps with my anxiety . . . keeps me focused on the things that matter."
Absolutely love this deck!
"Love them! Adorable! Do wish they were designed a little smaller though- I think these would be perfect as the size of a standard deck of cards but these are a little bigger than that. Great quality, good humor."
Loved what these say!!!
Love these cards. I keep my favorite ones in my purse at all times.
My daughter use these affirmations cards as part of our nightly routine prior to going to sleep.  We get a good laugh and are able to talk about the lessons in the cards.  They are great!
"Purchased in hopes it would be a great way to get me into journaling. Though I have not started writing, it's a fun deck. Love the affirmations."
"I love these cards!  I keep them on my kitchen counter and make my teenage kids and all their friends that hang out pick cards daily from this deck.  They think they are funny and witty and slightly shocking, and I love that they are getting the positive messages and principles that I want to be teaching them."
Great product and price. Great for therapy.
I LOVE the affirmations and the advice that comes with it. They are not only inspiring but comical as well. Worth every penny.
"I absolutely adore this set of 50 - Affirmators cards!!!  I love it!  It is absolutely so fun!!!  I can not wait to read some more of the cards!  It was packaged really well, and it arrived quick!!!  It was a pleasure doing business with you!"
"This purchase was for a birthday of a friend.  I have enjoyed this deck of inspirational cards and have purchased many decks as presents.  They are full of delightful illustrations, wisdom, encouragement, but also humor......like it says on the box, ""Help yourself without all the self-helpyness""..."
i love these. my daughter and i use them all the time. we hand them out as happy cards to people all the time

I love these things!  It's nice to get some good-hearted advice delivered with a heavy dose of sarcasm.  I'm getting these for all my girlfriends!

These are FANTASTIC. Really a delightful thing to have around. Who doesn't love inspiration with a dose of humor and sass? YESSSS!
:)
"Funny, brightened my day. Not cheesy affirmations but relatable to life."
"Cute and not so gushy affirmations, box is a bit fiddly and cardstock isn't grand."
These are my go to gift when I want to make someone smile!
This is a fantastic desk item. SO funny and self-helpy!

These are great. I use them in my yoga classes and the students love them.

Love these and already giggling over my first card! Can't wait to buy additional decks.
"Great gift! Bought the other box of cards, too!  I smile a day keeps the junk at bay!"
Love the funny but inspiring messages.
Gave as a gift and they loved it. going to give them the journal and love version next time
they can answer whatever you ask
Boring child-like deck with the same kind of message on most of the cards. Regret not returning it on time.
"Multiple people have recommended me to the product, glad to say it didn’t disappoint."
Great messages. I appreciate the bit of humor.
Bought for a friend dealing with a difficult situation. She's sharing them with her kids and they enjoy drawing a card a day. I have my own deck and always a great way to start your day.
I'm a creative arts therapist and I bought  these with the Hope that it would be a good warm up in my group sessions but it surpassed my expectations and led the group in really meaningful discussions about themselves and who they hope to be. Love it!
I love these. So cute! I bought 5 decks for gifts for my best girlfriends because I thought each one of them NEED these!
These cards are hilarious and uplifting!! I have given them to a few friends as gifts. Everyone needs a daily affirmation!
"One of my favorite gifts I've received. Love to give it as a gift, too!"
🙁
These were super cute and a fun way to start the day. When you're down all you need to do is just pick up one of these cards and start thinking positive.
Purchase for granddaughter or Christmas. She enjoys pulling a card every morning before leaving for school.
I'm so glad I got these cards. They are such an uplifting addition to my healing resources!
Bought these as a gift for my sister that is into self-helpy stuff and she loves them!
These are hilarious and love em. I use them with my high school students to build self confidence.
These are great! The only reason I have them 4 stars is because they could be a bit more witty. The packaging is good quality.
These are great!  So funny and yet insightful.  We love them.
I bought these for a friend going through a difficult time. She loved them!
Very cool cards. We have these out in our office waiting room and our clients love it. Would be happy to keep buying more
My kids love reading these and so do I.
Yes. Love.  Buy them. Bought as a gift but wish someone would buy for me. Quirky and fun.
What a great idea.gave them out at a party and made everybody read them aloud. Good times
Pretty hilarious! I've been slipping them into cards I send to friends as a fun surprise.
Love these cards -- they are so much fun.
love them
Absolutely brilliant!!!!
Absolutely love these! I pick one at random everyday and it helps a lot with setting the mood for the day. They are funny and have nice pictures. Works great for those who suck at speaking positively of themselves.
My kids and I really enjoy our daily affirmations before work and school!
"These are hilarious! They're like cheery yet sarcastic oracle cards. Bought 2 packs as gifts, they were well received."
Best cards ever I love them
These make great gifts
Fun and whimsical!
"Nothing wrong with these cards at all. However, I wasn't expecting them to be as silly as they tend to read."
"Like them, good quick read, funny, good material."
So cute!
Therefore just what I wanted. Arrived pretty fast.
I use these cards at the beginning of each private yoga session. My clients love them. Very encouraging and silly
Great gifts
Gets me through my day...I absolutely love these.
"Colorful, admirable, truly an uplifting gift to myself!"
So I work in a call center all day and it can get very draining talking to people. These cards are perfect for the office because they are light hearted and teach you lessons that make you smile.
"These cards are not only sweet and charming (the artwork especially), but the sentiments are empowering."
"I love these cards.  They are well designed, super funny, and although I bought them to give to my clients, I am keeping this box to myself :)"
Funny and motivational.
These are awesome! A great spirit lifter on those not so great kind of days :)
A great gift for somebody needing advice or positivity in their life!! love the messages in these cards.
The cards are really cute but the execution and laminating process are terrible some of the cards in the deck are damaged. Very disappointed.
"Perfect for a teenager that needed a little extra daily boost in a ""cool"" delivery."
LOVE THESE!!! I use these for my daily Affirmations on FB and IG and the people love their messages!
"Recibí conforme! Cada persona que ha sacado una carta ha quedado sorprendido con sus consejos, usted se divertirá mucho."
I love love love these cards! They are the highlight of my day and are written so well and the illustrations are adorable.
I love this.  My sister gave them to me for Xmas.  They're the perfect blend of deep and humorous.  I like them so much I have bought several sets to give to others.
These are so fun! It gives you a little happiness boost in your day every time you read a card.
These cards are fantastic. Each card is different.
I really love these cards. They're not too woo woo and offer a dose of positivity every day.
It really helps to give you a sense of center
Stocking stuffer for my daughter...she loved it!
"enjoy these cards, from time to time, with a person here and there.  Fun."
Love these! Positive and cheeky.
These are so awesome and fun! Great way to start the day.
"What I liked most was it was suggested after purchasing ""The Universe Has Your Back"" Oracle Cards.What I liked least was its cold humor, not dry humor but cold! I am a collector of card decks and this is theworst deck I ever purchased! Don't waste your money.!"
"Awesome, fun, and right on for me each time I draw a card.  I love the whimsy these brings to a daily card draw!"
these cards are so much fun!
These cards are really fun to use and really brighten your day!
These really helped me when I needed a boost.
Love these!
Funny & uplifting
Love these cards. They are fun to read.
Very fun and cute cards
so much fun. beautiful art. inspirational affirmations.
Gave as a gift to a family member who loves quotes and little sayings.
These are so awesome - absolutely love them!  Great and cheeky messages!
Too cute and funny! A friend recommended this and it inspired me to be more creative :)
Came as described. Would recommend and purchase again.
Cute idea and concept.
Fun
I love starting my day with these cards!!
"Cute cards but half of them had this weird film on them, when you try to take it off it’s messes up the unicorn picture. Kind of disappointing."
Absolutely love these cards!! I add them to my packages as I give them to customers and they rock!
Cutest little thing! I brought it to my work and it has the quirkiest funniest uplifting sayings. I am so happy I bought it as it really does brighten up your day!
"Bough these for a friend, she loves them! Very positive and easy to apply to daily life."
Love these!
They are SOOO good and funny.
Use it every morning!
The cards were bent and the print was uneven so there were missing letters in the works
"I love these cards! Every morning, I shuffle the deck and draw one (or two) cards to get my day started... always gives me a new outlook on life."
Absolutely amazeballs! Worth the money for the giggles and life-affirming fun.
"It's simple and cute, I'm enjoying it so far."
it was a gift
These are hilariously awesome! I have some them hanging in my office!
"I love these cards, super fun!"
good cards
Super cute
excited to use these in my yoga classes!
These cards are wonderful.
Good
The affirmations start really genuine and then get very cartoony and out of this world. If you don't want something too serious it is a fun product with adorable animations. But if you are looking for affirmation cards that will stick with you and you can use to really change your mood I would look somewhere else.
Love using these with clients :)
Purchased this (I'm a mental health therapist working with kids) for my bonus/step kids (6&8) since I teach them affirmations.  They were written more for adults.  I will likely be able to use them as  they get older- but some cards were not as appropriate for kids.  Great for adults and teens though!
Love these!! Bought extras for friends and family!
Love it and it comes as described
"Affirmations can seem hokey and trite much of the time, but I do find some that are worth utilizing and Affirminators! is definitely a set of those.These cards offer just the right balance of positivity and snark, which always makes me smile when I read them."
LOVE THESE :)
Love these
The package came empty.
"Really fun, my inner child loves them.!The only thing I don't really like it's the black background. In my inner child's world unicorns pick more fun colours!"
Absolutely love it! It's worth every penny!
Love this! Fun daily reminders to stay awesome!
"Unfortunately these cards are absolutely no value for me. I found them slightly vulgar and shallow. Neither inspiration,nor entertainment. I am surprised that these cards are so popular. I am writing this review to maybe save somebody from unnecessary purchase."
"Everyone loves these! I have had clients go from crying, to smiling after pulling out a card and reading it. They're a great ""pick me up"" when needed. Really cute art too."
"I bought two of these as gifts. I thought they were cute, but neither of the people I bought them for seemed to be impressed, and I honestly dont think they have used them... I guess if you buy these, maybe get them for yourself because they seemed a little disappointed when I gave them to them. Oh well, I tried. I thought they were a good stocking stuffer."
Super fun card! Definitely will bring a smile to your face.
"These cards make me smile.  Well done, fun, thoughtful with quirky illustrations highlighted with equally insouciant wisdom. Great gift."
Got these for my egotisticle bigot step dad. He got pissed but my work has succeeded. Thank you.
"Really well written and thoughtful cards, with charming illustrations. Witty and make me smile all the time. Do recommend! My only slight complaint is the box the cards come in for storage, rather easily comes loose and all the cards can come out. But not a big deal."
These are adorable and inspiring!
great cards
Awesome find! Love these. My best friend took my first deck so I had to order a new one!
I LOVE these cards!!!
so fun! kids and adults will love this.
I am very disappointed with these cards.  I have the Power Thought cards by Louise Hay.  I was hoping for something similar that younger people could relate to.  These cards are not it.  I showed them to two friends and neither liked them.  The directions for using these cards left one friend thinking they were similar to Tarot cards and would not make an appropriate gift. These cards will be going in the donation box.
Funny and just what you need to start the day
These are so cute and make me look forward to the day ahead of me.
This is ok for the price. Nothing really special. Just ok.
"Got them for my teenage g-daughter. Thought they would be good. Don't know if she is using them, but was anice ser"
"Sub-par printing quality. Only 40 of the cute affirmation cards, plus 10 ""bonus"" cards. They are really cute for the price, but you might look cheap if you try to give them as a gift."
"It's a deck of cards.  They're supposed to be funny I guess?  Some are okay and some miss the mark.  Kinda cute though.  But I got these for my daughter who is 8. I thought it'd be a tool we could use to keep a positive attitude going.  But some of the cards have questionable and, in my opinion, really unnecessary wording.  Use words like 'dammit', 'a-hole', calling people 'asses' & something like kicking guilt 'in the nuts'.  So whatever, I mean it's not terrible?  But there's a frickin unicorn on the box & cartoon animals on every card. ...  Why would they waste a great opportunity to have young kids also benefit from a great idea like affirmation cards.  Now I probably won't let her read all of them.  I don't know.  Affirmations are meant to be repeated over and over, and I'm not gonna have her use garbage language as part of a way to help her stay positive when she's down.  The cards are fine.  It just kind of disappointed me."
"These were fun the first time those of us here sat down and picked (and read) cards, but they're not actually useful or remarkably clever.  These would make a great gift because they're fun, but now I have a deck of ""affirmators"" I'll probably never open again."
not bad really
i got the card and it wasnt what i expected i read a few cards didnt find it helpful it didnt make any sense i would like to return it and get my money back but the process seems tedious so i will keep them hopefully they will come in handy one day
I ordered this for a family member. It is a great idea but it wasn't what I was looking for. I issued a return request and they said they would return $9 of the $14 I originally spent. Once they receieved it through Amazon locker they gave me back $1.
Funny and sweet affirmations
"Seriously the best thing ever. I LOVE these cards. Each one is unique and has its own hilarious, charming and/or heart warming description. It's also ridiculously spot on. Call it what you will but every time I (or a friend) draw a card, it is directly linked to something I am going through currently. It's AWESOME!!  It's always extremely uplifting, even on the toughest of days. I would highly recommend this and definitely have to a lot of friends!!"
Picked up a set of these at the gift shop at work and now everyone comes by to get thei daily Affirmator!Here are some of the cards I have drawn.
"I bought a set of these for my team at work during a particularly dark time in our project lifecycle. I slowly began introducing them to my team, inviting them to come into my office once a day to get their ""fortune"" or their ""mantra"" for the day. They were an instant hit; they've become so popular and loved! I'm about to switch companies, but I'm leaving the team the Affirmator cards. They are so excited and grateful. It's a little bit of happiness for us every morning. :) I'm going to buy a new set for my new place of employment.Update: My new work place loves it as well. I really want an expansion or companion pack! Please make more of these. At this point, we feel like we are drawing the same cards over and over. We love them, but we want more!"
"Had a relative recently in treatment for depression, they practiced affirmations, but they and the others there didn't really like them much.  Lo and behold, I managed to stumble across this by accident, unknown to me their struggles with affirmations that didn't really speak to them.  But when I saw this (when looking for something absolutely unrelated), it screamed to me that I must purchase!  Blind luck!  They love it!  5 unicorn horns up!"
"I didn’t buy these on Amazon. I actually received them from a friend. But I love these cards so much I was compelled to write a review! I pull one every morning and they always seem to tell me just what I need to hear. It feels like a little encouragement from the universe. They’re colorful, silly, and poignant. I’m prone to depression and they have really helped me stay positive and motivated on days I’d rather just stay in bed."
I adore these cards! This is actually my second set. It has become my go to item for gift because everyone needs a little extra happy in there life. The box and cards are high quality. Vivid colors. Adorable pictures and bright/funny affirmation to get you through your day. Definitely will be buying again as gifts.
"I'm a pretty practical person so hadn't played around much with affirmations until a colleague sent me these cards as a gift. They make affirmation work more accessible with humor and sharp wit, and always make me think a bit too. Highly recommend them!"
"Seriously, the BEST gift I have EVER received! Each one of these cards is like receiving a hug from a unicorn. They manage to balance profound insight and wisdom inside these HILARIOUS little diddys. I took them to work and everybody was like, ""OMG I NEED THESE!"" What a fun way to spread the love."
"This is such a go-to gift for me (I also keep a stack at my desk at work). These cards are inspiring without the cheesiness, make me laugh every time, and believe it or no, helped me get through a bit of a tough year. I want to be friends with the writer! Get 'em."
"These are awesome and make an amazing gift!  I bought a set for myself to see how they are.  Witty, inspiring and well made!"
"My friend got me these cause she knew I was having trouble staying motivated and mentally sane in school. They are seriously the best. They give me just the umph I need to work my butt off and stay positive. They are definitely magic too, so that's a plus."
"If you're not into ""cards"" try these anyway! They are funny, entertaining, and a silly way to start the day. Originally when my sister gave these to me last year I was like ""wut?"" but I find them genuinely ha ha funny and I'm ordering sets for friends."
"I just love love love these cards! they are silly and witty and surprisingly intuitive. i wish there were a million more decks like this one. They dont follow the typical format of divinity cards but in my mind they are a must have for anyone who does intuitive work, but doesnt want to fall in the trap of taking themselves too seriously. life is a game and these are too!"
Love the cute little daily affirmations! Gifted one to both of my daughters too so they can start their day off positive
These cards are delightful!  Nicely packaged in a box to store.  My daughter loves them.
Powerful  and easy to use cards! Love them!!!
"Every day i choose a new card and put them in my fiance's lunch tote, she is slowly collecting them (from me lol). She looks forward to reading ""her new card"" every day when she eats her sandwitch. I would recommend these to anyone."
"Really unique idea! Love the artwork and messages, I think they will be great for my therapy clients. Only complaint is the box is loose, the cards come in a drawer that a box goes over but there is no top or bottoms part to keep them secured, so the cards slip through the box too easily. It would be too easy to spill the cards every time I transport. Thinking about putting tape on one side to keep them more secure in the box. Very small complaint but worth noting. Overall love the cards just not the box."
"These cards are everything you want and more. Uplifting, funny, smart, and beautiful. If you don't have these in your life....you're doing it wrong. They've made me smile and brought me closer to my friends. Honestly, you need to have them in your life or better yet, buy a whole bunch to share the love."
"Super cute art, bought it for a friend who loved it."
a fun way to build your affirmations
So adorable and sweet. Will definitely buy the other sets of cards. Arrived within a few days too!
"I love these cards. I pick a random card once a day, and it usually tells me exactly what I need to hear that day. I try to keep it in mind all day long, and it helps me to stay more positive. Very well made, cute and funny. I am planning to get some as gifts for my friends."
She says they're cheesy but in a good way lol she likes them and enjoys reading a new card for herself each day.
So fun and different. Not super woo woo. Great as gifts!
"I LOVE these cards! They are fun and funny while giving you a sincere, positive outlook on life and a way to deal with the day to day stresses.  I feel they are great for all ages.  I use them everyday.  I find they help keep me centered. I also gave them to my 12 year old niece and she said they were so helpful to her--reminding her that she is beautiful and that she can make her life as wonderful as she wants to. It's all in the power of perspective.  My 16 year old nephew loved them too. So there ya go!"
I received these as a Christmas present and I love them!  They make me laugh and give me something to focus on for the day.
It helps a lot
Bought these cards for my sister's birthday and she loved them. She said she reads one each morning and it helps her stay centered. She also loved the cute illustrations because they made her laugh and were on point. Definitely will buy these cards for myself.
"Makes an awesome gift. So far, I’ve given sets to my employees and BFFs. They are cute and funny, but not overly self-helpy. ❤️ Perfect gift for the fabulous folks in your life!"
"Just got these and immediately started to use them. I think they're great. They're gun and positive and adds just that to your day. I ordered them as belated ""Galentine's"" gifts for my mom and sisters to! I definitely recommend!"
Bought as a gift and it was very well received. I can't ask for more.
"arrived on time, in terrific condition.  These are very fun and supported by bona fide psychological help."
Love these for daily positive reminders.
Great gifts
Use these daily as a pick me up.
Daughter loves them
"These cards are silly as they try to make it funny but its not . Just not the right kind of affirmations I am looking for. Also, some of the cards seem damaged."
these are great. get them.
I pick a card every morning in work when my computer is booting up.  It is amazing how you sometimes get just the message you need that day.  Last week I pulled the card about not taking things personally because you don’t know what is going on with a person who is unkind to you.  I then went to a meeting (which is usually very civil) and someone was very sharp and unpleasant to me.  Instead of being annoyed I remembered that her issues are nothing to do with me. :)
"I decided to try these cards as part of my toolkit to help with anxiety and depression.I loved them so much that within days I had purchased everything in the Affirmators range.The cards are cheerful, fun and practical. It is easy to relate to, and apply, the messages. I draw a card from this, and the other Affirmators decks, in the morning to contemplate during the day. It really has been a great help and comfort."
"I just bought these cards for myself as a positive message before I start my day. They arrived early which was a nice surprise and came in a good quality, well illustrated box as described/ shown. The cards are bigger than I expected but this is not a problem and makes them easier to read. Unfortunately when I shuffled the cards (as instructed) for the first time, some of the backing paper crumbled off of the corners of the cards. since the cards were for myself I am not bothered by it because the message on the front is perfectly intact. most of the cards are perfect so I don't think it is a common problem. Overall I am pleased with the cards and the messages inside are very nice."
"Sweet idea - affirmation cards that aren't too cheesy, and have cute animal type designs on them. One thing I ddi notice is that there were odd design flaws, like the box had a mark on it, some of the cards were unevenly cut. Nothing I couldn't fix myself but something to bear in mind.  Still love these though they are quite different to any other positive cards I have."
I adore these little cards! i have many Oracle cards... and these are such a contribution... they take the seriousness out of affirmations whilst gifting great insights in a comical way... I always feel lifted when I choose a morning card and they often make me giggle. I would say they are a great gift for a child and us adults that need reminding to not take life so seriously 😂
"I use these in my team at work and everybody loves them. Some take them more serious then others, either way it's always good honest advice."
Hilariously uplifting.  They also somehow magically fit the mood whenever I pick a card at random.  It always has just the thing to pick me up:)
"Affirmations , however felt overpriced and a bit child like style , amarican references which arnt relevant in UK"
"Love these cards - clever design, great content, and practical tips and tools to improve your life in light-hearted but science-driven way - highly recommend."
"I love these, very nice quality, not too ""self-helpy"" and usually pretty funny.2 Cards were damaged in the pack but it was a hassle free return and replacement sent out."
"got them for a friend during exam season - great to improve their mood, they often send me pictures of the card they got that day and it's just really nice and a useful gift overall"
"Love these cards. Come in a hard box. Quirky, light hearted, humorous & uplifting. None of your cheesy quotes.  Looking forward to reading these daily. Bought for myself but would make a great gift for others."
I am getting really addicted to these cards. So positive so empowering.
"I love these, I got them for a friend who needed a little lift. He's not the self help/mindfulness type so these little cards were absolutely perfect. Funny, insightful and not in the slightest bit 'waffley'. Absolutely perfect and there's nothing similar out there that I could find, I've recommended them to everyone! Would love to see more similar products."
"Great affirmation cards - positive, funny and inspiring without being twee. Makes a lovely gift."
It Has good affirmations. But I find the jokes at the end of each card a bit tedious.
Adorable and quirky cards that makes sure your day starts on a positive note! Nothing negative to be found but sound tidbits if great advice to stay positive and see the bright side of situations
Great cards with a sense of humour
"These are awesome and, as promised deal with self help in a matter of fact ‘remember to love yourself ‘ way. Money well spent, I’m looking forward to seeing what else they make."
Lovely cards
😄 these are really nice cards
"This pack really allows you to get a comical gentle reminder of what matters in life, it has helped me to clear my mind and focus on what i want to achieve mind, body and spirit."
Includes some really sweet ones. Some with practical suggestions to treat yourself nicely. Always makes me smile - done in a very lighthearted way. Would definately say it's worth it and makes a lovely gift
"How fun are these affirmation cards? The illustrations and messages are fun, humourous and insightful :) I have been struggling with depression and anxiety and was searching for something to help me with personal development and positive thinking. Most cards I looked at were only a few words or very vague, I really like how detailed and specific these cards are and that most give me a smile or giggle and arent too serious! 50 cards means less repitition in affirmations chosen! I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is interested in affirmation cards or to those who are looking for some guidance in their life and enjoy the spontaneity and belief that the universe gives you the messages you need when you need them!"
I cannot recommend those cards enough. They will bring smile to your face. They will let you rethink your own thoughts in more positive ways. I am really pleased with the purchase.
Bought as a gift for a friend and he loved it! Not your usual affirmation cards : helpful without being too serious
"I love the cards, my only complaint would be the design of the box as if you hold it upright they all fall out and end up all over the floor!"
I really like the cards. They have helped me a lot.
Great little everyday cards to fill your day with that little extra mindfulness
A great gift idea! My friend loved it!
Best affirmation cards ever! They’re funny as well.
bought this as a gift. cute box and made well.
Great item
Really good and funny cards
Love it
These cards arrived promptly and were so good I've already ordered (and received) a second batch.
What a lovely set of cards!! Shares positivity and smiles!! Thank you!
"I bought these as a gift for my mom who has had self-esteem issues since before her teenage years and lives with mental health illnesses. She is medicated, but she has some toxic thought patterns that I wanted to help her to reframe. I don't know whether there will be any long-term benefits, but she loved them when she opened the gift and keeps them with her morning things in her bathroom with the intention of reading one daily. The humorous tone helps to make them enjoyable to read. I even want to read them when I visit! Great gift for anyone who struggles with self-esteem and prioritizing themselves."
"A breath of fresh air, affirmations and humour"
So relevant and funny. Lovely gift
This helped me look forward to something everyday. Great little cards to motivate you and get you thinking.
Above my expectations
"I keep these on my desk and pull a new one every day. They make me laugh and give me a good start to the day. Usually plant a helpful thought to stay with me. I have hung up my favourite ones at my desk to keep as constant reminders. They are all very applicable to life but some will resonate more with you. They also make a great gift in a pinch or stocking stuffer. I have a few boxes on hand lol for when you need an emergency gift. I feel like everyone would like them.Update: I went to a music fest in 2019 and they had every person who attended pick a random affirmator upon entering. I was so excited I was like ""I have these at home!"" The guy was like, ""cool well you can have one here too!"" and I picked one and it said ""courage"". Very applicable because I was attending the three day music fest by myself and I'm a shy introvert but I love people. I wanted to meet others and make friends, maybe drink with some cool people at their campsite. I definitely needed me some courage!! I had a great time btw."
Great ! Basically brand new
Bought this for my 8year old HSP daughter. She's been bullied a lot since she started school in JK until recently. This has helped her to think more positively and set good intentions for the day!
"I like the idea but cards always sticking to one another. I like the cartoons it helps you to keep your affirmations in mind. I think a little smaller card may help a lot I have many other affirmations decks they don’t stick together and smaller in size. One side is beautiful caricature with affirmations which is the front side and another side is elaborating the affirmations. Which I feel more good and practical.I am not saying, it’s bad at all it’s awesome but lacking in size and sticking together. It needs to be improve."
"These cards are beautiful and such good quality. You pick a card for the day that has a little mantra to keep you in a positive state of mind. The pictures are gorgeous, and there is a unicorn on the cover so I HAD to have it haha. I gave it to my friend for Christmas. If you know anyone into wellness, yoga, meditation, this is great gift for them. I think I'm going to get a pack for myself!"
"I bought these affirmation cards for someone who was really trying to practice positive self-talk, and they worked like a charm.  An attractive and colorful set of cards that are great for anyone with a sense of humor who needs a dose of daily/weekly/however-long optimism in short bursts.  And honestly, the cards were so good sometimes they were just great fun to read together to enjoy some of the great energy and wisdom they exude.  I would highly recommend these to anyone who needs a laugh, a smile, or a card-shaped hug."
"I really do like this deck. The card stock is a little thin, but it holds up. It's beautifully coloured and has really cute drawings on it.Plus the messages are so hard hitting, but told in a loving and hilarious way. Just like the tough love we would get from a close friend.The only major issue I have with this deck is the slide out box. I really don't like it. The box keeps opening and the cards slide out. I recommend that you get a pouch for this one."
I love these cards. I know they’re not for work but I brought them in and everyone loves them. We like to pull one once a week.
"The moment I opened the box and read the first card, I knew this card would do wonders for me. They are so straight forward and very relatable. Does not have that cheesy self-help feel to it which I love!"
"It’s a great habit to use these cards, really.But Um! Every card wasn’t  really that helpful then again it’s a choice right! Can feel a bit vague and random at times.I would recommend Inhale-Exhale cards by Chasinglimes on Etsy."
"These cards are so cute, funny and really lovely without being, as they say, “too self helpy”. Had them in my wish list for a long time and finally got them. I’m so happy I did. We all need a little help to stay positive, and during a pandemic more si than ever."
"Esse livrinho é uma graça, leitura para pequenas inspirações diárias, com senso de humor delicioso e ilustrações divertidas.Veio lacrado e bem embalado.Demorou um pouco mais do que o prazo previsto pra chegar, mas provavelmente por ser entrega internacional e precisar atender todas às novas condições de funcionamento das entregas e transportes durante a pandemia de Covid-19."
"I really love crows, so I had to have this as soon as I saw it.The art style is really interesting.  A sort of out of focus blurriness coupled with the kind of layering effect you usually only see in computer graphic images, but more integrated by the loose, painterly way everything is made.  Over all it gives the deck a sort of Picasso disjointedness with an atmosphere like a Salvadore Dali painting that just WORKS.  There aren't any fine details - that blurriness - so the cards are actually best viewed from afar, lending to readings of a spread as a whole instead of card by card.The cards are more square and feel bigger than they are if that makes sense.  I love the parchment-y background.  Only the Major Arcana, Courts and Aces have the card names on them - the numbered cards in the suits just have roman numerals."
"I absolutely adore crows and was so excited when these came out...until I received them. The cards are too big for tarot. They lean more towards Oracle size. I don’t like that they have borders or that the borders are different colors. I don’t like that there is scroll work and what the card is only on some and then the rest just have Roman numerals. It makes the deck very choppy and not cohesive looking. It’s distracting for the reader. The art while beautiful just doesn’t speak for what the meaning of the cards are. I am a seasoned reader and luckily I know what each card stands for. A new/less experienced reader may have some difficulty with this deck. Yes there is a book to learn, but artwork on the card should tell a story easily depicting the cards meaning."
"I have a deep connection with Crows, and Ravens, so of course I had to order this deck!The artwork is magnificent and really intrigues me. I follow Crow Tarot deck on YouTube and Facebook which has given me great insights about the symbolism tucked into the deck. It basically follows RWS format. Could be used by a beginner Tarot reader.This is a bold, honest deck and my readings have been extremely accurate with the Crow Tarot deck.  The small 86 page booklet is better than the LWB that usually comes with a deck. It has one spread, the Crow spread. I would love for a guidebook to come out for the deck. I absolutely love working with this deck!"
"LOVE this tarot deck. Have been reading cards for thirty or so years, but have always settled on non-traditional presentations because the RWCS symbology can be fairly fraught for a feminist practitioner. My go-to deck has long been the Oshi, and I still find it uncannily accurate and perceptive. But this deck finally gives me the traditional RWCS format without the all-too-binary gender normativity (not to mention the complete lack of any other kind of diversity). Because, you know, crows. Gorgeous artwork in a lovely palette. And as a devotee to the Morrígan, the imagery is spot on. Very pleased."
"My wife bought these. The Tarot comes in a a single, hard cardboard box that fits the cards snugly along with the interpretation book which is the same size as the cards. The book being able to fit in the box is great for traveling or carry around. The font in the book isn't too small and easy to read.The cards themselves, in surprising contrast, are a bit too big for for my wife! At 3.25"" x 5"" They are quite a bit unwieldy and hard to shuffle. In bigger hands, the do slide together well and would shuffle smoothly. They have a nice matte finish and the art is just plain awesome."
I’ve been following this deck for awhile and was upset as I could not purchase it prior to its mass production! Beautiful!  I was thrilled when I ordered this. The artwork is beautiful but I really have to say the card stock is cheap and does not do the deck itself justice. Very disappointed! I give it a 3 because of the design and so far it seems easy to connect to! MJ US Games really did your deck no justice!
"This deck is gorgeous and of high quality. I love tarot, but am hesitant to purchase numerous decks because I want each to be truly special. This one definitely is."

   I suggest wash shuffling this deck and hand over hand. The card stock on my deck was nice and thick. I thumbed through the guidebook a little but didn't really sit and read it. It seems a decent guidebook, I would suggest for those wanting a good guidebook to actually check out some of the Fools Dog Tarot card apps or the Labyrinthos one which is really awesome and goes beyond Tarot. Some of the Tarot card apps have good guidance in them even if they don't belong to your particular decks.For size comparison I have put these cards with some of my others. Crow Tarot, RWS, Hanson Roberts, and Gypsy WItch Fortune Telling cards.What I like:Mine have a nice card stockSturdy box for storing the cardsLWB is a small book not a few pages stapled togetherEvery card has crows no people at allIt's a gender fluid deck in my opinionThis deck is neutral in that there's no age or race biasesWhat I don't particular like but is okay:The court cards especially the Queens and Kings is meh. Not a fan of the Queen and King of Wands. Both feature lions which is great but it look like the same image file was used and they just added an extra lion to one.The smell. My deck just had a stinky what I am guessing is ink ....maybe...it smells. It's not my first ""stinky"" deck. I just let them air out, add stronger smelling herbs to sit in an organza bag with them....star anise, clove, that sort of thing. I had a challenge on a few of the cards seeing what the number was, dark background, dark ink over it, so that was not something that I liked but I could handle.For shuffling:May be  challenge for smaller hands or less agile hands. As mentioned before, wash shuffle or hand over hand if you canFor energy:I felt a positive energy with this deckFor how it reads:It reads very directly, not afraid to shake things up a bit, it has an it's for the better sort of feelAddressing some of the negative points of other people who have reviewed this deck:Some reviews did mention the size being comparable to an oracle size and I would agree with thatThe cards being distracting because of inconsistent scroll work, card colors. Personally I noticed but it didn't hold my focus.The smell but that can be worked withMy take on whether this is suitable for a beginner or not:No. I don't think this is a good first deck. I feel like it lacks some of the key symbolism the RWS gives you. Yes it is based off of the RWS style but that doesn't mean that it contains all of the visual cues the RWS has.Yes, for an intermediate to advance Reader.Regardless of whether you're a by the book Reader, an intuitive Reader, or a combination of the two you need to have a good connection to the cards. I have a family love for crows so this deck really was an instant hit for me. I have included a flip through video so you can get some idea of whether this is a deck for you or not."
"The artwork and imagry on these decks is STUNNING. The cards each tell their own story and the artist has depicted it perfectly, making them easy to read and memorize. There are crows on every card and they also appear with other animals, such as wolves and horses. The deck is printed on a nice cardstock for a deck that is going to last you a lifetime if cared for. There is a little book included as well to help you interpret the cards. The interpretationsfollow the Rider/Waite format, and the author has not ""softened the meanings"". The cards are a nice size and shuffle well either overhand or bridge style. The box is also very nice and serves as a lovely home for your deck when not in use. You will love this Tarot Deck."
"Beautiful cards.  The artwork is delightful and the cardstock is very thick and sturdy.Some have complained about the ""disjointed"" art with different colored borders and some cards using numerals while others have words.  To me, the colors fit with the artwork, and the words vs numerals makes sense. I don't find it disjointed or distracting, at all.The cards aren't small, this is true.  Read the full description, and you will know this. The info isn't hidden nor is it misrepresented in any way.I have very small hands, and the cards are bulky, but not unusable. They are sturdy but after many, many days of use they have softened a bit - not to say they are bent or dog eared or worn and frayed.  They are very sturdy, but the feel has become ""friendly"".  Or maybe my hands have just become accustomed to the size. Whatever, they have become very comfortable. No, I can't shuffle them like a deck of playing cards, but I don't do that with smaller sized decks anyway.  I like to handle the cards as I slowly shift and shuffle and cut the deck into itself from hand to hand while focusing my thoughts. Card deck shuffling is impersonal and mechanical.  Therefore,  to me, the size is not a drawback.  Do make sure you clear a good space on your altar for the spread. This is where the larger size might be a hindrance depending on the amount of room you have to work.The box is thick and holds up to repeated removal and replacing of cards.  The instructional book is well written and will be easy to understand for beginners who are drawn to this deck."
"I haven't gotten any new decks in quite a while. As many of you probably know, collecting Tarot decks can become a hobby in itself.  An a tempting one at that, since their comparatively small size means more can take up less space than some things.  But in the end, I decided it wasn't doing justice to the decks or their talented creators to have them just sitting around not getting exercised, not fulfilling their true purpose of being working decks!  And even being the corvid fan that I am, I didn't jump on this deck right away like I wanted to.  I had a great Tarot experience with another reader though, that jump started my Tarot enthusiasm all over again, and I knew I was going to get to another, more intuitive level with this deck. Who better than the crows and ravens to accompany one to those liminal places where the worlds overlap?  And even though so far I am just wading, not diving, I can tell this will be one to take me and teach me new places, new ways.  A superb job, and my  thanks to the talent and vision of MJ Cullinane.  *** Addendum April 21, 2020 ***  I am finding this deck to be imaginatively, spiritually, and mythically alive for me.  It speaks beyond  book descriptions of meanings.  Again, my gratitude to an artist of depth._"
"I almost didn’t buy this deck because the price seemed suspiciously low…and a couple of negative reviews put me off. Glad I didn’t listen because they arrived today and I’m very pleased. They’re just beautiful. I was afraid they might be a bit gaudy—I’m not a huge fan of bright-bright colored tarot cards—but the colors are actually more subtle than displayed on the ad, yet still very rich and textured. Instead of going into a big detailed description, however, I feel like I should address  complaints from the very few negative reviews.1. “They’re too big”.You know, I get that. Really. I have ridiculously small hands and I struggle to shuffle cards this size.  But unless you have laser-sharp vision, it’s easy to miss important symbols on playing card size decks. It takes a little while, but even people with size 4 ring size fingered hands can learn to shuffle the larger sizes. If I can with my stupid baby hands, then most people shouldn’t have a problem.2. “Cheap card stock”.Huh. Not sure I even understand that one and I loathe cheap card stock. I’ve pretty much stopped even bothering with Lo Scarabeo’s cards because it feels almost blasphemous to print beautiful images on flimsy card stock. That alone almost kept me from buying the Crow Tarot. But I disagree. Is it the best quality? No. I have several decks that are sturdier…and I also have a few decks that I never use because they *are* flimsy. Also, since these cards are oversized, it actually helps that it’s not super-stiff. The Murder of Crows deck are the same size but it’s printed on thicker card stock and those are hard to shuffle (still a great darker minimalist deck though!).3. “The interpretation of this one particular card is different that my 3000 other decks! It’s a FRAUD!!”Okay. I’m trolling a bit lol. But seriously—I take it for granted that every creator is going to have a slightly different spin on interpretations and/or how to convey that interpretation. And I’m pretty tough on basic symbolism, which is why I don’t care for oracle cards—I like the ease of traditional RWS symbology. And it’s also true that I have a gorgeous deck that I never used because the creator was doing handstands to try to get the images of the artist to match and either failing or just making up their own meanings. But that just isn’t the case here. I think that MJ Cullinane has done a masterful job incorporating the crow theme to basic RWS interpretation. Would I recommend it for a complete beginner? No. But I would heartily recommend it to an advanced-beginner who loves crows, unlike the far more challenging Murder of Crows.4. *various complaints about the 88 page guide*I can’t help but feel like some of these people haven’t bought many tarot decks because if so, they’d realize that you usually get a crap white paper leaflet of terse, vague interpretations in tiny print. The guide book included with the Crow Tarot is actually pretty damn nice. It is an actual small book, with a nice cover and quite a bit of info. If anything, this guide surpasses most decks. And since MJ also sells a guide book for $30+, it’s pretty generous.And—dude—it’s $16. It’s a great deal for a very nice tarot deck. No regrets here."
"I LOVE CROWS...and Ravens and Starlings and birds in general, however this deck caught my eye, first because of the artwork.  Each card beautifully illustrates and represents quite accurately, both the Major and Minor Arcana archetypes.  The author of the deck also concisely describes the energy of each card by using a well-balanced blend of traditional Tarot definitions along with a present-day update of verbiage.  I've done several readings with them and each reading was quite concise in response to the query.  I also am a believer in being grounded and centered during a reading, no matter what deck one chooses to use.  However, having said that, THIS deck is a WONDERFUL addition to my collection and truly has been a ""go to"" deck for some deeper queries."
"The Crow Tarot just arrived today! I am so excited! The artwork is creative and amazing! It's the perfect size, too! The cards fit perfectly in my hands and don't stick to one another. My oracle cards are significantly larger comparatively. I am not a tarot newbie. The imagery speaks to me and is easy to interpret.I have had crows/ravens in my life since I was a toddler. They have always been an influence in my life and I revere their presence. As a child I rescued an injured crow from the Naval hospital in Bremerton, WA when I was 7. Caring for this magnificent bird (who I named Caw) opened me further to rely on my witchling senses. As a teenager, I was waiting for the school bus and had cawed at a raven I spotted flying very high above me. As the 'caw-versation' continued other ravens joined and made a circle flying high above me. I was dubbed 'Raven Woman' by my classmates that saw the spectacle as the bus stopped for me to board. They were making fun of me (I was a loner anyway), but I took the name as a badge of honor! Several years later, as a veterinary technician in Spokane, WA a raven between nestling and fledgling age was brought into the clinic. I was blessed being chosen as his caregiver and as he mended and grew into a beautiful adult my magick was enhanced. Bran and I bonded throughout that year as I did my best to prepare him for release back into the wild. After recuperating and his broken leg was fully mended, and he had learned to fly and identify roadkill (I brought fresh roadkills of venison, non-corvid birds, rabbits, etc. I found on my commute to and from work for him to get used to rather than the raw meats, pastas, vegetables, fruits...I bought for his meals as he healed; indoors he ate better quality foods than we did! I made sure of that!) In mid-October of that year he was released. I lived on a 140 acre cattle ranch 30 miles North of Spokane where he met up with other Ravens on the property, and at dusk he nudged my face and lightly gurgled his good-byes just before he launched into the darkening sky and went with his new raven friends.I am telling my story, the short version, as this Crow Tarot deck resonates with that similar connection I have with crows and ravens. I highly recommend this deck for anyone with such a connection to the most intelligent and holy of fowl, corvids!"
"I love the unique take that the artist has on the traditional rider-waite tarot. I wanted a traditional deck that wasn't THE traditional deck, the crow tarot was my choice and I was not disappointed! The symbolism is heavy in this deck and is wonderful in aiding in remembering what the cards mean. the only thing I have to say that is semi negative is that the cards are slightly large compared to other decks. This, combined with the stiffness of the cards makes them harder to shuffle than other decks. All in all, I recommend this deck to anyone and everyone!"
"My original review is below, I aired out both the cards and the box they came in for several days.  The strong chemical smell is disappearing.  Beautiful cards, can be blunt and to the point, but thats what I want.  Very smooth shuffle, they glide almost.If these beautiful cards didn't come with such a strong chemical smell I would have given them a five star rating hands down.  It's hard to meditate on the cards when the smell of chemicals distracts you.  I'm in the process of attempting to air everything out, including the box they came in.  I hope it works.  Other than that the card stock is OK and the image quality is very good.  As a side note the Guidebook was also ordered and I was rather disappointed with it.  The book goes into color symbolism of each card in detail, yet the Guidebook shows the full page cards colorless.  The little booklet that comes with the cards may be all you need.  Based on the cards and the Guidebook, the creator of these tarot cards may need to be more involved with the production of her product.  They are worthy of better attention and care of production."
"I absolutely adore these cards. I love how they feel, how they look, and my readings have been so great and clear with them. There are about 15 cards you might struggle to place at first with its counterpart in the Rider-Waite deck, because of the original imagery, but you learn soon enough. Took me a day to get used to them. Most cards are no trouble at all to recognize. I think it helps to learn the Rider Waite first, but I suppose you could just learn this deck on its own. These cards evoke a whole array of feelings, great energies, and maybe even a sense of humor. I just love :)"
"I bought this deck because I purchased the crow Oracle deck and loved it so much I wanted the tarot deck from the same artist. It wasn’t available on her website so I was thrilled to find it here! I even bought the additional guidebook just to support her wonderful work (the deck comes with its own small guidebook).This deck and the artwork and symbolism really speak to me! The complaints in the negative reviews seem so nit picky to me ... personally, the differences in color of the borders doesn’t bother me, it’s very subtle and seems to be different just to compliment the artwork. The labels for the major arcana and court cards but only Roman numerals for the minor arcana does not bother me - I have another deck like that and I think it’s fairly common. The size is not a problem - it is bigger than my Morgan Greer tarot deck but smaller width wise than the crow Oracle. I guess the card stock could always be thicker and It would be nice if they were gilded - but I only paid $15 for this deck, not $50! Indie decks need to be accessible so artists can make a profit, so I understand the decisions made in the production of the deck. Also, I saw someone complain that the artwork was nothing like traditional tarot. This is a ridiculous complaint in my opinion ... first of all, of course it’s different. But a lot of the traditional symbolism is maintained and there’s a lot of nods to the original rider wait tarot (a deliberate decision by the artist), so it is actually easy for beginner and seasoned readers to recognize them. There’s tons of room for interpretation no matter what deck you get and letting your intuition guide you is part of the beauty of tarot. No card always means exactly the same thing to me. I love this beautiful evocative deck!"
"I'm super disappointed. I LOVE the images and contrary to some other reviews, I'm a person that only uses a Rider-Waite-Smith deck, and feel like this is a translation that is easy to interpret. However, I just opened them this morning and have been shuffling them (using the basic overhand shuffle that I normally use with a RWS deck that I've had for 2 years) and one card split at the corner already! I love the imagery so much, but feel I will have to send them back and hope that they improve the quality.ETA: The allure of these cards was too great! I exchanged them for a new pack that is hopefully from a different (better) production batch and/or with the awareness that they need to be shuffled gently and will not become a daily workhorse. And I will continue to hope that they improve the quality so that they can be!(As a few people have noted previously, the edges are very sharp and maybe they kind of catch on one another? I'm going to start using Cowie push/put shuffle style on these.)"
I have loved crows my whole life. They follow me and if I park the car they land on the hood and if I am meditation in the forest they land around me. My sister says I am the crow lady. Anyway I love Crows and this deck is no different. I love the readings and the moment I got the deck it was spot on in the readings. I like that the card stock is not too thick and more the thin side and has a slick finish so they shuffle really well. One thing I really like is the the pictures show a crows pride not those cutesy pictures some people draw. I can't say enough about how much I love this deck and have ordered the book to go with it so I can fully learn more about the authors intent with working with the deck. I like to know how the creator of a deck feels about their deck and how it they see it's interpretations.
"This deck is stunning, and I'm not just talking about the art (though, yes, that too). Everything about it draws me in, and the imagery is very straightforward in my opinion. The colors are very well-balanced, the book is thorough and thoughtful, and I can feel the creator's love for these majestic creatures radiating from every card. All of my readings have been accurate as hell...I'm being called out by these cards LOLIf I could give it a hundred stars, I would, but I guess I'll have to go with five. :)"
"The Crow Tarot called to me. :-)I already have a couple of cartomancy divination decks (53 cards) and wanted to get a full sized Tarot. The only problem I have is a lot of the Tarot decks tend to not be my flavor, whether it be with artwork that's too woo woo or archaic, or just poorly printed and using thin card stock.First of all, I love crows and ravens. The artwork is great, and the card stock is nice and thick. I have larger hands and these tarot fit me perfectly. Though I'm not a Vegas shuffler, I feel like I do okay with these.The book it comes with has enough detail to help newbies understand card meanings. I appreciate that as a few tarot decks I've tried had great artwork but poor manuals.It's well worth the current price of 15 dollars, and is a great deck for someone like me turned off by the symbolism or woo in many of the contemporary decks out there.Give me a well-drawn crow and you'll have a happy seeker, :-)"
"My last name means means “Little Raven/Little Crow/Little Black Bird” I’m Basque so obviously I had to get this! I felt (&still) SUCH A VISCERAL CONNECTION I had to buy several more decks 1 personal, 1 public, 1 for my Mother of course (it’s her maiden name!) and 1 for my brother! My mother loves it but my brother isn’t confident in his card abilities so he just looks at them and likes them that way at least! 😂🥰🥳 I’m shocked I haven’t used it enough to have had to bug a new personal deck yet!"
I bought these because I thought they looked cool and would be a good addition to my tarot collection.They really surprised me because the images are so beautiful and really layered with meanings and symbolism. These are so easy to read with and interpret and I just absolutely love them. I think I might even buy a second backup deck because I love them so much!
"Beautiful cards! The artwork was a big draw on this one for me, and the deck doesn’t disappoint. I’m a beginner, and these cards so far are very easy to work with; the book has been helpful in interpretation as well. As others have said the cards are a little big— 3 x 5, like an index card— but I have tiny hands and am managing fine, so it’s not much of a problem if you can be patient about shuffling. They’re nicely sturdy and smooth without being slippery. My only complaint is a very minor one; for me they had a rather strong smell coming out of the box. Laying them out for a few hours and sticking a dryer sheet in the box took care of it, though, and it’s a very little thing. I love working with them!"
"The artwork is gorgeous. The two stars it does get are solely for the artwork. It's stunning and the artist did a beautiful job.The cards themselves are way too big. My mistake for not reading the size. I looked at the pictures by other users and they looked much more manageable than they are.The corners and edges are always nicked.Now the worst part. The cards are cupped. The corners don't touch the table if they're lying face up, and when I shuffle them, the cupping forces some of them to bend and others not. They don't slide together smoothly, and keeping a grip on these huge cards while they pop and flex in my hands is difficult.I want to love this deck, but the publisher really dropped the ball on quality."
"This deck is just stunning in it's artistry and detail.  Each card is beautiful in its own right, and the illustrations offer excellent suggestions about their meanings.  I appreciate the booklet that comes with it, and I highly recommend that you follow the creator on her website for additional opportunities and products.  The Crow Tarot has become my preferred deck, and I'm genuinely happy to recommend it!"
"Im positively surprised by this deck. The art its radiant and dream like, and the stock is of great quality. It retains most of the RWS deck symbolism, and also you can see those symbols be presented in this deck in an original fashion, with some new ones added by the author, which I welcome. I was worried that a deck of ""only crows"" could be repetitive, and although you can see similar visual elements used in more than one card, that gives the deck consistency in its structure and overall each card's artwork its inspiring an unique. A good deck for both beginners and long term practitioners, and collectors as well."
"I love this deck and was delighted to find it in a mass market version. I’m new to tarot and hadn’t learned about indie decks, but that’s another rabbit hole...I live the collage art; the cards are beautiful and full of symbolism, not necessarily RWS. The crows don’t mess around, and will get your attention bluntly and honestly."
"I have had a personal relationship with crows for years. I never bought crow tarot because normally they are kind of dark, and I don't think of crows that way. This deck is beautiful and not large at all, actually the cards are smaller than most of my Oracle decks and I wouldn't want tiny cards anyway. You're not supposed to shuffle tarot cards like a regular deck of cards in the sense that you don't want them very bent. The cards are not 'blurry' at all, they are a bit abstract and watercolor-ish, but very beautiful. I love the book that comes with it. Great job!"
"I LOVE these cards. I’ve been looking for a deck that speaks to me and this one is perfect. The art is so unique and stunning, admiring the intricate artwork on each card is part of the fun with each reading.I’ve seen some comments saying the cards are too big, but I have fairly small hands and they don’t seem any bigger than other tarot decks I’ve worked with.Really appreciate that the booklet also includes reverse meanings! I am fairly new to tarot so more advanced readers may prefer something more traditional or complex, but I adore them. Overall I think this is a great set, no complaints. Definitely recommend!"
I’m not going to claim I can do better. But these cards are so confusing. The art looks a bit lazy and plastered on. It is okay art on some cards of course but most hardly LOOK like their respective card. Some of the card even made me chuckle because of how ridiculous it looks. I don’t care if they are big or not (although they most certainly are but I have big hands anyway) I wish they would’ve put more thought into this deck. A tarot deck about crows ? I was super excited and then I finally got it. I doubt I could do a reading for someone without them laughing at the devil card. I think I’ll be keeping them as a sort of gag gift to myself but as far as using them I can’t find a good reason to. I guess if you like birds of the “funny” variety this is a pretty hilarious deck. Let’s hope someone makes a more meaningful set of crow cards later.
"Cards are larger than standard size tarot. They are sturdy, high quality and thick. They don't bend easy. They are beautiful and the images invite more intuitive feelings when reading,especially in refards to Masculine/Feminine energies as you are unable to tell if the birds depicted are masculine or feminine unless otherwise stated (King/Queen, Priestess etc)."
"Sooo  I ordered these cards. And I really wanted to like this deck...However..there were random colored borders  Some of the symbols  just seemed randomly placed.  For example the King of Swords..had the symbol for Saturn(arcane ruler), as Uranus is the ruler for Aquarius and Saturn the ruler of Capricorn, which would have been perfect on the King of Pentacles ..I liked the major Arcana..but getting into the other cards..the photoshopping was so obvious I just couldn't..So I returned them.."
"I had this deck on my wish list for a while and finally was able to purchase it. It has become my new favorite deck because it is highly intuitive, it shuffles really well, and the artwork is just my style. The guidebook that comes with the deck is easy to read. I learned Tarot using a RWS deck and the Crow Tarot is similar and has been easy adjustment for me. I am looking forward to receiving the more in depth guidebook that I have ordered for the deck creator so I can study this deck more."
"The email from Amazon asking for this review began with: ""Did the Crow Tarot meet your expectations?"" I'd answer with a resounding ""NO!"" The Crow Tarot far exceeded my expectations. I'm not an animal deck person, but a lot of people raved about this deck, and honestly I was in the mood for some retail therapy. So imagine my surprise when I opened this up and felt an incredible, high-vibration energy with this deck. This is NOT an animal deck but more of a crow-as-divine-messenger deck.Added to that is great U. S. Games card stock, a hard two-piece box, and very beautiful art, sort of impressionist water color, much prettier than it shows on line or in videos. Also, a good deck for beginners as it is a straight RWS deck.All in all, I love this deck and highly recommend it."
"This deck is good quality, beautiful and is very easy to read. On each of the Major Arcana, Kings, Queens, Knights, Pages and Aces, the card states the name of the card (ie ""Page of Swords"" or ""The World""). However that is not the case with the rest of deck. Instead there is just a number at the top with the suit in the artwork. For me this wasn't a big deal and I think a beginner could figure that outThat being said the artwork doesn't show everything that the card means, so using the guidebook becomes more prominent than compared to some other decks. Some people might consider this a hindrance, but it's helping me learn and get used to each tarot cardI have small hands so I have to shuffle it ""long ways"" which I'm used to but it can be an inconvenienceAs a disclaimer, I'm writing this as someone who didn't start with the Rider-Waite deck however I do have experience with other decks"
"I was drawn to these. As I am anything with crows (have been my whole life) so when I found these I HAD to have them, I even ordered a second set as a gift for my mom. They are a little tough for my tiny hands, but I have tiny hands so I expect that, my 9 year old has hands bigger than mine. And I still make do just fine. I highly recommend. They are excellent quality and the book is very easy to follow/flip through. Highly recommend!"
"The quality of this deck is unmatched. They are easy to shuffle and are the perfect size.I wouldn’t recommend this deck for a beginner, I think it may be challenging for a newbie to read. For an experienced reader, these cards are fun to read. And also you’ll respect the quality.The cards don’t stick, the edges to get trashed so quickly. I have a big collection and this deck gets an A+ for quality."
"This deck was exactly what I was expecting and then some. The artwork is captivating and the feel of the cards is sturdy and comfortable. I don't have the largest hands, but I had no trouble shuffling them. As for the intuitive feel of the deck, I tuned in right away to these cards, and have found they speak well to me. The messages I have received have been spot on, eerily so, and I am glad I purchased them."
"I truly love this deck. The artwork is dreamlike and kinda like watercolor prints. My deck's book came printed upside down, so I'm not sure if it was just that run or what. The cardstock is the kind that shuffles nicely and will hold up to lots of use; not too glossy, doesn't stick. I love crows & ravens and was delighted when I found this beautiful deck on Amazon. This is also the deck that the YouTube channel ""The Crow Tarot"" uses, in case you noticed a familiarity.You can see a full flip through of this deck on my YT channel"
"If you like crows these are the cards for you... Ignore any bad review because they are GORGEOUS. Each card is a work of art layered with depth, symbolism, and beautiful coloring. They are a little big but still easy to shuffle and use... I'm so in love I preordered her urban crow oracle cards which is not something I would normally do but I had to have them too. I'd give them 10 stars if I could."
"I can't even explain how much I LOVE this deck. I'm a novice reader and I've been working hard to learn the Rider Waite deck. Sometimes it was a real struggle because the imagery just didn't speak to me. Every now and then I'd get the meaning quickly and easily, but most of the time I had to stare at them for a long time, but this deck just makes sense and I get instant, intuitive messages almost every time. The artwork is beautiful and a bit dark, which is great for the somewhat darker topics I usually read on, like true crime."
I can't say enough how much I love this deck.  The art work is lovely and works well for beginners or tarot pros.  The card stock is thin enough to shuffle well but not flimsy and the size is perfect for me.  The box is sturdy and the book has more than enough info for each card including reversals.  I connected with this deck immediately and i have a feeling it'll be my go-to deck for readings for myself.  Love it!
"This deck is stunning!  The images are beautiful and the cardstock is top quality.  I don't think there is anything I don't like about this deck.  It has become one of the top 5 Tarot decks in my collection.  BTW, it's a collection and not a hoard, lol."
"I have about 2doz decks, not a huge collection, but a fair amount and this is my new fav! Neatest deck I’ve bought in a long time! Gorgeous art! Plenty of symbolism, you’d be surprised! Not exactly a beginner deck but if you’re pretty familiar with RWS, I’d say you’d do fine! Really, really love it! Check out Benebell Wens review on her website ❤️🌹❤️❤️"

   This tarot deck is beautiful, well designed and everything, the cards are a nice size not too big not too small, Goldilocks would approve! The only “problem” isn’t exactly a problem, I wish there was more “set ups” in the book that comes inside the box, there is one tarot spread and that is the “crow tarot” spread, just wish there was more spread examples but I go online to find thousands of my own spreads anyway. Also wish there was a place in the book to put notes, from the same company I bought “Spirit Song Tarot Deck” (also beautiful) which had a couple small pages where you could write a little (it also had the variety of spread examples that I was talking about). Overall I’d buy this, it’s a beautiful deck, I’ve just been spoiled with extras!"
I just recently received this deck and I’m glad I ordered it. The illustrations of the crows very good. It takes effort to keep illustrations of crows from becoming too kitschy or too dark. I think the artist achieved this balance. She also added a bit of very subtle humor to some cards. I found the deck easy to connect with and look forward to using it in readings.
This is a beautiful deck and I love the perspective in the booklet. I’m a lover and collector and user of the tarot and I know I’m going to enjoy this one. I was almost going to hold off fue to some of the reviews but forged ahead and am glad I did. Beautiful deck.
"Beautiful artwork! Also good quality material. As others have mentioned, they are a bit large. However I was able to get used to the size and can shuffle them easily enough now, and I have small hands. These cards are very blunt! I have done several readings and all of them have been painfully accurate. I'm very satisfied!"
"bought this for my mother as a surprise gift as she's more or less been taking care of a murder of crows for just about 6yrs now. the crows now her face, voice and car, and she can tell which caw is her babies or a different murders' babies. mamo also is v into tarrot and things witchy or wiccan so, perf gift"
This is something you want to immerse in for yourself and you will be so happy that you did. These cards more than meet you halfway. They do something special and treat you. I have always loved crows and ravens for no big reason (cat lady) but these cards speak to me so kindly. Thanks birds!
"Overall, the deck is ok. It was extremely disappointing that the deck was missing the 8 of Swords! I didn't notice this until it was too late to return the item. I like the crow theme, however, I was not able to read with these cards (aside from it not being a complete deck due to the missing card!). I just didn't connect to them, even though I've always felt a connection to crows since childhood."
"Beautiful deck, large, sturdy cards. Absolutely love this deck!!! I have Maggie Stillwaters, Ravens Prophecy deck and I hate it! I've chipped that thing up, edged it and will hate it lol. Some cards are beautiful, but I cannot connect. I wanted a nice crow deck with beautiful images, and THIS IS THAT DECK!"
"This tarot deck is absolutely stunning. I'm connecting really well with this deck so far and it's easily one of my favorites. The art/imagery is refreshing, the colors are beautiful and the card stock is excellent quality. I was sceptical at first about how I would feel about this deck but after I recieved it and worked with it a couple times I think I made a good decision. Plus crows/ravens are easily one of my favorite animals so that's a bonus.10/10 would recommend"
"This deck is superb. It came sealed both on the exterior and the cards inside were sealed as well. The artwork is so perfect. The guidebook is well written.  I got this deck to go with my Urban Crow oracle deck and I am so happy that I did. If you're thinking about it, just do it."
"This is a beautiful set of tarot cards, I love the illusrations and how the artist has reinterpreted the imagery using the crow figures.  My only two complaints are 1. The cards are quite large, so they are kinda difficult to shuffle, especially for someone like me who has small hands and 2. The printing seems slightly lower quality than I expected, its more noticeable on a few of the cards where if you look closely, the illustration looks blurry.  Aside from that, I overall love this deck and have been really enjoying using them.  I still reccommend despite its flaws."
"The cards are a wee bit big for my hands which is frustrating when shuffling. I'd advise the creator to make them a tad more user-friendly on that front.Everything else about these cards I love. Gorgeous imagery, crows on every card as far as I have found so far. For a Crow Mama like me, these are absolutely lovely."
"Hermoso  y original el diseño de los cuervos. Cada carta tiene su simbologìa, colores, la calidad de las cartas es muy buena, viene con un pequeño  libro en inglés  detallando el significado de cada  carta.  Si tienes manos pequeñas  debes practicar  ya que puede resultar incómodo  barajar."
Beautiful deck with great symbolism. Going to love doing readings with this deck.
"Good quality images and material. Not for the apprentice. Best tarot cards we have seen in a very long time. For the experienced medium, these cards will bring out the best in you!"
I bought this deck when it popped up as a suggested item and I'm so glad I did! One of my favorite decks and such a great tool to pull clarity cards for other decks and daily or situational cards in a quick pinch.  Gorgeous illustrations and fantastic images
"Yeahhh! Love, love these cards. Thank you to the creators. This is my new favorite deck. Not too cutesy, not dark...just right! At first try, they seem to be an excellent divination tool as well. Beauty and brains, and a little bit of the mystical."
I love crows so I had to get this deck and I am glad that I did. The artwork is beautiful and the guide book is very helpful.
"I really hesitated purchasing this cards after reading some of the reviews.  I’m glad I listen to intuition and purchased them.  I find them beautiful, thought provoking and yes, they are on the large side but not unwieldy.  I highly recommend them."
"This is my second tarot deck that I purchased with the intention to give readings for other people. It is very beginner friendly, the guidebook that comes with the deck makes the readings very clear as well as the story behind the cards themselves. The deck is very sassy, but very grounded. When describing this deck to others I describe it as a close friend who gives fair but very real advice. The art is very beautiful."
"Absolutely beautiful deck. I have a special connection to crows and ravens, so I was drawn to this deck the moment I saw it. I love the art, and the included guidebook is wonderful. I am so pleased and honored to add this tarot deck to my collection."
"Smooth shuffling, powerfully intuitive and just plain Beautiful!  My favorite go to deck of my 16 deck collection.  LOL  To some that might not be much but, they just feel real good in my hands especially for fellow crow lovers."
"Images are way more colorful in real life than in pictures. The meaning of the cards in the booklet is simple and original. The cards are large, I like that. They have a nice feeling, they are not glossy and I also like that. They are thick and the box is nice. Very happy."
"I put off buying this deck for awhile because I thought it would be repetitive with crows in every image. But I like crows and finally decided to purchase the deck. It wasn't until I could work closely with the cards that I saw the wonderful use of detailed color and texture in every card. Some of the cards I might have done differently, why I didn't give the deck 5 stars, but overall it is a very visual deck and reads well. And the crows are well done in terms of anatomy and action, flying etc."
This deck is my first. I have found it very easy to use and learn from. The art is gorgeous! The cards are sturdy. I have very long fingers and still have trouble shuffling them because the cards are just a bit too large for my hands. Trying to shuffle them sideways has yielded poor results because they are just narrow enough not to be springy. I'm sure that will change over time with use. All in all I love them!
"This is my absolute favorite deck! Each card is numbered, but doesn't have names on the Minor Arcana; the type of card is seen in the artwork on the card (pictures of swords in the sword cards). The artwork give me chills because it's so fantastic."
Art is awesome! Card stock is fantastic! The mini book that comes with it is interesting and the box used to hold them is good quality. Good bang for your buck! Dont pass up the crows
"I align closely with crow energy. This deck is a lovely addition to my collection. The artwork is based on the rider-waite which makes it easy to work with, while the interesting artwork does open things up for creative intuitive interpretations."
Very nice cards. They are larger size so be sure to review the measurements if important.  The designs incorporate crows nicely.  There are a few cards I don't like the design or feel it could have been done better to represent the meaning in the card or respect for the meaning of the card.
"I love this deck, just feels nice.  The pictures really tell a tale, really nice artwork, very nicely made and not huge cards!!"
"I absolutely adore these cards! The art is GORGEOUS! They’re bigger than my other sets which gets a little awkward in my smaller hands, but I don’t mind because the bigger art is fantastic"
Really neat deck. Cool artwork and quality cards. Love the little insert/book that explains the cards from a storyteller perspective of the crow character.
"I loved these Crow Tarot cards. The artwork is beautiful, they were easy to connect with and are very similar to the traditional Rider Waite deck in how they read. I would recommend these cards if you’re even  just learning or want to have some beautiful cards in your collection."
I seriously don’t know why I waited so long to get these. At first I just got them to add to my collection but these are very beautiful. I love the dark art. Nice and thick.
This has become my favorite tarot deck. The art works is amazing and deserves the awards the creator has won. Images rally capture the spirit of Raven.  Included guidebook is thorough and helpful. I also bought the companion journal and love it as well.
"I’m not a tarot reader nor do I believe in any of that business, but I bought this deck because I think the images are beautiful. I understand lots of readers use this deck."
I collect decks and have used then personally for over 30 years. I love this deck. I saw this on an astrologer's reading on YouTube and I tracked it down. I strongly suggest it.
"I already love this deck  The artwork work is super.  DOWNSIDE : The card stock is not the best ,the edges look like they will eventually separate with use. Why is stuff so cheaply made . I would love the companion book that goes with this deck: unfortunately only available in Kindle version."
I love everything about this Tarot deck! The artwork is stunning. The cards feel wonderful in my hands. The box that comes with the cards is the prefect size for storing and keeping the cards and book safe. My favorite deck!
Beautifully illustrated - I wish they were smaller to fit in my hands though
"Designs are beautiful, I feel really connected to this deck to the point that I don't feel a need to ever purchase another deck.  I pull a card every night and gain wisdom and insight into life matters.  It is apparent that a lot of love and creativity was in play during the artists creation of these cards."
"Just as amazing as I expected. So much symbolism and beautifully illustrated. Am positively thrilled.Cards are sized larger, it has an oracle feel. But slippery and stacked for the perfect tarot deck. There is enough reference on the card to know what you are looking at. But consider buying the reference book to delve more into the details. And watch out. I swear the edges can nip at you just like a crow itself."
Gorgeous and unique. I usually work with runes so this is only my second ever tarot set. The guide book that comes with it is super helpful in readings and I love how it is personalized on each crow on each card. Lovely vibes off of it.
I purchased this deck because I wanted to start getting into tarot. It is reasonably priced and the artwork really called out to me. It's gorgeous and the booklet that comes with it is wildly informational and so helpful for someone like me who knew nothing about tarot.
MJ's artwork and interpretation of crows is beautiful. She has other decks out for the Wise Dog and Grimalkin (the Cats). I recommend seeking out her work and buying it. She was a great find and I am honored to have her decks in my collection.
The artwork is just stunning! And I love that it references the original Smith Rider Waite symbolism while offering a fresh take. Highly recommend!
The actual physical quality is very good.  The images and interpretations of the tarot journey are both true to tarot AND still strikingly unique.
"My favorite deck ever!!!  I’ve had many decks of cards over the years and I had to have this deck because I love crows. It has taken a little time to recognize some cards in this deck but, that is time well spent for me because I have exceptional energy connected with my deck"
The card stock is great on this deck and is great to shuffle. Amazing color and I don't find it difficult to read. I pleasant change from the same ol RWS.
"Great deck. The pictures are vibrant, the silky matte finish feels soft yet firm In your hands. Comes with a booklet with a decent write up for each card and their potential meanings.Only downside is there is just one spread/layout, (crow spread). Kinda wish there was more to it than that. Apparently there is a companion book but it seems stupid expensive."
"In addition to the beautiful artwork, I'm especially amazed at the author's interpretations in the little book that's included with the cards! Very different and insightful!"
I love these cards! They are perfect for my connection with The Morrigan and beautifully designed. I am very pleased with this purchase!
These cards immediately had a good energy to themThe colors are fantasticThe pictures tell you so much about the carss that its very easy to connect with.I have been wanting this deck for awhile and I am extremely pleased with them!I may order a second one as a back up!
This is a very nice deck. The messages are clear I like using this deck. If you’re attracted to crows like me I recommend it. Easy fun deck.
"Beautiful pictures of wonderful crows. I don't agree with the interpretations of some of the cards, but the pictures are worth it."
This is a beautiful deck. Lovely illustrations and nicely crafted meaning/interpretation book. Sturdy cards that will hold up with use.
"This deck called to me immediately and matches my energy perfectly. I have only two formal tarot decks and this is the one I use every single day. The card stock is my favorite and easy to shuffle. Mine are starting to look a little rough around the edges, but very likely just from how much I really use them. Beautiful images, great guidebook, and a really good deck for beginners or professionals! Absolutely 10/10 recommend!"
Love this deck! I love the artwork and the card stock. My new go to deck for sure!
The cards look great! Most importantly the book has a detailed description of each card that makes interpretation easy.
I feel so connected to this deck. I've had a few decks that never made this connection but with crow tarot ot was instant.Love the artwork and the size  and feelof the cards.
"It's beautiful. The cards shuffle really smoothly, and for me are very easy to connect to. Perfect deck for me."
I’m really enjoying my Crow Tarot and also the guide book as well. So far I seem to be getting very honest and accurate readings. I like all the optimistic nuances of the different cards and the layouts the book presents. It fun getting to know this new deck!
The Crow tarot is beautiful. The satin finish is perfect. Just amazing deck. My take is you want this deck.
I love this deck!! I have wanted it for quite some time and now that I have it I am smitten!! The artist did a great job of including elements of classic tarot in the artwork. The book included is also nicely constructed and provides useful keywords.Highly recommend to any crow lovers out there!!
"I love the designs. Nice heavy cards, large size and beautiful design. Comes with a book for reading the cards.  Highly recommend!"
These cards are absolutely beautiful!  Perfect for you if the crows in the woods are always talking and you want to see what they are saying.  ;)
So colorful and beautiful. I absolutely love this set. Comes with a small book and a nice size protective box.
I've been really enjoying using this deck. The art and the quality of the cards are all very good.
"Beautiful deck, card stock quality was fine a bit on the thinner end but not too severe. Readings are pretty accurate and helpful but I wish the guidebook had more longer descriptions about the symbology in some of the cards instead of a very basic rider waite summary. The major downside is that my deck had a strong chemical smell, I've had it for around two months now and the smell has barely faded."
"I’m absolutely in love with this deck!I love crows. My spirit animal is a crow. Crow has helped me through the darkest of times. When I saw this deck, I felt immediately drawn to it, almost as if the deck was written specially for me.The colors on each card are vivid and stir my imagination.If this deck calls you, take it. It’s meant to be."
"A little bigger than the average card but of excellent quality. The art on each card is gorgeous and the deck itself has lovely energy. Definitely worth the buy, especially for a lover of corvids!"
I have a love for birds. I even found a few and raised them up. This deck really called out to me when I first seen it as I work with Apollo and of course my birds that I have. It just seemed a perfect fit. I LOVE how easy it is to shuffle the cards in the deck too! All of the pictures are so easy to read. Great deck! Highly recommend.
"I instantly fell in love with the artwork! However, I didn't buy these cards right away. There was something that kept drawing me back to them. So, I bought them and they were delivered so quickly. I am kicking myself for not buying them sooner. Whether it be for divination, tarocchi, or simply to enjoy the artwork BUY THESE CARDS!"

   that an amazing deck quality is superb !!!  can't wait to order some more card decks"
"I love these cards. The drawings are amazing, and the feel of them is excellent. Sturdy cards they will stand up to time."
"Large to medium size, low gloss. Very interesting & colorful cards. I’d buy again."
"I love the feeling of the cards and the art is beautiful. I found connecting with the cards fairly easy and I am a beginner. The guidebook is also super helpful and includes meanings for reversed cards. The only critique I would really have is that the guidebook doesn't include images of the cards, but thats not really much of a problem as long as you know roman numerals."
"The pictures online don't do this deck justice.When I opened the package, I was thrilled with the amazing artwork and obvious spiritual connection of these cards. MJ Cullinane has poured heart and soul into the images.This deck is an instant favorite for me. Love, love, LOVE it!!!"
These cards are awesome. This was a great purchase. I highly recommend these.
"Yes, they were a gift and were greatly appreciated and loved by the the receiver"
I love these cards so much! I feel very connected with them. The quality and the illustrations on each card are beautiful.
The cards are beautiful! The paper is high quality. I'd definitely recommend it
"Love how beautifully done this tarot deck was made, i was skeptical about getting this deck but now I have it I wonder what took me so long"
This is not the real deck. It’s a knock off deck with much flimsier cards
These are absolutely beautiful cards!  Buy them! You will not regret the purchase.
Love the crow tarot it’s one of my favorite decks to use stays on my table
Love these cards! The feel of them is amazing! The art is great! They shuffle  amazing and readings are on point! I am even thinking of getting a second deck. Totally worth the price!
I love these cards . They are big and with time should shuffle well. If you feel any joy in nature or have good feelings with Crows you will love these cards
Great deck! Instant bond with its artwork and feel. One of my favorites now.
"buy it! beautiful art, easy to read, clear and vivid- wonderful print of cards."
If you like Crow this is the deck for you. Lovely art work
Impressed by the beauty in the detail. Very easy to read.
Love the illustrations and the fact that it's crows.  Perfect for my collection!
"I’ve always had a special connection with crows/ravens. As soon as I came across this deck I knew I had to have it. Each card is so beautiful, you feel the energy bursting out of them. First tech that I truly have resonated with 100%"
I love this deck so much I’ve gifted a couple as well.
Beautiful deck. Looking forward to working with it.
I have experimented with this deck a few times since receiving. I really like the graphics and the interpretations. It is a nice addition to my choices.
"Beautifully made, I love the illustrations & the box is sturdy to keep the cards in!"
I don’t use them everyday but wheewwww they have been coming from me.
So beautiful! They fill a hole i didn't know what empty. I love them!
Used for personal readings. I like the artwork.
Absolutely stunning!  You will not regret buying these!.
I gifted these to a friend. She loves them.
This tarot deck is awesome! Good card stock and gorgeous images on EACH AND EVERY SINGLE CARD! The booklet is nice with easy to understand meanings and descriptions!  Would make a great gift!
I love the art work and colors of these cards. Quite stunning and the pictures are in alignment with my understanding of the representations of each card.
Gorgeous and I found it to be a very intuitive deck. I love it.
"This is a very satisfying deck. Beautiful cards, interesting crow spread and good card descriptions. Of course, it's all in your taste, but if you're called to buy it, then it's probably for you."
This is a beautiful deck! I absolutely love it and recommend it!
"These are beautiful, handle easily, and are just a pleasure to work with.  I don't think they are for beginners, but for more experienced readers they are great.  The images are a bit abstract, but extremely powerful.  One of my favorite decks."
"Gorgeous deck, images are very pleasant and exactly what I was looking for. However the cards do stick together a bit."
I purchased this deck because I was drawn to the beautiful artwork of the deck.  This is my first tarot deck and I am so pleased with it.
Super excited  I love 💘  this deck!
"Beautiful cards! Comes with a nifty little guidebook that fits in the box. No defects, exactly what I wanted."
"I absolutely love this deck, simply beautiful.... The only thing is my deck is missing the Six of Pentacles. The deck came completely sealed so I think it's just a mistake, but I wonder if this is the only one... It's so odd."
This is a very pretty tarot deck.
"I had an instant connection to the cards.  Beautiful, a great addition to my collection."
"This is becoming my favorite deck.  It resonates with me, and I am getting to know it."
Gorgeous deck. Very well made
I wish the artwork were a little cleaner
The absolute best. 100% recommend.
One of my favorite decks!
I love the art in this deck.
"great art. these are a little large for my hands, but I have small hands. Otherwise good quality card thickness and printing. Cards have been great to use, just a little awkward for me as they are on the larger side."
I absolutely love this deck. The artwork is amazing and I was completely happy.
Great addition to my collection
"Absolutely thrilled with this deck! So glad I bought it. Strong, sturdy card stock and really nice illustrations too!"

"It called me, so Special!"
Great product
Cards came prefect. They are beautiful. Came with book as well.
Connects to imagery of crow but also Ryder Waite so easily understood
Great artistry.
Love the theme...the art and the cards. It's my go to Tarot Pack.
Lovely card deck. It’s very large and good for beginners. The art is really nice as well. I mean there isn’t much reason not to get it. It’s not plastic or anything it’s just like normal cards ig. They’re very nice and definitely recommended.
Love it!
I absolutely love this deck. My only complaint is the way the edges are getting damaged after about 6 months of shuffling.
"Fast delivery, just what I wanted."
As a beginner I bought these cards and realized that these four cards as the same Roman number which make question this deck entirely.
"Like, color good"
Beautiful deck! Enough said!
Gave as a gift!
The imagery on this deck is stunning....absolutely captivating.  The card stock is nice....not to flimsy; not too hard...easy to shuffle.  I feel like they will hold up well.
These cards are beyond stunning. I can't express into words how much I love them.
Gorgeous artwork! beautiful deck and accompanying book. Thank you!
My favorite corvid deck. Easy to riffle shuffle and beautiful art on the cards.
"Absolutely adore this deck! Beautiful art, nice card stock, I have nothing but positive things to say about this product. The art is easy to associate to the Rider deck for a tarot novice but so well done that it easily can stand on its own."
"Gorgeous art, perfect packaging, and card stock feels great in the hand. Very happy!"
Love these cards . Beautiful art work and easy to use
Beautiful and unique cards!!!! The card stock is perfect. Not flimsy at all. I would highly recommend this deck.

"Stunning artwork, great size for using regularly"
"I love corvids and i love tarot.  I think the art, the emotions, and the artistic interpretations of the classic tarot in this deck are fantastic.  I highly resonate with this beautiful tarot deck."
I have read tarot for over 20 years and have several decks. I love this one and look forward to using it. Love the iconography!
Beautiful cards. MaryAnn from Revealing Light Tarot used them and shared he story about crows. I loved them and was happy to find them.
Beautiful! Thank you
"Beautiful cards, the painting on the cards reminds me Bob Ross. I love Raven,& Crows I see them all the time. The cards are super thick."
"These were my first tarot cards ever purchased and I use them regularly. I adore the booklet they came with, highly recommend them to anyone interested in learning tarot! Such beautiful artwork and interpretation."
"The deck is beautiful, and so is its packaging. But it came missing one card: the ace of pentacles."
💜
Absolutely love this deck- the energy and connection was strong. The artwork is beautiful.
For those of you who love tarot...and crows...this is the perfect combo!
"Gorgeous, well made deck."
"Just received my crow deck on 03/20/2020 and once I opened it fell in love!!!!!! Very beautiful deck, I am impressed, and glad I have!!!!"

The art work is amazing. I LOVE THIS DECK!!!

"Awesome deck! The cards are printed on high quality paper, the artwork is vibrant, unique and wonderful. The devil card is one of my favorites, but the whole deck is fantastic. 10/10 would recommend!"
Excellent.. Really good deck if you like the crows
I got these cards for myself and everything came in wonderful condition and the cards were brand new and smelt new and i got it reasonably quickly!
"AMAZING!!! I am so happy I have this tarot deck, it is gorgeous and magical."
Love the artwork. These cards are easy for me to intuitively read them. They are now my favorite deck. Ordering more of MJ Culliane's cards.
I absolutely ADORE these. Every single card is unique and totally stunning. The cards are too thick or too thin which is awesome! I am so excited to use these!
The artwork is incredible and follows the Rider-Waite deck logically enough to make readings uncomplicated. The cards themselves are sturdy and will hold up for a long time.
I love how this deck specifically helps me use my intuition. I feel very connected to this deck and this spirit animal. Beautifully written guidebook as well.

"There is a lot to love about the Crow Tarot. The images are just stunning, and generally follow the Rider Waite Smith system. The little guidebook that comes with the deck is very thorough and well-written, smaller than a full-sized guidebook but larger than a ""little white book,"" giving just enough information to interpret the cards without making a major study of it. She includes one 8-card Crow Tarot spread.The artist does a masterful job of making the crows depicted on the cards convey a lot of the traditional meaning of the cards through their body language. For example, the Page of Wands card shows a crow cawing, beak wide open, echoing this card's meaning as a messenger. The crow on the 5 of Cups clearly looks sorrowful, the Magician looks confident and masterful, the Knight of Swords flies swiftly alongside his steed, all done with the images of black crows yet really imparting the feeling of each card. I love the Death card, which appears to show the spirit of a crow rising from the bare skeleton of a dead crow, and the Moon card, with the face of a crow in profile on the large moon.At first I wasn't sure I liked the very busy background of most of the cards. They're gorgeous, but with so much going on I initially found them distracting. But by focusing more on the crows themselves, the backgrounds recede and the cards are really quite clear to read. I think for me the one exception is the 8 of Wands, where the crow appears to be flying right into the oncoming wands. The guidebook says ""The crow flies swiftly through the air on currents of energy brought by the 8 wands. This card brings with it a vitality of spirit..."" To me the crow appears to be in danger of being struck by the wands, and seems to be flying ""against the tide"" so to speak, rather than flying in sync with the wands. But that's a minor exception. On the High Priestess card, the crow wears what looks like a bridal veil or mantilla, which I found kind of amusing. But it nonetheless conveys the idea of her being set apart. Instead of holding the traditional scroll, she stands on a table holding the same elemental implements as the Magician. But unlike his expanded wings, her body language is self-contained.The box is sturdy and well-made with a nice matte finish, definitely suitable for long-term storage of the cards. The card stock is of a good thickness, and features a lovely reversible backing in a black/ grey/ tan feather pattern. My only concern about the cards is that after just a few shuffles, there was some very slight chipping of the upper card edges. I hope they stand the test of time, but I would take some care in shuffling.If you love crows as I do, or simply love decks with bird or animal imagery, you will love this deck."
"Crow might not have the mystical allure of Eagle or Owl, but the truth is that Crow has much more interaction with mere mortals and, therefore, has much more impact on their lives. Cullinane fell under their spell in childhood and knew that they needed to be the anchor in her first tarot deck. It is a contract with the natural world that has served her well. The unique artistry of this deck has made it a bestseller since it first hit retailer’s shelves. And the appeal of the deck shows no signs of wearing off.Dynamic, insightful, and sometimes showing a bit of tongue-in-cheek humor, the deck builds on the basic Rider-Waite-Smith format to add a new perspective to the classic symbolism of that landmark deck.I started studying tarot in 1970. I may not have seen it all but I have seen more than enough of it. This deck broke through my jaded mindset to show me something new and exciting. If you love tarot, this is a deck you don’t want to miss.(TarotWise.com received a free copy of this deck.)"

   Could be a bit smaller for easier shuffling, and I would like to see the names of the suits"
"I LOVE crows. I am not an avid tarot reader but I have casually used the same Rider Waite deck for twenty years. I was not seeking a new deck at all but I saw this unexpectedly and immediately had to have it. I had just recently started to re-connect with tarot recently and I took this as a sign that I should have new cards!The artwork was not what I expected - it's more collage style than illustrated, but still lovely. I really like the pattern on the card backs. At first I thought some of the major arcana cards were missing roman numerals, but then I figured out that was only the case for The Fool (that one is zero...oops, duh lol.)The cards feel very good. I love that slippery feel of a new deck of playing cards. At first I did not like the size of the deck. I have pretty small hands and it would be difficult if not impossible to shuffle these ""casino-style"" as so many people like to do. Maybe you could do that but it would end up bending the cards quite a bit? I realized eventually that there is no ""right"" way to shuffle, and that I didn't like the way my old deck had gotten bent from that style of shuffling anyway. I am a lot more gentle with these cards and I am so OK with that! I don't do readings for other people so I'm not concerned with the ""showmanship"" of shuffling them all cool.As far as the booklet goes, the meanings work fine, there's only so much you can put in such a tiny booklet... I use other resources online to round out my understanding of the cards, since this deck mirrors the explanations from the Rider-Waite set.I can take my cards with me every day, thanks to the sturdy little box they come in, which is pretty cute in itself.Overall I am very happy that I decided to make this my daily tarot. It really resonates with me in a way that my old deck never did."
"I pre-ordered my deck from the seller. I was a little hesitant because I don't usually like animal-based decks--but this deck was better than I had hoped for! The artwork is simply stunning. The card meanings are easy to understand and remember, and they're based on the traditional RWS system. The cards feel terrific in my hands and have a general happy aura that feels good when you use them. I'm so happy that I took a chance on this deck!"
"I love this deck. I bought it on a rainy day in a small shop in Portsmouth, NH. I feel decks have to call to me before I buy them and this one did. I’m so glad I bought this instead of a silly one I was considering. It some ways, it jumped out and said, “Take me.” I think crows are mystical beings and I am fascinated by the artwork here. It all makes perfect sense and it’s well done. Also appreciate the explainer book that comes with the deck. I know the meanings of the Tarot generally but it’s interesting to read what the artist intended. Perfect for me."
"I saw this deck at a boutique while I was on vacation and had to try it. I must say I was pleasantly surprised by how well I connected to this deck. The artwork is stunning, and it shuffles... like... a... dream! I love the size and how well they glide! This is the first full-size deck I've bought aside from my beginning set, The Rider Tarot Deck, and a mini set for me to carry in my purse. This deck reignited my love for the craft. Very happy with my purchase."
"The first thing this reader noticed was the sturdy box the cards are housed in and the card stock they are printed on, which is ideal in size and flexibility. The artwork is phenomenal and the accompanying book is clear and concise. Overall, this is a great deck. I will purchased again. Highly recommended!"
"The artwork on these cards is gorgeous and nuanced to really emphasize the meaning of each card. She is able to convey such a range of emotion, tone, and intent behind each card so that they felt immediately comfortable when doing a reading. The deck is also very well produced, feeling great in hand. No complaints!I bought my deck from a local shop, not Amazon. Shop local!"
Art based on  the Rider Waite type cards so easy to interpret. Beautiful complex art though back side is boring. Nice card stock. Larger than some other cards but I typically side shuffle so no issue for me. My favorite out of 25 decks.
This is my second tarot deck. I just got this recently and the cards are very beautiful and smooth so they're easy to shuffle. The imagery is a little hard to register but I think that's just because it's so new to me. I can't wait to use it and get used to the cards. It's a great deal for 15$ I'd highly recommend this deck!
"This item was given to me as a gift from a family member. The cards themselves are durable and well made, and the art on them is absolutely gorgeous; even the back of the cards is pretty, too. The box they come in is nice as well, and the book that comes with it is a nice addition for anyone starting with tarot or even a seasoned expert! Absolutely love them!"
Absolutely stunning Card stock is fantastic the reading on these cards is great I’m thrilled with them nice glossy easy to use perfect size
Absolutely beautiful and felt a connection as soon as I seen them. I had read reviews I just wasn't sure but they were everything I expected and more! You definitely want these!! The book is awesome as well....the smaller on that comes with it is good but the bigger one you can order additionally is awesome and a must have companion!
Powerful Deck!  Absolutely Stunning Artwork!  Good Card Stock!
"This is a beautiful deck, difficult to shuffle. But beautiful"
Easily the most beautiful deck I own. I wish the art existed as large poster prints so I could see it more often.
I love everything about this deck!
"I purchased 2 of these decks at the same time, one for myself and one for my daughter, and we both absolutely LOVE them! The card stock and size are perfect  for both of us, and they are beyond beautiful. My daughter has a thing for crows, so when i showed her this deck after finding them online, she fell instantly in love. I only purchased them for myself as well, because while researching  the deck for her, i found them to be too beautiful to pass up for the price. I honestly didn't expect them to be easy to read,  as I'm still learning,  and birds don't really have much of a facial expression, so i kind of just expected them to sit pretty in the box most of the time, and only taken out occasionally to admire. Oh, how very wrong I was... These cards are SAUCY when reading! There's definitely an attitude living within this deck. While getting acquainted with them after they first arrived, I swear they actually hinted that they wanted to be kept separate from my other decks. The Mary El is my soul deck, so that's the deck that  lives on my altar, but these are definitely sitting close by...separate from the others as requested. I'm tellin' ya...saucy. And full of attitude. If you're looking for blunt truth, you'll definitely get it from the crows."
"Beautiful artwork and such great energy. I think it’s a fine deck for beginners as well. I love crows and the cards are very detailed. The deck is on the larger side however, as someone with smaller hands and who shuffles carefully/slowly, it’s not an issue. Wonderful price tag too as I paid about $15 at the time of purchase."
"I really like this deck. It very textured and I was intimidated but as they played it was an easy story to tell. Beautiful cards, also playful and dark and romantic, all of it. They are a skoash, a smidge bigger than usual decks, have to shuffle them differently, but a very nice deck. The cards a a bit thinner, but not flimsy."
"I honestly can’t think of anything I would change about it! The size works perfectly fine for me, the artwork is gorgeous, the depictions are wonderful.... I can’t wait to use it! 😍"
"Very beautiful tarot deck, wonderfully illustrated, with large, easy to handle cards.The deck comes with a small instruction book, explaining the meaning of each card."
Very attractive cards and good card stock
There was nothing that I dislike about this purchase. Shipping was perfect the product was packaged correctly no issues with it at all. The deck itself is more than what I could asked for. I am very pleased with this purchase.
These are gorgeous! As a Corvid enthusiast I couldn’t be happier with the quality and artwork. I will say that if you have small hands they may be difficult for you to shuffle as they are pretty large.
"These cards are really beautifulThe art work is spectacular, the colors used are lovely. They are quality card stock and shuffle nicely. The included book is well made and in depth."
And I love that this deck shows their beauty in a traditional way. TY!!
Love the art. Booklet is short and to the point. Thick card stock.
"I think the illustrations are gorgeous. Abstract enough to spur your imagination, but very recognizable symbols. Can't wait to work with it more."
"The cards are excellent and thick, and the printing is so beautiful. The art is so pretty as well. It is packaged in a nice, thick cardboard holder."
"If you have small hands, this deck is large!But the energy of this deck is calming and beautiful.Excellent price compared to many other websites and gift shops.Fast shipping100% recommend🖤🖤"
"I love crows, therefore, I love these cards. Please check all the photos that I've taken. Thank you."
"Wow A stunning beautiful deck, the cardstock is perfect and shuffles like a dream, lovely and slippy. The size is ideal for my small hands but large enough to get so fully immersed into the detailed gorgeous imagery.You don’t have to be a bird lover like me to appreciate MJ’s unique style of collage artwork, her fun sense of humour adds little touches that will make you smile too.I have never liked collage tarot or oracle decks and I originally dismissed this on my wish list, then I watched a few flip throughs and I literally fell in love with MJ’s unique painting finished off digitally offering a meaningful story to each card making explanation easy to read intuitively. Read it simply for quick fast reading or look further into the painting and see so much more. But you also get this lovely chunky well made mini book with 86 pages of detailed explanations that will add to your own intuition. MJ’s way of explanation is so easy to understand and so relatable...she gets us.In the book you also get a brilliant Crow layout which I love to use as It looks amazing and reads like a dream.Sharing our wood with these cheeky, adorable birds resonated with my heart and I’ve never had readings flow so easy with any other decks.I also have to mention the stunning backs made of a deep browny- black crow feather design...perfect.Stunning easy to read deck which will be there as your best friend anytime when you need a hug or some honest friendly advice."
"Really high quality tarot deck. Sturdy and beautiful box and the cardstock is excellent (thick, more matte than glossy and shuffles great). I love the art style (digital collage that feels unique and well executed) and I quite prefer this mass produced version over the independently published one. The card backs, the cardstock and the borders of the cards are much more appealing in this version (in my opinion). It follows the RWS tradition."
"I was delighted to see someone finally made a deck with crows and I was so excited when this deck finally came out..... until I received them and started to go through the deck. The cards themselves are just way too BIG for any daily or practical use. They are bigger than even some Oracle cards I own. This makes them clumsy and hard to even hold and not in the least bit comfortable which was extremely disappointing because I actually bought them to use as my main deck...which now after holding them and trying to work with them...I just cant. They are just way too big. I understand wanting to show off the art work but even the art work is disappointing. The cards themselves are all bordered but in different colors...some have roman numerals and some dont its almost as if 10 different people worked on the art work of this deck and none of them collaborated together beforehand. The different colored borders make the entire deck look sloppy and its super distracting to even attempt to read. The art work on the cards really do not depict what the actual card is supposed to mean..less experienced readers are going to have a hell of a time reading these cards especially if this is a first deck for them because the art on the cards do not speak for the actual meaning of what the cards actually are supposed to mean..it is the same with the teeny little booklet you get along with the deck..its almost as if they added the booklet along as an afterthought and forgot that it actually needed one. The booklet itself has different meanings for each card compared to what the cards are actually supposed to mean in every other deck which is ridiculous. I have compared the meanings in the crow tarot to 6 other tarot decks...the crow tarot is completely off course when it comes to each cards meaning. The art work on the crow tarot cards do nothing to even help..the art work on the cards should actually tell a story as to the meaning of the card...these do not at all.  The card stock itself is cheap and almost sticky...really not what I would have ever imagined for any tarot deck.The art work itself is lacking for me..the colors are nice just not cohesive and all in all lacking. The art work is blurry on every card and this really takes away from the actual art of the cards.Sadly overall this deck is not what I had expected and I had really hoped for more considering I had purchased it to be my main daily use deck and now after going through the entire deck and teeny booklet.. it will not be. The deck is too big and too clumsy and really just un useable for me.  IDid not want another set of Oracle cards, yet this is what this deck is in size aspect and art work. Seriously disappointed all around that there really are no redeeming qualities that I can see personally in this entire deck. I will be looking for a quality, daily use deck yet again. Sadly enough. I was really expecting more out of this deck."
"This is a stunning deck! I bought this deck because the images spoke to me - and they're even more beautiful in person than seen here. The cardstock is a lovely quality, more robust and not flimsy. The presentation box is beautiful, lovely details about upright and reverse in the accomopanying booklet. The back is a brown/black leaf/geometric pattern...not too busy. Overall I'm really delighted with the deck."
"This is a really stunning and unique deck! It comes in a sturdy box, not a tuck case and includes a nice little booklet with a good amount of information. The cards themselves are printed on fairly decent card stock and the artwork is absolutely gorgeous! Even the back design is attractive and not over-bearing, which is sometimes the case in tarot decks. Overall these cards are just very beautiful and aesthetically pleasing. They are quite big, but I have small hands and can just about manage to shuttle them without too much of an issue. I highly recommend this deck to anyone who loves crows or tarot in general. A must have for any collector!"
Yes yes yes an yeeesssss ... So glad I bought these. So gorgeous and such unique work.
"I was unsure for a quite long time, whether to buy it or not, I added and removed from my basket, I don't even know how many times I added this to my basket and removed it.  It's a dark deck but I do get more accurate readings with dark decks.  I like crows & ravens.  There was a bit of smell in the box, but not so distrubing.  I love it."
This deck is stunning.  Very good quality card stock and booklet in a sturdy box.  Can not fault it.  I love the imagery and representations of the tarot.  Its now my main deck to use.  Love it.
"I opened the deck knowing I would love it, I love crows and I loved the colour of this deck. I was very wrong, the drawings try to resemble some sort of watercolour paintings but they just look pixeled and bad. The cards feel cheap and look like they have been mass-produced (yeah I know obviously they are mass-produced but get me) because they are slightly misaligned.I looked more and bought the Bianco Nero tarot deck which is an absolute win for me."
"Absolutely in love with this deck, the card stock is solid and the crow imagery really is stunning. I don’t usually focus a lot on the guide books for tarot decks but I like how this one is written, it’s not so generic in its meanings but rather tell kind of a story and a lot of those interpretations have resonated with my questions. Would definitely recommend!"
Great quality deck.
Absolutely beautiful cards. Good size. The images are just brilliant. They follow Standard RWS but they have their own subtle differences but some look better for it. And easier to understand. Great for a beginner and pro alike. I knew when I first saw them that I had to have them but I held off. But now I have them and they look amazing. Already bonding. Definitely worth adding to any collection.
Lovely set of cards. Was really drawn to these. can make a wonderful reading with them. I've had happy clients who choose these and lots of compliments on them
"I've got a large number of tarot decks but this deck is by far my favourite. Beautiful imagery and card stock, well worth getting."
Lovely tarot deck - spot on readings. I have trimmed mine though as they are larger than standard tarot cards and I struggled to shuffle them as I have fairly small hands.
Wasn't sure if this would 'speak to me' and the images would be over simplified but have found it to be a good deck to use.
"I ,personally love these cards. They have a vintage look to them on the front. Just wish the sides were an “old yellow “ colour too.Good card stock and vibrant and striking images."
Beautiful cards. Lots of crows around where I live and an online reader uses them
"Absolutely beautiful deck. Love the accompanying book, though this is not my first deck, I love reading how the images came about and they add a new dimension to the traditional rider Waite. Not in the least bit sinister as I usually go for more ethereal designs. Couldn’t be more pleased or connected with these cards. In fact I think my others are jealous."
Arrived on time and matched description
Beautiful cards. Received today but regretfully sending back because sent a deck that had already been opened/used and card missing. This is fault with Amazon not the cards so not reduced the star rating.
"A wonderful, evocative deck. Beautiful artwork (rich with meaning, subtle colours, striking imagery); good quality card & a perfect size to work with. I really like the 'crow' spread explained in the booklet, though it'll take a bit of practice!"
"Lovely cards, good connection with the art work"
"A lovely little box of tarot cards. The artwork is exceptional, the quality of the cards and prints are very good. You won't be disappointed."
"My favourite animals by far are crows and ravens. I am absolutely ecstatic to finally find a deck dedicated to them!The cards themselves - not super thick, but still feel solid. The finish is shiny but textured. They are a bit big for my liking, but I don't have any issues handling or shuffling them.I personally like the art. The art style is simple, almost watercolour-like with nice colours. The lines aren't super clear, but that seems to be the style the artist chose. Kind of wish they were sharper, though. The borders look like varying colours of parchment, which I think is something unique.I've always had issue distinguishing meanings through the pictures on the cards, so I can't vouch for that, personally. For the few readings I've done so far, the booklet has quick descriptions and is easy enough to understand.The one person complained about a couple of things which I want to touch on. I checked over the numbers on the cards and they are all roman numbers on my set. The card stock doesn't feel cheap nor sticky.Oddly enough, my deck came with a second Fool card. They were in order, but just a random extra Fool partway in."
Excellent
Love this deck
Beautifully designed and the book is very easy to follow
Arrived on time in perfect condition.
A very good frist Tarot Deck. Pictures are fantastic.
Beautiful Artwork
"MJ Cullinane has created a unique tarot deck, and while based on the traditional Rider-Waite-Smith deck, this Crow and Raven deck is truly something special. I love how each card is a gorgeous work of art on its own yet part of a beautiful cohesive whole. The real magic of this deck is how expressive each card is - the colours, symbols (hers, traditional and alchemical) and body language of the birds all speak loudly and clearly. I find they generously and easily share their meanings and support intuition, so that they reading them is a simple storytelling. Their overall energy is positive and I’m so enjoying them for myself and other querents.While a little larger than some of my decks, the cards are easy to hold and use. The stock is thick, the feel is smooth and inviting. The small book that comes with it gives both upright and reversed meanings in line with the Rider-Waite-Smith deck yet with its own crow and raven spin that I’ve found adds depth to my readings. There’s also an interesting energy spread in the shape of a crow/raven that provides a great overall view, as a bird in flight would. The box they come in is sturdy and beautiful too. All together a highly appealing package.Right out of the box the printing ink smell was a bit strong. I spread the cards out on a table and left the box open and the book out and the smell soon dissipated. I found I grew to enjoy having the deck out, though, to pull a card or three daily. So now when I’m not taking the deck somewhere for a reading, I like spreading the cards out face down for easy access.I bought this deck the first time for a friend, and when we looked through it I was hooked! I ordered another for me right there and then!! Just buy it - you’ll be so excited you did. 😊"
"Beautiful design, been using it for two days and still discovering more details.Its my first time reading tarot in a serious manor, and these cards have so much character and sass towards me and i love itThey are big, which i don't mind theres just more you can look at on the card itself."
"Ho acquistato questo mazzo perché da sempre affascinata da corvi e cornacchie (e corvidi in generale). Trovo che il Crow Tarot sia un mazzo fortemente evocativo, e anche se conoscere già a grandi linee i significati delle carte può aiutare, non è indispensabile per utilizzarlo. Infatti, oltre alle suggestioni offerte dalle immagini stesse (che seguono il modello RWS), nella confezione è incluso il libretto con i significati delle carte in questione. La carte sono grandi, quasi 13 cm di altezza per c/a 8 cm di larghezza, con un bellissimo dorso che ricorda il piumaggio grigio/nero dei volatili ritratti.Un mazzo perfetto per tutti gli appassionati che sentono una connessione con i corvi: assolutamente consigliato!"
"I've read tarot for 20 years, used and own dozens of decks, and I highly recommend this beautiful, well thought out Crow Tarot deck. The design and theme is based on the Rider Waite Tarot. Each card is accurate to their respective meanings, and you can tell that every card was born from a deep respect of crows, ravens, and tarot. The imagery is stunning and deep! This is an excellent deck for beginners and advanced readers alike. The colours are lovely, the different coloured borders are part of the artistry, the cards are titled and numbered correctly, there are no issues with missing information. The art is clear, in focus, and the medium used is well-done digital collage. Each card is a piece of art. The deck is of above-average quality, the stock is just the right thickness. It's sturdy, but not stiff, and it's easy to work with. The cards are average to smaller than many tarot/oracle decks on the market. A little larger than playing cards, as most decks are. I included a photo with my hand for scale, my hands are fairly small. The pattern on the back of the deck is a beautiful, calming feather pattern, which gives a nice vibe while shuffling. The book that accompanies the deck is more substantial that most deck/book combinations and does well for summarized meanings. This is an excellent deck to add to your collection. I love crows and ravens, and MJ Cullinane tastefully represents them and the tarot well"
"The Crow tarot is a great alternative to standard RW decks.  The meanings are still the same, but the people have been replaced by crows.  I like the painted looking artwork and bold colours.  Cardstock feels medium thickness.  I feel I have to break in the cards by shuffling a lot.  Mine like to stick and suddenly fly out.  Only thing that bothers me is some of the royals are hard to tell apart.  Nice addition to my collection.  Anyone wanting a RW deck without humans should get this."
"gorgeous colourful art. Thick stock. Comes in a Nice solid box not one of those thin cardboard packs. Inspired by rider Waite symbolism but not constrained by it. new favourite deck hands down. (Only bit of trouble might be the court cards, it’s hard to impart much personality to the crows and the symbolism is limited there so it’s useful to know those meanings already. )"
No recuerdo cuántos años pasaron pero a mí me tocó el estreno de este tarot era una novedad .....en aquel entonces mi pareja me insistió q lo comprará q el me lo reglaba le dije q no.....yo coleccionaba tarot....me lo hubieran robado en el 2009.Ahora q lo he vuelto a encontrar ya lo tengo en mis manos está hermosa de muy buen material.....me conecte con este tarot es sencillo fácil de interpretar....después de tantos años me considero principiante.....y.....este es una muy buena opción la imagen en las cartas t van guiando y el libro es un completo ideal .....
"I love everything about this deck the 9 of Pentacles is just gorgeous love the energy of it. I kinda expect it is to be a matt finish rather than glossy finish cause the card is of vintage old background colour but it is not over glossy and it doesn't affect the energy of this deck so still acceptable. Overall, a deck to be added to your collection."
"Difícil de interpretar, basado en rider-whita, tamaño más grande de lo normal, yo que tengo manos grandes me cuesta trabajo trabajar con el, la imágenes son bonitas y dan misticismo a las lecturas, pero siento que pierden la esencia y simbolismos de los arcanos originales del raider-white, esa fue la razón principal. De que no me gustara al 100%, siento que le falta mucho simbolismo y que en algo nos arcanos el simbolismo es confuso o totalmente contrario al original.Lo recomendaría solo si eres experto en raider-white y sabes los significados bien sin necesidad de apoyarte en las imágenes de cada arcano"
No soy de Gustarme Los Cuervos pero esta es la Excepción ya que es un mazo bello donde inspira por las imagenes los colores y los detalles de cada una de las cartas el arte de este mazo tiene un toque especial y que tiene su belleza particular no es un mazo mas tiene algo que atrae varios detalles que tiene es que son cartas Grandes mas anchas que los tarots normales a mi me gustan independientemente del tamaño y pues me gusta su reverso muy bello con calidad y viene en una caja rigida con un libro empastado y todo el una buena presentación  lo recomiendo
"This is my first deck of tarot cards and I'm absolutely in LOVE with it. I find it quite easy to read even if some cards don't have names written on them, but numbers. It's quite easy to differentiate the swords, from cups, pentagram and wands as the drawings are very self explanatory. The cards are big and sturdy, the images are so pretty... I really feel like I'm holding a little gem. Overall I'm extremely happy with my purchase."
Die Karten sind wunderschön und vielseitig gestaltet und sprechen mich persönlich sehr an. Jedoch sind die Bilder durch den grafischen Stil leicht verschwommen.Die Karten sind für kleine Hände ziemlich groß und somit leider schwer zu mischen. Dadurch wirken die Karten und die jeweiligen Bilder einfach etwas eindrucksvoller und schöner.Die Karten kommen in einer schönen stabilen Schachtel und einem kleinen Büchlein als Leitfaden. Die Karten + Buch sind jedoch auf Englisch!Im gesamten bin ich aber sehr zufrieden.
"Non ero molto convinta di questi tarocchi, le immagini che girano su internet non rendono giustizia alla grafica delle carte. Devo dire che tra i tanti oracoli e tarocchi che possiedo questo per me  è tra i più belli che possiedo. Buona la qualità della carta, buono il packaging, buona la rifinitura e mi ripeterò ma bellissime le immagini. Sarà che adoro i corvi.  Consigliatissimi."
"This deck is gorgeous.  The artwork is beautiful. The backs are lovely.  Quality of cards is great - smooth shuffling right away.I haven't spent a lot of time with them, they arrived this morning as I was getting ready for work (definitely ended up a bit late)Seeing the big angry review someone left - I don't really understand the frustration.  There are some colour differences in the borders, but it seemed intentional as I was going through them.  The artist carefully chose from the traditional imagery of Raider Waite - and I feel like this deck is more connected than the typical new ones to the old symbology.  The little book that comes with the deck has a nice artist interpretation of the cards, there's a little spin - but where she chose to use the common symbols, it's easy enough to connect them to the traditional interpretations.It's a lovely, vibrant, personality filled deck that definitely tells a story even without a guidebook or prior assumptions of meanings.I am so excited to spend more time with these cards."
"I am stunned by the beauty of this deck! Every card is unique and tells a story and the colours are rich and vibrant. The card stock is good quality and not flimsy, so the cards shuffle nicely.  It's on the larger side for a tarot deck but I have no issues with shuffling it. I think if you have smaller hands you might need to shuffle it more like an oracle deck.I have enjoyed reading the book and the decks meanings. Some of the meanings written are slightly different than traditional decks, but that's one of the reasons to own more than one deck. Ultimately reading tarot is not about looking to a book for meaning. It's about intuition and letting the image and ""suggested meaning"" act simply as a catalyst towards what you see in your mind and feel in your heart."
"So here I have attached two photographs of this amazing deck about the back side,the cover and the cards.I had been eyeing on this deck for so long because of the curiosity to work with energy of the crows.The cards have many images to nudge intuition, even though the guidebook is exhaustive. Do buy"
"El viaje del cuervo toma otros matices, entregando pasajes y aventuras penas y alegrías con emociones de diferentes colores, tiene un poco de su propia simbología a su ves de la simbología clásica, sus mensajes son muy comprensibles y de rápida interpretación, en ocasiones profundos. El material es de buena calidad y un poco más grande a una carta normal."
"Amazing artwork on each and every card. A gorgeous tarot deck, beautiful art illustrations, clear depicted meanings and pleasing to work with. These cards have a semi-matte gloss finish, easy to shuffle, a little bigger than a standard-sized tarot deck but still easy to use and handle. The deck comes in a sturdy box and with an 86 page guidebook. The guidebook is packed with information and easy to read and understand. I love this deck and work with it daily. I'd highly recommend this deck for any tarot enthusiast or professional."
"LOVE THESE CARDS!!! The style is absolutely beautiful! I love how the images of the cards look hand drawn and have this almost oil painting style look to them. I've used the deck to answer some questions and so far they have been pretty insightful and accurate! I love the small story that the guidebook gives, but I wish it would give more in depth information of the symbolism behind the image. I bought the comeplete guidebook 2nd edition of the crow tarot and it's absolutely amazing! It really helps me connect more with my cards"
"Excelente mazo me ha encantado, la calidad es suprema, tienen una energía muy positiva, el grosor de las cartas es el adecuado y bastante buena.Las ilustraciones son plenamente bellas y artísticasEl manual de interpretación es de buen tamaño al igual que sus letras, el idioma en el que viene es en inglés."
"This is a unique deck featuring crows in a RWS system. I liked the idea, never thought that I would like a deck featuring crows. The artwork is unique, the card quality is good and the little guidebook is detailed. I love the decks from US Games, they have great production quality."
"I was really excited about this deck after seeing it on a few different websites, but it was selling out so fast. Thankfully Amazon had copies and I’m so happy with mine. The illustrations are gorgeous and well thought out. They allude to the traditional Rider Waite deck, but still have a life of their own. Very much recommend if you have some (even if just a little) experience reading tarot and you identify with crows, ravens or darker imagery."
"Me encantó, el tamaño de las cartas me gustó mucho y el arte de cada una es diferente pero intuitivo los cuervos son muy especiales en cada carta, además llegó antes de lo que esperaba.  Definitivamente se convirtió en mi tarot favorito. La calidad de las cartas es bueno. Lo recomiendo para quienes buscan algo diferente."
"Edition originale en anglais. Une édition française est sortie il y a peu de temps.C'est un superbe tarot ! Une belle pièce de collections ! Les cartes sont d'une format ni trop grand ni trop petit, de bonne qualité. Les illustrations sont très parlantes, atypiques, elles sont douces malgré la noirceur du corbeau...Un petit livre (je dis bien un ""livre"", et non un ""livret"") est présent pour expliquer en quelques mots les cartes.Les descriptifs se traduisent rapidement et facilement sans soucis avec GoogleTraduction ou Deepl."
"Love..Love,Love,these cards! They came quickly. Yes they are a bit large but then I have 18 other decks of Tarot and Oracle cards and some are big some a bit smaller. Doesn't really affect the integrity of the cards.  The pictures are really well done. I get a really good energy from them!"
"Lo compré para hacer un regalo, la persona que lo recibió está muy FELIZ.Las ilustraciones son fáciles de asociar con el tarot original y son muy artísticas.Tamaño grande,  por lo que permite una buena manipulación."
"El Crow Tarot, es una obra de arte. Cada carta con su estilo vintage artístico, te transmite los mensajes muy bien. El tamaño del mazo es un poco más grande que el estándar, aunque tampoco es imposible de barajar. Algo que tiene especial es que las cartas son muy suaves y fáciles de barajar, cómo no he conocido ningún otro. Volví a comprar otra copia del mazo porque en realidad vale la pena. Este mazo esta apegado al Rider Waite."
"I absolutely love this deck! Beautiful expressive artwork. Perfect size for me, love the weight of the cards and excellent quality printing. I have nothing negative to say about these cards. I can totally relate to the energy they display"
"Me encantó el material de las cartas, el reverso es muy bonito, el arte es muy apegado a la simbología Rider a partes las imágenes son bellísimas, transmiten al instante, de los mejores mazos en mi opinión y llego antes de tiempo, incluye una caja de cartón muy buena y linda, el libro guía sin imágenes más que la tirada del cuervo y el mazo. Sin duda una excelente compra y llego antes de tiempo.En cuanto al tamaño si es un poco más grande que el común en tarot pero dentro de lo manejable y cómodo."
"This is a very nice deck that comes with a small but well-detailed booklet that explains the meanings of the cards and includes a few card spreads. This deck would be alright for beginner readers of Tarot. The art is beautiful and there is no human imagery on the cards, which was important to me. The cardstock feels like quality but they are a little hard to shuffle (I have small hands lol) I would recommend this deck to anyone."
These were exactly what I hoped them to be. Card is a good size and didn't stick to themselves out of the box.Messages are clear and the little book that comes in the box is a perfect reference.By far my favorite deck to date.
I am in love with this tarot i was waited for so long to get this deck finally it was available and loved to see it was superb card stock quality love the US games they did superb job its good for beginners and proffesional tarot reader too
"The artwork is stunning, the card stock is great quality, and it’s not shiny nor does it glare for using on camera. I absolutely love this deck, and will continue to use it!"
"I like that the quality of the paper is good. The cards seem resistant and slightly flexible. They are bigger Tarot cards, but I like that.The art is very nice and in general you can easily identify the cards and associate them with the Raider-Waite deck,"
Beautiful cards! Lovely art! I had read a review that the cardstock was subpar- it was not. Highly recommended set for any tarot enthusiast:)
They are sooooo beautiful and creative. I just would definitely not recommend these if you have small hands like I do because I cannot shuffle them because they won't fit in my hand but if you have big hands go for it they're beautiful the book is very informative and works perfectly.
Very very energetic deckVery much spiritual touch feelDeep insite to openup with pictures with action of crow/ crows!!!!!nice deck....one must buy it and go with depth👍🦄🧚‍♀️♥️
specially death card is so amazing the message come through is so so satisfying... and other cards are good to just knight cards need little work but then feel like how crow will take it but ..... on the whole cards are amazing
"This deck is just stunning!!! Beautiful drawings and symbolisms, absolutely a must have for all the tarot collectors!"
"The drawings are amazing, the quality of the paper is excellent, and the size of the box is the exact same size of the cards and book, so you know what you're getting.I'd  say it's the perfect gift for someone who's looking into buying a tarot deck, AND loves ravens.Totally worth it!"
I don't do serious tarot readings so can't speak to that aspect but just appreciate the deck for its artwork. Cards are a nice size with good quality paper and printing; the box is also very sturdy.

   Esta muy bonito, lo compré mas que nada por el arte en las cartas y no me decepcionó, la caja muy bonita, me gusta que sea resistente para guardarlas"
"Das Raben bzw Crow Tarot ist nun mein absoluter Favorit. Es ist einfach wunderschön bebildert, die Deutungen sind gut zu erfassen, die Karten haben eine tolle Dicke. Das Format ist zum mischen leider etwas unhandlich, da die Karten doch sehr groß sind, aber darüber sehe ich hinweg. Positiv überrascht hat mich ebenfalls das kleine kompakte Begleitbuch und die Box in der man die Karten verwahren kann."
"My only complaint is the size, however, I believe Tarot cards should be unwieldy. The Crows play with your hands.Every single card is unique, immediately accessible, works strongly on intuition.It is a tricky deck, a smart deck."
"I absolutely love this tarot desk! It is by far the best one I own and the one I connect with the most. I wasn’t sure about buying it when I saw someone said the font was different on the cards but that is wrong. Sure, on the minor arcana there is only a number but you can figure out the suit pretty easily with the drawing on the cards. Speaking of, I absolutely love the art and style of this deck!!"
"El diseño es muy bonito, contiene algunos detalles del tarot rider, pero respetendo mucho el propio estilo. Las tarjetas son hermosas aunque muy grandes, al menos para mis manos, ya que se me complica poder barajarlas rápido. El libro guía es claro y te permite entender el mensaje de cada carta."
"Acquistate per un regalo risultato molto apprezzato.ben confezionate eleganti e di ottima qualità,introvabili a questo prezzo.ottimo"
"Me encanta, hasta el momento es mi mazo favorito. Las imágenes son preciosas y el material es resistente. La guía es pequeña, pero tiene información suficiente. Lo único negativo es que las cartas son demasiado grandes, lo que hace que sean difíciles de mezclar para alguien de manos pequeñas."
"Haven’t used the deck yet. Beautiful artwork. Little disappointed that the 88 page guidebook is the same size as the cards, which means it would probably only be 15 pages long if it was a normal book size."
"Spettacolari, di una bellezza unica, super consigliate.Arrivate puntuali, cofanetto bellissimo a dir poco, buona qualità delle carte."
"This must be the most beautiful deck I have and I have a lot, I can't even express how beautiful and so accurate it is. Just go for it."
"Beautiful illustrations and deck design. The images are clear, colourful and pleasing to the eye. The details are simple to understand, yet provoke thought. If you are looking to get a set, this is a good one."
I have been looking for a deck that suits me for a few years and I am happy to say these are the perfect fit. The cards are quality stock and the illustrations are breathtaking.  And the explanations for the cards just clicked with me. I feel super lucky to have found this set.
Beautiful deck with lots of illustrations. I love all the crows and various ways they are drawn. This makes these cards easy to read and for me as a tarot beginner they work really well. The cards are a nice size as well and very flexible compared to my other deck but I don't mind that.
Very much enjoy these cards: beautifully illustrated and the descriptions are well written.
"Un tarot fascinant, les images sont de toute beauté et très pertinentes.Un travail remarquable.Les cartes sont un peu plus grandes qu’un tarot classique, et très robuste, un jeu qui devrait vous accompagner très longtemps !Il est livré dans une belle boîte bien solide ."
"Lovely deck, with all the classic and traditional symbolism one would expect.I simply adore it, easily my new favorite deckExactly what I was hoping to find one day in a deck."
The illustrations are nice. Arrived quickly.  A nice addition to my tarot collection
I absolutely love this deck!!! amazing artwork!!!!
"I'm very satisfied. Fast delivered, excellent seller, good quality. Thanks a lot."
shouldnt have revealed eventhings do existsaw first time the sony channel shows upwaiting for the cardsMurder of crows
"Beautiful cards. Great quality.Remember, they need to be acquired as a gift, so get someone else to order them if they are for you."
"Las cartas están HERMOSAS de excelente calidad y aunque están inspiradas en el mazo Waite, tienen una interpretación profunda. Estoy muy muy contenta!"
"Hola, yo soy tarotista, y escuche que no muchas personas se sentian conectadas con esta baraja. Sin embargo a mi me encanta. Los cuervos son de por si animales que representant clairvoyance asi que que mas lindo que una baraja de cuervos."
I absolutely love this Tarot deck. It has become one of my favourites. The artwork is so beautifully done.I would highly recommend this deck for yourself and it would also make a great gift for a friend who enjoys tarot.
"The deck is beautiful. Good quality, great size and the little book that comes with it is a great companion guide. Not to mention the lovely artwork! This is already one of my top 3 decks. I love it!"
"I’m very pleased with this deck! Sturdy box, nice card stock, beautiful cards!"
"I want a new tarot deck, and go trough so many, finally, made my choice and bought this one, and I'm totally in love with. High quality, and instantly connect to the deck.🖤"
Es un gran tarot que no debe faltar en la colección.
This is exactly what I was looking for! Cards are strong and artwork is vibrant and beautiful!
"Esta hermoso, la pasta gruesa, cartas grandes, los cuervos y todas las imágenes hermosas. Un tarot totalmente de cuervos. Las imágenes te transmiten un sentimiento que pareciera que ves una película."
"Es maravilloso este tarot, la calidad en la ilustración, del material en el que está impreso, la presentación. Excelente, llego antes de lo esperado en perfectas condiciones y una buenísima atención, gracias."
"Very amazing connection to these cards, they seem to like my energy."
"This is an incredible deck! The quality of the cards is better than I could have hoped for, and the illustrations are gorgeous! I highly recommend this deck to anyone that practices tarot."
"Sehr tolle Bilder, Karten liegen gut in der Hand und lassen sich super mischen! Absolut empfehlenswert"
"Wanted this deck for a long time. Definately not dissapointed. Great looking cards, beautiful pictures, nice size cards and of good quality. Would recommend for everybody who loves tarot and crows!!"
"Buena calidad , buen tamaño, buena imagen"
"Molto bello! io amo i corvi, questo e un mazzo molto evocativo per me."
"MY FAVORITE DECK!!!  I HAVE LOVED CROWS SINCE I WAS A CHILD, SO THIS DECK WAS THE PERFECT CHOICE FOR ME.  MJ IS A FANTASTIC ARTIST. HER ILLUSTRATIONS ARE MAGNIFICENT."
"Exactly what I hoped it would be! Absolutely stunning. Reference boom is good, I’ll be getting the separate guidebook for more detail."
Sono carini ma la qualità è pessima. Dopo poche mescolate si sono rovinate
These are beautiful cards! Great card stock quality too.
"Beautiful cards , love them🧿💐"
I love the picturesLove the deck
"Las imágenes son hermosas, muy completas. El material es resistente y fácil de manipular, si llegar a ser demasiado frágil. ¡Me encantó!"
"Ce tarot est très original avec son thème des corbeaux à ma connaissance il est unique. Il m'a tout de suite plu, les illustrations, les couleurs sont juste fascinantes ! Les cartes sont de très bonnes qualité, parfaites au niveau taille et glissent bien. Les explications sont claires et concises. Mon tarot chouchou !"
Beautiful deck! So in love with it!
"Likely because of the COVID issue so I had to deduct 1 star.  Otherwise, product arrived fine, albeit quite late."
Beautiful artwork and cards are the perfect size for my long fingers! It’s a crow enthusiast’s dream come true
Very impressive deck and art. I love the card stock also.
It’s ok don’t love it
"Très très beau jeu de tarot, agréables toucher glacé des cartes, dont on peut voir beaucoup de review sur YouTube. J'ai fait quelques tirages très parlants, et surtout j'adore admirer les illustrations de ce jeu d'une grande beauté.Je suis ravie de l'avoir acquis."
Morrigan enjoys making me squirm through them. She approves.
They are amasing cards.
Beautifully illustrated cards.  Very happy with them.
Loves it
As described. The card designs are wonderful. Bigger then usually but I like them
"Très beau tarot! Les illustrations sont superbes, je l'adore.En plus de cela les cartes sont de bonne qualité, et la taille est idéale. Le tarot est livré dans une boite en carton rigide qui protège bien les cartes, ainsi qu'avec un livret d'explications des lames.Le tout est arrivé dans les temps prévus et en bon état donc je recommande."
Crow themed tarot cards. Love 'em!! Guidebook is so useful.

beautiful artwork!
"ce jeu d'inspiration rider waite sur les corbeau est très beau, la boîte est solide ainsi que les cartes. J'ai trouvé les illustrations très belles. Le jeu ne m'a pas l'air fragile."
je l'adore
"I've bought a lot of these sticker books by Brain Games and other publishers and this issue is the best one yet.  The pictures are more adult with sharp, curvy, and scalloped edges, as well as quite a few smaller pieces.  It seems the publisher paid attention to complaints about some of their other issues and really stepped up their game.  The stickers are a much higher quality printed on thicker paper; the points and detailed curves are precisely scored so that they fit well in the designated spaces, and the adhesive material is sufficient to stick while still giving you a brief opportunity to reposition the stickers.  The colors are vibrant, the pictures are stained glass themed.  While I have only completed one picture (the one that was captured on the cover of the book), I was very happy with the result.  Because of the intricacies of the stickers (all the curves and points), I had to pay more attention to carefully position them - a feat that may be more challenging for a young child.  Focusing on this task was much more meditative than the ones with big simple designs that are more suited to younger kids. I was extremely pleased with the final product and look forward to completing more pictures.  I am also hopeful that this quality is the new standard for Brain Games Sticker books.  Well done!"
Just got this book and have done 3 of the pictures.  Have so many of the books and think this is my favorite with the flowers and nature.  I hope you are working on more.  Can't way.  Maybe scenery.
The stickers didn't match up. Was fun for the most part but definitely a let down since the other books are great!
"I love this coloring book! It is well done and the drawings are exceptionally well done, homey, cozy, beautiful, and it's almost like being right there in them as I happily bring them to life!  For people who relax by coloring and who love their ""home Sweet Home"" it's a must have!"
"This is now my favorite coloring book! I'm sorry my pictures are not good, and the book is on my lap.  I am in the middle of coloring my first page in it which I included a picture of.  The pictures are perforated nicely, easy to tear out smoothly, and printed only on one side, which is a must for me.  the best part is that every picture induces a very COZY feeling of a comfortable home.  31 heartwarming pictures.  To me it's very worth the price for the quality and coziness. :)"
"one of my favorite teresa goodridge books (my favorite is “main Steeet”).this book gives me warm cozy vibes and helps me to totally relax and have fun when i’m coloring. Wide variety of scenes/pictures. If you like to color warm, homey pictures this one is for you. I do so many things with her books. I use blending and layering in these books (a lot of folks don’t like the paper. It is on the thin side but i blend, layer etc with no problem). I use all mediums like prismas, polychromos, pablos, amazon brand pencils, gel pens, paint pens, pasca pens, tombow water based markers, fineliners and alcohol markers. Just use proper precautions depending on your medium. If you want to use markers, slip something between the sheets of paper for protection. i’ve even used watercolor pencils, so this paper CAN take it!  just be sure not to use too much water.For this price you can’t go wrong. i have a large collection of coloring books of ALL TYPES/STYLES and i can say that for the money, you can’t go wrong. I can get three books of this kind for the price of one of the higher end books. I do wish they used a better paper like the Johanna Baskin books but then it would cost twice as much i suppose. But i’d pay it, because i’d love to see  teresa goodridge artwork on a high quality paper. I guess i could print out on a good stock of paper but i’m lazy and then i’d have loose pages everywhere!  i like my coloring stuff to be neat and tidy!  so maybe i’ll start a letter writing campaign to creative haven for better paper!"
I purchased this book for my 82 year old mother who is a shut in. She used to be an avid quilter but arthritis and migraine headaches have caused her to no longer be able to quilt. Being able to color is very important to her it takes her mind off stressful things like covid and keeps her hands busy. Coloring is very important to her. I buy her alit of books and markers and colored pencils. She gets so excited and happy when she receives a new one. I would recommend this product to anyone.
"I've been trying to find the right home theme coloring book and I finally found it!  This one checks all the boxes - a diverse array of pictures covering different parts of a home, one-sided, thick paper, clear and bold outlines and detailed but not overwhelming.  You won't regret it!"
"This book is high quality and a great deal for the price. Nice scenes for those who like interior design. Room to be creative in colors and designs. Single sided pages make it perfect for markers, gel pens or colored pencils. The scenes are somewhat details, so fine points work best in some areas."
"I enjoy coloring in her books and own many of them, but I do have a few suggestions.  I'd like to see less repetitive foilage.  It's too much and I think more variety in the flowers and foliage would be a significant improvement.  Also, more pottery, fruits, vegetables, and other items would make her artwork more enjoyable.  Paper quality is surprisingly good for a book in this price range.  All in all, these are an excellent value."
"I loved this book. I've scoured Amazon for another with similar content and alas, there are none. The garden, farm, and otherwise outdoor scenes are lovely but there are so many leaves and flowers, there's a limit to how creative you can get with that content. This book allows one to be as creative as one wants with colored and the pages are filled with lovely rooms from kitchens to dens to attic spaces to nurseries. There is a lot of variety. I wish I could find another just like it, but different, you know?"
"Fantastic work by gifted artist, Theresa Goodridge. Super fun to color. Children can apply color over a larger area to simplify images. Very homey and filled with warmth. Water is the enemy of paper. Weather happens. Please slip coloring books into zip lock bags or those marvelous Amazon blue and white shipping bags. Five star product, three star shipping."
"Teresa Goodridge has the most beautiful adult coloring books for me. This book in particular is a perfect mix between beautiful interior designs, nature and animals. A perfect buy and a perfect gift. I highly recommend it."
"It really epitomizes the meaning of home sweet home, “cozy”, “homey”, “comfort.” I love the scenes, they really have brought so much relaxation when I feel anxious or just bored and want to color! They are truly drawings... can’t wait to draw more!!"
This is my first adult coloring book and I'm hooked! I love the variety of eclectic comfy scenes. Ive been listening to all my favorite podcasts while coloring. If you're self-isolating too then give this book try. The paper is thick and perforated.
"I am enjoying coloring in this home themed adult coloring book. It is difficult to find home themed CBs.  I do wish that the drawings were a bit more detailed and not so heavily outlined in black.  However, I'm making it work for me.  As always, one sided good  paper,  with Creative Haven quality I've come to expect."
This adult coloring book is high quality and a very good value.  The pictures are nicely detailed but not too fussy.  Looking forward to many hours of stress relief coloring.  Recommended to all.
Love the pictures!! Lovely scenes of a home that are challenging enough to color yet not filled with all those tiny spaces to test my aging eyes. Only 4 stars because of those nasty Creative Haven unnecessarily dark lines.
"This book has adorable pictures. While being intricate enough to be interesting, they're simple enough to be relaxing. The paper could be thicker, but I like that the pages are one sided. The perforations make it easy to remove the pages and use them on a clip board instead of drawing in the book. The paper is smooth, and takes colored pencil well. I haven't tried markers."
"Teresa Goodridge has once again designed an absolutely beautiful colouring book. Each design has had a lot of thought put into it, allowing you to see exactly what each picture is. There aren't too many lines or fiddly designs to worry about."

   If you watch the video you may want to turn the sound down lol. Pictures are very detailed and beautiful. I absolutely love this coloring book and I will be ordering more :)"
"I must say the pictures are really cute and takes you back to countryside charm. The paper is heavy as well. I use colored pencils that I have had for years as I have always liked to sketch and draw and liked to be able to mix my colors and shade the pictures. This is relaxing as a pass time to set your mind free of worries. So imagine a comfy chair, a cup of your favorite beverage, nice background music and have fun coloring!"
"My favorite of several Creative Haven brand coloring books I purchased during this pandemic. The pictures are beautiful and fun to color. Good, thick paper. I liked this one and their ""Country  Farm Scenes"" so much that I ordered a set for each of my sisters. They loved them. Hope they keep making these products using the same paper and wonderful drawings."
"I wanted to get into adult coloring & really thought I was going to like it. I got something I figured I’d be interested in, bc when I was younger I liked coloring houses in books as well.These pictures are average, but it’s the price you pay. Little amount equals little quality."
"Calming, great pics, and down home feel."
"The pictures were nice to color.  They were detailed, but it would have been better if they left a lot of plants out and stuck to a theme for the room.But she, the artist is very talented and yes I would buy from her again.Debbie/Fort Wayne, IN"
"I love this coloring book! Its so much fun creating your own “interior look” using your pick of colors.  I use alcohol markers and the pages do bleed through with those, but a simple piece of plain paper solves that. Not an issue really. I love everything else about it...very homey, cozy, crafty, and fun—allllll in one!"
"The illustrations are soooooo good, and at the same time really adorable and cute! You get a cozy feeling looking at these pictures, and I'm sure they'll serve as meditation when I color them. So glad I found about this artist! <3"
"Can't go wrong with a little coloring book in your life. I'm so glad I ordered. Feeling like a kid again! The pages are pretty, the sheet is not thin that it will tear. It's a wonderful book! Don't forget to order your crayons =)"
"The pictures aren’t all “completed.”  There are several pages with pictures where the lines weren’t drawn all the way leaving the colorist to decide where to end them-other than that,  I like it. Simple rooms, gardens, food and pets."
"Me gustóLos diseños son muy buenos,.Contiene detalles que ayudan a mejorar la forma en que coloreamos..Lo recomendé a una amiga para su hija,. Y le encantó.He pedido varios y me gustan mucho"
What an adorable adult book I love it.  Will check for some more coloring 📚  to purchase.
"This is my first Creative Haven book.  I was so thrilled to find an adult coloring book like this with pleasant interior scenes -- no mandalas, demons, tribal animals or fairies.  The paper is a good quality and the pages tear out easily.  There are definitely more Creative Haven books on my wish list now."
Fun and relaxing to color. I like these pictures so much more then the books that you spend days on to color one page. I like to take my time but enjoy a picture that I can finish in 3-4 settings. Well worth the money.
I got this for something to do during the period of staying home during the pandemic. A great stress reliever and has good pictures to color. Have almost colored the whole book.
This is a truly beautiful adult coloring book. No geometric drawing shapes. Nice comfy soothing homey scenes. Plus sheets can be torn out. If you grew up coloring this is for you! Love it!
Creative Haven coloring books are far superior to many others. Love the details in the pictures.  The paper is excellent for use with a variety of pencils. Highly recommend.
"Love the pictures, all cozy"
All of the Creative Haven coloring books are worth the price you pay.  Each and every scene is a joy to color.  Realistic scenes full of detail - exactly what I like in a coloring book.
So much fun ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
"Is dicficult but I Like it.💞no  me gustaba al principio pero ya logré hacerlo aunque es difícil para mí. Lo recomiendo, 💖 pero no para los que ahora inician."
"I always enjoy Creative Haven coloring books.  They use good paper and printed on one side.  Some pictures in this one are similar to other Creative Haven books, but I don’t mind."
This is another great book from Creative Haven . The drawings are so warm and cozy. Makes you wish you were in the picture. Fun to color too .
I love this coloring book. I couldn’t stop coloring. I really enjoy all of their coloring books.
"What fun!  I use gel pens and find that these pictures are a lot of fun to color.Reasonable price and many, many hours of coloring fun."
This is VERY CUTE and detailed. My daughter is 6 and loves the more advanced coloring books. This is such a great one. Cute cozy pictures you will love it.
I brought this book because I thought the illustrations were beautiful. I loved ❤ this book & I'm glad I purchased it.
"I have a few coloring books, and this one was so delightful to work with. I am not good with mitching colors, however, my imagination run away with ideas."
Love the homey designs!! My markers don’t bleed through!
Beautiful book...I love all of hers and this did not disappoint!! So glad I purchased it finally!! Came quick and in great condition!
My son is 9 and loves to color. I enjoy coloring with him but the adult coloring books with all of their tiny little graphics was just too much for me. This coloring book is perfect. Very happy with it.
Totally love this book. Perfect paper for pencil coloring. Creative artwork. Delivered in perfect condition

"Very cute ,one of my favorites.Special little details,make it so much fun to color!!"
Love the honey pictures got both myself and my cousin this book. She loves hers too.
"Gave as a gift to someone that colors a lot.  Gave a few coloring books at the same time, and this was the favorite.  Lots of detail, but not difficult to color. Paper weight is very nice.  Subject matter warns your heart."
I don’t care for this book.  The ink is way too thick and dark making everything look heavy and dark.
I really enjoyed this book. It was a change from the fashion books I usually color. Great rooms with nice details.
Very sweet little book. Flowers pets wood china very serene and beautiful scenes.
I like that these are quiet pictures to relax with and nice pleasant scenes.

Great price and pics!
I love all of these scenes! I was looking for a coloring book that had realistic images and not just abstract ones.
Love this coloring book!
Just right if amount of detail
"Best coloring book ever! Lots of detail that isn’t overwhelming, and a lot of room for personalcreativity."
"It’s great, but I’m learning how to shade colors for how this coloring book is laid out."
I love the creative haven books. It came fast and exactly what I expected.
I love this coloring book and plan on getting more from this artist in the near future!!
Given as a gift to my 91 yr old Mom. She enjoys using colored pencils.
Pretty pages!
Loveeeeeee Coloring cool pictures 👍🏼
Nice product
Love it!!!
Good book
Sweet.
I have colored many books. I like this one and I am enjoying coloring it.
"I love that these pages are perforated so that you can easily tear them out and copy them to have multiple images of that same pictures, frame when done or simply just have that flat paper to color on with no lift from the fold over. Such homely cozy relaxing images. This one is a great one of everyday scenes that will make you feel relaxed coloring and making them come to life."
Received this book as a gift and I could not be any happier with the illustrations. I color to relieve stress and this book is awesome. Submitted my first illustration I colored. Will be buying more books by this author in the future. Highly recommend.
I really enjoy this book.  It has just enough detail without having so much to make it frustrating.  It’s a winner!
"Creative Haven, PLEASE make a color by number version of this Home Sweet Home coloring book!!!"
Nice for the price pretty pics
Love this coloring book! Great coloring pages and details are amazing!
Teresa Goodridge at her best!  Home Sweet Home is an absolutely gorgeous coloring book!  The artwork is clear and beautiful and the paper is (consistently) good.  Another fabulous Creative Haven book.
"Absolutely loved this coloring book for a wonderful friend that is in Mebane Ridge Assisted Living!  My precious friend is in her late 50's.  Those books made her so happy.  She looks at each page, over and over, telling me how beautiful they were.  She is working on the coloring book now!!!  This is a blessing and your company is wonderful!!!  Thank you so very much!!!!  I am sure I will buy more from you!!!  Oh - they are VERY well made too....nice paper, good pictures drawn so she can color the pictures.  I just can't tell you how much I appreciate you folks!!From - Mebane NC"
Great condition and stress free coloring.  Love the pictures.
"When I first started coloring, I thought Jade Summer was the best book out there. While I still think they're great, Creative Haven is right up there with them. I love their books. They are finely detailed and, yes, they take a lot of time to complete, but I just love coloring in their books. I'll put on a podcast or tv show and just color away. The paper is thick and doesn't bleed through and I haven't seen duplicate pictures. I'm sticking with Creative Haven from now on."
I bought this adult coloring book for myself and my sister loved it so much so I also ordered one for her. I love the picture definition of this book.  The picture are black outlined and the pictures are like medium /large in size. It’s so easy to let your imagination run wild with colors to create beautiful pictures with this coloring book.  I love it from cover to cover and will definitely purchase from this particular brand again. The price is great and you surely get your money’s worth...
Cute and cozy pics. I found it very relaxing to color out of and the quality of the paper was surprisingly good (and blended well) considering the price. You can’t lose.
"Nice book. However, it doesn't need a cat or dog on every picture.  It ruins most of the pictures for people that were just looking to color nice rooms and for those that don't really care for animals."
I love this artist.  Her books are beautiful.  This one is great.  I have also bought several of her books for myself and my sister.  We both love them all.  Thanks!
Great Coloring Book
So heart warming and lots of detail! Creative Haven is my favorite adult coloring book company. I won't go with anyone else!
Like the Creative Home Coloring Book very nice pictures to color.  😍
"just what I was looking for, all the right kind of pictures to color"
Happy adult here
Adorable pictures
Love it
"O livro é mto lindo, tem uma proposta bem diferente por serem cômodos de uma casa. Recomendo!!"
"Os desenhos são bem bonitos, todos no estilo desse que está na capa, que foi o que gostei. Mas em algum lugar na descrição do produto dizia ""64"" páginas, então eu pensei que estava comprando um livro mais grosso. No entanto, tem apenas 30 desenhos (e +1 da folha de abertura), ou seja, tem 32 folhas e não 64 como diz na descrição. Quanto à qualidade do papel: é baixa, não posso usar canetinhas, por exemplo, porque mancha. Só uso lápis para colorir (não recomendo usar aquarela tbm!)."
"Have bought tons of books as I have been non stop colouring since I was a girl, long before the latest fad.  This is by far my favourite book.  I love the interior pictures, all different.  Its ok to get a country side books etc but one soon gets fed up with shading in green grass, green trees etc.  What makes this book different is you can choose the colours and not be held to green for trees and blue for sky etc due to the content.  Once I have finished it and it will be the only book ever where I have completed every single page, I will get another so I can choose a completely different colour theme. Love it."
"Amei o livro, desenhos grandes e bem divertidos. Realmente uma temática de casa, vários cômodos com diferentes coisas e situações e mais uns pets perdidos. Uma figura por página, tem opção de destacar, as páginas são um pouco grossas (cerca de uns 120gr) e bem branquinhas! Da para Aquarelar de leve e usar canetinhas basta apenas usar uma prancheta para apoio, assim não molhando a próxima página. Eu amos os livros da Teresa Goodridge e super indico esse para quem quer uma temática diferente dos livros tradicionais de colorir."
"This is a brilliant colouring book. Every page is so detailed. The paper is thick too, and each page is only printed on one side, and is removable if so you so wish. The price is so cheap for such a fantastic book. I've found that this brand of book is by far one of, if not the best, for colouring books. For price and quality. I bought it for a present, and the recipient loved it."
Pretty pages of lovely cosy home designs to colour. The paper is very good quality and the pages are perforated making it very easy to tear out of the book without tearing the picture you are going to colour.  There are a lot of different designs and all are nice.I have added two pages that I have coloured.
This is a lovely book easy to colour with an old world charm I like this artists books very much and will buy her others
⭐️Love these colouring books✨Great for adults⭐️Loads of different designs✨The pages are great quality⭐️Will always buy creative haven✨Delivery was fast as always
"Bought this book for myself as boared  in lockdown very pleased ,  I did is lovely good amount of pages  yes I would recommend if you like colour ing."
It has so many home designs and they are all really nice. I wanted this book because a friend recommended me and I already feel like I should've bought some others from the same collection.
Lovely colouring book a change from the usual scenes. Quality is nice not really thick paper but not the cheap thinner stuff some books have.
"Very beautiful coloring book. It comes with the perforated sheets in case you want to separate them from the book. They've left a blank space between drawings so they don't stain each other. With a lot of drawings and very varied. If the paper was thicker, it would be amazing."
Arrived in good condition. Lots of different interesting pictures. Lovely colouring book.
"Lovely colouring book, really nice pictures and good quality paper. I have bought a number of this colouring books and they have all been very good. I looked forward to more being released !"
Lovely pictures in this colouring book.  I would definitely recommend.
The drawings are good and quality of paper it great
"I love love love this book! Paper is very good, drawings are amazing and very beautiful and good quality overall. A must have colouring book for adults ♥️💎👌"
Great
Great colouring book
Good service
I simply love it
"Achei o livro bem barato pela qualidade que oferece...páginas mais grossinhas que as usuais e não tem nada no verso, o quê facilita se usar outras técnicas que vezem na folha.Recebi dentro do prazo e bem embalado, testarei com canetinhas e lápis Giotto.Mais uma vez parabéns Amazon!!!"
"Das ist jetzt mein 5 Malbuch und auch dieses ist wieder voll mit liebevoll gestaltenten Motiven ! Im Moment komme ich leider nicht dazu , arbeite  im Handel  - Weihnachtsstress ! Aber im Januar / Februar , wenn es draußen kalt und nass ist , mache ich es mir drinnen gemütlich , mit Musik und Tee und dann geht's los ! Viel Dank !"
"vi varias resenhas desse livro e já tinha o das fadas. essa coleção da creative haven  ( não os da creative heaven que são um horror) dá vontade de ter todos porque tem uma qualidade bem boa , uma pagina por ilustração então dá pra usar varios materiais . esse particularmente da Theresa dá uma sensação de estar na casa dos sonhos , super aconchegante com detalhes lindos. capa e contra capa internas coloridas para inspirar. tamanho bom um pouco menor que uma folha de sulfite, dá para carregar de boa. o papel não é muito fino,  umas 120 g. dá  para marcadores muito bem e até uma aquarelada leve se cuidar direitinho e não tiver neura de uns enrugadinhos.adorei todas as ilustraçãos, nem sei qual começo kkkk. mas é uma otima compra pelo valor e sendo um livro importado."
"The book arrive yesterday and I am very pleased with it.  I know I or someone else, will really enjoy colouring in it.  A nice way to express oneself, maybe keeping in mind, the different colours you would want to be seen or used in your own or another's personal space.  Just imagining, that's half the fun, isn't it.  Letting your thoughts and feelings take hold and expressing yourself with colour as only each and every one of us can or does.  Thank you for making the book available."
"Qdo comprarem livros dessa ""coleção"" Creative Heaven, olhem a o logo no meio de ""Creative Heaven""que é um conjunto de pincéis, além de ver a nome da editora ( Dover Publications Inc.)  e a autora Terresa Goodrige.Se for publicação independente, tem imagens pixelizadas ( baixa qualidade), papel fino, imagens repetidas e a autora assina como Lily Nama ou Lily Willy . São cópias piratas.Esse é o original, tem nome da autora certinho e editora."
"O livro tem um ótimo tamanho! Só tem desenhos na folha da direita, aquela que é bem confortável de pintar. E você ainda pode destacar as folhas! Os desenhos são lindos e claros, não são extremamente poluídos como outros livros de colorir por aí, este aqui realmente relaxam pra pintar, não é uma atividade que trás mais ansiedade. Para ser perfeitos as folhas poderiam ser mais grossinhas, que desse para pintar com aquarela, mas também não é a proposta do produto. Mas a folha também tem uma gramatura bem boa. Excelente, a entrega super rápido."
"Das Ausmalbuch hat wirklich tolle Bilder von gemütlicher Inneneinrichtung im englischen Landhausstil, mit Hund und Katz, auch mal mit Menschen, mit flackernden Kaminen, großen Ohrensesseln und Kuscheldecken, aber auch einige mit sonnigen Sommerterassen - genau richtig für ungemütliches Wetter:-))"
"Me encantan los dibujos, excelente calidad del papel, aunque uses sharpies se traspasan pero no manchan la siguiente hoja, sí es gruesa.Lo recomiendo mucho si quieres descansar de mandalas. De mascotas hay perros y gatos.Muy bonito!"
"Gostei muito, os desenhos não são aquela perfeição, mas são agradáveis. Belas composições. Amazon, obrigada, super-rápido a entrega e o livro em perfeito estado."
"Eu adorei o livro, apesar de as folhas serem um pouco finas. Só tem desenho de um lado da folha, o que facilita a utilização de materiais como canetinhas e marcadores. Mas os desenho são lindos e o custo-benefício é ótimo. Quero a coleção inteira"
"Para mi es el mejor libro para colorear que he encontrado. Son figuras normales, sin gráficos como de formas geométricas diminutas que nada más cansan. Esté está hermoso! Cada página vale la pena!"
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
        
    










  
    
   Gostei mt desse livro, ilustrações lindas, apesar de ser em papel branco, mas as folhas são mais grossas. Vamos pintar.....😍❤️♥️🥰💕"
"I love this Cover of this coloring book, so I bought this one.  Did not come yet  😷😓, maybe tomorrow, which is Sunday,  November 22nd,  2020.  I brought this for me.Thank You for the coloring book."
"Uma palavra para definir: PERFEITO!As ilustrações são tão lindas e cativantes que dá vontade de morar nelas kkkkUma ilustração por página e tem a opção de destacar o desenho, folha bem grossinha, de qualidade, enfim, em breve espero comprar os demais livros que devem ser um espetáculo também."
Cumple su función me relaja. Está entretenido. Es de lo más económico que hay por qué realmente estos libros de relajación son caros. Este es una buena opción
It’s got lots of details to the images yet they look natural so I don’t personally find it too busy at all.  It’s got a nice variety of pictures to do.
"Las imágenes son variadas, agradables, bien diseñadas y con bastantes detalles.Las hojas son de buena calidad y grosor.  Muy recomendable."
"Los dibujos de estancias de una casa son maravillosas, es un libro precioso. Las láminas se pueden separar ya que están troquelados e impresas en una sola cara. No le doy 5 estrellas porque el papel es fino, poco más que folio. Aún así,  lo recomiendo."
"Dei de presente e a pessoa adorou! As imagens são grandes e ""claras"". Há bastante espaço para colorir. Além de serem belas figuras. Foi o primeiro do tipo que comprei, mas com certeza pegarei os próximos temas. Achei o preço ok"
"LIVRO COM IMAGENS BELISSIMAS E ACONCHEGANTES, CENAS DE INTERIOR DE CASA NO CAMPO ,COM ALGUMAS IMAGENS EXTERNAS. COM CERTEZA A COMPRA VALEU A PENA."
Vraiment de très beaux dessins. Par contre on devrait mentionner le nombre de dessin et non le nombre de page. Dessus qu'il y en ait si peu.
Un cadeau qui a fait très plaisir. Un livre pour adultes avec de magnifiques choix de dessins. Très satisfaite.
"Comprei para presentear minha mãe e ela amou!Muitos desenhos grandes,cheios de detalhes,um ótimo passatempo para o pessoal da melhor idade!💜💜"
"O livro é bonito e diferente daqueles com muita folhagem, flores e animais. É interior de casa mesmo pra gente colorir. Tem desenho um desenho por folha. A gramatura não é alta mas dá pra fazer lindos coloridos."
Livre arrivée déjà dessiner.
Freitag besteld und dienstag schon in die Niederlande ! Turbo lieferung.Ein tolles buch.Ich freue mich.Danke Amazon
I Like the Creative Haven series of coloring books. Lots of details. This is my second one. I also have Creative Haven Christmas Trees. Great seller.
This is the first Creative Haven colouring book I purchased. I love how the pictures are old-fashion yet modern. The pages itself are not thin. Will be purchasing others from the series.
Beaux dessins détaillés à colorier. Le résultat a l'apparence d'une peinture une fois terminé selon le talent de celui qui le fait.
"Très satisfaite de ce cahier, les dessins sont tous beaux. À recommander. Merci!"
"C est mon 1er livre de cette illustratrice ...J aime beaucoup l environnement très cocooning.Les feuilles sont détachables ce qui permet d utiliser l aquarelle , feutre, feutre à alcool etc ...."
"one of my favorite books and I have hundreds, detailed and interesting, good quality paper too"
"This is a very nice adult colouring book, with lots of old style pictures"
"As páginas são da cor branca. Os desenhos são os cômodos de uma casa, ambientes internos e externos da residência. São bem detalhistas, com flores e muitos móveis em madeira."
Das Buch ist leider etwas zu dünn hab es mir dicker mit mehr Seiten vorgestellt aber sonst auch sehr schöne Bilder
I started my Creative Haven colouring experience with Theresa Goodridge's cozy interior designs and outdoor scenes. Love her work!
"Produto veio amassado na parte de cima, creio que foi na transportadora que não tomaram cuidado com pacote. ADOREI o livro  e estou ansiosa para começar  a colorir. Achei super legal que da para destacar."
Deliziose immagini da colorare. Adoro i libri di Creative Haven. Non mi deludono mai
"Es precioso. Dibujos maravillosos, buena calidad, un poco difícil para los principiantes"
Purchased as a gift for my daughter ...very cute pics to colour. She loves it.

"Un beau cahier de coloriage, idéal pour s'amuser et relaxer."
Este libro es muy bonito y el papel es de muy buena calidad.
The drawings are adorable
É um dos melhores livros da Teresa. A temática é bem diferente e interessante. Cada página representa um cômodo da casa.  Sem dúvida é uma ótima aquisição.
No es para pintar por números como yo pensé pero las imágenes son muy bonitas y dejan espacio a la creatividad y uso de diferentes materiales.
I love this colouring book! there is alot of detail ( that I love)
Great little coloring book. Illustrations are beautiful.
"Não gostei muito. Estou tão acostumada com os livros da Johanna Basford que estranhei muito esse. O papel é bem liso, mais dificil de pegar pigmento e as ilustrações tem os traços muito marcados."
A mi hija le encantó !Muy buena calidad y divertido a la hora de colorear! La entrega fue súper rápido . Mucho antes de lo esperado .
Super beau livre à colorier.  Les images sont très belles et ce livre est de bonne qualité et bon prix.
Os desenhos são muito legais e o papel é uma delícia de pintar.

Adorei tudo!!! O papel! As figuras! Única cois que mudaria seria a espessura da impressão... deixar as linhas mais finas... mas gostei muito assim mesmo!
Gosto muito da coleção Creative Haven e este não decepciona em nada. Para quem gosta de colorir vai se encantar com os lindos desenhos.
"Ilustrações lindas, páginas destacáveis, sem desenho no verso."
My favourite colouring book so far! Pages are detailed and calming to colour.

"O livro é lindo, como os outros dessa ilustradora"
"Ilustraçoes mais despojadas, ótimas para aquarela. Papel muito bom. As gravuras nos fazem sentir dentro da casa. Simplismente amei!"

"My daughter, a vet tech, loved this gift! She said her staff was looking for stress busters, so she took the coloring book and colored pencils to work and placed on the break room table for all to share. She said the gang LOVED it!"
Gave these to my techs for vet tech week and was a big hit. Always good to have something fun and different and even helps with stress!
I bought this for my staff for Vet Tech Appreciation Week. I believe coloring books is a great way to de stress especially on a busy day at work. The book is actually great quality
I bet its cute to draw in! I liked it when I looked through it before I gave it as a gift. I think she uses it!
"I ordered this as a gift for my coworker, who is new the the vet med world. I thought it would be a fun activity for her to do on the side while she learned the ropes at our clinic. She loved it! There are plenty of pages to color and they are all fun and surprisingly relatable to anyone who works  at animal shelter or clinics."
Got this for a grooming friend of mine and she LOVED it. Funny art and coloring make an awesome combination. Will be getting more for christmas gifts.
Bought as a gift she loved it and the pictures were really nice and the book felt really good
Granddaughter loved it.  Good for a Vet Tech to use for stress relief or calming after a days work or vet school.
I bought these coloring books for vet tech coworkers. They were a blast!!! They had so many witty observations and quotes. They’re also great stress relievers.  Perfect gift for those who work in veterinary medicine
She LOVED this - she could relate to so many of the pictures.  She brought it to work and the techs color it in on their lunch break.  Brings a smile to their faces.
I love this coloring book! It's very well done. The art is 100% original. I just wish these types of coloring books didn't make me anxious.
"Sturdy paper, single side printed, great designs.  I work at a Veterinary Hospital and I'm using the pages for team member coloring contests.  They love it."
Terrible quality! Pages thin and looks like photo copied. Do not buy!!! Plus 80% of the sayings in here don't have anything to do with being a vet tech.
Bought as a gift for coworker. Funny pictures.  Very detailed and great idea to pass time.
"A great book for the price! The pages are very funny and relatable to my job as a vet tech. I bought two of these, one being a gift and that person loved it as well!"
Bought these for my techs for Vet Tech Week - they were a hit!
Hilarious. Great gift for a fellow tech.
Really cute pictures all vet techs will love!! . Very humorous!!
I’m in school to be a vet tech and I absolutely love this coloring book. The images are funny and beautiful!
Very funny and fun
Hysterical gift for the vet tech in your life. You are never to old to color.
"Came super fast, despite Covid19. Super unique and fun looking. Good quality too."
I bought these for my Vet Tech co workers for a Christmas gift and they absolutely loved them! The pages and quotes were funny and everyone loved looking at the books! Great gift!
The pages seem to be overly detailed with black ink.
Bought them for my techs to celebrate vet tech week.  They lived them.
Got these for my vet techs
It was a great gift for my co worker
Perfect gift for my co-workers birthday!
Some of the pages are great but others have designs that are so tiny it is hard to color. It becomes stressful.
I bought this as a gift for my kid when she graduated. It could not be more spot on and funny!
Made a great gift for all the awesome vet techs I know!
"I ordered these for the techs at my clinic as a Christmas gift, and they LOVED them! Fun pages with great little details! A wonderful way to unwind!"
My team loved receiving this for Vet Tech Week. Drawings are incredible!
Bought this coloring book for my animal ER Nurse daughter-she LOVED it!
I bought this as Christmas presents for my technicians and they were a huge success!
This coloring book is hilarious and so well done. The perfect gift for any vet tech you know!
Exactly what was expected. She loved this gift!
Secret Santa at the vet clinic this year...I loved hearing the giggles and laughter as my recipient showed off her grown-up coloring book to the staff members!
Way more on point then expected
My technicians loved this as a gift
So much fun!
This is hilarious!! Love it
High quality and a great gift!
Love every page.
Hilarious!
Cute idea could’ve been better.
"Best coloring book ever! The pages are hilarious, and I also love that they’re thick and one sided so you don’t have to worry about one image bleeding through to another. Perfect activity while I’m out with an injury and missing my job! I’ve recommended it to all my coworkers. :)"
Great gift for a vet tech. Such funny pages and seems so fun to color
I love coloring in this on break 😊
Love that there’s a specific colouring book for vet nurses/ techs. Each page is extremely intricate so there really is hours of colouring here (almost too intricate if you don’t enjoy complicated patterns).
Brought as gift for Christmas. She loved it. Was giggling when looking through it. Some really nice patterns to colour
"I bought this as a gift for my clinical coach, it’s absolutely brilliant but I would love it if they did another edition with vet nurse replacing the vet tech so it’s more relevant in England. Other than that I love it 😻"
Lovely gift for vet nurses! I have bought multiple copies! Good quality and good/funny images. Definitely recommend.
Love this book! Great designs and fun to colour!
An amusing collection of pictures to colour as a break from study.
So much fun to color!
Great quality
I work at a 24h emergency practice so I bought this to relieve some stress for those able to get a break. Everyone loved it! Highly recommend!
"Arrived as described. Good quality. Only complaint : it arrived with a big smear on it that looked like greasy finger prints. Used a Lysol wipe to clean it, and they went away."
As described. Love it.Really like all the funny quotes included!
Bought for my recently graduated vet tech friend who also loves to colour. Perfect gift! She loved it and the sayings are hilarious :)
A hit!  Please do one for veterinary receptionists!!!
"It was a gift for a family member who just graduated as a vet tech, she loved it. Thick pages with funny sayings"
It has the best quotes! Super funny and makes a great gift
Great book
Awesome. So much thicker and awesome quality than I expected. Awesome gifts for vet tech week at our clinic
Great gift for my vet tech friends
Great book!  Arrived on time and is very cute
I read until the piece about treat them like dogs which was very highly abusive to dogs and so I stopped reading because this book should be removed
"If you are an empath, you feel things more acutely and suffer emotionally when other do. The author suggests ways of protecting yourself and develop you abilities at the same time."
"The first book discusses how an empathetic person is affected by things such as absorbing the energy around them and tells how and empathic person can live happily. The second explains how a person can have psychic abilities, how you can develop them and stop being manipulate by others negativity."
"An empath is a person with the unique gift of perceiving other people's emotions without even trying. I have much empathy, and I like this book for laying out, spiritually, how people with much empathy can be a little different from ordinary people."
Excellent read; recommended highly!
"I  hope  to  get  experience  when  I  will read  this  book. Also  want  to  change  my  life  for  a  better  way.Jaime  zaOctober  7,  2021"
"The book suggests keeping positive and away from draining people, meditating, and focusing on your abilities. I really liked the section on dream meanings as I've always had really strange dreams. Really interesting read"
"This book will help you develop your abilities because it will talk to you about psychic protection, clairvoyant healing and telepathy. Plus it will talk about your dreams and what they mean."
"Empath people are individuals who can sense the emotions of others, and has an open spirit. The author speaks on the meaning of your dreams, the different types of psychic abilities."
"Learn how to deal with the emotions of others, the different types of empaths, the rules to be happy and how to hone your psychic abilities with this book."
"It provides in-depth exploration for developing a deeper connection with your higher self, finding your spirit guides, and becoming a better empath? Then keep reading!"
"Everyone needs to do the work contained in this book. If you are seeking a deeper understanding of yourself and others, this book will provide profound insight into why we all act in ways that harm one another. We see the effects of disowned and abandoned inner children walking as adults everywhere in the dysfunction of our society. Mean boss? Tyrannical dictator? Needy mother? It is all just false performance by an ""adult"" who has disowned their inner child and has yet to discover their true authentic self. Get this book, do the work it prescribes and buy a copy for your entire family. It really has the potential to change the world. If you struggle with mental health challenges, do the work prescribed in this book with a licensed professional. It is deeply healing, but can also be deeply triggering. It is also deeply worth it."
"This book changed my life in such an incredible way. It’s been one of the most difficult journeys I’ve ever been on, and this book will guide you deep into your emotional wounds. I truly see the world in a new, beautiful way and am forever changed after working through this wonderful journey of healing. I drank for 20 years everyday, and wasn’t sure why I did so.  Quitting drinking just made me realize that I had feelings that I needed to deal with, and this book showed me the way to what had happened to my inner child that made my life so difficult for my to live in a healthy happy way. I couldn’t be in a healthy relationship, had anger issues with my dad, and hid from myself everyday with booze and pot. I’m now a year sober, in a wonderful healthy relationship with an amazing woman and am happier than I’ve ever been in my life. Thank you so much John Bradshaw and many others that helped me along the way..❤️❤️❤️"
"So this is one of those books whose age REALLY shows. It was written in 1990, but might as well have been 1890 for some of the grossly obsolete science and societal norms that are in there. It downright gave me a tiny cringe at times, with the author's cultlike belief and repeated advocation of 12-step (AA) philosophy...However, the core of the book, that of working with your suppressed grief, is invaluable and wonderful advice. I do absolutely recommend it to people who are on a path of self-actualization, but it does need to be read critically, especially the theory sections."
"Based on other reviews, I was worried about this book being ridiculous. This was recommended to me by my therapist and we're going over the exercises in my therapy sessions. It is a little different, but I do better with unconventional methods. Not that this book is REALLY unconventional; it just uses a different approach. Going through each developmental stage helped me to locate where the disconnect happened and how I can fix it."
"The first half of the book is terrific and very eye-opening, and mind opening. The second half of the book is good if you want to actually follow along and practice all of the procedures. This part was a little overwhelming for me. But overall, the book reveals just how messed up millions of people are because they didn't have a good ""we"" before trying to create an ""I""."
"I have shared this book with people that I love deeply because I want them to experience the same joy and fulfillment that I have since reading Homecoming and and participating in the activities outlined in this Homecoming. I'm so thankful for John Bradshaw sharing his personal experiences with the world. This book has set me free to be me, finally. Thank God!"
"Help that inner child heal, we all can use this! I am getting one for every close friend that has any issues because this addresses them at the core! I am taking my time processing while I read it and doing the excersizes. I have a friend I am reading it with which is helpful. It is deep and really good to work through deep inner wounds. I can already feel the difference in the way I respond to things happening, less anger, more calm. So helpful!!!"
"This is my first review ever. To those commenting negatively about the book - all I can say is that you must not have been raised in a dysfunctional family, thus, not understand the deep wounding that this might have left on one's soul. I like the book and I like the exercises. Yes, he makes you revisit parts of your life you may not want to revisit and work through feelings that are scary and leave you incapacitated. I believe the truth in the statement  ""The only way to is through"". I am seeing slow but progressive change in myself as a result of this book. I highly recommend to anyone who's had a rough childhood."
"Are you really interested in helping yourself to become the REAL you? Are you committed to doing the work? Are you ready to face your ""wounded"" inner and leave the comfort of your false self? If you answer ""yes"" to any of these questions, get your notebook and pen ready to do your life work.John Bradshaw's ""Home Coming"" takes you through the steps necessary to growing the inner you to match the person that you were born to be. This book includes exercises that may seem difficult at first, even scary at times. However, they do get easier during this walk towards the REAL you.Just know that the journey to discovering your authentic self was not meant to be easy. However, finding your wonder child is well worth unlocking old wounds. John Bradshaw's ""Home Coming"" will assist you in your transition from arrested development to being the genuine adult that you were born to be."
This is the second time around for me reading this book which initially saved my life.  The inner child work is key to successful recovery for me. It helped me change the destructive patterns of behavior that challenged my quest for happiness.  I re-wrote my inner script and stopped substituting actors!! Thanks John Bradshaw!
"At first I thought this would be a good book to read. Nope, once again as most people including Bradshaw believe, he writes that it is a blessing to be adopted, better to be adopted than unwanted by bio parents. What a contradiction. Not only that, but he like many others  never stop to think of asking what an adoptee thinks about the entire process. Especially an adoptee who was forced to belong to another family/culture through closed adoption or what I like to call legal/paid for child trafficking. I tried to believe in this book but Bradshaw’s commonly shared bias made me lose all interest and totally question his credibility."
"This book already has given me SO much insight into why I and other people act the way we do and the possible causes of dysfunctional thinking, and I'm only on chapter 4 out of 14. Many, many practical exercises to help you explore your mind and gain clarity. I can't believe I didn't hear about this book sooner. Invaluable if you wonder why you get in your own way and wish to really break out of toxic cycles for good."
"This book is an excellent resource for survivors of childhood abuse. It provides a great general structure of the healing process and has a lot of great concepts. Also uses a lot of work pulled from notable research and literature in psychology related fields. There are some things to note however - some terms and concepts are slightly ignorant, like the use of the word “oriental” to describe people for example, not for any malice of the author but as a result of this being a generally older book. Discounting the outdated ideas and language, it’s a great resource as a general guide/rough structure to emotional healing work."
"This work is painful, challenging, and not for the faint of heart. I am healed and moving forward as the woman I was meant to be.I highly recommend this book!!!"
"Ordered this, then it disappeared from my library so ordered again even though I knew I bought it already and downloaded it. But the book is worth buying at least once to anyone out there considering it. It will change your life."
This book won't reverse the effects from your familys dysfunction however I definielty felt like I took a great leap forward in my path to recovery after reading this book. This book makes me feel good inside and teaches me to make me feel good inside. Unlike other books on this subject it makes you focus on nurturing yourself because the book is written in a very nurturing way. There are slow parts like in every book but I still had something to highlight on nearly every page. This book is another staple in one's recovery.
"Although I chose to believe that everything happens FOR us rather than TO us (victim no more), we are all still uniquely wounded and adopt patterns of survival that don't serve our creative potential. Our caretakers, parents, siblings, teachers, school mates, aunts, uncles, cousins are our benevolent dictators and frequently our torturers.As children we are self centered and self involved (which is normal) and sensitive to every nuance that we interpret as critical.  We hear ""no"" thousands of times to curb our natural enthusiasm and curiosity and are actually punished for the manner in which  our brains project our genius.  This natural genius has been long forgotten by the adults who are determined to socialize us into obedient conformists.Homecoming resurrects the community of children hiding in the shadow of fear and assists us in coaxing them back into life to once again become contributing aspects in our personality.John Bradshaw definition of shame versus guilt is brilliant.  We claim to feel guilt that lasts for years and sometimes decades.  Bradshaw says that guilt is being sorry for what we have done whereas shame is feeling sorry for who we ""are"" as a being.  Read that again won't you.  Let it sink in and integrate.  It is a lighted discernment.  What most call guilt is actually shame.  Being ashamed of oneself.  Being ashamed for who we are ""being"".  A devastating difference.I give HOMECOMING to friends who are learning how to love their inner children (there is a community of aspects), help them find their voices again, and to return to some of the genius that is their birthright.Reading this book is a return of sanity.  It is like working with Sybil (multiple personality) and taking all of the fractured aspects of the children within ourselves, and allowing them to reinvent themselves and flourish.HOMECOMING is practical and gently leads anyone ""willing"" into a world of new possibilities. Coupled with HOMECOMING, consider […]  Byron Katie's ""the work"" is another tool for learning how to LOVE WHAT IS (one of her books)."
I think ALL high school students should read AND discuss Mr. Bradshaw’s series of books on the family before graduation!
I think this book should be a reading must before you get married or have kids.
Fantastic book. It really allows you to look within yourself and discover areas that need improvement. I first checked it out from my local library and decided to buy it instead.  I like self improvement books and this one is definitely one that had to be in my own library book collection. Highly recommend it.
"Good quality and can barely tell it is used. This book was suggested to me by a therapist and although it is old, it is a life changer."
If you are looking to heal your inner child this book is for you. Sometimes I have to put it down for a day or 2 before picking it back up. So much information and healing in its pages.
"The content of the book is excellent.  The author did an outstanding job in his step by step explanations and reclarifying information from concept to concept. The size of the book was comfortable to hold.  My reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was the actual  lack of sharpness and clarity of the print. It wasn't blurry,  it was just""off"".  Still readable, but bothersome."
This book should be a staple in every household. Absolutely! Being there for your inner child is a very sacred experience. You are the only one that will be there for yourself for all of eternity or whatever you believe. This shows you how to be your own advocate and not constantly disappointed with how others are not there for you. Really moving.
Purchased to share with a friend.  A little yellowed with age but still a great book.  It was life changing for me the first time I read it and I believe it will still give freedom to those holding on to pain they have held on to since childhood.
"THIS BOOK HAS SAVED ME IN SO MANY WAYS. READING THIS BOOK MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I HAVE THE MOST AMAZING THERAPIST RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. THIS BOOK HAS HELPED ME HEAL MY INNER CHILD. FROM CHAPTER TO CHAPTER IT BREAKS DOWN THE HABITS, THE WHO, THE WHAT, THE WHERE, THE HOW, THE WHY AND THEN WHEN OF THE BROKEN INNER CHILD TO THE HEALED INNER CHILD WHO BECOMES A HEALTHY ADULT. BRADSHAW EXPLAINS EVERYTHING IN A VERY EASY WAY TO UNDERSTAND--NO ""PSYCHO BABEL"" MANNER. BRADSHAW EXPLAINS EVERYTHING IN A WAY THAT KEEPS YOU FOCUSED, ENCOURAGED, ENLIGHTENED AND EDUCATED.EACH CHAPTER BREAKS DOWN YOUR AGES TO EXPLAIN DEVELOPMENT.  IN SOME CHAPTERS THERE ARE 16- 20 QUESTION INFORMATIVE QUIZZES AND MIND EXERCISES TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND YOURSELF AND OTHERS. THESE EXERCISES FOR EXAMPLE....""IMAGINE YOURSELF AS A SMALL CHILD...."" THIS BOOK SHOULD BE A REQUIREMENT FOR EVERY COLLEGE STUDENT B/C IF EVERYONE TRULY UNDERSTOOD HOW, WHAT, WHY, ETC.....ABOUT THEIR INNER CHILD AND OTHER PEOPLE'S INNER CHILD..THIS WORLD WOULD HAVE SO MUCH HEALING AND FREEDOM TO BE AT PEACE, BE HAPPY, BE ACCEPTING AND LOVING OF THEMSELVES AND OTHERS. HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR EVERYONE. I WISH THAT JOHN BRADSHAW WAS MY THERAPIST IN PERSON..."
"I'm reading this book now, I can truly say it is helping me in ways I never thought were possible.  If you are one that is need of this kind of help, and are willing to put your time into doing the exercises and really trying you should have some great success with it.  I know I have."
This book is very useful helping you to heal wounds from the childhood!
"I tapped into a wounded part of me that needed healing. With the help of my therapist I'm healing and learning so much about myself and how to champion my inner child. It feels weird, yes. But I'm open to healing old wounds in novel ways."
"This is my third purchase as I have loaned the others out to friends who then become very attached to the book and I want them to continue getting benefits from their reading.  This book is very helpful to me in taking a different perspective on my childhood and relating some of my present issues to events that happened way back when.  Bradshaw is frank and unsettling, so be prepared to be uncomfortable.  If you have not done much personal introspection, it may actually be overwhelming.  I would suggest leaving it on the shelf for a few months and come at it with different eyes.  For me, this is why I like Bradshaw, a nitty gritty look at issues that were not talked about much in public when he brought it mainstream on PBS.  Check him out on YouTube.  As a side note, he references Virginia Satir and Milton Erickson, whose work has been foundational in NLP.  Read his books for ideas you can use, and leave the rest as irrelevant for your purposes.  I believe most people can get something out of the book that will be useful."
Highly recommend for adults needing to heal the little child in them that was deeply hurt or affected by circumstances. A must read to take steps toward healing.
good
"Thanks, John Bradshaw. It has helped to clear most of my childhood traumas from stages 1-3 have not gotten to teen stages but it was enough for me to pick up from there and start resolving most of my emotional problems."
This is a great book for anyone that needs to heal your inner child and do work from your past and the pain that you felt as a child not an easy book to read and not easy exercises however but if you want to change your life I highly recommend this book
"Where do I start ? Being an adult child of an alcoholic , both parents ,  the book  would run different emotions through my body. At times I was angry , at times I was encouraged , at times I felt defeated and also hopeful.  There were also times when I needed to stop , walk away , clear my mind and what I was feeling. At times I could not put it  down wanting to learn more.What does survivor  mean  ? Is anyone really a survivor , completely ? Unless you are medically stripped of your past , you are never a survivor. Stripped from your anger , fear , scars , lonliness , habits , and who you  really are.  So as one who was  brought up in a alcoholic world , I try to overcome my alcoholic tendencies and behaviors . I try to be healthy and try to choose the right path , knowing that the dysfunctional path is right around the corner. Because of this book I was able to learn more and know that I am not alone. Also to bring some feeling out into the light and deal with them , not keep them buried . Bless all my other  HomeComing readers  may they all gain knowledge and strength and peace in their lives."
"WOW - deep stuff!  Anyone who wants to find out what they are struggling with in life and make changes, this would be a good book to read - but make sure you are ready for it!"
Fantastic book & I recommend it to any adult who’s looking to heal from their childhood.
I am a Licensed Counselor and have found this book to be a great therapeutic  asset in working with clients! Love John Bradshaw’s work!
"A life changing book! One of the most important books I've ever read. The tremendous positive healing changes with-in me and in my life as a result of my own homecoming with my inner child, little Gary, have been unparalleled. I am now whole, integrated.. and never alone!"
"This book was recommended by my therapist and has helped me connect my current reactions to childhood trauma in easily understandable ways. There is so much that makes sense now that didn't before, and John Bradshaw explains it in easy to understand language."
The book is dated but has some good ideas and points. Worth a read and self help.
this book is important for everyone to read. so many people walking around as adult children reacting the only way they know how.... leads to unjust suffering. just get it and read it and share it. :)
One of the most life changing books for people who are willing to work on their inner child issues. This book will bring out a lot of dirt but it's definitely worth commuting to cleaning up your subconscious mind of self limiting beliefs.
"Although not a Christian book, I heard about Home Coming through Christian radio.  I bought it for myself, hoping to begin dealing with my issues but I also began to gain understanding of others. The walls started to come down as I began to see others as hurt beings, just like myself.  Forgiveness of myself and others followed.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who needs healing."
"John Bradshaw was hugely popular and seemingly ubiquitous in the late 80s/early 90s and he's still going pretty strong.  That's for good reason:  The guy was a ""mess"" and he is brilliant, funny, curious, strong, down-to-earth, and he's been through a lot of 'hard life' himself.  He knows from whence he speaks, and his books (and workshops) are amazingly helpful to what I would imagine is a great majority of the people who read his books and attend his workshops.  He doesn't preach, he doesn't pull superiority, and he doesn't (duh!) use guilt or shame to get his info across.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who's dealing with ...life. Something in it will definitely ring a bell ...maybe a lot.  If you need some help with dysfunctions of many sorts, John's a go-to guy.  Many many seeming conundrums have been demystified by his material/workshops.  Give him a try --he can help."
"I just got the book and can't put it down.At the very beginning of the book, I was brought to tears and cried like a baby, when in one of the workshops they addressed writing a letter in your ""inter child"" format, to the one that had hurt you.So, I decided to write a letter to both my mom and dad separately.  I addressed how I felt in my childhood that really hurt me to my core, and there were many.Of course, all this time I have tried to bury my childhood issues.  I thought I had erased it from my memory.  But time and time again those wounds continued to resurface.I thought that my Christianity would get me through this and heal me completely from my past.  But, I still to this day, do not love myself, so I asked over and over as I prayed what is it, Lord, I'm crying out to you for help.God does answer prayers, and I pray that this book will be my break though!"
amazing book. It did help me to understand why I was the way I was and understanding our problems is the first step to the emotional healing.It open my eyes to see others people's emotional pain because it was similar to mine.Thanks it is an amazing book.
Though this book is older it is still one of the best sources for those trying to work out childhood trauma.
"The book is missing pages 17-48. Bummer. Shame, because it was highly recommended."
This book has brought incredible understanding to my process of recovery through therapy!  I would recommend having a therapist or wise counsel help guide the reader through what they are learning.
"Can definitely aid in the healing of so many broken people.  I'll admit, it is a little weird to refer to yourself and your ""inner child,"" but once you get pass that, it's definitely helpful.  Must be open-minded and willing to look at the man in the mirror to take away from the book."
"I first stumbled upon this book when I was pregnant with my second child in 1990.  Actually, I was listening to Bradshaw speak about his topic on PBS and found myself instantly drawn to the subject matter.  I utilized the teachings over the years and did the work inside to heal my own childhood wounds.  As a counselor, I've used it with my clients and also have given many copies away which is why I have to keep buying new ones. But that's ok because at Amazon, I can get them at such a reasonable price that I can buy extras and still keep giving them away.  Love it!  Thank you"
"This book is life changing. It’s more than just a book, it’s an experience. I’d say that unless you had some sort of idyllic childhood that this book is almost a must."
Reading this helps you to understand some of the issue that went on in Childhood carries over and just how important that inner child is.  Understanding the beginning of our journey in this life is important to hold we handle and react to situations as an adult.  Great book.
"I will re-read and refer to this book many times I'm sure. For those of you who want to see the patterns and understand what factors went into creating who you are (at the subconsious level driving your life & personality), there is absolutely no better book. When you have these unidentified subconscious drivers at work, no amount of mantras or ""positive thinking"" is going to suddenly reverse your direction. You must first understand what's going on.After reading this and thinking through things, I did feel like I'd been hit by a train for about 2 weeks time. I saw the gravity in the situations of my upbringing and understood more about why I've been attracted to certain ""types"" of people in my life - whether that's a romantic relationship or otherwise. You will see the pervasiveness of certain personalities in your life all the way around and in what way it is that you are striving to perform ""in order to be loved..."" Make no mistake, it can be a depressing process while you see the incidents of your life replay in front you, analyze and rethink ""friendships"" for what they really are.Being able to uncover the underlying blueprints of your own operations and what you are actually relating to in other people in your relationships is a first step to being able to make changes in your life. I also feel that for anyone who has or wants to have children, reading this will help you see if you are imprinting faulty aspects of your own upbringing onto your children and why people repeat the madness.I seem to talk about and recommend this book to everyone at some point. I also really look at the people around me and their lives and have a much greater degree of compassion and understanding for how they are living based on what I now know. I think that everyone will identify with aspects of themselves and their family models in the various real-world examples in the book"
I got the audiobook and paperback.  Amazing insight to reaching the inner child...
Prepare for a deep dive
So far so good! I have only read the first couple chapters so far but it is interesting and I am already recommending it to friends and family.
"Homecoming: Reclaiming and Championing Your Inner Child









  
  
    
  I cannot think of another published work that deals effectively with healing the wounded inner child, like this book.  Methodical and delibrate, Bradshaw explores territory unknown to our present conscious, but quite familiar to our subconscious.  The earliest of memories, whether peripheral, non-descript ""gut"" feelings or vivid, clear, sensory-engaged recollections, can be stirred up with the meditations and mental exercises outlined by Bradshaw.Those that are considering purchasing this book, and are reading the reviews to help your decision process, probably already discussed this with a trained spiritual counselor to truly do the work necessary, to undo years of damage in early childhood that somehow manifested itself into inappropriate social behaviors (misplaced anger or rage, attention-seeking, sexualized friendships, marital infidelity, covert sex, pornography), defense mechanisms (disassociation, projection, passing blame or guilt) and addictions (chemical, sexual dependencies).  Emotional wounds sustained at such an innocent age really cannot be healed properly until an emotionally healthy parent, particularly a fully-functioning, fit mother, can teach proper coping skills that later fully develop and become integrated into adulthood.  Some of us have not been as fortunate to have a parent, much less two, that offered appropriate emotional guidance.  Those that need innerchild work done, are those that were raised by damaged parents and damage is passed onto their children as abuse, whether sexual, emotional, physical, and/or spiritual.  Proper intervention is required to recalibrate the wiring in emotionally unstable adults and get them up to their appropriate EQ.In doing the innerchild work, I caution those that try to accomplish this in solitude.  The person in meditation may not know how to cope with the unearthed emotions (typically strong feelings of shame, guilt, and fear of unknown origin) unless a properly trained spiritual counselor provides enough guidance and tools to cope with the unpleasant, repressed feelings.  It is also important to conduct the tasks in the order Bradshaw has outlined - Start at the infancy stage, do the meditation, and work on the emotions that surface, if at all.  The best indication of how much damage was done to an individual is if the first task meditating at the infancy stage evokes a surge of unknown feelings.  Then the work needed to get healthy requires the entire process suggested by Bradshaw.  Skipping a chapter/exercise is not an option if the goal is to get emotionally fully integrated and healthy.In closing, this book is really a new beginning to properly train and socialize a wounded adult back into society, the workplace, family life.  Essentially, the process is likened to that of an infant learning to crawl, stand, walk, and explore the world around them, with the loving and caring guidance that lacked in childhood.  Bradshaw also includes a section on forgiving and releasing resentment and bitterness of the perpetrator(s) of the emotional damage.  I've witnessed miracles of healing because of the innerchild methodology, in lock-step with spiritual rebirth.  Many times, the latter is overlooked when in fact the two complement each other in the healing and deliverance of an addicted, depressed adult.  The spiritual aspect is alluded to, but not expounded upon, by Bradshaw.  However, this omission does not affect the overall success of the process.  I still give the book Five Stars and would recommend this to anyone in need of deep healing."
I have not finished this book but i should say that i learned so much in the first few chapters that i am both fearful and excited to read the rest. It's therapy for people who would never go to a therapist.
"Everyone has an inner child - some more wounded than others.  Bradshaw knows what he is talking about and this book, combined with a couple others have been extremely helpful to many people I know, including myself."
"Not finished reading yet, but, finding the ideas very interesting and written in a straightforward easy to assimilate style.Almost everyone could benefit from awareness of Inner Child work whether as an adult from a 'wounded' family or as a parent who wants to raise emotionally healthy children.Can also help with understanding other people in our lives.Good info."
"Good book. Opens my eyes. We all need to work on healing our wounded child. There are many ways to do this, and this book highlights many of them."
I recommend this book to anyone who has experienced any type of childhood trauma. Even if you haven’t it is insightful to understand other.
Helpful for anyone looking to be better.  It takes some effort but the methods described are well explained and easy to follow.
"Very helpful book, but a painful process."
"This is very good book ,at the end of first chapter, has test and the test will let you know if the book is for you"
"I was a psychotherapist looking for the reason why some of my clients could not give up some of the behaviors that defeat them over and over again.  I found the answer in John Bradshaw's book ""Homecoming.""  My clients are responding with hope for the first time."
Amazing book! I bought one for my mom to.
Arrived on time and as described A+
Extremely helpful.
Insightful and helpful book. highly recommended
"This is a very good, insightful book. I'd highly recommend it, but I also believe it important to discern there can also be other factors at play, so when reading this book either gave awareness of other mental health conditions or be prepared to explore more."
Good book
Just starting to read
"This book guided me to meeting and healing and sending love to my inner child. After the experience, my life changed. I am much more confident, behaving mature, and feeling loved."
Wonderful insights for adults to begin the process of reclaiming their wounded child. I am doing the exercises to help me understand why I sometimes relate to people in a defensive manner. Very insightful!
"Diagnosed as a ""flaming"" codependent by my therapist, I was prescribed this book. I am very pleased with it and I've enjoyed finding my inner-child's lost feelings and emotions. Okay, maybe ""enjoyed"" isn't the correct term, but I've been learning so much about myself and I'm feeling much better by reading this book, going to CoDA meetings and my therapy sessions. If you are a codependent and are searching for answers and want to start feeling better today, get this book and do the lessons. It really works."
This is the only book ive read that moves the reader from just thinking about his problems to action steps leading to healing.
Exactly what I needed.
John Bradshaw is beyond knowledgeable. Very helpful on my journey of healing my inner child.Watch his videos on you tube
Excellent book.
Very helpful and insightful.  Definitely a good read

Bradshaw is right on target with this book and methodically takes he reader through the process of reclaiming the inner child. It is a long and arduous journey made easier by Bradshaws gentle guidance.
Very good book. Highly suggest reading
"Not just a book, but a workshop toward better mental health.  Excellent. Bradshaw this forerunner in inner child therapy and a master of self-help therapy."
very wonderful and easily understood book for someone dealing with problems of addiction or just any problems dealing withchildhood wounds.
"There is the inner child who needs to be acknowledged at the least.John Bradshaw is extremely helpful, so that the past can be unpacked, and we can unlearn certain patterns, and heal the inner child"
Extremely helpful self-help book!
Excellent product
A brilliant treatise and real rubber-meets-the-road primer and work book on how to heal the inner child. Top of the line recommendation. I do recommend it to my patients at the mental hospital.
Amazing book to read. Thank you...Fantastic. Must read and exercise book for recovering lost child. Read again and again. Thank you.
This book gave me a fresh perspective-- wow! Who'd of thunk? Children are NOT resilient! We do get damaged by the sins of our parents. I am now a counselor and have given this book to at least 6 clients so far but have used it with many more.
"whoa, this is a great read for everyone, it may relate to you or others that are in your life.  well written and rings of so much truth.have already recommended it to people I know and to clients."
"Speaking firshand as someone who has walked this walk twenty years ago, this is the key to changing your quality of life. You will get back twice what you put into this endeavor. Well worth the effort and then some."
"John Bradshaw is truly a hero to me.  He clearly writes the way to look at childhood pain, feel and grieve, and ultimately heal.  I have found no other book equal to the task of healing the shamed or wounded child."
Amazing book a must read!
"Any adult struggling with unresolved childhood baggage will truly find this book extremely valuable in beginning to identify and heal our ""wounded "" inner child!A must read for any childhood abuse survivors !"
As I still wrk on my inner child issues I return to this book many times to gain the insight and strength to see it through. Thank you  John Bradshaw!
My therapist recommended this book. Loving it so far.
"The book is like new, very clean with minimal wear. Thank you!"
This is an excellent book....Have been reading his books for years.....He writes in lay men's terms and it's easy to floow....best way to read it is a chapter at a time because it is a lot of valuable information.
Very important book.
John Bradshaw is the best when it comes to family systems theory and how to heal childhood emotional wounds! An important and treasured addition to my library.
MY THERAPIST RECOMMENDED  I READ THIS BOOK. I BOUGHT IT ON AMAZON.COM AT LESS THAN HALF-PRICE. IN READING IT I FOUND THAT I'M NOT SO DIFFERENT THAN OTHER PEOPLE.
This book was in excellent condition.  It was recommended to me by my Therapist.  I have started reading and working the exercises in it.  It was sent on time.  Thank You!
"For those who are seeking to heal from abuse and neglect, this is such a good book.  When we heal from the past, our present gets so much better and we make better decisions for the future."
Just as described!
"I highly recommend this book for those who are looking to change there life! It tell you have to heal your wounded child in you. It will be of great help to those who are over coming co-dependency, alcohol or any other addictions, whether it be Food, Porn, Drugs this book will help you figure out why you got stuck in the addiction."
"I've recommended this book for 22 years.... used price delivered to your door...hard copy. Deals with ""toxic shame and addictions of all types""....a MUST READ to get started on a path of healing.... WOW!!!!!"
I love the way he puts stuff and the understanding of the topic
The best book out there for those of you who grew up in a broken home.
It is very easy to relate to the writings in this book.
"This book is easy to understand, and has many helpful ideas to reclaim your inner child. In a world of so many responsibilities, it is a nice reminder to tend to this child. Arrived well packaged and as expected."
"This book is life-changing especially for those who have grown up in a dysfunctional ""family"" and were abused as children.  Healing the inner or wounded child is the main key to beginning the healing and recovery process.  Going through the grief work is extremely painful but a necessary part of loss and healing.  Anger also must be dealt with in productive ways since anger and grief are two sides of the same coin.  I also recommend ""Toxic Parents"" and ""Mothers Who Can't Love"" both by Dr. Susan Forward since it introduces a person to soothing or healing the wounded child that each of us were."
"Quite helpful, if you do the exercises."
Great book
"self help book, search through your stages of life realzing areas of difficulty then second part of book is learning to overcome these harboring unresolved hurts"
THis author is a favorite of my husbands. He is currently going through Homecoming again with a support group. He is having quite a few revealing moments as a result
excellent book for those working on themselves. half way through you may find you will need help working through some of your issues. well written and easily understood.
Dynamite help for the adult who was formerly abused as a child.
Item as described.
Very interesting book. I chose it because my therapist thought t as perfect for me due to my childhood history. So far so good
"VERY Powerful. As a matter of fact one of the most powerful books I""ve written, and doing the work has opened my heart to a greater ability to connect with my wife and all people.BUT don't bother if you are just going to read the book. Be ready to do the meditations and visualizations, write letters and lists and really work it.  Its worth it!"
Gift
It contains much had I have tried to clear up in my own life. I think everyone should read this book.
Very interesting. Bought another copy for my son.
This author has a great heart and soul. I've read one other book by him and his handling of psychology and the whole person is awakening. Just listening to his reasoning and content reveals the inner-ness of you.
"Fantastic book, many things to learn"
This book offers validation and hope towards healing. The wounds of shame are so deep and altering. Highly suggest this book...I also highly suggest seeing a licensed therapist while working through this book if you have any past trauma.
Start living your full potential by releasing hurts which occured long ago but still block you from moving forward. This practical book is a classic.  The exercises within can be used with the help of a therapist or on your own.
This book came in great if not perfect condition. Im very happy with this order and recommend this book for everyone!
The book came in on time and was in good condition. I have not had a chance to read all of it yet. but the conditionwas as promised.
Good book!
all J. Bradshaws books are inspirational for me
Life Changing
Great book!
If you truly commit yourself to the work in this book and stick with it it can be a real catalyst to change.
You won't regret reading it.
thanks
Reading this book has been my answer to questions of WHY am I the way I am and HoW can I grow & resolve my issues.🙏🏻
A classic. Still as relevant today.
This book definitely has helped me put some  feelings of uncertainty  about my childhood into clear understandings that I can grieve and heal from.
This is an easily understandable subject matter book with good structure. I like it a lot. I wish it was available in electronic format
Not a better book about accepting of oneself IMO
excellent for helping one to be all that they can be
This is book is a tough one to read. It's a very deep book.  Good for Soul searching especially if you are working with a councilor.
I learned a lot. Helped me grow and see others more clearly.
"If you are dealing with things you feel you cant get past, like grief, sadness or hurt or pain from someone else, THIS BOOK IS A MUST. I did find one thing that helped, I bought a cheep tape recorder at wal-mart and taped the afformations on it, and did them 3-4 times a day. VERY quickly I found I was feeling so much better about life and how I was dealing with things. We ALL have stuff from your past, and this book will help you find your way. Special note - you need to have SOMEONE to talk to and support you when things from your past come out, for you can go very deep into it. But when you work through it, your life will be 10 times better. John Bradshaw tells you every step and how to do them. It is worth a million bucks!"
Love the book
"As promised product, fast delivery and a good price."
Recommend for everyone
Great book!  very thorough in covering development stages and how to help heal them.
"Valuable book for those who are adult children, not knowing their true self!  I have not finished it yet, but it relates well to me..."
Very helpful book.
Awesome book! !!!
Wow.
Well worth reading
"Simply put, this book literally saved and changed my life. Everyone should take the time to read this book !!!!"
Amazing book!
for sorting out my adult life and why I react the way I do in certain situations. Began the healing process with Bradshaw.
good book
"This book is amazing. Super concise and absolutely complete.Deeply rewarding to do the work mentioned in the book. Do not miss this one, and please gift one to people who have recently had children!"
I love this book and it's exercises .
very helpful
"This book is a classic. It can be read alone or with a close friend who can help with the exercises. I read it on my own and almost put myself into a trance as I dug so deeply into my past. The insights are groundbreaking as Bradshaw eases the reader into uncharted territories of understanding, healing, forgiveness and moving forward. For anyone who feels victimized by past trauma in family relationships, this is a must read. It gently challenges the reader to grow up and leave the victimization behind."
Once you start reading this book you can not put it down.  Great self-help book with lots of homework to do.  If you are willing to take the time you will find and champion your inner child within you.
This book is a very easy read and really makes you think of how you became who you are.  It also helps you realize your parents did the best they could with what they had
Book is just as advertised - very pleased.
The book is laid out to really help someone get at the root of their core problems left by dysfunctional parents.
Everything came in perfect time & in great shape. Couldn't ask for any better.
"A book I have used, been inspired by and shared ( with therapy clients) for years. This new edition replaces my old one which fell to pieces eventually."
"I'm still reading this one, but it has a lot of examples to work with.  Along with the other books I've purchased regarding my ""Inner Child"", I find this one extremely helpful so far."
Yes I am changing my life a day at a time. Doing this book while in therapy.  A life changing book.
love this book
Feel like you weren't really parented as a kid? Did you feel alone or ignored a lot? The good news is you can actually re-parent yourself with this book. It can actually show you how to go back and meet all the needs you had as a child that just weren't met. It saved me from sad memories of my youth and now I am kind and gentle to the person I am. Try reading this book. I hope it makes a huge difference in your life too!
Awesome book!
This a a very powerful book! There is so much meat to it. I think it would be very helpful to anyone. It will give you a much greater understanding of your life. One of the best I have read.
Excellent. It has helped me understand why much of my adult behavior has been unhealthy.
Good read.
Very insightful book.
Excellent book
"I didn't choose this book to read, and wouldn't have ever read it, because I am just not a Bradshaw groupie. I am finding, however, that it does have some good insights."
Very helpful still
Everthing was orderly and on time.
"Homecoming: Reclaiming and Championing your Inner ChildIn this book Bradshaw (1992) who had PBS television series based on the major ideas of this book  puts forth the theory of a ""Wounded Inner Child"".  He hypothesizes that most of our interpersonal issues emerge and sustain because  our inner child is wounded . Further, each one of us has this inner child wounded to some extent and each family is dysfunctional to a certain point.The author might be very right but I tend to disagree with this theory of inner child.  The book contains exercises that you can take to see at what level of development your inner child got wounded and then  ideas to put into practice for the healing of your inner child.  The book might interest you if you have plenty of time on your hand."
"Great to be able to get an older book that is now a classic. Delivery was prompt, packaging good.Some creases on cover, otherwise clean pages. Thank you!"
"Good book for it's time, but by 2017, I've heard all this before."
thank you
"May be helpful to some but subscribes to the notion that we are all walking pathologies and ""grieving"" what we either know or imagine malpractice our parents did to us. If you were raised in a fairly traditional home with a pathological parent, you may find some help. But if, like many of us, you have no accounting of your early childhood, Bradshaw claims you can ""reclaim it"" through his questions. If you've heard of therapies that may spark false memories, Bradshaw's work may be a case in point"
Easy read and very to the point. A very helpful book.
Take your time to read slow and absorb every detail. I was happy to find this book after I had read it 25 years ago and discovering it was available!
The topics in the books made a lot of sense and were helpful. The writing style wasn't for me. It was very boring and hard to read.
Essentials
"I  have received the item, but have not had an opportunity to begin reading.  Book comes highly recommended by my Pastor."
"I have not finished yet, a friend recommended it to me to deal with issues that should have been dealt with a long time ago"
"Wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but it was still a good book & I learned a lot."
"However, there was quite a bit of underlining in the first half of the book. The rest of the book was okay"
"Read it more than once. John inspired me to take 15 months of my life out to co-found and fund a successful spousal and child abuse prevention center. Powerful, enlightening, sometimes necessarily painful masterpiece."
I am using this book with the help of a Christian counselor.  It is an excellent book.  It is changing my life.
A must read!
arrived as expected
Good
Excellent book
"A game changer for that ""Wounded Child"" in your life.  I should send a copy to 1600 PA Ave."
"Good book, especially for those that are reaccessing their past life to their future life."
Love the book. Educational.
"There were questions in the book, I didn't see s section that gave instructions on clarifying those questions with specifics."
"This product was ordered for a friend, not for myself.  She was very happy to receive it at a good price.  Thanks."
It was a book I've wanted for a long time
This book was purchased as a gift and is very helpful.  I would recommend!!
Exactly what the doctor ordered.
not a fan
Very helpful.
"I ordered this book on a recommendation, but was disappointed.  IF what is written is true, our world is more messed up than I even thought."
Love love love this must have book on learning about your inner child/self.
no problems
Get to the point
"I love the fact that i got a hardback book, however when it arrived it had a thumb/finger print smudge on pages."
no comment
"Provided insight to causes of adult problems brought on by childhood needs not being met in a healthy way. The workbook part did not help. Meditations of positive affirmations,  been there, done that for months, no help."
never finished it
I'm so glad to see this book is still currently being marketed. I read this in 1990 or 1991. I grew up with a mentally and emotionally broken person. Robotic. My life was painful everyday. I could not function with other people very well and kept getting myself hurt. This book healed me more than any other book. Honestly answer the questionnaire and follow the steps laid out. It will be painful but also immediately rewarding. You will know and feel the wounds closing up. To date I still have my book and am so grateful for the time Mr. Bradshaw took to write it.  I have also watched some of his group session. Powerful. I took back my life after I learned how from Mr. Bradshaw. May this book help you succeed in life too.
"After reading many, many books on trauma, have to say that this one is a dud. Many of his claims are not backed by any research and at times are purely wrong. For example, he talks about magical thinking. In kids, magical thinking is normal - ""If I do this, my cat will be hurt."" But to claim that an adult belief of ""if I work hard"", the world will reward me is a magical belief is a complete stretch. I also quite disliked the ""Contaminate"" framework where he talks about how the inner child is contaminating the adult - talk about bringing forth toxic shame and disgust for the inner child that you are supposed to love and help. For much better books on trauma look at ""The Body Keeps the Score,"" even Pete Walker's ""Complex PTSD"" (with its own shortcomings!). I personally found this book not well researched, not well written, un-truthful and damaging."
"I first read Healing The Shame That Binds You well over ten years ago, just as my marriage and frail life was coming unglued.  Lost amidst the emotional limbo tragedy tends to create within the hearts and minds of the wounded, I turned to authors whom I believed could relate to the soul crushing agony I was in.At the time, because my level of self awareness was so narrow, and because I was still very much 'reacting' to others opinions of me in my life--I believed that where I was, and what I was experiencing was par for the course.  Confused; short sided--I assumed ""I"" was the problem.  To soothe my angst, I turned to doctors who, rather than suggest I find out what was causing my anxiety--prescribed me anti anxiety meds instead--and sent me home.As my body physically continued to deteriorate, asthma, migraine headaches, and unexplained rashes became part of my new everyday experiences.  I felt like a feather caught up in a tornado.  I never knew what out of the blue ailment was going to strike next.Only because my ex husband insisted that I was crazy--did I go see a therapist.At the first meeting my therapist asked me if alcoholism was a part of my family dynamic.I said, ""No"" my parents don't drink.Then he pushed a little further, which resulted in my non-chalant reply, "" Well both sets of my grandparents were alcoholics.""""So you were raised not by one--but two Adult Children of Alcoholics?""""Yeah--and?'"" was my innocent reply.Up until that meeting, I had never considered the idea that in some way alcoholism had affected my life.  I believed instead--that there was something chemically wrong with me.Unable to relax, get happy, or to be easy about anything in my life--I presumed I was ill--defective--just plain wrong.Healing the Shame That Binds You--opened my mind as well as my heart.  To learn for the first time that I was not alone, and even better--to learn that everything I was feeling was NORMAL for a person who had been raised by ACoA--help balance me emotionally better than any pill ever could.What John explained--hit home.HIs book Home Coming is for those who want to take their recovery on the road.  If you are at a stage in your recovery where you are asking, ""Ok--now what?  Where do I go from here? I know I have been wounded--and I know why--now what?"" this book is for you.It is because of authors like Bradshaw, Louise Hay, Melody Beattie and Dyer that I found the courage to write my own book about my personal journey out of the abyss self hate can be.Yes...buy this book.Namaste...Lisa A. Romano"
"I'm giving this a 4 star rating only because I haven't finished it and have a long way to go.  If  you are cynical and all about solid sci-ency stuff and have a vendetta against accepting yourself as a victim (aka hate ""victim-hood"") this book is not for you. If you don't do visualization imagination and meditation .. this book is not for you. If you are not accepting of your own circumstances .. this book is not for you.. however.. if you like me have a sense of a childlike self inside you.. know and accept that you were and in a way still are a victim to childhood trauma and or abuse and are ready to face and accept that.. buy this book. Its not easy.. it will make you cry .. it will make you remember things you don't want to and at time may even make you feel a bit silly ... but what could it really hurt to try? I'm only on the third exercise and I can't say ""oh i've seen the light"" but i can say it speaks to me and my inner child. I just hope I am strong enough to keep going because it is not an easy thing to try and go through by yourself.. if you are blessed enough to have love and support for something like this take the dive and try it."
"John Elliot Bradshaw (born 1933) is a speaker and author who has hosted a number of PBS television programs on topics such as addiction, recovery, codependency and spirituality. He was preparing for the Catholic priesthood, but his alcoholism turned him away, and he found sobriety in a 12-Step group for alcoholics. He has written numerous other books, such as

  , etc. [NOTE: page numbers refer to the 288-page hardcover edition.]He wrote in the Prologue to this 1990 book, ""I began my inner child work more than ten years ago, using a rather makeshift meditation with some of my therapy clients... I developed an entire workshop to help people find and embrace their inner child... This is the most powerful work I have ever done. The workshop focuses on helping people finish their unresolved grief from childhood---griefs resulting from abandonment, abuse in all forms, the neglect of childhood developmental dependency needs, and the enmeshments that result from family-system dysfunction... In the workshop we spend most of the time on grieving our neglected childhood developmental dependency needs. That is also the main focus of this book... I describe the normal dependency needs of childhood. If those needs are not met, we tend to grow into adulthood with a wounded inner child. Had our childhood needs been met, we would not have become 'adult children.'"" (Pg. xi)He states, ""I never once found a person whose addiction was purely chemical... The common factor I always found was the wounded inner child. It is the insatiable root of all compulsive/addictive behavior."" (Pg. 21) He says, ""Reclaiming your inner child involves going back through your developmental stages and finishing your unfinished business."" (Pg. 56) He suggests, ""The good news is that original pain work involves nature's own healing process. Grief is the healing feeling. We will heal naturally if we are just allowed to grieve."" (Pg. 76)He argues, ""Being a good parent is a tough job. I believe it is the hardest job any of us will ever do. To be a good parent, you must be mentally healthy. You need to be getting your own needs met thorugh your own resources, and you need a spouse or significant other to support you in the process. Above all, you must have healed your own wounded inner child."" (Pg. 87) He admits, ""In my spiritual quest, Saint Teresa, the Little Flower, modeled maternal nurturing for me. I've had powerful nurturing from Mary, the mother of Jesus. She is truly my heavenly mother."" (Pg. 189)Perhaps surprisingly, he admits, ""I can now see that my whole life is perfect. My dysfunctional family, my alcoholic dad and co-dependent mom, my poverty---all were perfect. They were exactly what I needed to experience in order to do the work I am now doing. Without my childhood I would never have done a TV series on dysfunctional families or written books on shame and shame-based families. And certainly I wouldn't be writing this book ... which calls you and me to reclaim and champion our wounded inner kids."" (Pg. 262-263)Bradshaw is nowhere near as popular today as he was back in the 1980s/1990s. But his books clearly reveal the reason for his popularity within the Recovery movement."
"John Bradshaw discusses how people can learn to nurture their inner child, in essence offering themselves the good parenting that they always needed and longed for. John offers a step-by-step process of exploring what he calls the ""unfinished business"" of each developmental stage, with the aim of identifying destructive family roles/rules and understanding the impact that these experiences have had. What I find particularly useful about this book is John Bradshaw's instruction in the technique of letter-writing to the inner child, a healing technique that can be very useful to anyone who is critical or ignoring of themselves."
"A year ago, I found out that I am co-dependent. In fact, I am extremely co-dependent. That was the first step towards understanding why my life hasn't been working. I'm on my third marriage and it looked like that was going to end in failure as well. I always felt that there was something wrong with me and lived with an undercurrent of sadness because I knew on some level that who I was and who I was supposed to be wasn't in alignment.As part of my recovery, inner-child work is very important as that is the very core and origin of co-dependency. I remembered about John Bradshaw from his PBS days so I read the reviews posted here and ordered the book.I sincerely believe that this book should be required reading for any adult that is suffering from fear, inner pain, any form of self-doubt, addictions, etc. John Bradshaw has laid out the whys and how to change them into understanding and self-forgiveness. I now understand when my co-dependency started, why my development became arrested at that age, and what needs weren't being met. It has nothing to do with blame. It's an easy yet extremely informative read.I can understand why someone thought this book should come with a warning. This book speaks to the very heart of our pain and in order to get past it and heal, we have meet it where it lives and re-experience that pain. For some, it could be unbearable, especially if they're are not accustom to going deep or are apprehensive about truly facing their own pain. Personally, I took the author's advice and did the work with an experienced therapist. My results are nothing short of amazing. I reconnected and reclaimed my inner child and since then, have been in a state of perpetual bliss. I took my child out of the darkness and brought her into the light. Since that moment of reconnection, my feelings about myself have been confirmed; I was born a loving, joyful, and insatiably curious little ball of fun. I ""let"" her run around in my house and hear her squeals of joy. It's totally mind blowing.If I could give this book a thousand stars, I would. It has changed my life and changed the course of my marriage."

  , etc.He wrote in the Prologue to this 1990 book, ""I began my inner child work more than ten years ago, using a rather makeshift meditation with some of my therapy clients... I developed an entire workshop to help people find and embrace their inner child... This is the most powerful work I have ever done. The workshop focuses on helping people finish their unresolved grief from childhood---griefs resulting from abandonment, abuse in all forms, the neglect of childhood developmental dependency needs, and the enmeshments that result from family-system dysfunction... In the workshop we spend most of the time on grieving our neglected childhood developmental dependency needs. That is also the main focus of this book... I describe the normal dependency needs of childhood. If those needs are not met, we tend to grow into adulthood with a wounded inner child. Had our childhood needs been met, we would not have become 'adult children.'"" (Pg. xi)He states, ""I never once found a person whose addiction was purely chemical... The common factor I always found was the wounded inner child. It is the insatiable root of all compulsive/addictive behavior."" (Pg. 21) He says, ""Reclaiming your inner child involves going back through your developmental stages and finishing your unfinished business."" (Pg. 56) He suggests, ""The good news is that original pain work involves nature's own healing process. Grief is the healing feeling. We will heal naturally if we are just allowed to grieve."" (Pg. 76)He argues, ""Being a good parent is a tough job. I believe it is the hardest job any of us will ever do. To be a good parent, you must be mentally healthy. You need to be getting your own needs met thorugh your own resources, and you need a spouse or significant other to support you in the process. Above all, you must have healed your own wounded inner child."" (Pg. 87) He admits, ""In my spiritual quest, Saint Teresa, the Little Flower, modeled maternal nurturing for me. I've had powerful nurturing from Mary, the mother of Jesus. She is truly my heavenly mother."" (Pg. 189)Perhaps surprisingly, he admits, ""I can now see that my whole life is perfect. My dysfunctional family, my alcoholic dad and co-dependent mom, my poverty---all were perfect. They were exactly what I needed to experience in order to do the work I am now doing. Without my childhood I would never have done a TV series on dysfunctional families or written books on shame and shame-based families. And certainly I wouldn't be writing this book ... which calls you and me to reclaim and champion our wounded inner kids."" (Pg. 262-263)Bradshaw is nowhere near as popular today as he was back in the 1980s/1990s. But his books clearly reveal the reason for his popularity within the Recovery movement."
"I am very active on the No More Mr. Nice Guy board and this is the first book I recommend to people who are struggling with problems from the past, dating problems, or marriage problems. I usually start with the abridged audio version of this book.The premise of this book is taht because of your chilhood conditioning, your ""emotional brain,"" the amygdala, has repressed feelings. Those feelings still control you. It's the basis of the toxic shame. You have to get them out. The best way to get them our is by tapping into the subconscious mind, which the abridged audio version of this book does. The paper version is also very good as well, particularly for those who grew up in families of alcoholics, or with too much relgiion. Actually, I like how he points out taht many people medicate their toxic shame with religion.I have read many of Bradshaw's books and think this one is the best. I don't even recommend the others. If you're a guy, I encourage you to read it with No More Mr. Nice Guy and join that discussion board to get help with your recovery so the past can stop controlling you."

"Having not read the book I can't say for certain but I don't think the Audio book is just a straight reading of the printed material. If that were the case, the book would be very short. It seems more to be several coaching sessions that have been roughly cobbled together. Some sections are almost aggressive while others are slow and drawn out meditative sessions to help you resolve issues with your inner child. At the end, he even suggests that you read the book to get more detailed information on the subject.This was not, at all, what I was looking. I expected the Audiobook to be a reading of the content of the book. It's not, and that's very disappointing."
"This was recommended to me by a misguided friend (lol!).  It may be just fine, but I'm not qualified to tell you, I don't have substance abuse issues."
"I actually have owned this book for many years (the original edition). This is a book that is just incredible. It has helped me so much over the years.It is easy to understand and follow, and helps you to discover your own healing journey. The other good thing about this book is that now I can look back and see how far I have come since I first read it.This book has really helped me over the years. I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to heal and connect with their inner child. Wounds from the past can affect us way more than we think. This book guides the reader through the past in such a way that is comforting. This has been one of the most useful books that I have come across over the years."
I wrongly thought that newer material would be more evolved. This is a remarkable book. Buy this ( Blessed Book) and then heal and reclaim your Inner Child! Bradshaw. This old book is awesome and as relevant today as the day it was published.Great ACA / ACOA Literature!
"At age thirteen, the emotional state of my family changed dramatically. The details I'll leave out.. Nothing violently illegal happened. Simply put, an event occurred. I've written about it before, but with some regret, so I'll avoid the details. It was horrifying.After the incident, no adult recommended professional therapy for the children. Keep in mind, fifty years ago, mental health was something best kept out of a conversation, and if considered, not spoken to anyone. And besides, children are resilient, right? Don't believe it. Nothing is further from the truth.Today, the condition we kids suffered with for decades, and even now wrestle with, is known as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). In the early sixties, there was no name for it. Neither was it recognized or understood by the average parent, at least not by the adults surrounding our lives. Children were left alone with their thoughts and feelings, left to struggle through the inner turmoil without a listening ear, a guide or hope. Without a break, we heard the same unanswerable questions in our heads, meditated upon in them in our hearts, and repeated them over and over, year after year, as we individually attempted to make sense of that senseless event. And so, that unnamed and unrealized condition, PTSD, clung to us during the proceeding predictable phases of their lives -- other schools, activities, military duty, and relationships.At age 19, my life was interrupted by a revived faith in Christ. The initial commitment to attend services and voraciously study the Bible kept me occupied for eight years. I thought discipleship would manifest the cure, and at first it seemed to be, but, to my regret, I could not procure the miracle I was desperate to secure. In its place, I saw only the flaws of a widespread belief system that was failing its adherents: repetitive methodologies and formulas designed to force God's hand, doctrinal extremism, debates, sheep stealing, personal kingdom building, illegal activities, and more.Rather than stopping my search, I continued on, and through a young woman with whom I became friends, I discovered John Bradshaw and a psychological approach called inner child work. Adopting it, I made a few advances as I learned to talk to that little fellow inside me, to tell him everything is okay, and that life is worth experiencing.Today, I'm 62 and ready to retire from a job that I have held for nearly 27 years. I suppose that is proof of some success. I don't have a family of my own, since, as I found out in an accidental sort of way, I'm sterile and have been since birth. So I was always unable to make children. I share my time with a female friend in possession of a large family, including ten grandchildren. During my military hitch from 1969-72, I developed tinnitus and hearing loss. I wear hearing aids, and when the kids are kids, the noise can be overwhelming for me. That's when I calmly say my goodbyes and head home to my cat, Bella.I like to read, write, play a bass and sing in a ""quiet"" band, and I enjoy a trip or cruise once in a while. Maybe soon I'll get away again, this time on a longer trip with my friend. She's good company as long as my comments stay to the point, that I don't unconsciously employ sarcasm to be funny. Responses like that are how I was brought up in SW PA. Having a dry wit came with the territory. Not everyone understands it."
"Three cheers for John Bradshaw!  A thoroughly enjoyable, helpful, practical, fun and ultimately liberating book for anyone who has unresolved issues with their childhood and who has tried (and failed) to move onward and forward with their lives as an adult.Bradshaw doesn't spend a lot of time dwelling on the circumstances that led to feelings of shame or grief from childhood trauma's, although he does a wonderful job of validating how those feelings came to be. Rather, he quickly delves into how to `heal"" and reclaim the fun loving child present in all of us that became repressed and frozen dealing with painful events in childhood.Bradshaw's reference to the inner child in the title of the book sounded corny and touchy feely at first but after a few pages I found the flavor of the book to be actually the opposite.  Bradshaw writes from the heart over disappointments and heartache that he himself experienced as a child growing up due to his father's struggle with alcoholism.The book is well written with plenty of supporting material, studies and references behind his theories and ideas about how to reclaim the childlike spirit that thrives inside all of us as adults and what actually makes life worth living.  The exercises he uses are fun and enlightening and he reiterates over and over again that much of what was not learned or developed as children was not the fault of the child, but rather was a shortcoming and responsibility of the parent/caregiver.  However, he reasons and reassures that now, as an adult, one has  the power to correct these deficits.What is especially refreshing is his assertion that this is not easy work.  Bradshaw makes no claims or promises but simply accompanies one along the path of developing, possibly for the first time, appropriate coping strategies and emotional skills for caring for one's self and interacting with the world.  This essentially allows one to pick up where they left off as a child and write a better ending for themselves.It should be stated that this is not simply a self help book about how to be a better person or how to overcome some emotional obstacle.  Homecoming is geared towards developing how to experience joy, wonder, awe, fun and creativeness in life as children so naturally do.Give this book a shot if you or a love one are stuck emotionally and have found nothing else to work."
"Most of us have been raised by parents who did not realize the damage they did to us in our formative years. ""Homecoming"", allows us to see and repair that damage and therefore to treat ourselves as our parents should have treated us. The most important part is that you must be willing to recover very badly to start this journey, because it takes a lot of courage to explore yourself this way. The information in this book could make a dramatic difference in your life, once you've looked at the inner feelings and dealt with them, you're on your way to whatever you want of yourself.  This book  brought up memories I did not know I had, it stirred up many emotions that were buried for years, thus, helping me improve my self-esteem and become healthier."
"We tend not to recognize, after a time, the inventors of a seizmic shift in consiousness or perspectivethat reverberates for decades for an entire people.  After a time, we come to believe that a movement, not advanced by  war or the economic equivalent of such tyranny, was something that was  simply meant to be.  We will even begin to give credit to the erstwhile  disciples of the movement- those who ride the crest of a preexisting wave-  in a search for who to acknowledge; in part from a fear of believing an  individual can in fact change the world so profoundly with insight,  creativity and generosity.John Bradshaw's HOMECOMING is such a work, and  he is such a man.  His ideas have long since become the stuff of  trivialization, as the buzz phrase ""inner child"" has been drained  of its marketable exploitation and appeal.  And yet that trivialization has  been a response to the degree to which we are now intellectually and  emotionally living in his world.I rank this book as one of the most  important written during this now ending twentieth century.  Make no  mistake, our concerns about something as seemingly unrelated as child labor  practices in India and China today, and how much we care about it now (when  it has existed for centuries, just like here) can be traced back in part  back to Bradshaw's influence in how we see the life of children, and  subsequently the inner and outer life of adults- ourselves.Its effect on  the world as we know it will be felt for years to come, long after it has  been forgotten or redefined as a late eighties/early nineties pop  psychology fad.Do not be surprised by the books and authors, living and  dead, of a multiplicity of disciplines, you find yourself drawn to after  reading this.  Do not also be surprised at how well it teaches you about  who you are, and how deeply it touches your soul."
"I am very happy that I came across with that book. It is the classic book of psychology and self-development and digging into your own deep, deep past. Seems like all modern life coaches repeat many of John Bradshaw findings.I did the exercises in the book. I cried during the whole process.I am going to do listen to this again in some time. I help to get stronger, accepted, loved by yourself."
"I haven't had a chance to read it yet. If you ask again in the future, I'll let you know. Thanks."
"After a long co-dependent marriage...and I married very young, no surprise....and now after marrying a man who I don't need to fix...(and therefore became extremely dependent on emotionally) I thought I was just perhaps not able to be with anyone.  In this new second marriage, I became increasingly and surprisingly needy, clingy, and very jealous...  After I realized the pain was just too much to bear...I entered into therapy which then raised my awareness that I may have inner child issues ..abandonment issues but just knowing that doesn't help at all with present day pain.  Does it?  So I began to search desperately for more help and understanding.  Many things have really helped me and this book  really did.I recommend some sort of continuing dialogue with those that are going through the process too.  We can begin a discussion page through Amazon so I'm going to do that and refer to it as an Inner Child page.  It is such a new process and journey for me I believe a group forum would be very helpful to work on these issues daily.I wish everyone who has made their way to this book and are on the journey continued success in their recovery."
"To accept our vulnerability is to be courageous.  Bradshaw himself had a lot of emotional pain and he has figured out that by being honest about our feelings, it is possible to resolve past emotional pain!  This concept is not new - in some cultures such as that in the Indian tradition, to grieve over losses is considered very important.  A prime example is the mourning that occurs after the death of a dear one.  The family cries along with friends and relatives, sometimes for days on end.  After the 10th day, everybody is normal and back to business ready to face the new reality!  After reading Bradshaw's book, practicing his techniques, and experiencing a sense of empowerment and emotional growth, I can fully appreciate this tradition of expressing grief, brought to us from our forefathers.Just like the body is capable of healing a physical wound by itself - all we need to do is protect the wound from being hurt again, take some precautions, etc, - thankfully, the mind is capable of healing emotional wounds by itself - otherwise there would probably be no sane people in this world.  In today's fast-paced life, we need to be deliberate in providing our mind with environments conducive to healing.  Bradshaw gives us techniques which will help us and our loved ones for the rest of our lives.  Thanks to Bradshaw and others like him, I now thoroughly know the value of healing our emotional knots, and by implication the emotional distress we can cause our children and relatives by our improper behaviour.John Bradshaw is a gift to humanity."
"This is one of the best books ever written for folks who grew up in dysfunction.  It is easy to read, crisp, clear and concise.  It has a depth of understanding while maintaining an ease of communication that is just down-right enjoyable.  It is one of the most positive books within this genre because it constantly presents solutions to the challenges."
If you want to feel sorry for yourself and justify it then this is the book for you because it doesn't offer solutions
"The 1,000 word limit for this review does not allow enough space to say all that I would say about this book, and more particularly, what it did for me, and could do for you.There really is a Wonder Child in all of us. The more damaged we are, the more opportunity for the magnitude of the emerging of that Wonder Child in reading and embracing this book. For years, in fact all of my adolescent and young adult life, I knew something was not right, I just could not put my finger on it. I wondered why I would ""act up"" in professional environments and ""lose it"" just on the edge of success. This book answered all those questions and guided me to restoration of my ""self"".John brings home the essence of what we need as toddlers and adolescents. He spells it out simply as Love, Guidance, and Permission along with a few other very fundamental needs of children. He makes it very clear as to the damage caused by emotional and physical abuse, over-protection, under-guidance, abandonment and other acts that parents do not even realise are occurring. The realization of these as issues, and the guidance to work these age-old and often subconsciously buried issues to closure, is the key to ones ""self"".With all due respect to other reviewers, this is a book that can not simply be read. It must be practiced and lived. Having gone to several seminars and workshops of John Bradshaws', I slowly saw the Wonder Child emerge. Since reading this book and doing the work for a year (don't get me wrong it does not end there) I have gone from 20 years as a white collar worker in my career, being constrained by dysfunctions, to a top consultant in my field. Only because of this book and the discoveries that it led me to in order to free my ""self"".And for those who claim that this type of work is herecy, WRONG... I have also become a better Christian as a result of the outcome.Read it. Be prepared for emotions when you do, but.... read it."
I'm so happy to receive this book. I can't wait to know my inner child. It's time to shine and be free. Thank you for writing this book.
"I am currently reading this book and decided to purchase another book for a friend and I have not received it yet, but I highly recommend this book to everyone....t has something useful for every adult."
"Bradshaw has written a book on perceiving and rectifying problems in your life as a result of your dysfunctional childhood, which many of us have had.I am sure his approach is very helpful to many people. But, I found his dwelling on negative case examples, to be counterproductive- so much so that I returned his book for a refund- which I have never done before.Reading his book reminded me of watching American news media, such as CNN. A ""never ending saga of tragedies"" that should stimulate the reader. Not at all what I wanted to read.I suggest to Bradshaw to do a rewrite that removes most of his own personal pain, that permeates almost every page.He will do us all a service."
"If you have suffered from a difficult childhood, especially one which included an alcoholic, this book is a must read.  Because he lived the life himself, John Bradshaw brings empathy to the task in buckets.  The tests require honesty about yourself, but if you find that you fit the ""wounded child"" profile, this book will absolutely help you get out of the rut of recrimination that has dogged you most of your life.  Perhaps the best part about his method is that it is relatively simple and you do it yourself.  There are no expensive psychological or psychiatric tests, appointments, etc.  I was so impressed that I bought the book for my brother and sister.  And now, my sister and I are going to attend a Bradshaw lecture on a slightly different, but related, topic."
"Bradshaw is a wonderful writer, with a warm tone and compassionate point of you. This is a classic and is highly recommended for any social worker or therapist, or just on your own if you want to understand your internal process and your family dynamics better"
"This book sat in my bookshelf for 6 months before I read it. When I finally picked it up, I felt John Bradshaw was writing all about me. Once I'd completed this book I wondered why John Bradshaw is not running the world. As you're reading the book you realise it is not a ""self-help"" book, it is a workbook which will change you forever. I recommend reading the first two sections of the book, skipping the exercises, and then go back and thoroughly read, doing the exercises in the exact order he recommends.  I think everyone should read this book, whether they are from a dysfunctional family or not.  If you are from a dysfunctional family, and are sick of feeling empty, confused, angry, this book is for you!  You will wish you'd discovered it years ago!  Well done John Bradshaw!"
"It's been almost 20 years since this book was published and after re-reading it this week it holds up extremely well.  I was curios to see how his advice on reconnecting with true essence compared to recent writings by authors such as Byron Katie and Eckart Tolle.  I am happy to report, very well thank you.Drop the masks, heal thyself, forgive, live in the present and have the time of your life!  AMEN!"
I watched the author give workshops in PBS and it helped me then ..but now the book feel like is for severe cases of abuse .I don’t feel identified with the way the book is written .
"Powerful book, really opened some emotions and showed where I need to practice my own mindful reflections.  It gets a little long winded in the meditations section."
"John Bradshaw does a beautiful job showing how we all carry a historical ""inner child,"" the child we really were.  When that child did not get the love and nurturance that it needed, it will either act out or act in later in our adult years.  Bradshaw brilliantly shows the many ways in which the inner child got hurt and how it continues to contaminate our adult lives, unless and until we take steps to heal it.  This book does not dwell on self-pity or blame; rather it focuses on understanding what happened, why it happened, and then dedicates the majority of the pages to a constructive approach to healing the inner child so that we can live a full, happy life."
"This followup to his book HEALING THE SHAME THAT BINDS YOU which catapaulted him into becoming a host of three PBS t.v. series based on his writings, ON FAMILY and ON HOMECOMING from this book, he explains why he believes in and uses 'existential philosophy.'  He feels that we need a balance between Apollo, the god of form and structured discipline, and Dionysus, god of ecstasy and creativity.  The secret of balance is that all of life is a marriage of opposites: ""...no life without physical death; no joy without sorrow, no pleasure without pain; no light without darkness; no sound without silence; no good without bad.  True health is a form of wholeness.""Robert Fulghum was quoted: ""I know what I really want for Christmas.  I want my childhood back.  Nobody is going to give me that...I know it doesn't make sense, but since when is Christmas about sense, anyway?  It is about a child of long ago and far away, and it is about the child of now.  In you and me.  Waiting behind the door of our hearts for something wonderful to happen.""  I remeber reading Bradshaw's FAMILY SECRETS: THE PATH TO SELF-ACCEPTANCE AND REUNION when it came out, and became acquainted with his concept of ""inner child"" he espouses in this book, how I felt I had to hide it from my teenage son, but I needed to know what had brought on such a terrific chronic nerve pain, and how to live with it.  As always, it was caused by a traumatic life event over which I had no control.  He explains that trauma has a twofold potential: unresolved pain repressed at the time the trauma happened.  ""There are places in the heart which do not yet exist; pain must be in order that they be.""There is such a thing as ""metaphysical blues' especially at Christmas time.  ""...No matter how completely we fulfill our earthly goals and dreams, even when we arrive just where we have longed to be [back home], we always experience a slight disappointment.""  Sometimes it is more than 'slight,' and we wonder as Peggy Lee did in the song, ""Is that all there is?""  John Greenleaf Whittier wrote"" Somehow not only for Christmas, but all the long year through, the joy that you give to others is the joy that comes back to you. And the more you spend in blessing the poor and lonely and sad, the more of your heart's possessing returns to make you glad.""  He tells the story of a 'tender elf' named Joni with a mission something like that of Eubie, Harry Connick, Jr.'s, 'happy elf' which inspired the new Christmas cartoon classic.In 1989, Jimmy Gupton was ninety-three years old, alone with no family, and was known just as the man who wanted to go home.  A young mother brought her young children with her (including a three month child) as she cleaned his house and made the house festive. Seeing the child brightened his heart and he said, ""Here it is, almost Christmas, and we don't have a tree up.  There's a beautiful tree in the attic, tall and grand with colorful lights beaming across its silver branches made of tinsel.""  He switched on the multicolored floodlight after the tree was inserted into the revolving stand he had made out of an old t.v. antenna, and the tree started to turn like a silver ballerina.""  Sometimes, it takes a wee child to bring an old person back to life so as not to dwell on the dead.  He writes, ""We are all 'infants crying in the night' who need one another's support.""This is written by one who's been there, done that, and survived.  ""I did not find inner peace because I did not find myself.""  He was born in Houston, Texas (as was Rodney Crowell, the Houston Kid), into a troubled family, with an alcoholic father who abandoned them .  He's a great public speaker at conferences and workshops dealing with dysfunctional families.  ""The greatest learning of life is that creativity overcomes violation and is the answer to violence.""He is a good role model as he's lived an interesting life (almost became a Catholic priest), earned three degrees from the University of Toronto in Canada, and was from early educational opportunities a ""high academic achiever.""  He also wrote CREATING LOVE: THE NEXT GREAT STAGE OF GROWTH."
"I'm listening to the audio on this and wow. I read an article by a psychologist about healing from the core and as i listened to the first chapter i could feel so much of what he was talking about. One minute tears would be in my eyes as i would realize i am doing exactly what he was speaking about and want, yearn to heal."
This is the first time that I have felt strong enough about a self help book to actually write a review. This book is one of the single most defintative reasons that I finally feel like I have the anwsers to the questions that have haunted me for 36 years.  The author does a wonderful job of guiding the reader through a step by step process to uncover the underyling reasons that we act in ways that are detrimental to our emotional health. He opened my eyes to things that I wasnt even aware of. I think this was one of the best things about the book. you cant even begin the healing process intil you know what questions to ask.
"Useful in working from ""Your Inner Child of the Past"""" and ""Healing the Child Within."""
"Creating Love: The Next Great Stage of Growth









  
  
    
  My Spirit and soul awakened to Bradshaw's ""Creating Love"".  How could I escape the truth when it was staring me in the face.  He tells us how to demystify love and begin a new life in all of our relationships. He writes with such great respect, dignity and loving kindness.I will gratefully bless him for the next 40 years!!!  Thank you, John Bradshaw; for the FREEDOM to find me, awaken me, take care of me, love me and show me how to create love with other's."
"After listening to this audio series, I realized that I had suffered greatly as a child. This suffering was, in part, do to my parents' inability to be good models and their parents before them. This series  helps you to learn how to end the cycle and progress as an individual. I  needed the regression therapy (my term)and techniques on learning how to  get in touch with those child-like emotions again. I highly recommend this  to anyone who has feelings of inadequacy or unknown fear. John Bradshaw is  amazing!!"
"for everyone hanging on to past baggage ,read this book and heal.3 of us read this and all felt the same way.Blessings"
this could be good for frufru optimist types but if you're dark and brutal like me it's a waste of time.
John Bradshaw offers a lot of insight into one's being.
How to build your inner loser.
"This isn't a bad book - not at all! It's very helpful at helping one realize how events in childhood affect, no - form the person we are today. It has some very good exercises for getting in touch with one's inner child . ..  I liked it, and found it useful. Worth the money and the time reading it -"
"Lifesaving words for which I will be ever grateful.  This should be required reading for every parent, future and past, and teachers as well.  I know my students appreciate my having read this book.  I've taught early  childhood for fifteen years, and I believe this should be a required book  for all education students.Thanks John Bradshaw!"
"In trying to move on this was recommended to me.  After doing the exercises, I still can't get past the fact that the blame still falls on the parents - even when he insists that he is not blaming them.  As self-help books go, it's just OK at best."
This book was life changing. I cannot heap enough praise on it's value. Passages and chapters must be read over and over again to feel and rediscover the real you and a better tomorrow.
Worth the time.
A must read for all.
"This book cange my life in a lot of fields. I have read of self help books, but this book really helped me to understand so much i my life, and why other behave the way the do. I give this bokk five stars, read and bekome a new person :-)"
Bought for a class.
The two books received were in excellent condition and the service was prompt.  Thanks!
"I bought this book at the suggestion of a therapist I have been seeing.  I did my best to work through the activities and ignore his constant attacks on my Catholic faith and religion in general.What eventually led me to put down this book was Chapter 7: Reclaiming Your School Age Self.  In this chapter, he shames the whole system and gripes about how schools are set up to harm children.  He compares them to prisons and calls the grading system ""very shaming and distressing"" which ""creates toxic shame.""  ""In our schools,"" he says, ""if you did not learn geometry as fast as other kids your age, you failed geometry.""  Essentially, this is a child's voice couched in pseudo-academic language.  It sounds as if, years later, he hasn't gotten over the fact that math wasn't his strongest subject.  I disagree with him on what he says here (and in many other places), and while reading it I feel he is trying to shame me with the ""toxic shame"" he so often decries simply because I disagree with him.Throughout what I read, Bradshaw complains about how the world is out to hurt everyone.  You'll begin to wonder how anyone makes it through life at all.  His tone is whiny, self-righteous and sanctimonious.  His book advocates embracing victim-hood instead of becoming a warrior who has overcome your problems.If you want to remain a child with even greater problems, buy this book and start sucking your thumb.  Otherwise, keep looking, and keep living."
"Recommended by a friend, the book has some valuable content; however, the author quoted a prayer he learned as a Catholic priest, only to follow it with his opinion that Mary was not a virgin. At that point, I closed the book and returned it to the library. To think I actually considered purchasing copies for my adult children..."
As expected
Quality of item was sterling. Admirable delivery. Packaging was resplendent.
This was a gift.
This book helps in realising why individuals adapt certain toxic behaviours as adults and attempts to heal people that come from dysfunctional families - from mild to severe cases. It can become a bit painful doing the exercises. I read the first 11 chapters and I skimmed the last 2-3 chapters as I found them to be less beneficial for myself. I would recommend the book.
"I turned to this book during a period of crisis and personal discovery after reading about it in an article about or from Billy Connolly. I certainly learned a lot from it and still dip into it from time to time. There's a lot of wisdom to be found when you visit your inner child. Eye opening, for sure"
"A great read. So insightful.  This work is challenging and can be emotional.  Ultimately though, this allows empowerment and freedom and self confidence in relationships.  Wonderful work."
Strongly advise reading this with professional psychological support.... It is deep stuff.
"the book contains lots of tests to do to evaluate yourself overall and at each childhood phase.  the author goes through all phases; infancy, toddler, schoolage, teenage years and gives you insights as to how things might have gone wrong and then tips on how you can work on them. there is a part where the author advises not do to certain things without the approval of your therapist so if you are in therapy it would be a good idea to let your therapist know first. in any case the author is very careful in telling you what is safe to do and what not. even if you don't do the ""therapy"" part the book is still an excellent read on wounds that we acquire as we grow up."
Bought this book from Amazon many years ago when  l had to go to a retail Park in Waltham Forest.lent it and didn’t get it backIf any body has had a troubled life especially childhood .Its the greatest book ever written.
"A most excellent book!! Have the tissues to hand and trust the process!! Not easy to really do properly but well worth it! Important that you have some good, understanding support or that you're genuinely very well grounded"
"Great book, I would also offer to listen to its abridged audioversion: 

  
Home Coming: Reclaiming and Championing Your Inner Child









  
  
    
  Very useful guide on a way of discovering yourself."
This is a great book to help in recovery. It is emotional and so quite tiring to read. But this work is hard and emotional.  I hope it will help improve my lifehe is a good writer.
"Great book, fast delivery. Thank you"
Excellent book
"A lovely book. Can be a bit wish-washy in places for me but that's just my preference. Also, there are places where it becomes a little repetitive too; I found myself skipping some pages because I'd got the jist. However, all in all, a very enjoyable book and it gave me some great insight that helped me communicate with parts of myself that I'd previously thought I was in touch with but had been ignoring"
US book so not always relevant to UK. Lots of the book is based on group work. Author focuses on his own experience and quite religious and traditional views of family.
"Great book, a tough read in sections but a real eye opener and comforter in learning to love yourself"
"It is well and truly the best book about inner child I have ever read. The book is full of author's in depth knowledge and useful tips.  Whether or not you are a wounded child, this book would help you rediscovering your childhood and how it's affecting our life as an adult."
Excellent book. Enjoyed the clear writing on theory and love the way in moves into practical exercises for working with and healing the Inner Child
Arrived promptly. Haven’t read the whole book yet but the bits I have seem very interesting and helpful.
"Great Book, great Author. John bradshaw is a genious and a pioner . I'm working through the book right now with my therapist . A most for everyone who had a traumatic childhood ."
If you are doing the work get this book. Thats all i need to say
Fantastically insightful! Getting to the core of the issue and understanding.
Great book - recommended!
"Absolutely fabulous book, helped uncover & explains so much..definitely worth reading & working through."
"Great reading , gave me the knowledge to. Understand myself which in turn helped my recovery"
great read
Great book
I recommend this book to anybody who has difficulties in life especially family.
Groundbreaking at its time and very informative.Didn’t find the exercises to be very effective though.
Therapy
This was recommended to me and yes it is very insightful and helpful
very good
Brilliant book; a classic. This has helped me to heal deep emotional wounds from my childhood. This is one of John's most distinguished works.
One of the best books of inner child work
Getting great use of this book!!
"I bought this for a friend, if only because I found it such a beautiful book, she too is valuing it's content and says it is helping her enormously."
One of the best self-help books I’ve ever read
Not an easy read but worthwhile and recommended if you want to delve deeper in some habits that keep recurring.
Great inner child work x
"Excellent book, really help me, would highty recommend"
excellent and really makes a lot of sense :-)
This book has seriously helped improve my life. Love it
Excellent read
I’m sure the content is excellent however the print is too light and print is small the above pic shows a comparison between this book ( in the foreground )  and another book that to me is normal therefore it’s a strain for me to read . This has occurred in other paperbacks I’ve ordered. This book is just very poor quality sadly .. anyone who needs readers will find this difficult to read! I’m only a light 125 power in readers but still this is going to have to be returned .
"John Bradshaw wrote this book as a great source of information and as a workbook, which makes it enormously valuable.The first part describes how childhood is a crucial time for the development of basic behaviour patterns, character traits, and habits. Bad experiences and learning deficits in childhood lead to suppressed emotions, repressed anger, anxiety, insecurity, a lack of social skills, faulty anger management, compulsive behaviour, addictions, and more. As a result, many adults are actually adult children. A questionaire at the end of chapter one helps to determine if you need to do some work.In Part two John Bradshaw distinguishes five stages of child development.- Infant, age 0 - 9 months- Toddler, age 9 months - 3 years- Preschool, age 3 - 6 years- School-Age, 6 years to puberty- Adolescence, age 13 - 26 yearsEach stage begins with a tailor-made questionaire, which he calls Index of Suspicion. Then normal development during the stage is explained, and in contrast, he illustrates specific growth disorders and other problematic factors or events. After that he recommends that you write down as much information as possible about your family system and yourself. When done, you share it with a good, supportive friend or anyone you genuinely trust. It is important to talk about it and feel the feelings. Then you write a handwritten letter to your inner child at that age. As a response, you write a letter from this child yourself. The final step of each stage is to give your inner child kind and positive affirmations and a guided meditation that you can record and play back.Part three is about championing your wounded inner child, which means you give yourself a new childhood, a new nurturing set of rules to live your life more gracefully. Be the loving and supportive parent you wanted as a child.A change for the better can only be achieved if you do the suggested work. It takes a bit effort and time, but it's worth it."
This book taught me many things about childhood trauma. I understood how I was going about it wrong. Trying to focus on results and no empathy for the process. I learnt about my bad habits and how changing them could lead to a more fulfilling life.
"This is the kind of book that allows us to take the deep dive with compassion - more than once. This comes from the knowledge the author shares. We learn the origin of our handicaps and that it is no fault of our own. It's about things we were not taught by our neglectful guardians and unaddressed childhood wounds.Very few books also offer the way through and out in such detail. Clearly his personal and professional experience give us the road map to living life to the fullest. Definitely a book to work through more than once.Due to the pandemic and me living in Europe, it took a couple months to receive the book. This was NO fault of the seller. I even received notification about the delay. The quality was as promised. It was well wrapped.Buy with confidence!"
"The book had sings of not being handled correctly, the paint is coming off in the edges. Overall I can read it but I like to take care of my books and keep them in perfect condition"
"This book was recommended by a counselor, a good book if you're ready to make serious changes in the way you think and act, painful, emotional issues surfaces, be ready to confront them."
"I read some of it and knew I had to buy it.  I needed to put my mark on the book, texter, tears.  I have quite a few books for motivation and self-help and I  like to personalise them.  I love this book.  Thank you."
"Utterly life changing.  It can be extremely triggering and many of my traumatic experience came to the surface while reading, but the shift in me was almost immediate.  I feel so much more free and empowered.  A must read!"
I am not a huge fan of Bradshaw's written style but the content and insight offerd into the working of the brain and mind is amazing. It is not for the feint-hearted to trace the impact of childhood incidents and track the repetitions of learned behaviours into adult life.The self-help therapy offered seems daunting but leaves you feeling optimistic. I love the holistic approach to sound health and the place given to our spiritual selves.
"Ho comprato questo libro per studiarlo per un corso di ipnosi a Londra, mi sono diplomata a pieni voti, percio' lo consiglio anche a voi."
"i can't say enough about this book. it hits the nail right on the head. it is very helpful. it is a very practical book that will recomend you do many exercieses. Alot of the excersies are not pleasant, as you deal with bad past issues. however after doing them, i felt a little better each time. because of the exercises and the intensity of them, the book can take a while to go through. but it is well worth it. it helped me figure out why i was acting a certain way, where it all started from, and what to do about it. highly  recomended!"
"Amazing book, highly recommend it. life changing read if read with purpose."
Great book! Great ready was recommended it by my therapist.
Used copy of Bradshaw's book arrived as expected.
I love how John Bradshaw helps to heal families and individuals
"So insightful, full of pearls of wisdom.  A must read for those who have been wounded as children and come from disfynctional backgrounds.  Helpful for me because I am an adoptee and was not affirmed nor felt validated as a child in my adopted family.Anyone who was not loved unconditionally as a child, and that's most of us should read.  Anyone who fears abandonment but also fears engulfment should read.  Anyone who's infancy needs were not met, leaving them with feelings of shame, and a feeling deep down that something is wrong with them should read.  Anyone seeking to heal the wounded inner child should read."
Happy with the shape of the book.
Seeking recovery- get this
"From the onset, this book has helped me in discovering the person I lost many years ago.  It can be a hard read, if your suffering, however just lay it down and come back to it ... engaging!!"
"I heard about this book and was excited about reading it but I didn’t get that far into it before I gave up.  I’m very into energy healing and have done a lot of general clearing work on myself and a lot of self analysis.  I think perhaps the book is designed for people who aren’t particularly self aware.  Energetically I found the book incredibly heavy and unpleasant to hold, I even saged it, this could perhaps be because I bought it second hand and was picking on in the previous person’s energy.  I also found the quizzes poor.  There would be two questions listed where only one answer was required and often my answer was yes to one question and no to another.  The author also said experiencing someone else’s emotions as your own was linked to inner child wounding. He clearly isn’t aware of empaths.  I think whether this book works for you is perhaps dependent on where you are on your journey."
Yes the book is going to be very helpful.  Some marking inside as stated
Very helpful
Immensely helpful! This book can real help you heal profound wounds. I will always be grateful to John Bradshaw for his work.
For everyone to read
great for CPTSD survivors
Classic
What a great book! It already did help me as well as friends and family a lot.  Amazing what is stored in our souls...
A powerful work.
interesting
well used and noted inside. An older edition than pictured
Every thing was awesome thanks!
A very useful book for Inner Child work!
It seems very informative. However when I could absorb it it clearly didn't have impact for now I need in further need of it but canno absorb it let alone retain it. However the costs are so small on this site they are worth getting.
Very helpful
"John Bradshaw is an inspiration. Each one of his best selling books builds on the previous one, and he takes us in an apparently light and straightforward manner deeper and deeper into our recovery. recovery is hard work, and by sharing his stuff so honestly , he makes the journey that we all need to take , safe and real and leads us into the light. His books are great and i find i can go back to them and go deeper each time. claire hershman"
"not a bad book, interesting"
"This book was recommended to me. Sadly, I was unable to read it all!"
"I was extremely disappointed when received the book, it said in good condition but the cover was of the yellowish kind and the book was filled with yellow stained dots all over the outside of every page. It was readable and stain free on the inside but I wouldn't say this is good condition, I would feel embarrassed to sell a book stained like that, not even charity shops accept this. I loved the context of the book and the book was important to me so I'm extremely disappointed."
Very good book I highly recommend it to everybody ! If you do the exercises it will definitely make a difference.
"I'm really glad I got this book. It helped me go a lot deeper in my journeys. The core of it can be summarized as:Have good set and setting. Preferably have someone to check in on you every hour or two to make sure you're alright. Lay down with eye shades on and earphones in listening to music without lyrics. Focus inward, surrender to the experience. Do not try to distract yourself from negative emotions, just experience and accept them."
"Reading this book brought me up to date on what I've read from the '60s until now. I understood most of what he wrote. Interestingly, he writes about how he conducted experiments proving LSD (in the proper context) can make you smarter. Reading this book validated my own experience. I was failing math/physics/chemistry in college, then one dose of LSD turned everything around. I got perfect grades in classes I had previously failed. It was interesting to read about research that went on besides the regular Leary/Dass stuff (not that there's anything wrong with that)."
"I have absorbed a lot of information concerning psychedelic substances during the past few years. Some sources have taken a scientific approach, full of statistics, surveys, and other assorted data. Others have focused on the spiritual use of these substances, which include direction for practices like meditation, yoga, and breath work. There are also accounts of recreational use, which clearly illustrate the possibilities of both positive and negative outcomes of using and abusing these substances. These sources have included books, movies, podcasts, YouTube clips, and audio lectures. I also have my own experiences with several of these substances, and had already come to my personal opinion that they have the potential to awaken in me unexpected paths in my life, greater self-understanding, an ability to engage in self-healing, and a stronger connection with the Universe and the inhabitants of our planet that we call Earth. I have learned so much about psychedelics that I often come across a feeling of ""Oh, I've learned that already"" while reading a book or watching a documentary. However, James Fadiman's ""The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide: Safe, Therapeutic, and Sacred Journeys"" is the first work in quite a while that had so many new things to teach me. This book covers many aspects concerning psychedelic use that I was previously unaware of, such as the concept of sub-perceptual dosing and the importance of listening to non-vocal music such as Classical during the beginning of a psychedelic experience.I first heard of this book from Lorenzo Hagerty's ""Psychedelic Salon,"" a podcast that I have listened to for the past six years. Fadiman is the guest on episode 302, during which Lorenzo interviews him about the book and his experience in the psychedelic research field. After hearing Fadiman speak about these things, I put the book on my ""To-Read"" list and purchased it a few months later. My intention when reading this book was to learn how to become a guide for others undergoing psychedelic experiences. I was pleasantly surprised by the wealth of information contained in the book afforded to those of us who wish to better integrate our psychedelic journeys into ordinary reality as well as learn to be a better guide to others. Following my reading of this book, I have already identified some aspects of my own psychedelic traditions that I would like to change in an effort to focus more on the therapeutic and spiritual uses of these substances, rather than my previous goal of having a good time. While I still believe that the recreational use of these substances can have a positive outcome, I am now sold on the concept of using them in a more intelligent manner.This book does a great job of dispelling some of the myths about psychedelics, offers a practical and positive itinerary for a successful experience, introduces several important people in this field, and does so in a way that is unbiased and helpful. It is important for the psychedelic community to have truth on its side, and Fadiman does an excellent job of collecting both scientific and anecdotal evidence and arranging it in a way that is easily understood. I commend him on his work and look forward to more coming from him in the near future."
"in a way it's a shame this book didn't exist back in the sixties, when much of the experimentation was free-wheeled without any context other than the hippie culture. dr. fadiman makes it clear that real research was taking place on the benefits of psychedelics as applied to mental health and self-development. this guide provides proper context for the usage of these sacred medicines as well as instructions for proper set & setting. following dr. fadiman's recommendations will greatly increase your chances of a profoundly life changing event. he also discusses micro-dosing, which is becoming quite popular. don't leave 'home' without this guide."
"I finished a neuropsychology class last semester and gained an interest in drugs, both pharmaceutical and recreational. We somewhat touched on psychedelics, but I ended up reading the whole chapter. The topic is fascinating to me and I wanted to learn more about it. This book was perfect for learning about how psychedelics affect the brain's processing and responses and how they produce these amazing effects. It also guides you on the therapeutic methods they can make."
"Offers a responsible approach to the use of LSD, psilocybin and other entheogenic ""medicines."" I strongly believe that following the practical guidelines suggested for psychedelic Voyager and Guide would prevent most ""bad trips."" The book also reports on the author's involvement in conducting LSD research, back when such investigations were LEGAL. The book is best-known for its chapter on micro-dosing LSD and psilocybin---taking tiny doses every fourth day to enhance creativity, lucidity, and energy. A few years ago, Rolling Stone magazine's online article on the micro-dosing fad in Silicon Valley set off a tsunami of interest in the practice. Jim Fadiman is conducting research into micro-dosing via a detailed survey that can be found on his website. Alas, the information gathered by such means is, by definition, self-reported (anecdotal). It's impossible to collect much empirical data when the drug under investigation is illegal! Even so, I look forward to the release of more anecdotal data from the questionnaires."
"New to the concept of Psychotropics, this book is an excellent resource to delve deeper into yourself.  The book outlines a precise process to follow to ensure a good experience, guide others, heal wounds, and gain enlightenment.  A number of other books just felt too ""hippy"" to be taken seriously.  The many chapters include the history of research, uses, and even describes statistic findings from large samples of people.  Although these drugs are not legal, the book presents amazing results for helping those afflicted with substance abuse, anxiety, PTSD.  The book is nothing short of enlightening and is a good read if for the simple merits of expanding your understanding of different substances."
Excellent book for psychonaughts and/or psychonaughts in training or anyone curious about the healing potential of psychedelic use.  This is the real deal by someone who's been there from the beginning.  Lots of valuable info on SAFE and efficacious use of these wonderful substances.
"Fadiman does a brilliant job of introducing the world of psychedelic therapy and entheogenic experiences.  He discusses several aspects of the introspective and therapeutic world as well as the newly budding research in the field.  There are a few examples of direct research, but mostly descriptive numbers and research from the sixties, but this is not the fault of the author, it falls on the legal issues around the area.  This book also describes the bright future for the field."
"A collection of scientific studies, personal accounts and history of use, this is the book for you whether voyager or guide. Note, not promoting recreational use but showing the benefits for mental health and a host of other ailments that is only being hindered by the ridiculous war on drugs."
"A terrific introduction and overview for those interested in psychedelics generally for therapeutic, entheogenic, or creative use - either as a provider-faciltator or as a user. Fadiman is recognized as being among the leading authorities on psychedelics, and while this book focuses on harm reduction, it will undoubtedly be widely referenced by researchers and healers alike once prohibition comes to an end for this extraordinarily promising branch of pharmacology."
"Compendium of useful knowledge and relevant references regarding the use of psychedelic drugs as a most promising aid in the field of mental health - particularly in the resolution of ""treatment-resistent"" PTSD, depression, anxiety, and a number of other issues that have been difficult to treat."
This book was absolutely fantastic. I recommend to anyone planning to launch yourself into a psychedelic experience. It can be a truly life changing turning point in your life if done safely and knowledgeably.
"This is the book for anyone who is interested in the use of psychedelic substances for everything from therapy to spiritual quests. The author James Fadiman, MD has many years of experience with psychedelics, and backs it up with some solid research."
"A very complete, readable and useful guide. This is the book and author that all other researchers and writers reference, The original and ultimate authority.  If you are at all interested or curious, this the foundation."
I am SO excited!!!! Came in perfect condition and looks even better than I thought!!! Will be back to review after I read!!!
I discovered this book from listening to the Medicine Stories podcast. My life has changed because of it. This book is one to purchase and pass down through generations. The knowledge and care put into research is worth the keep and shelf space. A must own!
Good book. Lots of info. I breezed over some Info that was not interesting to me regarding some of the history but still a good resource.
Not able write a review on whether or not its a good book but came in perfect condition thank you.
"A very educational and fun to read book. Anyone who's interested in alternative ways of healing should read this book. I give it a 5 because it was easy to follow and provides facts, research and links to learn more about the subject. Thank you James Fadiman for  your pioneer work."
Just opened it. Read a few pages. Can tell it's gonna be great.
"Only thing I didn't like about this book was that I didn't read it earlier! I learned so much from this text... a little dry at some points, but fascinating research. Thanks James Fadiman!"
DETAILS and experiences by some of the most brilliant minds ever.
Extremely interesting book with lots of information. Helped me to understand and control my own mind.
What a great read this book was. Exhaustive resource on the subject of psychedelics. Highly recommend as a scholarly reference.
Highly useful information from one of the pioneers of psychedelic research and therapy
Interesting read
Great transaction! Smooth with very fast delivery!
"A serious scientific history of early experimentation with psychedelics at Harvard and Stanford...no weirdness, new agey stuff, just the facts."
Very informative book
Good read for those that like to travel
"This book contains lots of common sense stuff, but has much interesting material. I'm new to the Psychedelic world, so it's nice to have a guide. If you would like to make the most out of your psychedelic, check this book out. And remember, when concerning psychedelics It is better to be over informed ( if possible ) than under informed. Be wise; stay safe."
Interesante
Good read
Nothing useful or seincftic in this book
"Skimmed portions of it and enjoyed what I have seen. Winter time reading as far too much to do. I walk and practise shamanism and have used legal hallucigens in meditative workings. From a spiritual approach, this is definately of interest."
Amazing research on a subject that is not usually taken seriously.  Insightful research by a serious scientist.I appreciate his perspective and thoughts on what is usually dismissed by science.  Thanks for sharing your insight. I anticipate others will build on your work.
Very fun read with lots of good information. Make sure to educate yourself properly before you become a psychonaut for maximum benefits :)
I was amazed that Dr. Fadiman was able to salvage crucial research into the use of psychedelics. This work is helpful to those who support psychedelics or who oppose psychedelics because it addresses the myths (they say) pushing towards  academically sound knowledge about psychedelics.
"Well written and informative overview of the subject matter, presented with as much factually based data as one might hope to discover."
Definitely this is a must read for those making decisions to head to Peru for and adventure in mind expansion with Ayahuasca.
This is the classic bible of psychedelics!  Great book; honest and clear!
"Surprise! This is not your normal non-fiction book. It is defensive and angry which is what helped me read it to the end. ""Defensive"" is not bad. But the shut down of research and criminalization of what researchers determined to be healing therapies just might have a negative effect on proponents. ""Angry"" is not bad when something you believe will help humanity is forced from your medicine chest. The book does not encourage the reckless use of psychedelic drugs. In fact after reading about steps and procedures in preparation for use one is left wondering why go through all that? I have never tried psychedelics and I am not convinced I want to. But one of the most important effects of psychedelics (important to me) is the intense feeling of being connected. The book propelled me to wonder how I can feel more connected with people, the world and the universe (Yes, you can read ""God"" for ""universe""). Apparently our brains already have receptors for these drug, I wonder what other ways we can connect."
Interesting.  Informative.
James Fadiman confirms his expertise in the entheogenic subject basing his guides in both scientific and metaphysical knowledge
"Well written, easy and very interesting to read.  Well annotated somewhat factual, but some of the annotations and authors comments seem to come from opinion and hope rather than hard science."
"if you want a practical approach to psychedelics, this is your book. years of research and an unbiased presentation offers the reader great insight into the potentials of such a taboo subject."
I’m enjoying this very digestible read. It feels like everything I wish I knew when I first began my psychedelic journey.
A must read for anyone curious about psychedelics.
Cool
This book is a must have for anyone interested in the topic of psychedelic substances. It covers every corner of the subject and was written by people who have studied this their whole lives.
"Information is concise, easy to read, includes accounts that are unique and the author is a master of the subject, almost no one in the world has his depth of understanding as James Fadiman - highly recommended for those with any interest what so ever in Psychedelic substance use."
Great product. Fast Shipping.
"A book solely written for the practical use of psychedelics. It speaks of the importance of the psychedelic ""awakenings"" and how they impact people. It is both scientific and poetic. There is a large range of advice for both people taking the substance (the voyager) and people who are with the voyager (The guide). As of now in America and most countries these psychedelics (LSD, Mescaline, Psilocybin) remain illegal for any therapeutic or religious/philosophical use. People might get the entheogen's confused for something like alcohol or marijuana that are easily used for recreational purposes since they are illegal in the same fashion. The book was written to shine some light on the reality of the substances, and to help make it safer to use since they are still being used. In my personal opinion it is a start. My hopeful dream is that society will open its arms and embrace the beauty that lies within the entheogenic experience. Until then, this book should serve its purpose."
"With the publication of The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide, James Fadiman has inaugurated a new era of spiritual and practical exploration of inner space. Mind you, he didn't invent or even rediscover the spiritual use of entheogens, nor the psychotherapeutic exploration of psychoactive plants and chemicals, but this guidebook represents a bold re-emergence of an ancient healing practice.Fadiman, a co-founder of the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology and author most recently of an undergraduate psychology textbook and 

  
The Other Side of Haight: A Novel









  
  
    
  , is a champion of psychedelic guiding. He's been around since the giddy big bang of psychedelic culture, and now, gladly, and with hope, turns the keys to guided journeys over to the grandchildren of that distant revolution. There's plenty by and about him on the web, if you're curious.Fadiman gets right to the guided session instruction without disclaimers and apologies--a courteous gesture considering we've waited for more than a generation already. The guidebook is replete with suggestions for both guide and voyager regarding everything from music, food and lighting to finer aesthetic points. The six aspects of the well-conceived voyage are set and setting (which you knew), but also: substance, sitter, session, and situation. The six stages of a voyaging session are all simple and easily spelled out, as well, but this is rather like saying most of the paintings in the Louvre are made with canvas, brushes and paint: within Fadiman's simple protocol exists a universe of possibilities.Not all these possibilities are happy ones, naturally, so there is plenty of material on what can go wrong, and how to recover. Some chapters, contributed in part by other writers, speak to the experiences of pioneering elders and suggest how voyaging can address healing, creativity, problem solving and everyday life. Other chapters bring history, science and future directions for research and experimentation into context.No single volume could hope to address all the issues, and especially the practical concerns, of the myriad combinatorial nodes of the Six S's, so The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide wisely points out to the Web for other resources, and to a dedicated wiki, to which you, too, may contribute.As noted, this topic has been around for a while; the World Health Organization published Ataractic and Hallucinogenic Drugs in Psychiatry in 1958! The 60s saw several widely read personal narratives of voyaging, a handful of guidebooks, quite a bit of science, and a larger number of rants, both pro and con, religious and secular, erudite and fulminating. The intervening decades brought hundreds of books about hallucinogens, cannabis and other drugs in religious, cultural, medical and literary contexts, but relatively few had practical advice or spiritual use in mind, although you could read between the lines, and many did.The ""How I Tripped Good"" genre is alive and well--scarce copies of such books by folks who tripped to death fetch handsome prices--as is the perennially larger ""How I F*d Up Getting F*d Up"" school, which are quickly remaindered. But, The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide belongs to an altogether higher order of endeavor, puns happily winked at. Truly destined to be a classic. Don't leave everyday reality without it."
"You will get some good info in this book, but not the most easy read of course lol! but if you want to educate yourself on this subject, i would recommend it!"
Great quality
Very detailed & practical approach. It's an in-depth look so you should be ready for a long read but a fascinating one.
"Great book, very instructive (it's a bit spiritual and scientific so it's a good mix of both sides)."
Great practical guide.
So clear and packed with first person experience.
Fantastic book!  A must read.
So happy with this book!
A must for guidance.
Great book if you are looking to use psychedelics for therapy or insight into your mind instead of just for partying with.
Great overview of the psychedelic experience.
Clearly written and full of good information.
5 out of 5 stars.Dr. Fadiman has shared his knowledge and experiences gained during his time as a psychedelic researcher. Useful information for anyone considering the safe and informed use of psychedelics.
"This book explores the history and potential benefits of psychedelics in small controlled doses to enhance creativity and facilitate spiritual journeys. I have enjoyed learning about how the government shut down the successful experimentation, and can only hope that this drug can be re-established for legal use one day. I recommend it for anyone curious about psychedelics."
Amazing and well written resource
"Totally changed my mind about psychedelic use.  Had no idea what the potential benefits were.  Believed benefits might be touted so someone could have an excuse to use drugs.  Was I ever wrong.  Read this book and let Dr. Fadiman change your mind, too."
Incredibly useful resource for individuals looking to do their own explorations or people looking to sit for others. It helped me a lot to supervise sessions with some friends who had very different reactions than myself which posed challenges in the experience which I had never faced.
Highly informative
"I was very happy with this purchase. It is easily one of the most interesting and informative books I've read. Narratives, excerpts from voices in the field, professionals, and acclaimed influential figures were of heavy interest and relevance. This combined with accounts of experimentation yielding quantitative results, case studies, and interviews makes for an informative and titillating read. Facts about the history, effects, dosage, and studies of application were very helpful. I went in unsure and apprehensive due to my own experiences. I came out confident but more cautious about the way to handle these substances and the experiences they yield."
"Lots of great information about the experience, and about safety. Very inspirational"
"Gives a great understanding of what a psychedelic experience can bring you. These experiences if done with purpose and intent can be extreme religious, life changing experiences.  Fadiman gives good insight on how to journey as well what to expect and ultimately even what you might discover as the ""truths"" of the universe if you can keep an open mind and let it take you.  I recommend you read this if you want to have one of the religous experiences that are discussed or if you're just curious. Either way I highly recommend this book."
"Great treasure of a book with lots of case studies, links to other people's work, fascinatingand entertaining, thought provoking. Loved it."
I highly recommend this book if you or any of your friends are planning going in a psychedelic journey.
"Although it mostly talks about LSD, with a nod to other psychedelics, it gives a clear, experienced overview of the therapeutic frontiers these drugs are opening. Too bad those frontiers were closed off during the Nixon administration. Now, with FDA-approved trials being conducted, and funds being raised for my research, maybe we can get back to healing people's psyches with these substances."

INTERESTING READ
Belle introduction aux possibilités offertes par les substances psychédéliques pour tous les curieux en quête de nouvelles expérimentations. Regorge de témoignages inspirant.
A very good over view and introduction to the  exploration of  chemically induced altered states of being.
Interesting book.
Glad I got it.
One of the most informative books on the subject matter base on scientific research.and powerful tool to dissolve fear based myths
Awesome
A must for any psychnaut
great book
"very great book, full of interesting articles of various scientists and researches, full of great tips and advices, full of practical and concrete details. a must be for everybody who is seriously interested to build up a good and deeper knowledge about this content and its use."
Great book. Jim did the psychedelic community a real service by authoring this book.
Exellent !!!!!
"I honestly am only at page 70, but the information I have learned up until 70 is full of some of the most useful information on conducting a safe session. The rest of the book has much more and I will update my review soon, but for now up to page 70 is alot more than I expected."
"Excellent, well written book."
"Outstanding read, well put together and well researched"
Everyone who believes societies bulls*** conclusion on psychedelics should read this. FACTS BiTCH
"I've found this book following @gruber link and it is an interesting read. As somebody that newer used any stuff I have always been interested in things that are ""prohibited"" by those on power and the reasons behind their prohibition. The book is as scientific as it can be (understanding circumstances) and is a first hand experience. If you are some stuff addicted or you plan to be, this is not a book for you."
Extremely interesting and  insightful... Dr. Fadiman's research is a gift to humanity
The only book one needs
Great Book!
Great book!
"Great information, easy to digest."
"There are a few interesting things in this, but it's not much of a guide for a solo explorer; it's very focused on details of how ""guided sessions"" should be, according to the author. And it reads more like a boring psychology literature review or something than a useful personal guide. It's really stuffy and pretentiously scientific: It includes pages of statistical explanations and ""rigorous studies"" and yet the author hints that he believes in things like telepathy and new-age crap. Similarly, he devoted an entire chapter to himself, and I believe in this chapter he discusses in depth how psychedelics transformed him, rid him of his ego and neuroticism of course! (Doesn't this explain why he feels the need to tout his ""high IQ"" and devote a chapter about how much he lacks an ego?) This is surprisingly not your book if you're looking to get a better idea of what to expect on different doses and substances. It's not very practical at all. It reminds me of the kind of paper I'd write if I were forced to write a paper, only he can get away with entire chapters written by other people. Half of the book is details of experimental design, probably copied and pasted from an unpublished ""study"" that you really probably don't give a crap about."
"Gave this to noobs, need these motherfers to open their third eye"
Not much new here. Did highlight a section about how to stay in a good frame of mind. Everything else was pretty much the same stuff. I was disappointed.
"Very deceitful book. My colleagues and I were truly alarmed and concerned that this violated all medical ethics as well as the scientific method itself. It has drawn very large conclusions in opposition to a vast amount of peer reviewed medical literature. In it’s bias, what this book fails to mention is the vast amount of research showing the devastating long term mutation of the brain’s structure LSD causes among other synthetic psychedelics along with the statistical and behavioral research showing high rates of persisting psychosis and schizophrenia among previous LSD users and countless patients of mine. I am very excited for the new 7 Tesla MRI systems, my colleagues and I are anticipating further additions to the medical literature.What does the peer reviewed modern medical research show, time and time again? It shows the detrimental harm of LSD to the brain by artificially restructuring the brain synapse, inhibiting the synthesis of protein in the brain, changing gene expression in the brain, seriously affecting the serotonin response and causing long term HPPD even decades later after only one dose. It harms the immune system in the common recreational dose, by suppressing the the proliferation of B-lymphocytes; the production of the cytokines IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6; and the induction of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. It causes mutagenesis of the DNA, scrambles developing neurons in the fetal brain stem, birth defects, reproductive detriment and much more. My colleagues and I have known countless patients who were destroyed from the use of LSD and other synthetic psychedelics. The long term affects have devastated hundreds of our patients lives for life. This is even forty year later after they discontinued use. Permanent personality changes and the not being in control of their own thoughts are seen daily with our patients. We are not talking about a natural thing that has existed for billions of years like alcohol, marijuana or mushrooms. My colleagues and I are showing the long term neurological effects of all the natural psychotropics are virtually nonexistent. The use of natural psychotropics are sanctioned by a very long history of human use as well. If you really need to not be sober, just drink some wine or smoke some marijuana. But don’t throw your life away with these devastating synthetic psychedelics. You don’t need your brain to be artificially restructured and permanently altered through synthetic influences."
Well done.
"The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide [Guide] is a compendium of information regarding experimentation and use of psychoactive substances from the limited philosophical perspective of Monism (the ethos of counter-cultures in Europe and America during the 1960s), and drawing upon scientific materialism, Eastern religious mysticism, and contemporary New Age mindsets. Rather than transcendent enlightenment, Monism is a universal form of mental regression into the spiritual darkness of ancient paganisms.On page 40, the author writes ""The quality of these experiences depends considerably upon one's prior orientation and attitude to life, although the now voluminous descriptive literature of these experiences accords quite remarkably with my own."" This is called a ""self-referential confirmation."" Is Mr. Fadiman aware of how the ""voluminous descriptive literature"" may have shaped and limited his own experiences and descriptions of reality?Readers looking for additional information on alternatives to Monism, see The Other Worldview: Exposing Christianity's Greatest Threat or One or Two: Seeing a World of Difference, both by author Dr. Peter Jones.PS. This reviewer was a product of the '60s and navigated through the use of mind-altering substances, meditation, and various religious traditions in search of answers to the classic questions of philosophy and religion--epistemology and metaphysics."
"Dr Fadiman's tone comes off as preachy, but his advice is sound. He advocates people plan and set things up in such a way as to avoid potentially bad situations in the first place. I believe people journey for their own reasons and have never been one for that much planning. Once you've blasted off you'll need exist in the moment to weather the suns and storms until you return to earth. Journey for your own reasons, but never forget your judgement is compromised. Allow yourself time afterwards to integrate your experience with reality. Im not advocating anyone do anything. I am just saying I feel the book has been overrated by a bunch of armchair psychonauts. Whether you take Dr Fadiman's advice or not, be yourself and keep it together."
Totes dope af
"The Psychedelic Explorers Guide is most likely the best of its genre.  However, this book, as good a it is,  because of its basic orientation, is essentially flawed. The psychotheraputic protocol which he describe s was developed during the 50 's and 60 's. This was before the rise and spread worldwide of the ayahuasca religions of Brazilian origin. Also before the widespread knowledge and acceptance of shamanic ayahuasca healing methods. If this entheogenic assisted  psychotheraputic protocol were to be legalized soon , it would be accepted and become widely used in psychological therapy. But it isn't likely to be, so, besides being an ineffective and awkward way of treatment ,it's future is bleak; because, at least for a good while yet,it will continue to be banned. Experiments are being approved by the USA govt. They are currently showing success and the mainstream usage is probably inevitable. Nevertheless , this book is heads over heels better than it's closest rival , Psychedelic Healing "" by Goldsmith. I have them both; have read them closely, and in basic form and function, they' re almost identical . So why is the one so much better. Well, you could say its just a matter of opinion, of course. However, since I study this subject  closely , and have read many books about it. ( and, best of all, have fond memories of entheogenic trips in my younger days; that's why I love the genneral subject) Anyway, i'll say here that my opinion definitely carries more weight than average. So the basic fact is that I liked Fadiman a lot more than Goldsmith as people . Goldsmith just came across as less likeable than  Fadiman. Apart from being turned off by the one and  being accepting and approving of the other, I'll just give one specific example to illustrate: The chapter titled "" Can Sub Perceptual Doses of Psychedelics Improve Normal Functioning"" . Importantly, Albert Hoffman, the ""inventor"" of LSD, predicted just this effect. And it turns out to be true, anectdotally , of course, in the testimony of the very few people who regularly practice this protocol.But, way more importantly is the fact that umpteen millions of people around the world take Prozac and it's ilk , but LSD could do the same, only better by far. Or so we might surmise. Nevertheless, however much I endorse the enthusiasm and faith both these authors have in the efficacy of  psychedelics to ameliorate the psychological maladies of mankind, i take issue with their reliance upon Western psychotheraputic protocol. The time tested methods of psychedelic protocol have worked for millenia in traditional societies . There is absolutely no reason to think that a very recently fashioned system called psychoanalysis is superior to the "" old fashioned "" way of healing and curing. And ,since I know quite a lot, I am sure that their methods of using psychedelics are inferior to the time tested ones. For a fuller understanding of the subject, the best book ( besides actually engaging in an organized  ritualised entheogenic group session ) is Ayahuasca Ritual and Religion in Brazil by Labate and MacRae. This is a difficult book, mostly because its been translated from the original Portuguese by various people (its an anthology) . The English is often awkward, depending upon which article was translated by whom. In general though, if you really want to know about the various ways to go about using entheogens, this is the source to get it from.The Brazilian Government has endorsed all religious uses of entheogens and there are three main auahuasca using ones, plus very many small subgroups using ayahuasca and also other groups using different kinds of entheogenic sacraments. The governmentally enforced religious tolerance ( these groups can complain to Brazilian officials  about infringements upon their legal  ( ! ! ! !  ) freedoms  ) . In the USA it is now legal to be a practicing member of the UDV ayahuasca religion. But that's the only entheogenic religion that's withstood stood the scrutiny of the Supreme Court. No others have tried yet, except for The Native American Church; which passed through the Supreme Court ,but is limited to tribal members only. Later, there will be more, no doubt. So my final judgement on the whole matter of entheogenic assisted psychotherapy; is that it's a vast improvement over ordinary psychotherapy, but definitely not anywhere near as effective for psychological healing as entheogenically assisted religion, or entheogenically assisted shamanic healing. I could specify why, but I won't here, because I'm not going to write a comment that is any longer here."
Very in depth and insightful.
Fun Read!
"great delivery,great book!!!!"
Rather than a guide this book reads more like an infomercial for psychedelics.  It's full of glowing endorsements for the use of mind-altering substances but lacking in useful information or balance to the negative aspects of such use.  What information that is offered comes off vague and anecdotal.  Negatives are given as an aside.  Considering Dr. Fadiman's background and connections to historical figures of psychedelia I expected much more.
"""The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide...."" dispels some of the myths promulgated about psychedelics during the course of the last 50 years.  Unfortunately psychedelics were declared illegal in the late 1960's and most research was stopped at this time.  It should be noted that before all civilian research was stopped, LSD was the most widely studied psychiatric drug in the world.  There are studies that have shown that there are clearly many benefits including improved mental acuity, creativity and in the health areas showing benefits in treating alcoholism, cluster headaches, PTSD and other conditions. It should be noted that Francis Crick, a neuro scientist and molecular biologist, used small doses of LSD that helped him unravel the structure of DNA, the discovery that won him the Nobel Prize.  The author is one of the foremost pioneers of scientific research of psychedelics based on 40 years of experience dispelling misinformation over many decades.  I would highly recommend this book."
"I found this book to be extremely boring. I read about 2/3 of it before I just couldn't read anymore.  I guess, having read Michael Pollan's ""How To Change Your Mind"" first may have set the tone and doomed this book to the trash heap. I'd recommend skipping this one and reading Pollan's books. They are comprehensive and engaging. Sorry I can't give you more details on this material, it was so boring I found none of it memorable."
"Lots of good content, but the sexual habits of people with other than other persons is hardly relevant content for a psychedelic explorer's guide. This is only one example of inappropriate content in this book. Fadiman is exceptionally arrogant, even pompous, in his YouTube presentations. The attitude also show in this book."
"This book is more like an academic rehash of his Research and a rehash of old information about LSD research. The book offers nothing about the Sacramental use of Sacred Mushrooms or Ayahuasca or Entheogenic Plants in Ceremonies. SACRED MUSHROOM RITUALS -THE SEARCH FOR THE BLOOD OF QUETZALCOATL a 308 page large 81/2” X 11” color book & kindle is unbelievably better with first hand accounts of Sacred Mushroom Veladas with Curenderos and the famous Sabia Maria Sabina in 1973 and meeting with R Gordon Wasson , Albert Hofmann and Richard Schultes."
"I first learned about this book when I was asked to read a pre-release version and help with some minor editing and formatting that the publisher asked for. It was not, frankly, a book I would have normally read otherwise.After the first reading, I remember putting the manuscript down and thinking, ""This is an important book, and it has to be out there.""The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide shows the surprising ways people are using psychedelics in healing, psychotherapy, and spiritual quests. One chapter describes the emerging trend of micro-dose usage: where people use tiny doses of psychedelics to improve their functioning at home, work and play.I also remember how impressed I was to read about the early research using LSD to treat alcoholics who had failed all other treatments. The  results were highly effective, even in these formerly hopeless cases.Jim Fadiman is a gentle, intelligent and engaging storyteller, and this book reflects his personality.  I recommend it to you highly."
"As so many of us discovered in the 60s, our culture was (and still is) desperate for spiritual meaning beyond materialism and consumerism, beyond stale religion of the ""Believe it because I say so and you'll go to Hell if you don't!"" type.  Jim Fadiman was both a laboratory investigator who saw beyond the limits of the laboratory and a real person in the real world of psychedelic exploration who could function in the world of common sense as well as the visionary world.  There aren't a lot of really knowledgeable folks like that around anymore, and his sharing of what's known and unknown, do's and don'ts, is essential knowledge if you're thinking about exploring that visionary world.  We are lucky to have this book."
"I've been waiting years for someone with the proper qualifications to come along and write this book. Hands down, this is the very best guide book that exists on how to prepare for a safe and therapeutic psychedelic journey, with positive psychological transformation as one's goal. It is the most important book written on the subject since The Psychedelic Experience--Timothy Leary, Richard Alpert, and Ralph Metzner's classic adaptation of the The Tibetan Book of the Dead, which was published in 1964. Before psychologist James Fadiman's book, this was a subject that desperately needed attention by someone who really understands what psychedelic drugs can do to the human mind. Drawing from his own personal experience as a psychedelic researcher, Fadiman presents the fascinating results from his clinical studies into how psychedelics can enhance creativity and improve problem-solving abilities, in the context of a clearly-explained guide book. The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide can be used as a training manual and reference by professionals in the blossoming field of psychedelic psychotherapy, as well as by outlaw shamans who defy government regulations to engage in illegal forms of self-exploration. Anyone interested in the subject for educational purposes will find this book hard to put down. This comprehensive volume is simply bursting at the seams with rare, valuable, and well-organized information about how to get the most from a psychedelic journey. Invaluable at dispelling the many myths and misconceptions that are associated with this controversial subject, this extraordinary volume provides essential guidelines on how to run a psychedelic session, and presents little-known techniques for using sub-perceptual doses to improve mental functioning, along with new information from surveys, clinical studies, group sessions, and personal anecdotes. Very highly recommended; absolutely essential reading for anyone interested in the subject."
"A brilliant and thoughtful book by one of the leading proponents of safe and responsible use of psychedelics, primarily LSD.Although he acknowledges the spiritual power of entheogenic substances the main focus of the book is how to use these substances to enhance creativity. Based on his own research - together with Willis Harman - in the 60s. As well as eye witness accounts from recent times. Also touching on the (controversial) subject of regular use of low dose LSD in every day (work) life.The book has many scopes. accounts of the mind and career changing events for the early pioneers like Albert Hofmann, Aldous Huxley, Timothy Leary, Huston Smith and Stan Grof.

  Although Fadiman clearly defines himself as a law abiding citizen this book DO contain some well thought out and reasonable criteria for a succesful session. Especially focusing on the need of an experienced guide (who does NOT- unlike in the Leary experiments - take the substance her self). Personally I think there can be arguments for self experimentation with out outside helpers - as described in

Psychedelic Healing: The Promise of Entheogens for Psychotherapy and Spiritual Development









  
  
    
   this book is clearly written by an experienced psychonaut with a broad and spiritual vision. Personally I think of these substances as sacraments and that using them for any mundane purpose is like the executives meditating before a business meeeting - if they really knew what they were doing, if they really went into it they may (to quote Jerry Garcia) rather feel like going outside chasing butterflies than attending the planned meeting. But no doubt Fadiman's case stories are weighty arguments for the (obvious)fact of the creativity enhancing potential of LSD.Essential read for everyone into qualified discussion of the benefits of these substances for the growth of humanity in all aspects of Life."
"While there is a lot of good information in this book, there are endless lists of references, webpage urls, etc that make it really hard to listen to. With a TOC that only lists chapter numbers, there is no good way to skip past sections that are us little interest."
"I bought this book both in hard cover for my husband and on Kindle for a friend as a result of listening to a Fadaman interview on the radio.  Fadaman is articulate, intelligent, and not at all the wacked out acid head idiot that I had believed all users of LSD are from the propaganda.  I knew he was a reliable source of information because of his affiliation with the Institute of Noetic Science.  My husband and I were both blown away by the amount of serious research that had been so promising before the government made LSD a Schedule I substance.  I highly recommend that everyone read this book so they can hold informed opinions about this very strange and much maligned substance.  And, no, I have never used any of these exotic drugs.  I only want to know the truth about them and I believe I heard the truth from Fadaman."
"Very helpful book that outlines all you need to know to use the very useful compounds known as psychedelics.  This book will guide you through proper set, setting, dosage, compound, and other choices to make sure you can get the most out of these medicines.  The book focuses on the classic psychedelics, primarily LSD and Psilocybin, though Mescaline is mentioned.  Highly recommended and I still reference it even though I'm an experienced psychonaut because the book is that good."
"I’m not sure if you’ve noticed, but boundaries are evaporating. What’s in their place? New consciousness.Let me give you an example. We used to draw a boundary between sentient and non-sentient beings. Us and the animals, and the insects, etc. were the sentient ones. Plants and rocks were the non-sentient ones. Then Cleve Backster, with his little wires, amazed us (at least those of us who don’t grow plants) by showing that a plant reacts to our energy, our negative or positive thoughts. I’m sure many plant lovers already knew this, as they spend a lot of time talking and cooing to their little ones. OK, so plants can feel. Well, modern botanists have been discovering the many ways in which they detect changes in their environment and respond accordingly. I’m not just talking about detecting the sunshine and turning toward it. I’m also referring to detecting the approach of insects and other beings who’d like to chomp down on the plant, and the defensive “spray,” and other remedies the plant can summon to protect itself.Not only can plants respond and react, but some of them can also TEACH! How can that be? That’s a great mystery to understand, but countless folks have experienced their teachings! Socrates was banned, too, and so have been these teachers the last few decades, but maybe that will change. I’m saying all this to bring to your attention a book that, were it to come out today, might be titled, “A Student’s Guide to Plant Teachers.” Instead, it’s actual title is The Psychedelic Explorer’s Guide: Safe, Therapeutic, and Sacred Journeys, edited by James Fadiman, Ph.D. “Psychedelic” is yesterday’s name, with its connotation of drugs, mischief, and psychological mayhem. Today’s title is “Plant teacher.” The former has a materialistic bent, the latter a metaphysical or spiritual one. Entheogen is the title philosophers enjoy, and they often refer to Aldous Huxley’s Doors of Perception.This book has many human teachers serving as authors to bring the reader up to date on what’s happening. By now, there has accrued a wisdom about how to best learn from plant teachers. Consider the  Ss: Set, Setting, Substance, Sitter, Session, Situation. These are the factors that are proven parameters for having a good educational experience. New research is beginning to evolve alternative methods, increasing security and confidence, and moving us toward a more enlightened posture. Besides chapters on guidance, there are also reprints of research studies, giving the manual more “gravitas.”Just for your information, should the opportunity arise. Just don’t forget about Socrates!"
"In case you have not seen a copy, James Fadiman's latest book THE PSYCHEDELIC EXPLORERS GUIDE: SAFE, THERAPEUTIC AND SACRED JOURNEYSis one that should be on every shelf of people interested in both journeying to such realms as well as anyone seeking a sound reference point in this field. James is a serious scholar as well as a multi leveled adept who walks his talk in many ways. As an early 1960's pioneer in the first decade of serious psychedelic inquiry, he took part in both the role of the scientist seeking data and explanations as well as grounded person taking part in the many expressions of higher consciousness. At ease both in the laboratory as well as at a Grateful Dead concert, James has used a compassionate, focused and sensitive heart, mind and soul in reflecting on the psychedelic experience. His guidelines are a must for anyone wishing to be able to help others navigate these spaces comfortably as well as reading excellent articles from the perspectives of many other students, navigators and other psychonaut experts.  His exposes  fallacies in government and media misinformation as well as pointing out dimensions of present interest and future possibilities in medicine, psychology, spirituality and personal development.  There is hardly a page in this book that I have not highlighted with my yellow marker and whole heartily recommend your checking this gem of a book out as well."

Found this book very informative and interesting regarding psychopharmaceuticals and the future of psychopharmacology.
ok
"Read the reviews and the sample, and decided to purchase. I did not get far into the book. I Returned it once I realized that it read almost like a collection of essays. In general I do not enjoy this type of book because it does not feel like the author (or anyone in particular) has a voice."
"Excellent Book! Highly recommend this for anyone interested in exploring these fascinating substances in a safe, responsible manner."
Great sounding voice and great information
Book was pretty trashed.
a big waste of time
"I will only say one thing about this.No matter what anyone says, the ""root"" of all psychedelic drug experiences are spiritual.I don't care how modern society has ""cleaned"" up the experience by putting it in some clinical context, you are dealing with the spiritual world with every one of these compounds.I was involved in shaminism for almost 35 years and if you really want to ""know"" what is going on, go the root of where these drugs come from, what they are really used for and who ""used"" them.For example, with a little searching you can read about María Sabina - Saint Mother of the Sacred Mushrooms. This is a tragic story, but there is so much truth in it if you are willing to receive it.The truth that I am talking about is that Maria used these drugs to connect with the spirit world. Now... whether you believe that or not is irrelevant.The western mind has been so poisoned by its debased culture that very few people have any idea of ANY type of spirituality, let alone any experience with the spiritual world. And without a cultural context it just becomes emptiness and meaningless - just simply being high.When you trip and see demons or entities or distortions of your ""normal"" reality or you ""feel"" as if you are dying, that is what is really happening - science tries to clean this up by blah, blah'ing about chemical reactions, etc.But that doesn't matter either. This is the part of our modern society that seeks to destroy spirituality. People in our current age think it is spiritual to use a cloth shopping bag rather than plastic. Or to not eat meat and become a vegan. That is utter rubbish and is so foolish.But... I know that most of you are simply looking to get high or are on some type of cliche spiritual journey. So whatever....But I was delivered from the world of shamanism and psychedelic drugs by Jesus and the power of his death on the cross. It took almost 3 years of pain and struggle and prayer to get set free. Hopefully if even one person reading this is interested in the truth and can receive what I have tried to put here then awesome.BTW - I really don't care if you rip about the whole Jesus thing. I don't go to church, I am not religious, I am too old and have heard all the rants against Christ to enter into some endless debate. I have dropped the truth, I dust me feet off, and you are left with the choice to deal with it honestly."
"This book seems like it was written for someone who wants to lay claim to understanding psychedelic substances without actually taking them, which is of course completely impossible.  The author gives little evidence that he has personal experience other than some vague references to meeting Ken Kesey back in the 60's.  He was definitely not on the bus.  Any book about acid that fails to even mention Owsley or the Grateful Dead shows the knowledge and sophistication of the author is lacking. He might have academic credentials and this might be ok as an introductory book on the subject, but if you're an experienced user who is on the bus there are much better books written by people with more insight and understanding.  I bought his book based on the high reviews, but if really read the five star reviews you'll see none of the reviewers are on the bus."
"Stupid. Didn't like it at all. It makes an attempt to steer you where you do not need to go. Just be yourself and hold to what you know. Deleted this one, was a waste if money."
Why can I not read this book after paying?!
Great book!
The are simpler books with a less doctorish  thesis kinda reading. This one in my opinion is too academic. Sometimes I felt in the middle of a PPT presentation.
"If you're interested in the research surrounding these substances, you may find this book valuable. If you're looking for a practical guide to self-development, actualisation, and growth using psychedelics, you may be disappointed, as the actual ""guide"" part of the book is very small.Having the word ""sacred"" in the title betrays the fact that the book may at times venture into the supernatural or religious (Fadiman was director at the institute of Noetic Sciences) but the book seems to stay relatively scientific throughout.I ended up skipping a few parts because of boredom, a lot of the content here simply articulates in different ways how amazing psychedelics are. Nevertheless, I did gain some value from other parts of the book. It's worth noting this edition also contained a few typos.Still worth reading for any aspiring psychonaut, and I am greatful for Fadiman's contribution to the cause!"
"The author is one of a number of scientists who researched the potential use of psychedelics as a treatment in different psycho-therapeutic areas. Even though promising results were reported and published, the ""FDA iron curtain"" came down and this research ground to a halt. This book is a useful history on this early work, but an even more important reference guide, particularly now that the ""iron curtain"" seems to lifting even so slightly in the UK and the US."
Since reading this book I have become convinced  the powers that be need to open their eyes to what craziness banning these MEDICINAL substances is inflicting upon society. A must read for those who seek guidance where it is woefully unavailable.
If you are interested in experimenting with psychedelics this is first class advice.
Advice on staying safe and getting maximum benefit from a man who has been there and experienced it for himself.
Good book-
"Am loving reading this book, it's an eye opener."
Extensive knowledge on psychedelics
Great price
interesting read
So well written and instructive.
"It's like reading how to be a good pastor.  Full of opinion but very little data, even little case reports.  I have treated over 40 people and this book gets many things wrong.  The religious overlay of God is plastered on too thick for my stomach and not relevant and if anything blown out of proportion to the topics and there is not even enough science or data to smear and spread a thing veil disguise the books many short comings.So bad you could read trip reports off Reddit or shroomery and get a better more informed idea of consuming or guiding somebody though the process.The book boarders on negligence. Its kinda what you would expect from a tabloid magazine or tripping for Dummys book (actually it's worse)."
"A brilliant and thoughtful book by one of the leading proponents of safe and responsible use of psychedelics, primarily LSD.Although he acknowledges the spiritual power of entheogenic substances the main focus of the book is how to use these substances to enhance creativity. Based on his own research - together with Willis Harman - in the 60s. As well as eye witness accounts from recent times. Also touching on the (controversial) subject of regular use of low dose LSD in every day (work) life.The book has many scopes. accounts of the mind and career changing events for the early pioneers like Albert Hofmann, Aldous Huxley, Timothy Leary, Huston Smith and Stan Grof. Interviews with James Fadiman himself taken from

  .Although Fadiman clearly defines himself as a law abiding citizen this book DO contain some well thought out and reasonable criteria for a succesful session. Especially focusing on the need of an experienced guide (who does NOT- unlike in the Leary experiments - take the substance her self). Personally I think there can be arguments for self experimentation with out outside helpers - as described in

   this book is clearly written by an experienced psychonaut with a broad and spiritual vision. Personally I think of these substances as sacraments and that using them for any mundane purpose is like the executives meditating before a business meeeting - if they really knew what they were doing, if they really went into it they may (to quote Jerry Garcia) rather feel like going outside chasing butterflies than attending the planned meeting. But no doubt Fadiman's case stories are weighty arguments for the (obvious)fact of the creativity enhancing potential of LSD.Essential read for everyone into qualified discussion of the benefits of these substances for the growth of humanity in all aspects of Life."
"Muy buen libro, escrito con conocimiento y rigor por James Fadiman, Ph D. quien estudio en Harvard y se graduó en Stanford (se aprecia en su escritura bien organizada y sobre todo en la corrección con que están presentados el índice bibliografico y de notas, una delicia). Se adentra en el uso no recreacional del LSD tanto en su dosis normal (150-200 mcg) como en microdosis (5-10 mg). Así mismo recorre la interesantísima historia hoy día olvidada del LSD, la demonización injustificada a la que se ha visto injusta e intencionadamente sometido por parte de las instancias de poder, los falsos clichés y bulos referentes al mismo todavía arraigados en la sociedad, su adecuado uso y los peligros psicológicos reales (físicamente es inocuo) de un uso irresponsable del mismo, siendo determinantes el ""set and setting""; de especial valor encuentro su uso terapéutico, de mucho más alcance y efectividad que la psiquiatría convencional, su uso para el tratamiento de adicciones así como en las personas en procesos terminales. En mi opinión es probable que tenga un potencial único en la preparación al parto, sin embargo su injustificada demonización, tremendamente arraigada en la sociedad, lo hacen inviable. Un referente en esta temática, sin duda. Lo recomiendo."
This is a great collection of articles on the subject of psychedelics. Some are historical. Some reference studies. Some are opinion pieces from others in the field.All in all an easy read. I'm glad I purchased :-)
"The book was published in 2011 and many web links referred to are not active anymore. However, I believe the content is still representing nowadays reality: hope for institutional openness that are yet to materialize."
"Interesantes anecdotas sobre el movimiento psicodélico, te ayuda a guiar y ser guiado en viajes psicodélicos muy buena lectura si te gusta el tema"
I like how he navigates around topics of interest on psychedelics. This book is a great read for those with experience and those without but looking to try it.
"Escrito por uno de los pocos expertos reales en psicodélicos, el Dr. James Fadiman, activo en este campo desde la década de 1960."
"El libro es un poco pesado. Entra demasiado en el detalle de cada experimento que fue haciendo Fadiman y se puede hacer aburrido, incluso para mi, que me apasiona la materia."
"A little too much information for an amateur like me, but all the same, loads of very interestig information on the subject, and definitely a keeper on several levels."
"Great book, priceless science based information and knowledge."
Ein wirklich sehr informatives Buch!
Super buch mit vielen praktischen tipps. Zum ende hin wird es jedoch sehr speziell und dreht sich häuptsachlich um fadimans studien über microdosing.
Excelent book for those who wanna explore their minds through psychedelics and an excellent tool for those who seek to guide others through this beautiful universe of thought
Bin begeistert.
"Recibido antes de lo previsto. Excelente estado, excelente guía enteogénica. Recomendado para todos!"
Good deal
"Amazing.If you are interested in the psychedelic subject - especially LSD-25, this is the way to go.10/10 would recommend"
Excellent book. A must have for everyone interested in psychedelics and self exploration.
Very good advice.
Excelente contenido para expertos e inexpertos en el tema de la autoexploracion/sanacion con sustancias psicoactivas
Very informative and backed up by many studies and testimonials
Says everything you’ve already read online
"Para informarse sobre el tema,"
Wow what an amazing book. I should have purchased much sooner!!
Great book
Item was in perfect condition and exactly as advertised.
Perfect condition..prompt delivery. Very excited to read
Very good reference material.
"not a deep book, more like an instruction"
Good read. A lot of info I already knew. But also a lot of new info.
Ce livre est le plus complet sur les psychédiliques.Il permet de savoir où en est la recherche actuelle sur ces substances et tout ses potentiels bénéfices.
Great book.
This is exactly what I needed.
Great guidebook!
"Love psychedelics, but honestly not a very good book. Collects information that you could more easily find online. Advice is flaky at best and outright nonsensical at worse. It is a lot of anecdotes and not a lot of good instruction, honestly. Was hoping for a lot more. Could have been 100 pages or less of a really good book and instead it is a rambling poorly organized collection of blog posts and snippets of stories already published elsewhere.If you know nothing about psychedelics or their history this would be a great introduction, but for anyone with a passing awareness in this areas you would do much better to read around on erowid and watch youtube videos. The book literally tells you to go to youtube and search for things anyway, so you might as well do that yourself."
Excellent
"Jeder, der sich selbst mit psychedelischen Wirkstoffen und Halluzinogenen beschäftigt, sollte dieses Buch unbedingt lesen.Autor Fadiman geht hier auf die verschiedenen Wirkstoffe ein, beschreibt eine sinnvolle Schadensbegrenzung und listet Methoden auf falls doch mal etwas schief gehen sollte.Auch für Tripsitter ist dieses Buch bestens geeignet, es ist sehr empfehlenswert mal in die verschiedenen Kapitel rein zu lesen, da dem Tripsitter eine hohe Verantwortung zukommt.Generell beschreibt Fadiman die Wichtigkeit des Sets und Settings - die zwei kritischsten Säulen des Nutzung von Halluzinogenen.Neben LSD, Psilocin und DMT wird auch Ayahuasca erwähnt.Generell ein tolles Buch für jeden Forscher, Anwender und Sitter."
"Jimmy Fadiman's one and only concern is our well being. Understanding that there are limits to conventional medicine, with some doing more harm than good, Dr Fadiman opens the vaults to a once taboo topic and contemplates the benefits of psychedelics in the field if psychotherapy and beyond....An amazing book by an even more amazing person ...."
Brilliant book.
Great Book and it came really fast!
"Loved this book, keep referring back to it, just a wealth of knowledge"
Excellent book -well worth reading
With out a doubt one of the best books in my library.THIS SOURCE BOOK HAS IT ALL.BUY IT IT'S WONDERFUL. Especially if your researching or new to the psychedelic universe.5 STARS *****THANK YOU.
fantastic
"Sehr interessant Buch!Wenn man Ahnung hat,und interessiert Sie sich noch so sachen,wie Psychedelika,das ist Genau Buch für Dich.Schnell gekommen ist,2 Tage ,wartenzeit"
"The book starts out by stating the information is only about serious therapeutic and spiritual experiences - not for tripping for the fun of it. It stays quite scientific and covers many subjects related to psychedelics. Many co-writers offer their opinions through out the book making it diverse. If you want to know how the psycedelics might be used for specific and targeted experiences in both therapy, self exploration and problem solving, this book is very informing."
"The author, a distinguished psychiatrist, was one of the founders of IANDS and has been at the forefront of serious NDE research for nearly 50 years. The book is worth reading for this reason alone.I've been following the NDE phenomenon since Moody's groundbreaking LIFE AFTER LIFE was published in 1976 and have read all the important works in the field. I'm not an NDE experiencer, although I have experienced several substantive After Death Communications and have extensively studied all aspects of psychical and afterlife research for more than 50 years.I was frankly hoping for more from this book. The NDE accounts are nothing you haven't read before, hundreds or thousands of times. The speculation as to what NDEs are and what they mean is likewise nothing groundbreaking. In all honesty, this is very similar to the books Kenneth Ring was writing in the 1980s.Greyson bends over backwards - and beyond - to maintain at least a façade of objectivity between the extremes of insisting NDEs are full-blown experiences of the afterlife and insisting they're products of natural processes. It's clear he believes, as do I, that they are to some degree experiences of a higher level of reality and cannot be explained away in mundane terms. The basic takeaway is that consciousness is not a mere byproduct of the brain and may well survive physical death.Like most NDE researchers, Greyson focuses on the commonalities and transformative effects of NDEs. The content of NDEs is too all-over-the-map to take any of it literally. I've lost almost all interest in elaborate, content-laden NDEs such as are reported by the legions of NDE superstars. The basic phenomenon as originally outlined by Moody - apparent separation of consciousness from the body, the encounters with deceased relatives and friends, the overwhelming sense of peace and love, etc. - is what's important.Greyson has far, far, far greater experience with NDE experiencers than I do, but I must say that my own experience has left me somewhat skeptical of the reported transformative effects. Some 40 years ago, Kenneth Ring was promoting this angle, and I eventually cancelled my IANDS membership when it became clear to me that the organization was turning the NDE phenomenon into a New Age religion with its own NDE-based theology. The IANDS folks were almost as hostile to anyone who disagreed with them - including fellow experiencers who continued to be mainstream Christians - as a snake-handling fundamentalist cult.Although Greyson acknowledges that a minority of NDEs are frightening or negative, and that in some ways NDEs can negatively impact an experiencer's life, overall the book puts a happy face on the phenomenon. Very much in the Kenneth Ring mold.You will not be disappointed if you approach this book as a biography of Greyson and a late-in-life summation of his work and perspective on the NDE phenomenon. It isn't by any means technical or groundbreaking. It touches all the bases, but not in a deep or challenging way.It's fairly short (I read it in a couple of evenings), nicely organized and the chapters are short and readable. That being said, I was a bit disappointed in the lack of depth. For example, one of the later chapters is called ""What about God?"" I was expecting some meaningful discussion about the extent to which NDEs do seem to point toward a personal divinity of some sort, but the bottom-line was pretty much the standard NDE-religion theology that all paths are equally viable and inevitably lead toward Whatever There Is. (Greyson has no religious background and seemingly no insight into the possible significance of NDEs in the context of any of the world's religions.)"
"I first discovered NDE'S between Christmas 1976 and New Year's 1977. My husband had an explosion of an aneurysm in the major artery of his brain Christmas evening. All day he had been saying odd things about death to me - odd, like the hair on the back of my head stood up. As I sat outside intensive care, I picked up a Reader's Digest someone had left there. Raymond Moody's article introduced me to the concept. I bought his book and poured over it.  On New Year's early morning I was awakened by him, along with his ""deceased"" parents standing before me. They blew me kisses, turned and faded as they walked away. I knew he was gone from here. At one o'clock in the afternoon on New Year's Day, they turned off all the machinery that kept his body ""alive.""  He made himself known during the next year with things like candles flying across a room, sliding glass doors opening and closing by themselves, lights turning on, etc. It was all aimed at getting my attention that our son was about to get into trouble. I know it sounds strange, but it did happen. I am a highly educated women and not prone to superstitions or falsehoods. I do know for many reasons that life continues, and  also did not begin with birth here. It is exciting and comforting."
"This is an interesting, readable book, but it does not live up to the hype it has been given.  I’m not sure that any book on so complex and potentially consequential a subject as this could.  It concerns near death experiences, which Dr. Greyson has been studying for over four decades.  The subjects involved are what my college classmates would have termed cosmic: the existence of God, the existence of an afterlife, the aspects of that afterlife which might be described and enumerated, the existence of a heaven and a hell, the meaning of life/death/experience, and so on.The scientific method is interviewing/categorizing/calculating experiential overlap/summation.  What did people experience in their NDE’s?  How many people near death have NDE’s?  Of what do they consist?  What are the most common experiences?  What conclusions can we draw from all this?Needless to say, this is all of the greatest possible importance, but the evidence is perforce anecdotal, not anecdotal in the ‘that’s not science or real data’ sense (which he addresses at some length) but the kind of science represented by ethnology—the interviewing of individuals, the development of case studies, and so on.  The investigator is limited by the number of ‘experiencers’, the nature and quality of their experiences and the degree to which concrete conclusions can be drawn from those experiences.  This is not topology, particle physics or genetics though it may be more important than all of them.Given the fact that the data are thus limited and that the book’s audience is a general one, the science is interesting and instructive but not as weighty and persuasive as we might like (particularly when readers are all personally invested in certain conclusions that might be drawn).I found the first half of the book a bit of a slog.  It is largely autobiographical (how I got into this, what it meant to my career, why I wouldn’t have gotten tenure doing it at the U. of Michigan, and so on).  About halfway through, the book comes alive with the discussion of consciousness.  Consciousness is the most complex and perhaps most weighty of the subjects facing contemporary neuroscience and the notion that NDE research suggests (proves?) that the mind and brain are separate entities, that the mind lives on when the brain ceases to function and that not only does the brain not ‘create’ the mind; rather, it takes its directions from the mind . . . this is all very heavy, fascinating stuff.  He returns to this in the book’s interesting (8-page) conclusion.  The problem is that the weight of the conclusions is perforce disproportionate to the weight of the evidence.The bottom line is that for this reader (familiar with much of the popular neuroscience literature and the product of Catholic education, from grammar school through college) the book carries less weight than I would have liked, even though I am disposed to agree heartily with its conclusions.  It may be that skeptical but passionate believers, like Samuel Johnson, e.g., always want more evidence, more rigor, something approaching a proof that compels belief, even though such a so-called apodictic proof may not be possible.  I recommend the book, particularly for those who are new to the subject, but I warn those already familiar with it that they will come away wanting more."
"""After"" may be valuable to many people, but Greyson's exclusion of any and all material on reincarnation memories, or insight, during NDE experiences shows the book doesn't live up to its promise to explore ""what comes next."" Lots of God and heaven, but zero rebirth. I'm returning this book. The two stars are for appreciation that ""After"" will benefit others who believe exclusively in a one-life, one-heaven, hereafter."
"The Doctor has certainly done outstanding research in an area where research is difficult to do. As a Catholic,priest, I have worked with people who have had NDE’s. What Doctor describes of these experiences is certainly accurate.I will be buying numerous copies to share with people I see for grief counseling. This is a book of hope. Thank you so much, Doctor. Father Jim Sobus"
"I love this book. I admire the way Dr. Greyson reports NDE cases both as a meticulous scientist and a humanitarian. His career at UVA, his research is legendary, the NDE scale being named for his work in the 1980’s. But also he reports these cases from the perspective of the people who’ve had a life changing event. His research, the over 100 peer reviewed studies on the topic are the gold standard for NDE data. In this book each person is given both respect for their experience and for the new information their experience revealed. Dr. Greyson includes private doubts and amazement at what he was witnessing first hand. Highly recommended. For a wonderful lecture and to hear his voice, see his ""Is consciousness produced by the brain?"" on YouTube to hear the medical evidence that consciousness is not only confined the brain. This book is a masterwork of research, one that will be cited for generations to come. Bravo. Five stars. A must have book for any serious research into near death experiences."
"""After"" is certainly well written and reinforces the growing body of near-death experience literature. My favorite overall book on the subject is ""God and the Afterlife"" by Jeffrey Long and the best website I have seen on the issue is nderf.org (Near Death Experience Research Foundation), which provides thousands of nde testimonials"
"I was expecting science and journalist-quality work - backgrounds of experiencers, details behind the experiences, how and how extensively they were verified, when they took place and so on - but there’s almost none of that. Mostly it’s a string of unverifiable and largely undocumented anecdotes. And no, in situations like this, the plural of anecdote is decidedly not “data,” even if the stories are plotted on an arbitrary NDE Scale."
"I met Dr. Greyson at a conference about 1.5 years ago when this book had not yet been published. At the time, I was familiar w/ Ian Stevenson’s and Jim Tucker’s work on reincarnation—which I discovered by accident—but didn’t know much about NDEs. I had barely heard about them. I had not read Dr. Greyson’s work prior and looked forward to reading this book. It doesn’t disappoint, from its coherent and logical layout to the conclusions he draws. He does not write as a “true believer”, but as one who, having studied the evidence, is almost reluctantly drawn into his observations that there might be more to life than what we now know. One possibility, for instance, is that we may be connected to something larger than ourselves. As such, this is the best kind of “science writing.”When I discovered the initial JAMA article on Stevenson’s work years ago, I personally wasn’t in a good place, w/ two seriously ill children and a flagging career. In further exploring the topic, some hope did arise that there might be more than misery ahead for us. This book affirmed those thoughts—life might be more than a chancy jungle where the lucky and smart survive while the others (us) don’t. So, the book has achieved at least that one goal  of its author, (for me) as well as the other goals he mentions.Some critics have dismissed this book as a review of known research (known to who? I might ask). I’m less familiar w/ NDE research, so perhaps the critics are correct. Big deal. It’s the coherency of the presentation of even supposedly known fact in this book that makes it helpful. Also, this book is not written for a scientific audience so assumptions about a purported reader’s prior knowledge of the topic cannot be made.That criticism and others I saw as the usual cat fighting among academics that is often based in envy. I was an academic, and I know more than I care to about this nasty behavior.It’s a good book. Read it if you are interested. And thank you, Dr. Greyson, for writing it.Sheila Wall, MD, MFA, CAc"
A few interesting stories from like the 1970s from an author that wants to tell you more about his professional prowess then what is actually “After”.  I honestly was expecting more with some conclusion as opposed to his constant talking about himself and his colleagues.  Mix in some poor attempts at literary grandeur  with descriptions like  “her dark brown hair was disheveled but the natural curls were...”. Please I wasn’t looking for a novel.
"Credit the progression of the Near-Death Experience (NDE) over the past 50 years from an event that raised eyebrows about the experiencer’s sanity to a phenomenon that merited serious consideration by scientific and medical professionals to the curiosity and persistence of Dr. Bruce Grayson, Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and Neurobehavioral Sciences at the University of Virginia, among many other professional credentials.Dr. Greyson’s interest in near-death experiences began in medical school when he encountered a patient in the emergency room who stunned him with an account of leaving her body while unconscious, an event that challenged his orthodox beliefs about the mind and the brain and thus led him on a lifelong journey to study near-death experiences scientifically. He went on to co-find the International Association for Near-Death Studies (IANDS) and serve as editor to the Journal of Near-Death Studies for 27 years.As a writer myself who focuses on reincarnation and the paranormal, I found IANDS ten years ago, have attended several of its events, read widely on the subject, and observed related research by Dr. Gary Schwartz of the University of Arizona. This is not to blow my horn, but to give some standing in reviewing and  recommending Dr. Greyson’s recently published (March 2021) memoir/autobiography of his work with NDE’s, After: A Doctor Explores What Near-Death Experiences Reveal About Life and Beyond. To those with considerable experience, direct or indirect, in the subject, Dr. Greyson’s work might, as a top Amazon reviewer put it, appear to be “interesting, not groundbreaking,” qualifying such bluntness by saying: “You will not be disappointed if you approach this book as a biography of Greyson and a late-in-life summation of his work and perspective on the NDE phenomenon. It isn't by any means technical or groundbreaking. It touches all the bases, but not in a deep or challenging way.” A left-handed compliment but the type of innuendo that Dr. Greyson as an academic working in a non-traditional field must be used to, and one I see as more of a positive than perhaps intended. After is indeed not highly technical or overburdened with jargon; Greyson is an experienced teacher introducing his subject in a way that novices to the concept of the NDE, his target audience, can readily absorb. That same reviewer also takes issue with the author holding to middle ground: “Greyson bends over backwards - and beyond - to maintain at least a façade of objectivity between the extremes of insisting NDEs are full-blown experiences of the afterlife and insisting they're products of natural processes.” Again, a left-handed swipe that can be seen as a compliment to Dr. Greyson’s ability to encourage the reader to think independently and synthesize the opposite sides of the argument for himself. He does this so elegantly when he writes: “One of the fruits of that open-minded attitude is an appreciation for things we can’t explain. Studying things that fit our preconceived ideas helps us understand their fine points better. But studying things that don’t fit our preconceived ideas is what often drives breakthroughs in science.”And I believe he is plenty bold enough in stating what is obvious and incontrovertible about the NDE experience: “Whatever NDEs were, they were changing people’s lives as surely as our psychiatric drugs and psychotherapy. What’s more, they seemed to do this much faster, more profoundly, and more permanently. And beyond that, NDEs changed not only the experiencers’ lives, but often the lives of others who came into contact with them—including me.”He takes on the tough, perhaps unfathomable, questions, a key one of which in his own words is: “What’s a better way to think about the relationship between the chemical and electrical activity in your brain and the thoughts and feelings in your mind?” He then points out the need to differentiate the mind from the brain, citing NDE phenomenon as evidence to that separation in the human makeup, a conclusion he is then content to leave open-ended: “We may eventually come up with another explanation, but until then, minds and brains as separate things, with brains acting to filter our thoughts and feelings, seems to be the most plausible working model.”After is Highly recommended for those newly curious about to the subject of NDEs (there are also dozens of books with supportive case studies and alternate analyses) but equally valuable to the already initiated as a summary of the subject from a master and a well-crafted handbook for use in presenting this difficult but critical element of the life process to those who need to know about it. And if NDEs are as frequent and impactful as Dr. Greyson proposes they are, who shouldn’t know as much as can be known about them?"
"There are some books you want to read immediately when you first hear about them. A medical scientist recommended this book so I figured it would interest me. I'm one of those people who can't wait for science to catch up with those who have already experienced the afterlife!Bruce Greyson is a psychiatrist and scientist, but every indication in this book implies that he is also a born writer. His experiences are conveyed with the thrill of a suspense novel. Frankly the first revelations of a patient seeing him as she had an out-of-body experience gave me chills! It is one thing to have an experience like that, it is another to convey it so effectively.I kept reading...Bruce Greyson explains that after years of research he can not dismiss NDEs as simply dream states or hallucinations. He believes that near-death experience research can help us describe reality as it really is! That the mind can function apart from the brain.This book is based on 45 years of scientific research. Some of the questions this book answers include:When is a person considered clinically dead?Can you be spiritual and not abandon science?What are the types of questions a doctor asks himself or herself when patients are telling them about their more-than-real-life out-of-body experiences!?What does a person feel about his/her body when they have left?What is the difference between an experience of a lack of oxygen and an NDE? (they are not the same)With photographic precision, Bruce Greyson tells story after story! It is absolutely fascinating and some of the ideas in this book are so unique I've never read about them in any other NDE book before. This author is really at the top of his game as far as science goes. He is one of the true scientists who goes where the evidence leads and draws his own educated conclusions.The people who describe their experiences of NDEs in this book are especially poetic and most of the stories were absolutely new to me. There are mostly positive experiences but a few negative ones that scared the heck out of me. Be prepared!Some of the things I disagreed with were few, but I don't think the author knows enough about the biblical heaven and how people get there as he is not convinced it is another place besides earth. Sure it is invisible to us now, but when we leave our bodies people say they travel to heaven through outer space, a tunnel or descend into the earth to hell in the middle. I've read nearly everything!I also think it matters how we describe God. He is known by certain names and not others. People's religious beliefs do apparently affect some of the experiences, like some are surprised to be encountering Jesus when they don't believe in him. This is a little disconcerting for them at first.This book helped me understand how humans are attracted to religion because they are searching for God. But I believe the main religions do differ wildly in what they teach about the afterlife and how to get there. So this book indicates that all religions lead to God - which if you study many religions you will see that most religions lead to many gods.While reading this book I did notice from my own experience that falling in love with God has some of the same after effects that positive near-death experiences do. And I realized that the negative side effects are much like depression.Before reading this book I had read that all suicide victims had negative NDEs, but apparently I had not read enough. While all I've read about were given a second chance, in this book there are some individuals who felt love and acceptance from God. That was beautiful. I still believe suicide is the wrong choice but I'm happy that God is still so forgiving of our mistakes.Reading this book is like getting a doctorate in near-death studies. It is profoundly meaningful and explores ideas from all angles. Bruce Greyson is a soul who I think will find Jesus himself eventually as he has such a open heart. He already seems OK with a belief in God, and as a scientist these days, that is really something!The main impression I got from this book was that God is so loving to give so many of us second chances. It really is amazing when you think about it! This is a book you want to read before you die - the sooner the better!~The Rebecca Review"
Excellent book covering 50+ years of Near Death Experience research and study.  If you aren't certain that we survive after our bodies die then you will be after reading this book.
"I first heard about this book on a podcast. The doctor’s description of these patients’ lives after NDEs were so inspiring. As their attitudes changed and evolved into a selfless lifestyle.The book approached this subject in a very scientific manner, but still addressed each experiencer respectively.I am a Christian and throughout the stories of NDE, different scriptures kept coming to mind. It made me question how many things we believe as Christians are man made. God is true love and that’s what these NDE where finding out. Some of them had no words to describe an enveloping love, but this book confirmed His existence for me even more."
"Dr. Greyson has done a phenomenal job writing this book. The personal accounts shared of NDE’s are a source of hope for what lies beyond the physical journey. I found his explanation of the difference between the mind and the brain, particularly fascinating and highly educational.My interest in what lies beyond the physical world began following the sudden passing of the man I loved. His death and the grief that followed sent me spiraling into the grips of despair. Comfort was found in reading books written about NDE’s. The subject matter brought peace to my spirit and set me back on the path to life.I have self-published two books on my grief journey, in the hopes of helping others. I am a firm believer that we are far more than these physical bodies we currently inhabit. We truly are spiritual beings having a temporary human experience. Thank you, Dr. Greyson for authoring such an amazing book. Your collection of data and the scientific methods applied in your research are easy to follow and not off-putting in any way. The language used is easy to understand and thought provoking. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject of what happens when we die. This book inspires HOPE, something we desperately need in today’s world."
"A fascinating book, no matter what perspective you bring when you read it. Dr. Greyson follows the evidence, even though it leads in unexpected directions, in his work studying near death experiences aka NDEs. His work, and the work of his colleague Dr. Jim Tucker, both of the Dept. of Perceptual Studies at the University of Virginia Medical School, deserves open minded reading and serious consideration. Amazon has this book categorized as “new age” which is a shame and a mistake. It should be grouped with nonfiction writing about medical and scientific topics aimed at the lay reader, because that is what it is. I will be thinking about this book for a long time."
"I have read numerous books about individuals' NDEs.  The stories were intriguing, but there was nothing to substantiate them.  What I liked about this book is Dr. Greyson's very detailed account of the methodical research methods he and others have used to explain what NDEs are, and what they are not.  He's also not afraid to state there is still much we don't know about the experience that requires further research.  He's right about one thing for sure...although I have never had an NDE myself, learning what I have about them has significantly reduced my personal fear of death."
"The author has nothing new to write aboutA bunch of anecdotes, nothing scientificAll these authors including greyson are copying each other"
"Ever since the Myth of Er in Plato's Republic, there have been accounts of Near Death Experiences.  Dr. Greyson details many accounts, their similarities and their differences across cultures and that NDEs are part of our common human experience.  One of the most interesting stories is of a,mafia soldier descibing his past life review from three different points of view.  His considerations of their deeper meaning at the end of the book, especially the mind-body conundrum offer people a logical, reasoned approach for apreciating this phenomenon.  While I doubt that skeptics will be convinced by Dr. Greyson,  his book is a refreshing addition to the growing body of literature that tries to help people understand that even the unknowable can be considered with reason.Dr. Jonathan A. Curzon"
"Dr Bruce Greyson scientifically approaches the world of people who report their Near Death Experiences (NDEs) to any and all readers.  Readers who are intellectually honest about exploring the topic will read the transparent feelings and responses of this skeptic scientist as he discusses his life-long pursuit of truth.  I enjoyed reading numerous accounts of people and their NDEs.  His final chapter is a summary of his findings for readers who want to skip the many engaging descriptions of his progressive investigation, including his struggle to find acceptance among his peers—worthwhile and engaging to read for this fellow former skeptic."
"This is a very well written book.  Greyson presents the evidence, research, and statements, and discusses possible implications, without drawing any definite conclusions.  It’s very readable and engaging, and I’ll be thinking about it for a long time."
"This is an extremely interesting book as Dr. Greyson tracks his history of studying near death experiences (NDEs) and his work to attempt to view them through his largely scientific lens.  It’s provocative and informative, albeit a bit repetitive even when it comes to the NDE stories themselves…which, in some ways, proves his points.  There are a lot of common elements in these NDEs and their after affects and it challenges us to re-examine how we think about the biological brain and whatever is the “mind”.  He doesn’t have all the answers….who could?  But, he does a great job of narrowing down the questions."
"During the pandemic I found myself missing the chance to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner meetings so I began reading different books at different meals, pretending to be spending time with the author of each one, at each meal. For breakfast I chose Bruce Greyson, MD, and AFTER to start each day with a sense of wonder and possibility. Indeed, there are no ""answers"" at the end (I hope I'm not spoiling it for anyone that we will all have to find out the truth for ourselves at the time of our own deaths) but I loved learning about the phenomenon of Near-Death Experiences. Dr. Greyson writes clearly about complex topics and sensitively about the human experience. I loved this book!"
"Author failed to analyze NDEs caused by sudden cardiac arrest, the most fatal worldwide killer.  Yet its survivors have the most bizarre experiences which led to the name NDEs. But hardly any researcher will admit that our God-given souls orchestrate the entire rescue operation for victims of sudden cardiac arrest."
"Dr. Greyson is a professional scientist but still writes accessible. He makes no hard claims, but he presents the primary evidence of his patients' narratives in their own words. These are extremely compelling. Greyson admits that his own worldview has been challenged and humbled by means of his patients' experiences, and that is also a moving part of this book. He has had to wrestle with being uncertain. His honesty about what can and cannot be known (with our current science) and the pursuit of truth make him an excellent narrator. I recommend this book to anyone seeking their own truth along that boundary where science and belief meet."
"This book has changed the way I view this life. And the life after this life. The thousands of people who have these experiences and report back are very, very clear about what are important in this life: kindness and compassion. And what are NOT: power and money."
"What an interesting book with so many near death and other experiences.  I loved it.  I believe in Angel numbers and there is a very important exchange between Dr. Greyson and the Dalai Lama on page 222.  Read this book and look up some meanings of 222, I think you will be amazed.  Messages of hope and a light for all.  Thank you Dr. Greyson and all who were a part of this amazingly inspired book.  Namaste."
"I have read a number of NDE books and find them fascinating.  I found the first part of this book with all the scientific experiments the author did somewhat tedious, though important to the authors purpose.  I skimmed some of those chapters.  However, I found the latter part of the book very interesting where he summarized his conclusions and I got some new insights from some of the experiencers reports."
This was a great book to help me understand what near death experiences are all about and to give me some research material for my book which will be called your life review without a near death experience.
"This book handles a complex and sometimes baffling subject very skillfully. With his mix of curiosity, openness, and scientific approach, Dr. Greyson brings us a thorough discussion of the theories and speculation around near death experiences.  He deftly examines the scientific views of what happens in the brain of a person who experiences a close brush with death, and then describes why various theories fall short. I particularly appreciated the section on how these experiences affect the experiencer, those around them, and even, potentially, the broader society, as revealed in early studies of including material on near death experiences in academic settings. Very highly recommended."
Writer kept a comfortable distance from committing to the idea of NDE's existence. However presented the material in such a way that one can decide for themselves.
"A look into life, death, the brain and consciousness. It opened my mind, my heart and will definitely have an impact on my life and how I live each day and interact with the people in my life. Not a religious or scientific treatise, but a look at what has come “After” the bodies have died from the eyes of the thousands of people Dr. Greyson and his team have spoken with. A fascinating read!"
This author did an excellent job of analyzing and comparing various scientific examinations of hospital patients who had a near-death experience. Dr. Greyson critically analyzes the facts as determined by several studies and compares and summarizes the results in a way that the average person can follow and understand. A wonderfully readable book that is careful not to be sensational and leaves any ultimate conclusion to the reader. Highly recommended!
"Must read for the curious reader regardless of the readers religious belief, agnosticism or secularism. Read this book and see for yourself."
"Brilliant! Opens with a funny, warmly human story that makes this brilliant scientist completely relatable, and then goes on to blow our minds with meticulously researched stories of people experiencing life, or awareness, after death. This is a must read, and a hugely fun read."
"Clear writing conveys the wealth of information gleaned by interviews from patients who experienced sufficient trauma to have Out of Body Experiences. Enough salient information is presented to authenticate that consciousness was able to separate from the body to convince even the skeptic that consciousness persisted when the brian was no longer functional. In fact, what was learned is that consciousness freed from the brain is higher, and that perception is greatly enhanced as if the body and brain were barriers to true perception. This book is an instant classic."
"My mother-in-law told me she wanted this for Mother’s Day so I quickly got on Amazon, my perfect go to place to buy books of course! I snatch this up for her and it got there within two days, she was so happy she almost cried. Thank you AMAZON! She really enjoyed the book."
"Dr. Greyson made it enjoyable reading and was generous with his findings. As an NDEr and one of his subjects over the decades, it's good to know that NDEs are being taken seriously by academia and the information is getting out to the general public. Highly recommend it to everyone who thinks about death and dying.Diane Goble, MS - author of ""Beyond the Veil: Our journey home"""
This book was so insightful on the subject of NDE.  The author wrote clearly and respectful on the subject.  Lots of examples of people who have had a near death experience.  His conclusions at the end were very thought out and made sense.  He is a medical doctor.
Fascinating reading about NDE’s and the impact on people’s lives after.  There seems to be consciousness after death - how else to explain these extraordinary stories?
"As a MD, I was a skeptic but after reading the book, I am open to many new experiences. Enjoy"
"Certainly a fascinating subject by a dedicated M.D.  Sadly, very poorly written, cliche-ridden anecdotal account. No new insights. Dr. Greyson should have collaborated with a professional writer; if he DID, he  was working with a hack."
"A psychiatrist interviews and studies the testimonials of people who've had Near-Death Experiences, and unfolds his engrossing search for answers about the brain and the mind and consciousness itself.  Written with great humility and intelligence, he addresses the concerns of skeptics and the demands of scientific thinking.  Fascinating, totally believable and wonderfully well-written."
The reader grows to trust what the author says not only from the plethora of evidence he has collected but because he presents the full stories of NDEs even from experiencers who have a different worldview from his own.
very compelling. I appreciate that Dr. Grayson comes from the perspective of a skeptic. It is also interesting that no one “comes back“ and wants a bigger car or house. They want to be of service to their fellow man. Well written and well done memoir of a life‘s work studying the subject
I was very disappointed.  Did not include enough experiences from individuals.
"This book gives us important, compelling, information from over 40 years of research that Dr. Greyson was involved in. It convinced me of the truthfulness of NDE's and the accounts were truly amazing. The book is very well written and so interesting I couldn't put it down.  Understanding the mind is not the same as the brain will make sense and it will give comfort to those who are grieving."
"This book will be of particular interest to logical thinking skeptics looking to see what methodical scientific study has made of NDE's, study that has been superbly woven with innumerable personal experiences and relevant excerpts from thousands of recorded NDE's"
This book was very well written & enlightening. A good book to read if you want a better understanding of an afterlife experience.
"Excellent book from the leading researcher in this field for many years. He takes an even handed approach and covers the topic from many points of view. Goes far beyond only  providing stories of the experiences of those who have had an NDE, and covers the many explanations that have been offered by various researchers for NDEs over the years plus his own conclusions."
"Dr Greyson has written a book that will rock your world.......nobody has had more experience with NDE's than he has, and he imparts it to us in amazing detail.  This book changes lives and gives great comfort to all of us....... no matter our stage of life.  I highly recommend AFTER!  There is nothing like it."
Really makes one question a lot of preconceived notions about death. I felt better after reading it.
It was interesting but redundant and awkwardly written. I wanted to love it. Did not.
I have a whole new appreciation for the mind/brain relationship after reading this book. Dr. Greyson provided much food for thought about what comes After.
I heard the author in a podcast and I am loving the book 📖💜
"I liked about this book that shows a topic that you’ll think it’s not possible to see with a scientific point of view. For those of us that are very logical and physical, this book can show you a different perception of life and what’s beyond it. And Dr Greyson do it with a practical and objective speech, in the entire reading. Highly recommended."
My husband enjoyed the book.  He said it was amazing.
Interesting information and vivid experience
A very scientific and thorough insight into this subject
"Interesting, but really didn't prove his case. As he essentially says, you will believe what you want. There are ways these events can be verified. Seeing a stained tie is not enough."
Life changing read. Its so grounded and for the first time I believe in a form of life after death. Very well done!
Enjoyed this book. Love reading about NDE's.  one was very insightful. Author has a great deal of experience in researching his subject
Great book but a little too scientific for me a lot of the stuff was over my head Extensive research too much skepticism for me
See the headline.
"I highly recommend this book, not only for those who have experienced NDE's, but for anyone who has lost a loved one, pondered the meaning of life or just wonder about the afterlife."
Great product. Very happy.
"As a therapist, I meet people who have anxiety, panic, depression, and grief, who could all benefit from the relief of fear that this book has brought and must bring to people. All people would benefit from reading it."
I was expecting a dust cover for the book and it didn't have one. Other than that the book was in good shape.
Legitimate exploration by a true scientist
Very cool collection of near death experiences weaved in with what is known about the science. One of my favorite reads.
This book is awesome. I was enthralled from the first story to the last. At times I fear what will happen when I pas. Having been brought up with the ideas of Hell and all that it was refreshing to actually read what people have seen on the other side say about what comes next. After covers a lot of ground. The fact that near death experiences should nt be possible when a persons brain is dying is highlighted and explained in a way I now understand. My favorite story is one of the first. The story of Henry and his seeing his Mama and Papa again. If you are worried or have lost someone this book will give you a fresh look at what we all will experience someday. That is the passage to the other side.
"Timely, well researched, captivating read all while feeling like Dr. Greyson and I were just having a conversation."
"Outstanding book by a superb author, highly recommended"
Loved the content!
thought provoking...well written
"In ""After"", an esteemed medical doctor and researcher ""Explores What Near-Death Experiences Reveal about Life and Beyond"". Near-Death experiences probably puzzle, baffle and certainly interest most of us. In this non-fiction book, the author Dr. Bruce Greyson provides us with a clear, kind and compelling look at the science of Near-Death Experiences. This book is as fascinating as you can imagine. ""After"" is well-written, and the scientific explorations and research that Dr. Greyson conducted for over half a century will teach you about what makes life meaningful, what you think about death and what you know about yourself.Are Near-Death Experiences (NDE's) ""real""? After reading the book, they certainly seem to be. They are common and can happen to anyone. Near-Death Experiences may lead to profound and long-lasting life changes. Surprisingly to me, NDE's may reduce the fear of death and cause those who have experienced them to be more fully present in their lives after the event.The book presents a number of patient histories and their recollections and descriptions of their NDE's. Many people had out-of-body experiences and saw themselves, from above, as they were being treated in the hospital. Many also described the experience as incredibly real, perhaps the most real experience they had ever had. Beautiful colors, lights, a sense of a loving deity and interactions with those that had previously died were also noted.Dr. Greyson also presents many of his research studies. One that really interested me involved re-intervewing people about their NDE, many years after it had happened. Remarkably, their recounting of the experience did not vary at all. For many, it was still the most amazing thing that had ever happened them.How do our minds and brains work together? This informative and rather amazing book will discuss and answer many of the questions about life and death that you may have pondered. Thanks to NetGalley and St. Martin's Press for an advance review copy. This is my honest review."
"Having read at least 50 books dealing with the near-death experience (NDE) over the past 45 or so years, I would rank this one among the top three, probably first among those with a more general approach to the subject rather than relating one’s personal experience.Dr. Greyson is certainly one of the most experienced researchers in the field of near-death experiences, if not actually the most experienced and qualified.  He touches all bases on the subject.  Although I was familiar with some of the cases, such as those of Eben Alexander and Tom Sawyer, there were many I had not heard of or do not recall if I did read them before.  I do not share the view of another reviewer who suggested it is all old stuff and nothing more than a 1980s book might have offered. First of all, there are millions of potential readers who are unfamiliar with the subject matter, i.e., those who have not read earlier books, and secondly, it brings the reader up-to-date relative to the arguments made by skeptics and debunkers. There is always a need for something current on a controversial subject.  A 1980s book would not necessarily address all the materialistic theories offered by the skeptics in recent years.Over the years, Dr. Greyson appears to have gone from a strict fence-sitter on the survival issue to leaning heavily in that direction while making every effort to maintain his scientific objectivity. As he states in the book, he does not have any alternative explanation for some of the evidence, especially that  of experiencers seeing deceased loved ones while out of body. However, one might infer from Greyson’s comments that the NDE is the only phenomenon offering evidence. As the great physicist Sir Oliver Lodge said, it is the cumulative evidence that convinced him.  The NDE research provides icing on the cake – a cake well baked by Lodge, Frederic Myers, Richard Hodgson,  James Hyslop and other pioneers of psychical research long before Dr. Raymond Moody gave a name to the NDE.I plan to order a copy of this book for a very skeptical friend who is nearing the end of his life and thinks he is facing complete extinction.  I’m hoping his very melancholy mood will be uplifted by the book. Many thanks to Dr. Greyson for all of his efforts over the years."
"As Dr. Greyson points out in the book, the plural of anecdote is data. This book is a data-driven compendium of the state of the science regarding near-death experience. It doesn't pretend to offer explanations for what is so far unexplainable. It doesn't speculate. It classifies and organizes NDEs into different types. It reveals what is known: That NDEs are not hallucinations nor signs of mental illness. That the experiences can be life-changing, but positive outcomes require acceptance from loved ones and the medical community. That experiencers can develop a deeper sense of empathy and lose their fear not only of death, but of life.I was struck by how closely some NDEs resemble Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor's descriptions of her stroke: the vibrancy, the sense of oneness. Dr. Greyson touches on this but doesn't explore it. He avoids the speculation that some NDEs could result from a loss of blood flow to the left hemisphere of the brain while the right hemisphere (for some moments at least) remains active. It seems the implication is there, but he's careful not to state it outright.However, this does not adequately explain other types of NDEs, like out-of-body experiences. So we're left with what's still a great mystery—the profound question of whether consciousness is a function of the brain or something else—and whether consciousness can continue even after the brain has died.This book doesn't reveal any great secrets of the universe. But it does offer great insight on how to offer compassionate care to patients and loved ones who've had NDEs, and how the experiencers can process the NDEs and integrate them into their lives.Thanks, NetGalley, for the ARC I received. This is my honest and voluntary review."
"This is a fascinating, amazing book, and ultimately, most comforting book! In it, Dr Bruce Greyson, a psychiatrist, and a person attached to no religious faith or doctrine, describes his 45 + years researching and studying thousands of near death experiences in a countless number of scientific tests and presents his startling conclusions.I so appreciate how he blends details about the ways he approached the topic from many different angles for his tests with stories of Near Death Experiences, and admire how he kept his ""scientific mind"" open to the possibilities of what the results were showing him. Throughout his research he didn't take a stance ""for"" or ""against"" such experiences, he just kept track of the data, continuing to get enough data to prove or disprove each test, and note commonalities or lack thereof. For instance, NDE's do not favor a particular age group, race, culture, or religious/non-religious group. They happen in such frequency amongst people who have undergone medical death to be considered common, and have been recorded and reported for hundreds of years. There is enough evidence to conclude that the mind can be separate from the physical brain which alone is flabbergasting!He presents his research and the NDE stories in a straight-forward and understandable way. The whole book is just incredible and affirming! I am so glad he invested his decades of research and his findings to the medical communities and now the public, so that we all can appreciate how even knowing that NDEs happen and are real, we can live and view our lives differently in the here and now, and rather than fearing death, look at death, not as an end, but rather as a transition to a brighter, ""more real"" and soul-expanding, love-filled place.My sincere thanks to the author, NetGalley and St. Martin's Essential for writing and publishing the book, and allowing me the privilege of reading and reviewing it. It is a read I will never forget! The book is scheduled to be published March 2, 2021. All opinions expressed in this review are strictly my own; I have not been influenced by anyone associated with this book."
"Thank you so much to the publisher for the free review copy of After, by Bruce Greyson MD in exchange for an honest review!This was interesting to me as a critical care nurse, something I never would have thought of.  I was shocked to learn how many different types of experiences there areThis is an incredible book about NDEs by the world's leading expert on the topic.  He shares a lifetime of research and select stories from throughout the years, even showing that NDEs have been reported in similar context over hundreds of years, which show that the experiences aren't necessarily based on the current world view of death and dying.  Is it God? Is it science? Greyson doesn't indoctrinate, simply shares his research and lets the reader think.  My biggest takeaway was how consistent the reports are, and I think I can be more sensitive to the topic if a patient ever wishes to share an experience.  Heck knows I see enough people trying to die and I am extremely curious now.  The book was honestly a tad dry in places talking about research but I think layreaders can gain a lot from this one"
"At first glance, this could seem like a very science heavy book, but it was written in such a way that even non-scientific people can understand. What I found most interesting was the first hand accounts of near-death experiences (NDE) and how profoundly they changed the experiencer's outlook on life.""If you take only one thing from this book, I would want you to appreciate the transformative power of these experiences to change people's lives.""Thank you to the publisher for the advanced copy; all thoughts and opinions are my own."
"A startling incident that occurred when Bruce Greyson was an intern propelled him to embark on a decades-long study of near-death experiences (NDEs).  Dr. Greyson, who is a psychiatrist, was summoned to the bedside of Holly, a university student who had taken an overdose, was now stable, but had not yet regained consciousness. Much to his shock, when Holly awoke, she told him a strange story about her spirit leaving her body. Not only did she accurately describe a stain on Greyson's tie that she could not have seen, but she also recounted a conversation that the doctor had had with the patient's roommate in another room.  Although he was initially skeptical, Greyson thought that was a subject worth investigating.  When he finished his training, the doctor became medical school professor, treated patients, and in addition, helped establish the International Association of Near-Death Studies. In his book, ""After,"" Dr. Greyson explores ""what near-death experiences reveal about life and beyond.""This starling work of non-fiction will interest readers who have an open mind about puzzling phenomena.  How is it possible for someone to come back from the dead after drowning, suffering a heart attack, being severely injured in an accident, or having attempted suicide, and then recount in minute detail what he or she saw and felt?  The author and his colleagues interviewed thousands of people, and what they discovered is eye-opening.  Many of the men, women, and children who ""came back"" reported meeting loved ones who had died (including a few who passed away while the subjects were still unconscious!), having a sense of timelessness and bliss, and reliving scenes from their past.Whether or not one accepts the possibility of NDEs, it is fascinating to note that those who claim to have had them may subsequently change in remarkable ways. Examples include the following: They no longer fear death; begin to believe in a higher power; become less materialistic and more charitable; and value life more than ever before.  A small number kept their NDEs secret for a while, lest their relatives and physicians accuse them of hallucinating.  Greyson's humanity, compassion, and dedication to scientific inquiry are impressive. He enlightens us with engrossing anecdotes and draws thought-provoking conclusions from the evidence that he gathered over forty-five years of research. This is an absorbing examination of a much talked-about but little-understood topic.  Greyson suggests that our understanding of our brains and minds (the two are interrelated but not identical) is still in its infancy. In ""After,"" the author offers a lucid and evidence-based assessment of NDEs, and proposes various theories about what they may signify."
"Written from the perspective of a doctor who has made it his life's work to study near death experiences, After is the result of countless patient studies into the nature of consciousness.  The idea of a medical approach to a more philosophical question is intriguing, but the author never really quite gets there.  There is nothing really groundbreaking here, basically nothing new or transformative.  In an attempt to express his objectivity, Dr. Greyson uses too much detail on matters that are not central to the issue at hand.Having never had a near death experience himself, Dr. Greyson must rely on the recollections of his patients.  Whether a person believes in the science behind the NDE, or the metaphysical connection to the spiritual world, there is no way of knowing without having experienced it first hand.  I honestly wanted this book to be more about the medical science aspects, so I was disappointed in the book as a whole.  Having heard a NDE from a loved one, I wanted to know more about the physical reasons.Readers seeking answers are better off looking elsewhere, so I would not recommend After: A Doctor Explores What Near-Death Experiences Reveal about Life and Beyond.Disclaimer: I was given an Advanced Reader's Copy from NetGalley and the publisher, St. Martin's Essentials.  The choice to review this book was entirely my own."
"A fascinating read about Near Death Experiences and what that means relative to the human mind.The chapters take you through a Doctor's journey into his research on this unique topic:Introduction: A Journey into Uncharted Territory1. A Science of the Unexplained2. Outside of Time3. The Life Review4. Getting the Whole Story5. How Do We Know What’s Real?6. Out of Their Bodies7. Or Out of Their Minds8. Are Near Death Experiences Real?9. The Biology of Dying10. The Brain at Death11. The Mind is Not the Brain12.  Does Consciousness Continue13. Heaven or Hell?14. What About God?15. This Changes Everything16. What Does it All Mean?17. A New Life18. Hard Landings19. A New View of Reality20. Life Before DeathI like the way the book is set up in that it captures the evolution of the author’s thinking into research on this topic, with the twists and turns along the way and info on the other research taking place. I believe I’ve read books by some of the other researchers mentioned (Ian Stevenson).  While some might consider this topic out there, it truly is a mystery and isn’t that what science is all about?  What we don’t know we research and form a theory about.  Then when we have enough info, we try to prove or disprove.  Right now, we are at the head-scratching stage of wondering if we have enough for a theory.At the end of the book the doctor/author points out that several lessons have been learned from his research:1. NDEs (Near-death experiences) are common experiences that can happen to anyone.2. NDEs are normal experiences that happen to people in exceptional circumstances.  Let’s face it, luckily few of us face death prior to actually dying.3. NDEs usually lead to a number of profound and long lasting after effects.4. NDE’s reduce fear of death5. NDE’s lead experiencers to live more fully in the present moment6. NDE’s raise questions about the relationship between minds and brains7. NDE’s raise questions about the continuation of consciousness after death.Pretty exciting huh?"
"Dr. Greyson is a pioneer (in my opinion) and one of the first scientists to collect extensive data on near-death experiences (NDEs).  Here, we are getting the scientist's description and interpretation of the NDE phenomenon based on his many years of research.  Some insights we might expect -- others are more surprising.  The descriptions of what people experiences are very detailed, and Dr. Greyson includes a helpful final chapter on the key ""take aways"" of his research.I'm a sociologist who has taught an ""end of life issues"" course at a large public university.  Beyond the actual research, what I find unique and fascinating about this book is the author's explanation of how he came to study this field -- his own background an ""no nonsense"" scientific training.  While Dr. Greyson has taken a scientific approach, it is fascinating (but not too surprising) to read about the resistances he experienced in the medical community.  I can say that many researchers in the social sciences face similar resistance (e.g.,  ""the topic of your research is not tenure worthy"").  Dr. Greyson's reflective, non-hyperbolic approach to his whole research project in this book would make it a great read for students of the social/behavioral sciences who are interested in a future in qualitative research.And, I should add, this is a must-read book for anyone interested in NDEs!"
"An extremely fascinating recounting of a doctor's efforts over four decades to research and understand Near-Death Experiences (NDEs): where they come from, what they mean, and what they do for those that experience them. What's particularly appealing about this book is the author isn't a religious scholar or minister. He's a doctor who's a self-described skeptic and does not appear to be of any particular religious persuasion, relating how he became interested in NDEs and his efforts to research them.Those that are from a religious background, or background of faith, will find much in here that strengthens and affirms that faith. For those that are not, there is much in here that will give them an appreciation for NDEs and how they change can change the hearts of those that experience them for good, and give them hope and strength to cope with the difficulties they experience in their lives.I come from a strong Christian background, and the book gave me a lot to think and ponder about. Things like reflecting on my life, my interactions with others, and reassessing and reconfirming my values and priorities."
"I was raised in a religious background, so I have thought about death a lot during my life, especially as some of my relatives have passed away over the years.  I think most people want to believe that your soul continues to survive after death, and that you are able to go to a place where you will be happy and with your loved ones who passed away before you.  Of course without proof of an afterlife, all we can base our beliefs on is either the faith we have in our religious teachings, or the stories of those people who have died for a short time and been revived.  That is the subject of this book.  Dr. Bruce Greyson has studied these near death experiences for more than 40 years, so he has many stories to share in his book that strengthen my belief that our minds continue to exist after we die.  I recommend this book to anyone who has an open mind about this subject, regardless of what your religious beliefs are.  Since Dr. Greyson is not religious, I trust what he says in his book since he approached his research from a purely scientific viewpoint."
"I loved this powerful book by NDE research pioneer Dr. Bruce Greyson. As one who is fascinated by the history of science and medicine, I am always struck by the courage of innovators who challenge the scientific community's status quo in any age. Dr. Greyson, an academic of impeccable credentials, applies research rigor to a field that was never systematically investigated prior to the 1970's, but which holds important keys to understanding the afterlife and human consciousness itself. So grateful for Dr. Greyson's curiosity, courage, and ingenuity!"
"After is a very interesting book on a topic that is little discussed and even less understood. Bruce Greyson has been investigating in this area for some 40 years, ever since he first encountered unusual behaviors in an unconscious patient early in his career as a psychiatrist. This book helps all who might be interested learn what his and many others’ years of research have revealed about those who have near death experiences (NDEs), how they may occur and some characteristics.As it happens, there is evidence for NDEs in historical and literary records going back hundreds to thousands of years (the Greeks). There are mentions of injured people seeming to be dead, then being alive and reporting strange visions or experiences. It appears to occur in about 10 to 20% of those who come close to death.Dr. Greyson presents extensive detail as he has set up a format to move methodically from the existence of NDEs, through the physiology of the brain, theories of brain vs mind, comparison of life pre and post an NDE, etc. There is an international association dedicated to this work now, one in which Dr. Greyson has been very important.While absolute answers may never be possible, there are very intriguing results found here, such as specific information a person may bring back from an NDE that they didn’t know at the time of their illness/injury. This leads to questions about the possible existence of the mind without the brain. As I said, intriguing.I do recommend this book to all who have any interest in this area.A copy of this book was provided by the publisher through NetGalley in return for an honest review."
Fascinating! Dr. Greyson has throughly studied NDE (Near Death Experiences). He takes a close scientific look over multiple decades. I finished the book with a peace about the unknown. Dr. Greyson definitely has a scientific way about him but the book never feels cumbersome with technical speak. I would highly recommend this to anyone with a fear of dying or someone that works with the sick or elderly. It gives a wonderful perspective and hope that there’s more after this.
The subject in this one was definitely eye catching as it demonstrates that near death experiences are differs yet similar for anyone who has experienced it. Most doctors won’t acknowledge near death experiences despite patients knowledge of things they shouldn’t.What did I like? My father had a NDE and retold it many times over the course of my life. If it hadn’t been for a student doctor that saved my father after he’d already been cut open for an autopsy then I wouldn’t be here. Medical phenomenon has always been tossed around in our house since his NDE but he also said he saw pink elephants while detoxing from alcohol. I’m glad this doctor didn’t discount so many people’s experiences. Some things just can’t be explained. This book gives you a look at different experiences and allows you to look at the different qualities of a NDE.Would I recommend or buy? I’d definitely buy a copy and recommend to people curious about things that happen when your body is clinically dead. My father has since passed but this book also gave me peace and made me feel closer to him. I simply believe there is a veil between this world and the next and we must lose our earthly bodies to pass through. Scientists are becoming more convinced as well. Four stars! Interesting book!I received a complimentary copy to read and voluntarily left a review!
"The book is comprised of three parts. The first explores the author's early years and experience. The voracious reader will struggle through amateurish writing saturated with excessive rhetoric to expound Grayson's medical/psychiatric credentials. But stay the course.Grayson next delves into his much better-written patient interview notes. These are solid. They are systematic, personal, and fascinating. Grayson's subjects do an outstanding job attempting to describe an experience too contextually complex to be captured in language. Some subjects are the-every-person, some from the 4th sigma of the normative population distribution … example, 'failing to succeed at suicide twice?'The last phase of the book guides the narrative's toward the spiritual. NDE’s are observed to drive lifelong behavioral change. The participants express an unnatural fearlessness of death. Grayson draws a set of commonalities from the general population claiming NDE's. Perhaps there’s fertile ground for statistical validation of the NDE experience?Grayson tells lots of stories. He includes the most extensive selection of NDE interviews that I have seen in a general population narrative. Several were incredibly enlightening as they spoke to the imagery that I have lacked the language to describe.The introduction is miserably overwrought with excessive adverbs, adjectives, and prepositional phrases. It approaches 'dark and stormy …' but excludes 'cerulean' which would have earned an immediate dismissal. By chapter 2, it becomes clear that Grayson is struggling and likely shedding readers. The intro and first section of the book makes the whole a 3-star.I understand the NDE. I’ve experienced it. Twice. The NDE's bear a near-daily presence 50 and 10 years later. So much occurs in these moments between failing life and room temp death.  Reading the experiences of others jogs fragments and aspects that I've never found words to explain. Language, as Grayson notes, is inadequate to describe the NDE.I'm also a physicist. The NDE is not, by definition, 'scientific theory.' The mind-not body nature of the NDE cannot be objectively proven untrue. A body of research ascribes the NDE experience to natural organic operations. The O2 starved brain is considered a scientific rebuttal. Indeed, strange things occur in levels of hypoxia that I can relate. However, the genuine NDE is decidedly supernatural. The scientifically aligned mind is left to deduce no other causality."
A fascinating read! This book was written in such a way that it is very accessible to the average reader. I have long had a fascination with accounts of near-death experiences. Reading this book changed my perception of near-death experiences as well as made me think more of the mind/brain connection. This book was very well done
"Interesting book for anyone who has questions, or is curious, about near death experiences that give a glimpse of life after death. He gives numerous examples of people who have had the experience without being judgemental or religious in any manner.  In part it is scientific/clinical and  reads very much like an article for JAMA. It gets a little slower to read midway  but  picks up as he describes more occurrences.  For those of us in healthcare who believe in a Creator, most of the stories confirm that which we learned from the King James Bible as children, live by the ""Golden Rule"". It also confirms that we aren't meant to know everything and that we are to ""have the faith of a child"" and that we ""walk by faith, not by sight"".I suppose I had hoped by the end of the book he might have admitted to more of a belief in God as he was in the perfect position to witness to the world as did Lee Strobel. But as noted, it is more clinical observations seeking to find resolution of a mind/brain conundrum.I received this book as an advanced reader copy and was under no obligation to provide a review. The opinions expressed are my own. Thanks to the author, publisher and NetGalley for the opportunity to read this book."
"Dr. Greyson has spent over forty years studying (NDE""s) Near Death Experiences of hundreds of people in an objective manner. He does a statistical study of various things that they experienced during their NDE's. He attempts to find generalities in what they felt. There are two principle things that almost all felt first, these experiences feel real to people and second, they have a reduced fear of dying afterward. A large majority try to change their lives for the better. If you are in anyway curious about what happens ""afterward"" you should read this hopeful book."
"I only made it about halfway through this book because it just wasn't what I was expecting.  It wasn't for me, but that doesn't mean it isn't an excellent book for the right audience.I ordered this book thinking it was going to be primarily detailed accounts of NDEs from those who experienced them.  Since the book was written by a prominent doctor in the field, I expected some medical insight to be added to each case.This book is actually the reverse of what I expected.  It is more of a medical reference and an account of this doctor's many years of experience.  His theories and observations are supported by brief summaries of actual cases.This is a fantastic book for those who want to learn about the scientific side of NDEs.  I was more interested in the personal experiences, so it didn't hold my interest enough to read the entire book."
"The book is well meaning and certainly uplifting and reassuring and I enjoyed it, yet I feel it suffers from the attempt to try and analyze the experience rationally. This, in my view, can no more be done satisfactorily than studying and trying to understand the physical reason for love. Ultimately it doesn't matter. The truth lies in the experience and it does not add one iota of value to find out that it is a result of the jumping of chemicals between certain neurons in the brain.I think part of the problem with the book is that the author, ho I greatly respect, while having studied the subject for many years, has never had an NDE and can only draw conclusions from what other people tell him, which he readily admits really cannot be put into words. This left me with the feeling that something important was missing."
"There are lots of books on the topic of life after life, but After shows the steps a doctor has taken over several decades to study the phenomenon. Most books just contain anecdotes on the subject, which is fine. But After follows the psychiatrist author on his journey from the very beginning when he first heard anecdotes from experiencers all the way through his various experiments.If you're looking for anecdotes, you'll find plenty here.It's a thought-provoking journey that in the end will fill you with wonder and a positive feeling about what lies after we shuffle off our mortal coil."
"How frustrating is it to be told by all the different sources the things you must do to be successful in life? This book definitely does NOT do that. It instead takes an empathetic approach and gives bite size approaches and allows you to have kindness and patience with yourself when dealing with life. This is so necessary for everyone to read in life. I received an advance review copy for free, and I am leaving this review voluntarily."
"Conflict of interest disclaimer: I am a long-time colleague of Bruce's -- also an NDE researcher. Although my relationship with him may be a source of bias, my knowledge of the field of near-death studies positions me uniquely to comment on the value of this book. Considering Bruce's goal in writing the book -- to inform people about NDEs who have only a passing knowledge of them and enable them to come away with much more thorough knowledge -- I believe he achieved his goal the best of any single book on NDEs I've seen so far. In fact, when people have asked me, ""If I were going to read just one book on NDEs, what would you recommend?"", I used to reply, ""Ken Ring and Evelyn Elsaesser-Valarino's book, Lessons From the Light. Well, my apologies to Ken and Evelyn: From now on, my response will be ""Bruce Greyson's After."""
"I've read a few books about NDE (Near Death Experiences) and this one is quite engaging and easy to read, especially considering the author's background. Understand that the author does believe in the afterlife and deity, and those who are offended by such beliefs may want to move on. Those who believe that science and religion do not cancel eachother out will enjoy the insights to be gained from this book.It really makes one think, and I enjoyed this more than some of the others on the topic I have read."
Great effort by author on bringing his research to larger unfamiliar NDE audience..Audio book narrative is great.. think will read this book couple of more times to get its essence.. very interesting book..
"Anyone with an open mind, and there aren’t many, and who very carefully read this book in its entirety will clearly see, at the very least , that the materialist/reductionist paradigm is certainly not working to explain the phenomenon of consciousness. Clearly the concept of an implicate order, see Theoretical physicist Dr. David Bohm’s work “Wholeness and the Implicate Order”, is one that clearly allows for such phenomenon as explained in this incredible work by Dr. Greyson. Science got it right and wrong folks. Yes in the explicate Newtonian order the current paradigm fits quite well; however it crumbles and falls apart in the quantum/implicate realms. Please again don’t zip through this book and criticize it based on your preconceptions. Give it the respect it so much deserves! This book will make history of that I am convinced!"
"I've been fascinated by NDE (near death experiences) ever since my mom told me about hers. As I get older, especially with health issues, I find myself curious to learn more. I don't believe death is the end. My family members have had our fair share of spirit/ghostly encounters, enough to let me know beyond doubt that there's more beyond the veil of body death. So I really enjoyed reading this book. I loved the stories, the experiences. I'd recommend this book to anyone curious about this subject."
"They say if your work speaks to one person in an audience it was worth it. Well, for me, this was that book. I was feeling a lot of grief as I wandered around Costco after hearing my beloved cat did not have a simple eye infection but an inoperable brain tumor. I did not know how to process this. I feared a piece of my heart would die with him. I saw this book on the pile and was drawn to it. After... what, I thought? I'd never given a moment's thought to NDEs but it was written by a doctor with a scientific, non-religious approach which appealed to my skeptic sensibility. What if death is not something to fear but a blissful transition? Wouldn't that be something? Everyday I would read it with my cat tucked in beside me. I would give him comfort and your book would comfort me. Thank you, Doctor. I feel lighter. More hopeful now. If there is one big adventure left at the end of of the road, I like where your research takes me."
"Very interesting read specially from a cientific versus religious point of view about NDE. The biology, and chemistry of the brain, all functions of the body or medications contributing to those experiences.I wish there was more data backing up something that felt more of an speculation, hoping there's more research in the field but definitely a worth reading."
"I listened to this via Audible. It is an unforgettable book, supported by solid research and case studies, complemented with interviews by the author. The topic of near death experiences is one about which I have read for several years, yet I learned a great deal from After.One of my favorite book purchases. Very highly recommended."
"Well written and a little provocative when it came to talking about the mind-brain issue, but nothing new.I would have preferred the whole reading experience if the typeface had been a little bigger.Of course, on a kindle you can adjust it to your preference, but I still prefer a book or audiobook."
"This book is written by a doctor, so it’s not surprising that the overall content is clinical. I’m more interested in individual experiences, so I found myself skipping around to find this info. There were some good points from the author’s research. If you like research driven books, then this is more for you."
This is a very good description of the Near Death Experience experienced by very many people and how it changed their lives. I think the author used what he found  from these experiences to justify his theory what it all means.
"I really enjoyed this book! The stories were fascinating as were the various studies that were discussed. I have no background on the subject of NDEs, only an interest stemming from curiosity, and I found this book to be easy to follow and extremely thought provoking. I would definitely recommend it to readers of all backgrounds and interest levels."
I have read several books written by people who have experienced NDE. This author has not personally had this experience but he has vast experience and describes dozens of people who have experienced death and returned to life with a new outlook on life. I recommend this book.
"When I first started reading, I was put off by all the extraneous detail, but it didn't take me look to realize that the detail was not extraneous at all. Drew me in from the start. Reads like a novel. Good addition to the genre."
This book was a wonderful and straightforward analysis of the scientific discoveries surround near experiences. Dr. Bruce Greyson is the ultimate authority. His writing is crisp and to the point and he makes excellent points in every chapter. It was a terrific read.
"There's not much more I can say. The book truly changed my perception about life and death. And above all, it gave me hope."
"I received a complimentary digital copy of this book from the publisher, St Martin’s Press and NetGalley. My review is voluntary and unbiased.After explores the stories of patients who experienced near-death experiences. Although raised by a practical chemist, the author was drawn to study experimental psychology at Cornell. He was initially interested in animal intelligence which eventually led him to medical school. Always maintaining his belief of methodological and statistical research, he was fascinated with what seemed to be a common universal theme of life and death. In 1976, he was teaching at University of VA where he met Raymond Moody, who was a student after teaching philosophy. Dr Greyson was intrigued by his book, Life After Life, in which he describes his life after a near death experience.Dr Greyson began his own research and experimentation after several odd encounters with patients describing similar events. He was eventually convinced that these stories had some theoretical basis. He took history and science into consideration when formulating his own theories which he shared with others when he formed the International Association for Near Death Studies.What I found interesting was the account in 1892 of Swiss geologist professor Albert von St Gallen Heim. He had been mountain climbing when his brain became deprived of oxygen due to the altitude. He reports a NDE where his thinking was rapid yet clear as if a slowing of time occurred. Psychologist Joe Green wondered if Heim’s experience played a role in Einstein’s theory of relativity. Heim wrote, “Time became greatly expanded” so time so that he was able to think through his situation as if time slowed down. Einstein’s theory of relativity sites that time slows down the faster you travel.The stories from patients range from mildly eventful to extremely spiritual in nature. Some report having “died” and actually seeing their body as well as other family who has passed away. Others report a less extreme experience which almost seemed like a “dream”."
"This is an incredibly good book. The fact that the author is a ‘scientist’ adds a certain level of credibility to NDE, credibility that is sometimes missing from similar books.Whether you are religiously / mystically inclined or not this book will prove a fascinating read. What impressed me most are the references provided & the author’s accessible & engaging writing style.On the whole, a thoroughly enjoyable, interesting & absorbing book. Buy ‘n’ read - I promise you will not be disappointed!"
"I would tentatively recommend you read the book, but it does repeat itself a lot, and I mean A LOT.The anecdotes are fairly interesting though, and although the author stops short of stating there is definitely a heavenly afterlife, you can tell he thinks it.He also frequently refers to God with capital He and Him etc which is the sign of a theist giving this most questionable of entities due respect. Nothing to do with grammatical correctness because he and him are not proper nouns.Throughout the book there’s an underlying message of “how could this person possibly have known X Y Z without actually leaving their bodies”. Case in point being the repeated mentioning of a spot on his tie which he says was not visible. Yeah, right, that’s proof positive, isn’t it. No possible other explanations than the floating soul saw it when out of their body.The trouble with this and every other anecdote is that they are just that, anecdotes. However they’re quite interesting, and this is the aspect of the book I can recommend."
"If you expect a conclusive study of this phenomenon you are going to be disappointed because this is not the aim of the book. It is the acount of a medical professionals long term fascination with and study of what are termed near death experiences. Other reviews have criticised his work for its reliance on ' anecdotal' evidence and I can understand this but I can also appreciate that by the very nature of the phenomenon. clinical and non empirical evidence is usually impossible to gather. From the reported cases it is clear that a significant number of those who have been brought back from clinical death have experienced something which cannot be easily explained except in ways bordering on the mystical. What is undoubted is that the experience has changed the way in whch many of them regards the world and the phenomenon of death itself. Unlike some other books on this, the author offers no hard and fast explanation but rather leaves it to the reader to come to their own conclusions based on the informaion he presents. It is thought provoking - although you may of course end up disagreeing with some of his suggested explanations and hypotheses."
"I was very disappointed in this book given the good reviews. Essentially it's an author using the fact that he's a doctor to add weight to a series of near-death experience anecdotes, which, though interesting in themselves, prove absolutely nothing. There's little in the way of hard science and the author offers none at all to explain his stated belief at the end that consciousness that comes into existence with our birth somehow continues after our death, despite the brain turning to dust.The author seems sincere enough, and tries hard to be impartial, so I would hesitate to class this book with the plethora of others on the the same subject peddling tripe to the gullible, but in the end it doesn't amount to much more."
Look forward to reading this book as Ive had a very similar experience in the past
"Bruce Greyson has nearly 50 years experience encountering and researching Near Death Experiences, so this is a great book to buy if you want a good overview of the topic (as well as some truly heartwarming & transformational personal accounts!).  Greyson really writes with the reader in mind... got through this in a few days and left me wanting more. Recommended read! 5-stars."
"An excellently researched book, dealing with a 'spiritual' subject in a scientific way that allows the reader to draw their own conclusions, whatever they may be. I still don't believe in a 'god', but I do now believe that there may be an afterlife....time will tell!"
"A cool scientific appraisal of the evidence  available which convinces me that our minds are not simply the product of our bodies, and therefor do not inevitably die when the body does.  How long the mind might survive, in what form or rather, perhaps, with what capacities, it s not possible to know but this is already as far as I know the most steady appraisal of these  conclusions as I have come across."
"It doesn't matter if you are an atheist or some sort of fundamentalist this book is fascinating. I come from a fundamentalist, Pentecostal, Christian background and having become atheist/agnostic in my 70s I found that 'After' pretty much summarises the views which led me down the path to rejection of the teachings of the evangelical/fundamentalist view of man's relation to God. This is not a book about theology at all, nor is it preaching any religion or particular world-view but rather simply relates the stories of those who have experienced near death events. The author attempts to view these in a scientifically detached manner and to analyse both the experiences and their results from the viewpont of psychiatry."
Excellent. Very interesting read indeed.
"Deeply iinteresting, lots of case studies.  Holds your interest throughout. Much to ponder.  Very well written.  This book may change your life for the better.  I have never read such a non-fictional page turner.  A must buy and keep"
"very interesting book, I am a often very cynical and whilst not everything seemed interesting much of it did.  lots of food for thought.  Author used  compelling reasoning not just blind acceptance.  good read"
Well written and intriguing subject matter.  A thought provoking read.
"Easy to read, maybe a little technical as there are references to psychology but certainly worth sticking with it."
"Excellently researched impartial account of NDE' S. Fascinating read, could not put it down, read it, you will be glad you did"
Extremely interesting and well written book. Plenty of food for thought.
this was indeed a great book and I enjoyed it from start to finish
"I loved everything about this book; the content, style of writing, the author's own compassionate objectivity. I do feel changed  for the better after reading this and I highly recommend it."
Very credible author.
"Good book, very informative and thought-provoking"
A fascinating and thought provoking read. Once I started reading this book I could not put it down. Highly recommended.
"Conversational, slightly laboured prose and structure.But I give it 4 stars for its research, which is a lifetimes work."
If you are interested in this topic this book is superb.
A very interesting read.
"Wonderful book, still reading and reading!"
"The book explores how the author came to research the field of NDE's, and tells fascinating, and some convincing, NDE stories along the way.  Only with a very few select anecdotes he shared did I find them wishy-washy, but they were a small minority.  If you're looking for methodical hard research data, skip this book.  You're actually better off looking at the research yourself in various online avenues(AWARE study is a good place to start).  This book is really good to share with the open skeptic.  ie. someone who's open to the idea of an afterlife, but assumes there is no serious research into the phenomenon (or for those that the serious research has shown it's just a hallucination caused by the brain).  I say this because the author seems like an accomplished researcher who's somewhat skeptical himself, but is having a hard time explaining away all of these unusual phenomenon with only the materialistic explanations available.  I wouldn't bother sharing it with a hard skeptic though.  They often will come up with even more fantastical explanations than the idea of NDE's being real, in order to try to hand-wave away the phenomenon.I'll give it 4/5 stars only because I was hoping for a bit more newer revelations, or newer convincing stories (ones that specifically coincide with observed things that were happening in real life that the subject couldn't have known otherwise).  There ARE good stories like that in this book.  I was just hoping for more unheard ones."
"Muy bien estructurado y escrito. Uno de los mejores libros sobre el tema de NDEs. Yo he leído ya 5-6 libros sobre el tema, por lo que mucho de lo que dice me era conocido. Pero a pesar de eso lo recomiendo incluso a los que ya están versados en el tema"
"Dr. Greyson rightly asserts that one does not use science to prove what one already believes, but to explore with an open mind. If that's what you want to do - explore Near Death Experience accounts with an open mind - this is your book."
"This is a very objective and well researched analysis by Dr. Greyson.  Data was collected over a very long period of time and he applied the best scientific methods available to psychiatry in his quest to interpret and understand these events.  Reading it, had very positive influence on my outlook on life."
"Thought provoking, stimulating, inspiring, hope inducing read. The scientific approach makes it more engaging, and the book promotes hope and more meaning in life."
"Written by someone in medical field, this book is highly thought provoking. Loved the way the author tried to cover relevant skeptical questions and letting the readers to decide on how to interpret them."
A well presented and reasoned treatment of NDE’s for believers and sceptics alike. The book answered some key questions for me ...
This was a great two sided view at the research conducted on Near Death Experiences. It is great that this phenomena has been studied scientifically and explored spiritually.
Very enlightening read. Perhaps consciousness is a non materialistic entity related to but disassociated from the brain
AFTER is a well-researched and superbly written book with transformative potential on how we view death and live our lives. Definitely worth reading.
An honest and a great job of Dr. Greyson. It really puts some light in the fantastic trajetory of each human being.
Very extensive research on NDE! Interesting to read! One of the most educative book published on NDE
"Thanks Dr. Greyson for such a thorough, rigorous and interesting study of near-death experiences.I absolutely recommend this book to anyone interested in this subject.Well done sir !"
"Very educated, informative, thought provoking report."

   Bold, brilliant autumn colors. Themed deck that holds true to the RWS symbolism translating well to be a year-round use deck. Lots of themed decks are just beautiful works of art; you can look at them but you can't really use them because the art changes the story of Tarot. Not so with this one. The brilliant characterization of light shines through key cards such as The Fool (0) and The Hermit (9). Lightweight and solid paper stock makes for easy handling and shuffling. Thinking it will likely stand the test of regular use. If you enjoy Samhain/Halloween/All Hallow's Eve and are looking for a deck that displays and celebrates the same, this is it! Comes with a LWB in multiple languages."
"I wanted to like this deck, but in truth, I'm disappointed😞 Card stock is thin & flimsy, card artwork colors aren't as vibrant as they appear on the product page, and I can't connect with the deck whatsoever. The tarot booklet gives absolute bare minimum info for minor arcana cards & refers to the cups as ""chalices"" even though the it says ""cups"" on the cards themselves, giving me the impression that this deck was rushed & thrown together haphazardly to be released in time for the Halloween season. Still trying to decide whether or not to return them.Update: I ended up returning this deck☹"
"Well I received the deck and was a little disappointed.  A lot of my issues aren't Amazon's problem, they are just the messengers. But Amazon did loose my first package and I had to reorder, and it was late.But other than that, this isn't on Amazon. And more on the artist I guess.For some reason I was expecting more of a Halloween themed deck and instead you get an occasional pumpkin thrown around. The deck is white washed, no diversity lots of white people, which I would have liked some diversity. I like the renasance style of art, but the color pallete is the same for almost every card, just a bunch of blues, and same colors. But the colors are vibrant and beautiful.  I like that it's borderless art which was nice. The book was disappointing. The moon card had a sun instead of a moon. But other than that, that is just me being picky and spoiled based on my other decks. I belive it'll be a good deck to work with nonetheless."
I pre-ordered this tarot deck back in August. I was really excited to get a new Halloween deck! It finally got here. The artwork is beautiful and based on the Rider-Waite system. Unfortunately the cardstock is awful! It's really thin and flimsy. These cards won't last for long. Definitely not worth what I paid. I'm so bummed! This deck had so much potential!
"Beautiful deck with amazing artwork.  Everyone I've shown this deck to wants it.  The Halloween theme is definitely there, with pumpkins, skulls, bats, etc.. But!  The ""creepy"" elements are subtle enough that this deck is more than suitable for year-round use.  The traditional elements are present and gorgeous, and the coloring is So. Saturated. The size is perfect for my smaller hands, and the card stock is not too thin, not too stiff.  I couldn't be more enthusiastic about this deck."
The artwork is okay. Way less Jack-o-lanterns than expected.The real problem is the cards are made out of (practically) construction paper. Very weak and will not last long with use.
"I was so excited waiting for this deck to get here tonight, but wow am I disappointed. They look like cheap dime store tarot cards, absolutely nothing like the description. I am returning them immediately."
"This deck is a must-have for fans of Samhain, Halloween, or Autumn, it has a beautiful card back and follows the Rider Waite format with some twists. The card stock is fine, it's not as thick as some but I also don't plan on scraping ice with them.  Definitely worth$22 and some change."
"I’m a sucker for all things Halloween, so I was going to like this deck no matter what. The card stock is playing card quality, which I don’t mind as I have a hard time with shuffling firmer cards. Knocked off a star because the colors are no where near as vibrant as the pictures suggest."
"Idk what everyone is complaining about- the card stock is the same as it's always been with this company. It's perfectly fine. The colors are lush and vibrant, the artwork style is very Renaissance style meets macabre. At first it seems like it's not very Halloween themed, but on closer look, there are creepy jack o lanterns, skull shaped chairs and clouds, bats, demons, etc. Easy to read with if you're familiar with Rider Waite system (no clue why people are complaining about the booklet, as it is a standard little white book that the company always produces.) Overall I am very pleased. (And people need to get a freaking grip, it's a $22 mass produced deck, not a $70+ indie deck.) I love it."
Gorgeous cards! They are perfect for Halloween. They’re more adult than the other Halloween tarot deck. Beautiful images and very Smith Waite based. Easy to read. Nice card stock. Very pleased.
Love the cards
"I was really excited to receive these and pre-ordered the deck. As a bit of background, I am VERY open to spiritual things, energy work, crystals, etc. I love surrounding myself with reminders to live up to my life purpose or that give me fodder to think about my life in a new way. Though discovering all of these things I've come to realize that experience with them is VERY subjective and what inspires one person can fall flat for another.Unfortunately this deck just didn't do it for me. I also own Voyager Tarot: Intuition Cards for the 21st Century and when I flip through those cards they are often so spot on they give me goose bumps or so insightful I feel compelled to journal. The illustration is pretty to me but the messages just felt...benign. I can't think of a better way to articulate it for my personal taste. I never disagree with the statement, but they feel so reminiscent of the common inspirational quotes on Pinterest that they don't fill me with a sense of being inspired or moved.Again, this is TOTALLY subjective. Note that when I ordered the deck there wasn't much out there to indicate what the cards would be like so if you see preview pictures and think they seem like they'd be for you, they probably will be."
"Loved!! The cards are beautifully made, this deck is way more colorful than the “Universe”, so is definitely an upgrade for those complaining about how the Universe was made. I love both, the phrases are beautiful and I was so anxious to get this! I’ll use it daily too. I loved that the back of the cards has kept the same simple yet beautiful stylez"
"As a tarot reader and card collector, Ive never returned cards before. But this deck just doesnt do much for me. The cards all seem to say the same thing in different wording. ""Manifest what you want"" ""I believe the universe will give me abundance"" ""I have a goal in mind and I believe the abundance will come"" stuff along those lines. I'm a little unsure of the point, since they ALL have the same message basically? But if thats what youre looking for, then they're great. Theyre nicely made, pretty pictures, large size.... i just dont see myself ever using these"
"These have seriously been a huge game changer for myself, my clients and my business as a whole. Highly suggest them for your own personal transformation and then please share the goodness with the rest of the world."
"Bought this deck after working with someone who used the cards daily. She would let us all choose a card everyday. My co-workers and I always looked forward to picking one. The messages always seemed to bring some positive messages that felt personal and specific. So, I bought the deck for myself! The cards are colorful, thick and sturdy. The size makes them difficult to lose which is good.Summary: beautiful art, great messages, sturdy cards. I would recommend this purchase."
I look forward to seeing a new card every morning. It's truly helping me start my morning off right and continue that vibe throughout the day.
Great for weekly mantras. I got these so I wouldn't have to go through pages of mantras to pick one I liked. With these I just shuffle an pick a card. Love them.
I have other decks of cards & I find these to be very inspirational. I like the positive messages. They are beautiful. I also bought the book but I have not had time to read it yet. I am looking forward to using these together!!
"I was so excited to get this but there were only 5 cards that really were inspirational in my opinion...the rest seemed plagiarized from TRUE “thought leaders” (Abraham Hicks, Louise Hay, and other Law of Attraction notables). I can’t believe Oprah would think she’s original, authentic, or leading edge, considering how many books she has read and authors she’s interviewed over the years. It’s all about branding and marketing these days...all glitter and no substance. Save your money and read the authentic works of Hicks and others, and not someone who is trying to pass on their work as her own."
I just received these cards and I guess I was just expecting more from them. I feel like a lot of them are repeats just worded differently. I had hope the cards where more thought provoking with useful messages I could meditate on to find what it could mean for me in my life. I don't even feel like these are good affirmation cards as they really only have one message through out the deck.
"These are gorgeous!  The artwork is beautiful.  The box they come in is beautiful as well.  The paper quality is excellent, heavy and not flimsy, but not too heavy or stiff to shuffle.  The messages resonate and brought happiness the moment I opened the box.  I had gone back and forth on whether to buy these or not, and am so glad that I was treated myself.  They are packaged with good vibes and an appealing presentation and I wouldn't hesitate to send these as a gift directly from Amazon."
"Gorgeous cards, but obvious she didn’t include a booklet guide so that people would buy her book and she could make more money. That is super disappointing. I’ve never bought cards that came with zero suggestions as to how to best use them or to open up a sacred space. There is one blog post where she gives a few suggestions, but no elaboration on the cards or anything."
These are beautiful cards with a lovely message. They were exactly what I was looking for. These make a great gift as well!
"I have the Universe Has Your Back deck and love, but these are beyond.  You will be inspired, led and aligned through the magic in these cards.  If you have not purchased the Super Attractor book...put that in your cart now.  I have read all of Gabby's books...this is a whole new level.  Love!!!"
"Everything that Gabby produces has the potential to be life-changing, and certainly has been for me. My life continues to improve, in no small part due to the teachings that I’ve listened to/read in her books. These cards are a concentrated distillation of some of her greatest and most powerful words. I can’t wait to read the next message from the Universe!"
"I love the designs, colors & messages of the Super Attraction cards! Beautiful! Although no book is included, I have personally emailed  & asked the creator what is the companion to the cards. Is it a book? I just found this gem of a item through Gabrielle Berstein. I love all her books. I have read and purchased them."
I just love everything Gabby!  ❤ I pull a card in the morning when I wake up and follow her lead when it comes to asking the universe to show me what I need to focus on or ponder for the day.  I love the beautiful artwork as well.  I will be giving these as gifts around the holidays.
"This is the perfect gift during During times of struggle. My friends and colleagues have really appreciated having these cards on days when they need a reminder they are not alone. These cards are good for those who are agnostic, spiritually guided or seeking a metaphysical connection or outlook."
"These cards are how I start my morning, every single day! They are what you need to get your mindset right for the rest of the day! I highly recommend this deck, it will add not only your day, but your life!"
"A little more faith-based than I was hoping for, but they're fine."
I listen to the dear gabby podcast and I absolutely had to have this deck. The cards are so beautiful and they really don’t lie.
Gorgeous cards. Perfect affirmations. Positive intentions.
"Love these cards for what I wanted them for! Super fun and positive, there may be a few cards that don’t resonate with you but that’s with anything! Very quality materials!"
One of the best things I’ve ever purchased. I love these cards beautiful artwork and so inspiring definitely helping me out on my journey to enlightenment 💜
These cards are gorgeous
This deck is beautiful and inspiring!  I have added these in to my morning meditations and gratitudes.  The cards are colorful and fun.  My daughter loves to look at them and always wants the princess ones.
Lovely deck! Beautifully designed!
Bought these for my daughter and her roommate loved them so much she bought a set :-) she says they are really beautiful!
Beautiful images and positive quotes. I love these.
"I love the deck of cards - very inspirational. Keep them on my desk and use them in many ways - pull a daily card, as a tarot card deck, simply to inspire and often remind...!  LOVE THIS PRODUCT!"
"I wish there was a guide book, but they are great cards."
Na
"Love her, the mantras and design"
Uplifting and positive messages
I would buy these for any woman on my list for giving a gift too! They are Amazing! A plus!
My son and I both love these cards!! Such a fun way to stay in tune with your spiritual side.
Obsessed with this deck! It’s so fun reading a new one when needed! They’re also so beautiful!
A beautiful daily reminder!
"Like everything Gabby touches, this is magical!"
Inspiring and helping me create a morning ritual of self-care
Gorgeous cards!
Beautiful deck
Stupid not worth the money
Love these cards ! I use them for my daily affirmations.
"Love these, I draw a card daily"
"This is the very first deck I own of Gabby Bernstein. I've been following her on and off for quite some time, yet, she never... 'spoke' to the depths of my core.You know the saying...""A teacher will find you when you're ready to learn the lesson""; well, this is one of those moments.I ordered this deck together with her Super Attractor book as well. As I received it, I didn't expect anything. I was completely neutral as I didn't really know what to expect. I have seen a few images of the cards, but it never really set in my mind.So I received the deck. Unwrapped it. What a beautiful purple - the colors just work with this deck. Again, another sturdy box from Hay House.So I opened it. Please be aware for those who prefer a guidebook with each deck... this deck does NOT come with a guidebook. No guidebook included.I'm someone who really prefers to work with the guidebook as well, however, this whole deck just seems to work brilliantly.The card stock is of decent quality as well. Matt finish. Cards not too large for my tiny hands as I shuffle.Let's have a talk about art... this one is really interesting though.If you presented me with this deck ten years ago in the frame of mind I was then in, I would've probably thought... ""What a load of scrapping doodle!""I've always been open-minded and I don't judge. Seriously, I always try to gain both perspectives and feel my way through things.This deck could've either gone horribly wrong with its artwork or it could've been brilliantly planned. And it being Gabrielle Bernstein, an International Spiritual teacher; this deck and the artwork is just absolutely brilliant.I mean, these days every second person is bringing out a deck. I applaud them all - my manuscript is currently in the editing phase as well...yep, I'm also bringing out a deck! LOL. However, sometimes it feels as if there is this competition amongst curators of whose artwork is the most glamorous of them all.A deck, it being either oracle or tarot should be created from the soul, the heart of the soul. The artwork you make use of should speak to you. It should choose you as the creator as you apply it. And I think simplistic often is the best option. Don't get me wrong here, you get some ABSOLUTELY AMAZING decks out there. I LOVE the artwork. What I'm saying is that sometimes the simple route is a better option than the fancy stunning artwork we often see in many decks. And this is one of those decks.The artwork is powerful, yet so incredibly simple. It resonates with each message. And what makes this deck even more powerful is that you don't need a guidebook for this specific deck. The messages speak loud and clear.It's a gorgeous affirmation deck which you can make use of every single day. Either pulling one card of multiple cards to add to your story for the day, week or month. Lately, I've been making use of multiple decks during any reading as it really adds so much depth and insight to your specific question."
"The cards are lovely, the artwork soothing, and the messages inspirational."
Micaela did it again with her gorgeous artwork! If I could blow some of it up and hang it on my wall I would.  These cards are just so sensitive and thoughtful.  Great cards to pull every morning and set your intention!
"Pretty, but they lack any real substance or guidance. The problem with this deck is a problem across many things “spiritual” and that is it totally bypasses the shadow- it’s obsessively positive. There isn’t one card in this deck that isn’t positive. An oracle should offer a wide range of human emotion in order for it to actually serve the user.  This is drivel. If you’re an experienced reader- keep lookin, this ain’t it.. These are energetically DOA"
"Nice card stock. Not sure how any of these words or phrases she has on here will help anyone attract anything. I got for $12 at Marshalls. Not worth it, they should be $5. The words are worthless. You can get better online. Too bad i cant return them because the package which had the label is in the trash. Id suggest dont buy. Nothing these cards say deals with manifestations or attracting anything."
A great gift for a friend who needed some focus each morning.
This is such a lovely deck so colourful too x
I love selecting a card each day to help me align with my universal message!
"It arrived quickly, and very well packed. Cards arrived with the original plastic on the box and were in excellent condition. Love them. 😊"
Thanks
Great set of cards
"Great deck after listening to superattractor audiobook, nice illustrations too"
"Disclaimer: if you are not familiar with Gabby’s teachings, please don’t judge the messages in the cards. It’s easy to call them “basic” or “too generic” without knowing the deep meanings behind them.I understand that a phrase like “it’s good to feel good” might not mean anything to some, but if you read Super Attractor, she explains the meaning of this phrase in great detail. A lot of phrases/quotes from teachings of spirituality and self-development might seem generic and basic if you don’t read and study the meaning behind them. You have to be willing to see and listen, and let these teachings permeate you. Having read the book, and being familiar with her work, these cards offer a great resource for starting everyday with an uplifting message.This deck is gorgeous, uplifting, and inspiring. The artwork is so beautiful, and the quality is extremely high! It’s a pleasure having these 😍"
Love these cards as it helps me every day to think more open minded for myself and others around me.
"Got two of them for some reason and I ordered one, the images are so beautiful"
These cards are beautiful and colorful. They have great messages on them. I love them and ask a message in the morning.
"I have always been a believer of trusting the universe and positivity. These cards were a gift for a very special friend! She loved it, only missing piece would be a stand to hold cards. Other Than that, this is great!"
"Good quality and all but i don't relate to the messages/affirmations, wich aren't very concrete, i don't rekate to them, too much vagueness and psycho mumbo jumbo. Quite Dissapointed. Money down the drain as there are much better cards out there."
Sono stupende! Oltre ai disegni bellissimi è molto rilassanti i messaggi che trasmettono le carte sono bellissimi.... sprigionano energia positiva e sono d’aiuto in momenti difficili. Consigliatissime!
"Super bonita las cartas e inspiradoras. Las recomiendo mucho. No necesitas usarlo de tarot, hasta como para 'frase dinspiradora el día' está genial. :*"
"What an amazing set of affirmation cards! Absolutely love them! Use them every day, keep them on my bed side table. Beautiful drawings too. Thinking of buying the other set, called “the universe has your back” , by same author. Highly recommend."
"I love my Super Attractor Cards . They are absolutely excellent . The quality is perfect . The artwork is lovely . The messages are empowering , positive , uplifting and meaningful . I highly recommend purchasing as a special gift for yourself or as a gift for someone you care about ."
Even though i read the description it didn't click in my head that the card would be that big. I was expecting small card like the  small one. I was going to add thr super attractor card to my oracle box of mixed cards. But now Ill simply be using them on their own.
"J'ai été attiré par l'esthétisme bien que simpliste. Pour moi ce n'est pas un véritable oracle, son atout est de proposer des phrases stimulantes comme leitmotiv. On n'a jamais assez de positive attitude. Ce jeu n'a pas d'âme mais les messages sont des petits boosts et rappels au quotidien. On tire une carte quand on veut comme on avalerait un carré de chocolat. Il ne sera jamais l'un de mes oracles préférés, cependant je ne regrette pas mon achat. Bien regarder la review avant achat pour ne pas être déçu. En plus il est en anglais, donc je me suis dit que ça me ferait potasser par la même occasion ;)"
The most inspiring card deck. I use it everyday and have now bought three for gifts for my family.
I'm actually doing the 12 steps programme & working through this excellent book. It saved my life.
"Bought as a gift, nice hardback book"
A very interesting book and one that has been a useful companion.
Great quality
Great!
"Brand new, and arrived early too, cant wait to read, thank you"
Great and quick delivery but do read the info - this is a reprint of the original edition...not an original as I'd thought.
This book is a must for anyone suffering with alcohol addiction.  It details why AA has became so popular and with many success stories.
The most important book ever written - to have in my hands in the 1. edition is just amazing - thank you so much
"This is a great original version of the AA Big Book. I bought it to hear what the original authors had to say. In later versions, many of the original stories are taken out, but these are crucial to the overall development of AA. Yes, this book is about the power of God - the Higher Power. AA is all about the power of God to heal. So, if you're adverse to this idea, don't bother with AA, but if you like a great healing journey - one that can be translated into any life - buy it!"
"I ordered these because I'd seen them used on YouTube channels and loved the illustrations. They're everything you could want in an everyday deck, each card inspiring your intuition. The guide book and book to hold the cards are quite large, which is nice. But the quality of the card stock itself is horrible. It's so thin that the first time I shuffled them—and I shuffle side to side, not Vegas-style—I could feel them bending. You can't just relax and shuffle, you have to be constantly mindful that you don't crease or damage them."
"What I love about this deck is the playfulness of the Tarot cards.  Every card is at the very least cute, while some are just beautiful!  I collect Tarot decks, and have over 30.  While this deck is perfect for those versed in Tarot, I would advise a beginner to get a deck with a more serious, realistic approach to the cards' representation, images, and symbolism.  This is a fun deck for ones that know the true meaning behind each card, but each card is defined as something positive.  Not all cards in the Tarot deck are happy and fun."
"I have the mini version (which is way too small to actually use unless you have a magnifying glass), and loved the images so much that I ordered the full size.  The card stock is the thinnest I have ever seen used for a deck of tarot cards, feels almost like thickly coated paper.  Will never hold up to repeated use. The book is definitely for beginners; it's very simplistic with no depth.  Art by Elizabeth Alba gets 5 stars.  I will never buy another deck published by Llewellyn again after this experience."
"Beautiful in so many ways.  The artwork of the cards is so pretty you'll want to frame it and hang it up.  The pictures are definitely a cute representation of the everyday witch.  I really like the interpretations of the cards and the quotes given in the guide book.  They make the cards very easy to understand.  The wonderful guide book has a nice bonus of something I've never seen in any other instruction books that come with a tarot deck, it has color illustrations.  And the box it all comes in is nice and sturdy.  All in all, a lovely deck."
"Exceptional Tarot Deck! I so love this deck!! The artwork is absolutely beautiful. I remember seeing a glimpse of the art over a year ago and just wanted since day one. WItches!!! Yes! I adore Deborah Blake's books as well and Elizabeth, the Artist, is so gifted! Wonderful combination. I just can't wait to delve into the book and work with this deck! Very impressed by the book enclosed, the box the book and deck are in even down to the delivery! I am very HAPPY! Good job, ladies!"
"I received Deborah Blake's new Tarot release today. One word -- GORGEOUS! Professional quality, breathtaking artwork, accompanied by a guidebook, written in a way that may finally actually teach me how to read a Tarot deck. Deborah's writing has always been precise yet whimsical, a joy to read."
"As someone with six tarot sets, I can say that these beautiful tarot cards have quickly become my favorite. I usually use one card each morning or maybe a past/present/future three card spread, and thus far in the time I've had these cards, they've been extremely helpful and accurate. I love the humorous explanations for each card and the artwork is outstanding and so very fitting for female practitioners. I may need to order a second set as a backup!"
"Amazing deck! It feels very modern and fun. It also comes in a wonderful box with a magnetic closure. It sticks to the Rider-Waite system fairly closely with a few fun little differences (that don't detract from the interpretations). My first run through looking at the cards I was a little bit torn. Then I read through her wonderfully written book, seeing her descriptions, and chuckling at her little bits of added humor. and I felt myself connecting more to this deck. Now, I adore it! If you're looking for a fun new deck, give this one a chance!"
I am new to Tarot but these cards are already speaking to me like none of my other cards have. First shuffle two cards fell free and spoke volumes to my heart. I am not looking for love or money. It said this is the right path. Rest and let others take the lead. I am good where I am. The cards are sturdy and glide against each other. Pictures are descriptive. Deep intentions in each. The set is beautiful and would be nice set out on display. Would recommend this set
I was concerned when I bought this deck.  I had read other reviews that spoke on the quality of the card stock.  When I received these I understood what they meant by how thin it is.  I've used these everyday since I bought them in April 2020.  They're holding up just fine and I'm delighted.
"My first deck and I love it. Based on the reviews, I thought the card stock was going to be paper thin but it’s actually not bad at all. Although, it may fall apart more easily for those who do readings all the time. Regardless, the cards are beautiful and the book that comes with it is simple yet incredibly informative. Great for beginners and everyone else!"
Just received this deck and I absolutely love it! I can't stop using it. I use it in addition to my Halloeeen Oracle since it is October but I have a feeling I'll use it even after! Love the artwork and the descriptions in the book are the icing on the cake! Any tarot lover needs this in their collection.
"Oh, my..... I connected with these cards right away! I’m so pleased that I got them! Fantastic book with them."
Love it & it's clear accuracy.
"Witches. Black cats. Broomsticks. The theme of this deck is special because Deborah Blake is a real witch and author of both non-fiction books and primo fiction novels about witchcraft. So, she's got magic cred. I love authors, such as her, who share their knowledge and art with a message of empowerment.As you can see, the illustrations are beautiful. The artwork tells stories. I love Elisabeth Alba's interpretation of the Tarot for the modern witchy woman. For example, The Chariot depicts our witch on a steampunk-like motorcycle. With a wand in one hand, Strength walks with a lion. Powerful! Justice holding scales with a white cat on one side and a black cat on the other. Purrdy! My Favorite? Temperance does a Vriksasana Yoga (Tree Pose). On one side of her sits cupcakes and martinis (and a cute cat) and the other side has water and carrots. YES!Everyday witches--everyday woman, I say! We all get that!And isn't that what Tarot is all about?Simply looking at a card and understanding or sympathizing the meaning in a personal way is easy to do with this deck. I love it!Surely if any Tarot deck contains magic, this one does!"
I originally saw these when someone I follow on Instagram posted a pic of his reading. I fell in love with the deck then and had to get my set. So much nicer in person than I expected. I really love these.
"Perfect deck, great book, so nice imagery, fair price, fast shipping and good quality. Go for it!"
"Cards are very cute and based on rider waite Smith designs. But the shining star of this pack is the companion book. The meanings in this book are so clear and applicable to everyday life, very practical."
I really love this set and how the book is written. The drawings really speak to me. This deck is fun and magical to work with. Plus I love the cats on each card.
Very cute version of the standard Tarot. If you are familiar with the Waite Rider deck you will find these easy to use. The accompanying book is well done and gives a slightly new perspective on the cards and their meaning.
"Beautiful cards! Absolutely was so excited to try them, but for some odd reason King of Pentacles was missing from the deck. I just bought them not even a week ago. So sad! They are a beautiful product with a wonderful guide! I definitely recommend getting them!"
The damage outside of tarot box...will review later on the cards.
"The artwork is beautiful, the full color book is amazing, and the box is perfect to keep everything together."
These cards are gorgeous. Good quality.
Absolutely loved the deck! A great deck for a beginner.
"I bought this to begin learning with, and while the images were interesting, the card quality was unimpressive and mine arrived with a few bent cards new out of the box."
Very cute. I  bought this mostly  because I  like Elizabeth  Alba's artwork.  This deck would  appeal  to anyone  who likes slightly  whimsical  decks. It follows the RWS tradition.
Love these cards
Cute cards
I absolutely love 💘 i
One of my absolute favorite decks!
"I absolutely LOVE this! Incredible readings. 100% dead on- best part!? The cards are so beautifully illustrated- to the point there is no guessing about the meaning, very straight forward and clear. Awesome. So pleased."
"I love this deck. I have no issue with the cardstock, it's perfectly fine. The book is awesome!"
Amazing cards
I like the art just speaks to me
Perfect!
Beautiful cards and book!
I love this tarot
Good quality product and came earlier than expected.
I really love this deck eveything came perfectly package definitely recommended these decks
My cards arrived quickly and they are absolutely fabulous.  I love whimsical anything and these are visually stunning. My new favorite deck! I also love the feel of the cards and they are easy to shuffle. Blessed Be🙏🏻
Very easy to read cards and I love the twist on the witches. Great book that comes with it.
I love these. I think I've found THE tarot for me. Beautiful and very accurate.
Beautiful set! Definitely good for a beginner like me.
Such a fun deck! I love all of the illustrations!
Beautiful cards. Very easy to read. I love them
Got these for my fiance and she loves them! Awesome pictures on them.
Fantastic deck for everyday use. Love the artwork!
"The Witch Tarot cards are beautiful,  great artwork!"
Very excellent deck it comes with a box that closes and even a manual with note pages very satisfied
So relatable!
Lovely cards but very thin.
Loved these cards
This is my everyday use deck! I connected with it instantly and the artwork is adorable. The deck is very blunt and straightforward! Highly recommend
Gorgeous tarot deck!
These are awesome. I got mine today. Very good quality
Love it.
"The card you're absolutely wonderful, the cardstock is just a little thin but other than that I love them! And the book is super cute with glossy pages and no Pages which is amazing"
wonderfully
Love it
My favorite tarot set! Thisnset definitely resonates with me. I love the imagery and the book is fabulous!
"Wow, the cardstock is excellent. The illustrations are wonderful, and it's borderless as well as sturdy. I love the book it comes along with, and the sturdy storage box as well."
I waited so long for this deck! It is so very charming and it reads very well. Combine Alba and Blake and it is truly my favorite new deck. Each card was arranged wonderfully and is relatable. I saw a promo for this deck awhile back and was not familiar with either of them but have really enjoyed discovering their other work to pass the time until this came out!
"This is a beautiful tarot deck with a delightful interpretation book.  The positive and lighthearted tone of both the cards and book make it a fun deck to use and an good first tarot deck. The images are intuitive so ""learning"" the deck is quite easy. I'm very happy with this purchase."
This is my favorite tarot deck to own and gift to other cat lovers. The illustrations are absolutely enchanting!
These are absolutely beautiful. I literally felt like Harry Potter the moment he held his wand.
Awesome deck! Super easy to read and the meanings are easy to remember.
Love the art work. Ease of use and very comfortable in my hand. Only thing I wish it had were the meanings of the cards in reverse. I understand the author doesn't use them in their readings but for those that do it would have been helpful.
My first tarot deck ever. Absolutely beautiful and the book was so well written! You can tell that a lot of hard work was put into this deck. Perfect for a beginner. I'm so thankful.
"3.5 stars actually. This is truly a delightful deck. The art work is fun yet insightful the book is printed in colour and on good quality paper as is the box. BUT the cards?! Why were they printed on such flimsy paper? It's barely card stock, I really like this deck but in my first shuffling I've damaged a card already. This is such a shame. Please improve card stock quality some of us want to use the deck not just look at it. 😕"
"I had my first reading from Chani 25 years ago and I knew from that moment that she had a way of making one feel seen and an inherent ability to help one to connect to their true purpose this time around. After reading this book so many years later, it is clear that she WAS born for this! So many of us are searching for ways to understand ourselves and our world in a deeper way, and to take that understanding and use it to create change. In reading this book and using the guidance that Chani lays out I felt a validation and a deeper understanding of the path I have chosen to take in this lifetime. Make sure that you buy this book today! Buy one for your best friend, your mother, your partner....just buy it!!"
"Very different approach to Astrology, opened some more doors, and allowed me to see things in a different perspective (specially regarding houses). Excellent addition to my book collection!"
"I honestly was shocked with this book. It is a nice read, even if you are sceptic around astrology"
Bought as a present and they were super happy! Great place to start off as this book breaks everything down for the ammauture astrologer
I went through my chart in one sitting! I definitely need to go back and absorb all the detail. I can't wait to take a look at my kids and husbands charts.
Unfortunately came with loads of oily finger prints and the cover paper ripped at the edges.
"Her calculator is inaccurate, all my planets are in incorrect houses... Use Astro.com to get your birth chart. This is really disappointing. What I liked most is that she offers altars to work with your birth chart, which is really cool for a pagan like me."
"Ich mag ihren Schreibstil, sie erklärt verständlich wechselt vom großen Gesamtbild immer wieder mit Ergänzungen und verweisen zu den Details.Man kann es als Arbeitsbuch verwenden und lernt beim umsetzen sehr viel. Im deutschsprachigen Raum habe ich (noch) kein vergleichbares Buch / Autorin gefunden.Man bekommt Eindrücke über die Autorin und ihren Weg, praktische Infos und auch Beispiele."
"Ich war auf der Suche nach einem Einstiegswerk in die Astrologie und bin bei Chani Nicholas fündig geworden.

Nach einführenden Hinweisen zu Beginn der Kapitel kann man die genauen Informationen zu seinem ""chart"" nachschlagen, und findet neben Affirmationen hilfreiche Reflexionsfragen. Sein individuelles ""chart"" kann man sich kostenfrei mit vielen hilfreichen Hintergrundinformationen auf ihrer Website berechnen lassen.Sehr zu empfehlen für komplette Astrologie-Neulinge für einen fundierten Einstieg in alle wichtigen Bereiche!"
Great read. I've been studying astrology for some time and found this a beautiful perspective on main chart points. I think it would be excellent for beginners as well.
"I love this book. It discusses tarot from multiple angles such numerology, astrology, kabbalah, color, etc. It has been a wonderful tool for learning and I highly recommend it to others. However, when I recommend, I also give a warning that it is full of errors, usually at least one per card. Either it's spelling errors, color errors, errors in pointing out specific details, etc, but since you're studying the cards, 90% of the time you can figure out what the author was trying to say. That being said, come on... practically every card has an error. Why didn't someone proofread this before publishing? Regardless, this book is still fantastic and I still recommend it"
"This has helped me understand how to interpret the Tarot as a beginner. It is fabulous! It touches on Numerology, Astrology, and Mythology, has lots of info on interpreting symbolism in the Rider-Waite deck and it's just an overall great resource. If you only buy one book when you're starting out this should be the one. I purchased around 5 books and this is by far the one I reach for the most."
"Bought with the Smith-Waite centennial edition (the original RIDER-SMITH-WAITE deck, I recommend this deck to learn). Fabulous so far and have learned a lot very quickly. The author is easy to understand and many examples are provided in the book. I am quite pleased.The book is not hard back, but rather a nicely bound paper back, which actually makes it nice while working with the cards and learning. (It's bound similar to a work book). Only giving 4 stars because it arrived with a tiny bit of wear on one corner. I can't wait to learn more!"
"This is the only book anyone wanting to learn how to read Tarot cards needs to buy.  Based upon the standard Waite/Rider/Smith deck, all of the cards' meanings are explained in plain and simple language.  All the symbols on the cards are explained.  Liz Dean provides many easy card lay-outs that are fun to experiment with.  I especially like the book because it is faithful to Waite and Smith's original card interpretations, updated only when necessary to make them pertinent in today's world.  Anyone pursuing Tarot could start with this book, then move on to other decks, if they want to do that.  This book provides an excellent foundation of Tarot knowledge.  I recommend it highly."
A great book for newbie tarot readers like me! I use it whenever I do a read with the rider waite tarot but it's also really helpful just to understand the meanings behind each card. I really recommend if you are new to tarot as it breaks down the picture of the card as well so you can intuitively read later on when confronted with certain aspects. There's a few pages of different spreads you can use and the major arcana have spreads dedicated to that specific card that you can do for certain isolated messages you want to acquire. Probably the best for inexperienced readers because it's very basic but also informative. It might be too simple for those who are really experienced with tarot though!
"I was reluctant to start with a RWS deck because I find it mostly uninspired and unappealing but for learning the basics, it's pretty much the first stop on the journey. So I recently purchased a RWS deck and this book to help learn how to strengthen and add a more comprehensive understanding of my readings. As a new reader, this guide is helping me a lot with grasping the basic symbolism and interpretation behind the tarot. I appreciate the tone and pace of the book which reads like a manual with added personal and sometimes even humorous commentary. All of the information is easily readable and thoughtfully indexed for anyone who likes getting straight to the point (=often me!). Probably best for beginners or folks who didn't start off with a strong foundation. It definitely shouldn't be your only book on tarot (I recently added another text that I'll save for when I'm more advanced) but I feel like it's a good starting point that can be referenced whenever you need a refresher. Definitely recommend!"
"I bought this book as a gift for a friend however it didn’t come wrapped in plastic so I took a little look-see and... what do you know? Now another one is on its way to my house for me. :) I have been off and on doing tarot readings for a few years and more recently started getting a bit deeper. I like to read them intuitively first and then look at the book if I am not sure. This book is great and I find the meanings to be more in line with my intuition than my other book. (Although many are the same or similar). Some reviewers say it’s great for beginners and so I want to know, what book does an experienced reader use?  Anyway, you can’t go wrong, it’s a lovely book with thick pages and a lot of detail."
"The book is rich if information about tarot. Everything you need to know. It’s medium size book which I thought smaller but perfect still perfect. If you’re looking forward studying tarot, understanding them, how to use them it’s all here.The cover and pages are hard paper which is a plus.It’s a must have and excellent referral instead of googling each card. You can use this as a reliant or clear doubts/ meaning for your interpretation."
"First, this book is beautiful and has the best vibe of almost any book I own. I bought the paperback version AND the Kindle version (for when I travel or just have my Kindle Reader with me). Her write-ups on each card are brilliant and offer great insight. The color reproductions of the cards are excellent and are given a quarter of a page. One of the best features, and most useful to a rookie, are the spreads she gives for each Major Arcana cards. Her section for getting started, called ""Six Easy Ways to Begin Your Tarot Readings"" in Chapter 2, offers wonderful advice and guidance. For each card she has write-ups on Upright and Reversed cards. The whole book is well written and very organized.  It truly is ""The Ultimate Guide to the Tarot"". Five Stars Plus!"
"I bought this book with zero experience in reading tarot after purchasing a standard Rider-Waite Deck. It has beautiful full color images of each card and it goes in depth with regard to the element, astrology, symbolism, suit, Tree of Life (Kabbalah) position, and interpretations of meaning (including reverse readings) of all the Major and Minor Arcanum.It also provides different layouts for readings, guides to proper procedure when reading for yourself and others, tips to learn the significance of a card’s element, color, and number and how to attune and cleanse your deck!It is merely a summary with regard to astrological associations and Kabbalah, so a more in depth text would be required if you would like to expand your knowledge on those topics."
"Great book for a beginners. It breaks down each card, shows you spreads, and very simply explained for any tarot student"
Im excited to use this book to build my tarot practice! It came highly recommended by a friend and I shall do the same to any new tarot user.
In the world of tarot books there us a lot of garbage. But Deans's book is truly amazing for all those interested in the Rider Waite Tarot. It is easy to read and provides a lot of information hidden in the cards. I do recommend it.
This book is brilliant. The pages are glossy and images clear with all the details you need to become a great tarot reader. I will read it inside out before I began.
Lots of great information on the tarot as well as correspondences. Better than I expected. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about the art of tarot
This was such a huge help in giving me a better idea of the meanings of cards. Highly recommend
I use this book all the time! It's breakdown of card meanings makes learning and memorizing the cards way easier! This book was recommended by one of my Pagan friends and I'm so glad I listened to them.
Must have if you’re beginning to learn tarot reading! Makes a great gift for those whom love the mystical side of life!
If your a beginner definitely get this book!!  It provides great examples and gives details on the drawings and what they mean. I love this book!!! You definitely need it If you are starting off.
Excellent book for beginners.Colorful and detailed review of cards and spread.Nice read.
Beautiful book!!
"Easy to understand, and great layout makes for a wonderful book. So glad I added this to my library!"
Comprehensive book; nicely  done.
"After reading about Liz Dean and her professional career in Tarot, I coose this book. Was not disappointed. I use it often along with the eady tarot spreads and meanings. Great index for quick look ups. Would highly recommend...."
Very nice book!! Great quality and so much good information.
"I love the way the descriptions of the Tarot are lined up. It corresponds most with the traditional Rider-Waite tarot, but since most decks use that basic format, the information in this book can be applied to most decks."
Love it. It is exactly what I asked the cards for. I was definitely drawn to this book.Very cool. I am not wrong much. Not bragging just saying. 😁 Please enjoy this book as much as I am.
"A solid beginners guide! I knew nothing about tarot when I bought this, and it was a great way to start"
Beautifully illustrated and well organized. Love this book!
This is an excellent guide to understanding your tarot readings.  It explains the cards very well and in a way that helps me to remember and understand the pictures and symbols on the cards.  I highly recommend this book.
Love this book very helpful. Though I found a couple spelling errors. Like the texture and binding.
This book was the best option for me to learn tarot. It's very detailed in explanation & background history of each card and card layout. I'm new to tarot & I'm still learning but could not imagine doing so with any other resource.
"This book is even better than I had imagined. It is a semi-hard cover, and very easy to read. The way the book is written, makes it so fun to learn about the different cards. Everything is neatly categorized. Not to mention the colors in this book are vibrant and eye-catching. Nothing is left unsaid about tarot in this book. I recommend this book for both the beginners and the experienced."
So much great information in this book! Very excited to get into it in depth.
"Upon opening the cover was ripped, not a big deal for my wife she just taped it, but wanted to inform others. She’s excited to read and use this particular book because of what she’s read about it. She researched the book she wanted for hours and this is the one she decided on"
"Informative and very well laid out. The full-color illustrations, lovely page design, and high-quality paper grade makes me hesitant of highlighting/marking it up like I do most reference books-- coffee table worthy. :)"
Great stuff inside
"This is an easy-to-understand, visually beautiful book.  Lots of good, basic info."
Best book ever! Tells you all you want to know in terms you can understand.
perfect for people like me that are new to tarot cards and want to learn.
"I read the great reviews on this and being an intermediate tarot card reader I thought I couldn't learn much from one MORE tarot book but I was wrong.First of all it's a larger book with great color pictures which I assumed was more for aesthetic than function.  However, I got the Oliver Hibert tarot deck which is a psychadelic play on the standard Rider Waite deck. Basically, it's a lot of detail on somewhat small cards & I can't always make out the minute details. The enlarged photos of each card in this book help me to see what all of the symbols on my cards are and what they mean. Now I feel like I can truly get in touch with this gorgeous artsy tarot deck of mine!The explanations of the cards are succinct & to the point, very nice for a busy person like me who doesn't have abundant amounts of free time for reading. Where this book is lacking in quantity of data it more than makes up for in quality of data.Also, she gives a specific tarot spread suggestion for each major arcana card. In other words use that specific card to be your guide through a spread with the energy of that card.  I've never heard of this before. I get certain major arcana cards over & over in my spreads like The Hermit.  Now, I can use this book to get down to what The Hermit is more specifically trying to communicate.This would be an awesome beginner's tarot book & I wish I had started with this one. I have The Wild Unknown tarot deck with accompanying book which has really enriched my readings & I highly recommend them.  However, that deck has no reversed meanings & I'd like to be more savvy with reading different decks.This book is just the thing I need for the next leg of my tarot journey!"
Very informative
Love the mini spreads
"Very helpful resource for any Tarot library! Wonderful illustrations, detailed and thought provoking descriptions and information."
Great images. Sturdy stock. Easy reference.
"I’m a novice and this book is super informative, I love it"
Love this book! Has been a great guide to learn tarot. Love the level of detail and the historical details that are provided.
"This book is full of information, presented in a clear and attractive style. Love it, recommend to anyone who wants to explore this wonderful system :)"
good
Great book on the rider Waite system!
Exactly what I needed!
Excellent and informative! Would highly recommend!
"Love this book, Very Helpful. Thank you"
Love this book.
Very detailed
Educational
I literally just got this book and it’s the best thing ever!!!!
"This book here is the only book you truly need for tarot reading. It goes over numerology, history, and much more per card."
"Seems interesting, easy to understand."
Wonderful book. Easy to use!
"I was absolutely glamored by this deck and was not disappointed!  From the gorgeous and vibrant artwork to the description of the Essence, Invitation and Medicine for each card assists you to notice how this speaks to what is going on in your life and you discover messages and treasures that often are hidden in plain sight.  I read professionally and the messages have been spot on for clients along with picking up the synchronicities and signs that have been occurring in their life, validates their inner knowing.  I have been doing daily one card pulls personally for meditation and journalling as I like to work with the light and the shadow.  Today I pulled the Spiral, read the Essence and Invitation but was drawn to it's Medicine.  Create or walk a Spiral, slowly for at least three turns. When in the center, offer to the Earth feelings or situations you no longer want in your life.  As you walk back, feel renewed and energized for your journey forward.  If you can't physically create one, you can find Spirals or Labyrinths online and in Pinterest to spiritually walk too!  I highly recommend this deck!"
"I've been using this oracle deck for about six months now.  I didn't want to write a review until I felt comfortable with the deck.  I use this deck and another one almost daily and I find that when I ask for guidance and wisdom from Spirit, my answer from both decks will often use the same wording or have the same meaning, and is often exactly what I was just writing about in my journal.  I find this both comforting and confirming that I am on the right track.  I have also found that these cards sometimes point out where my thoughts or actions need to change - the challenges (""the medicine"") are always appropriate to my situation.  I have gotten so much out of using these cards.  The artwork is beautiful and appealing.  I highly recommend this deck!"
"I love love love these cards!!!They are gorgeous! The card stock is really nice, it feels really silky and sturdy. Sturdy as in it feels like it will stand up well to use not sturdy as in stiff and thick.The included guide book is a wonderful reference. It has an overview and then a meaning for if the card is right side up or upside down.The size is a bit big if you have small hands but not too bad.It comes in a nice quality larger box with a magnetic closure. There is the guidebook and then a smaller box with the actual cards in it. You can take everything out of the box easily with the attached ribbon. There is a ribbon inside the card box as well.The little bit that I’ve worked with this deck, it has given me goosebumps it is so on point.  It’s very complex as well as being simple if that makes sense. It’s easy to understand at first then there are so many layers to explore.Like I said before this is a gorgeous set. The only downside I can see is that the guide book is so much bigger than the card box so it’s not as easily portable. I guess that just means I need to get more proficient so I don’t need the book!I also have her Widsom if the Oracle deck and would be hard pressed to pick a favorite."
"First of all, this deck is GORGEOUS, it came in perfect condition, all cards enclosed; the artwork is absolutely amazing, but I do have a few complaints...A lot of the cards 'meanings' in the guide book are almost completely the same-- just with different wording.. the descriptions are also filled with lots of fluff; and I'd prefer it more condensed.I feel the artwork has little connection to the meanings in the guidebook.I tried the recommended 4 card spread in the front of the book, and the cards just.. do not match well at all for it.. ""the card on the west is what needs to die inside of you"" and I get ""the rainbow"" which is all about spirituality and chakras... So essentially my first time using that spread it seems my cards wanted me to quit spirituality and give the cards a rest..Honestly though, if I create my own meanings for each card someday, I would love to use it as the card quality and artwork is beautifully crafted.. but I think I'll rest on this deck for a while."
"I once cared for a man who is a bad boy type . My intuition kicked in by having me smelling  him in my or his dog  in my when I wasn' t with him . I felt crazy by this and thought maybe I should stick it out ?After I walked away, I found out that the smells where messages telling I was on the wrong path. This set is a replacement  - I anticipated all afternoon - I smelled someStrange Floral like - When the Oracle arrived I realized it too smelled strong and similar..as I opened the box  I was like ""Whoa and WTH!""  I later reading the book it STINKS ! had my stomach feeling 😷. All put away and out of my room. Found out the original order arrived and my boss says the box smells strange.Of  my room .. I'll have to send these back.. As they aren't for me? perhaps ?  The book is the worst - As I was reading reviews .. I don't see any other complaints as to odor .. How strange and Sad 😭.. I like the cards .  I just found out that my original order was received at work and my boss said the box Stinks !!!Cards are Great .stock paper too! I don't agree with the book's 'descriptions. I actually used my own intuition on them prior to reading -as I do All my cards . The book for me doesn't relate . It's an Oracle so use how it resonates with you!  . My hands are short and thickish .. one thing I leaned about shuffling .. You cannot  adapt any method . I uses several based on my feelings and the cards. So Hogwash to those who complain about the sizes. Being a reader require to adapt . That simple."
"Colette Baron-Reid is always giving so much, the value is so much more than the cost. The beauty of this deck is amazing. There is so much incredible detail and energy to this deck. Even the presentation when you open the box is mindblowing. You can feel the care and love put into every single facet of this deck. The artwork is amazing.  The guide book is larger and sturdy, and opening it and reading about a card every day deserves a larger sturdy book! The energy in this deck is off the hook! I immediately connected to it. Just gazing at the artwork on a card has it's own message, before you open up the guide book and read about the meaning of the symbols or message of that particular card. The deck is based on old ancient indigent symbols, and it is universal to humankind, these symbols take us all back to our heart in a language all of our ancestors would understand, and our Spirit spark can relate to as well. I am having so much fun learning and working with this deck. I love this so much. I find this deck to be very direct and honest, like an ancient one speaking directly to my soul, telling me the messages I need to hear, in a way that I can hear it. This collaboration with Marcela and Alberto is a tremendous gift, their expertise comes through, and I can only say wonderful things about this deck! Thank you, Colette, for a fantastic beautiful portal to Spirit, this incredible, eye opening deck. Yes! Everyone could use this deck!"
"First, I would like to say that I have been reading cards for a very long time. I typically use my favorite deck, despite the many I have. But this deck is so powerful! I can feel myself tapping into a vast energetic collective that is just empowering. Every card gives me an energetic path to healing & karmic release. I can feel a depth of guidance & Beings supporting me w/ every pull. So beautiful! I love, love, love these cards! Thank you to those who created them. They will definitely be part of my healing & energetic work."
"ALL of Collette’s decks are wonderful, but this one is AMAZING!!!I can FEEL it somehow. It really speaks deeply to me and I get this sense of “knowing” when I do the readings. More so than usual.  I’ve liked the old Avalon best, (and Post Cards) but this is my new fave. I have them all except the good tarot which I gifted to a friend.This deck is pure magic!!!"
"I felt a pull towards this deck so I purchased! It’s really beautiful, and the vibe is spiritual and honest. Based around the sacred symbol, before their were words. It is also based around Native American culture and beliefs, and Native American beliefs resonate with me the most out of all “religions” or beliefs. If you listen to what these cards need you to hear, I think that growth is possible. I recommend journaling after each card pull, using what messages were revealed. This way, you can relate it back to your current situations and find the connections. They are there, they always will be. I also recommend the Starseed Oracle Deck (the pastel one by Rebecca)"
I absolutely love the artwork of these Tarot cards!!! The packaging was very nice and it was very fun opening it. I couldn’t wait to see inside. The cards are sturdy well-made and almost flawless. Only one card had a corner bent but in one way I was happy to see it because it gave me a good idea on how these cards will handle overtime and I’m confident they will endure a great deal before I’ll have to replace them. Overall I’m very excited for this purchase. I felt a great connection especially to the artwork and just the overall vibe even from the author. Great purchase if you ask me.
"These are the MOST BEAUTIFUL cards. My heart was beating out of my chest when I opened the beautiful box. Their presentation is just gorgeous. I felt them immediately. Cant wait to use them and building up more energy with them.. Thank you Colette, Alberto, Marcela and Jena. You've really outdone yourselves!"
"These cards are epic...each one is it's very own work of art! There is so much detail, beauty, symbolism, mysticism, and magnetism in each card. This is the first deck I have found that makes sense to my way of reading. In a trance state, gazing at the cards the information just comes, all the clues are there and the guide book is succinct and masterfully supportive."
"Beautiful.  This deck clarifies beyond the usual Tarot, opening ways to react to a situation.  I highly recommend it."
These cards are a must have.  The artwork is so beautiful and deep and the message/medicine is potent.  I use these cards every single day.
Where do I begin? The most impressive deck I have ever worked with. Ancient wisdom abounds here. The artistry is beyond impressive and so true to the actual Shamanic Wisdom in many ethnic societies around the globe. Your purchase of this amazing deck will be a brilliant decision. Enjoy!
The artwork is beautiful and the cards really make you use your intuition.
"I love, love, love this deck. The art work is stunning and it s fantastic for readings!"
This is in my top 3 favorites for decks. Beautiful images with clear messages that stand out.
My favorite so far.  I absolutely love them
The artwork is beautiful! The message each card has is insightfully detailed. The box they come in makes you feel like you are opening a treasure chest. I love working with these cards.
My GO TO deck for my own readings!
I love these cards. They are well-made and absolutely beautiful. The guidebook is a great size and the messages contained within inspiring.
"amazing, Love it"
Loving these cards.
"I have several other wonderful decks of cards by Collette. I love them all but this deck, the Mystical Shaman Oracle Cards are very special. They are not only gorgeous but resonate in my soul. I simply love them."
Great addition to my oracle cards!
"The art work on these cards are so amazingly beautiful, and once you delve into using them you will absolutely feel the authenticity and connection to indigenous culture .... these cards are truly a work of spirit"
"Wow, this is such a beautiful set of cards. It is very obvious this was a labor of love creating them. I am excited to use them."
I love this deck.  ive been using them for about 6 months and they are my new favorites
These cards speak to my soul! I love them!
"I am an Enneagram and typology consultant and this is one of the best books I've read on The Enneagram. Chestnut is at the cutting edge of exploring and explaining the elements of this system. I recommend it over most others for both beginners and advanced learners. Beginners will find her general descriptions of the types enlightening. Many advanced learners will be exposed to in-depth analysis on what ""subtypes"" really means in a way that is not usually addressed, except by Naranjo in works that aren't generally translated into English.The territory of the subtypes is explored with impressive nuance and compassion (an issue which famous Western teachers have ignored or been so excruciatingly general about so as to almost be useless, including-maybe especially--Riso and Hudson). Chestnut has a true gift for writing, as well. My only issues are that, here and there, she uses quite unflattering (bordering on insulting) descriptions of a few subtypes, which doesn't feel all that useful and is not in line with what I see in real life, Two or three times, it can be as if she is only concerned with the bottommost levels of certain subtypes, or that she might have a couple of biases she's not accounting for. That's a problem, but it doesn't ultimately make me think less of the book or the book's importance."
"This book provides some very helpful points of view on the enneagram.  The discussion is well-organized around the nine basic types and the esoteric structure of the enneagram, itself.  These types are considered as arising out of archetypal patterns of responses children might have to their environments, especially with respect to making adaptations for survival that are irreversible and carry into adult life.  These adaptations have a shadow side of human characteristics that cannot be adequately incorporated in the survival strategies.  Dr. Chestnut discusses all of this remarkably clearly.  It is relatively complicated by the dynamics of the enneagram.  She is very interested in discussing how we can grow as human beings, given our natural, often adaptive, survival strategies.  Each enneagram type has three subtypes (hence a total of 27 subtypes) based on whether our mode of adaptation focuses on a more solitary orientation to life, a more social orientation, or an intimate intersubjective orientation.  All of this is discussed in a way that clearly shows how the 27 subtypes can help us to understand human behavior.  The book represents a considerable achievement, and is especially to be recommended if you have some knowledge, already, of the enneagram.  I would have liked to have seen a fuller treatment, especially of the wings, but the author has done an excellent job with what she does consider.  There is an even more complex side to the enneagram, and this relates to comparing the types in pairs, such as comparing type 5 and type 6.  The author gives a presentation of these 36 comparisons in an appendix.  This is extremely helpful for roughly identifying your type, if you do not already know it."
"First: if you are unfamiliar with the Enneagram, buy this book!! Strange symbols and language aside, the Enneagram is a great tool for self-discovery and understanding, and totally changed my life. It gives you words to solidify your hopes, motivations, and fears, and helps identify practical areas of growth based on you function differently than others. So worth it!!Now for my actual review! This is a great ""textbook"" for those exploring the Enneagram. It has very detailed analyses of each type, with additional information about instinctual variants that I found truly helpful. Chesnut gives an objective and informative introduction to the Enneagram's admittedly complicated format, clearly explaining concepts such as growth and regression paths, type relationships, and archetypes. It even includes a section for determining how various types are mistakable for each other, and what the core differences are. Definitely something to add to the collection!!"
"This is the third book I've purchased on the Enneagram, and I've definitely enjoyed it the most - however, I wouldn't recommend this book to beginners. If you're new to the Enneagram, I would start with Discovering Your Personality Type by Don Richard Riso and Russ Hudson, which includes the Riso-Hudson Type Indicator - a pretty intensive test to determine your type - and a brief overview of the 9 personality archetypes. The Wisdom of the Enneagram is an excellent book for a more in-depth understanding of the personality types.I ordered this book when I found that Riso and Hudson's books weren't giving me the depth of understanding that I wanted. Beatrice Chestnut's book builds off what Riso and Hudson do in the Wisdom of the Enneagram, but goes much more in-depth. If I didn't already have a lot of background knowledge, I might not have enjoyed this book as much as I did. I especially appreciated her examination of the subtypes, which she explains in great detail, and her explanation of the counter-types. Overall, an excellent read and purchase!"
"I am not a novice with Enneagram and far from advanced. My interest is purely personal and practical . I did find this book very detailed, thorough and extremely useful to me for personal growth. She covers both the characteristics of the nine types along with a lot of information on how the instinctual sub-types (self-preservation, social & sexual) specifically impact each type.This book is much more than an overview and digs deep into each type and sub-type. Packed full of of good, practical information/suggestions on growth paths specific to each type and sub-type.I feel this book is well worth the money and time. I've read and re-read the sections on  my type several times."
"This might be the best book on the Enneagram that I’ve read. It is thick, so should probably be the second book someone who is picking up the Enneagram for the first time would purchase. The content of the three subtypes for each of the Nine types is exceptional. I will return to this repeatedly. After a primer/intro book, like Cron’s or Rohr’s, this is a must-read."
"I so appreciate Bea's thorough and insightful approach to teaching the Enneagram through this book.  I've studied the Enneagram for almost a decade, having worked with several different teachers.  My personal perspective is that Claudio Naranjo's understanding of the 27 subtypes, which Bea aims to elucidate in this book, is a critical aspect to the model that many other Enneagram teachers have thrown aside for more simplified approaches to the 27 variations.As a devoted student of Claudio Naranjo, I see Bea's book as a great honoring and celebration of the work of this primary innovator of the Enneagram, and as an executive coach, it has become one of the only Enneagram books I invite my clients to read."
"I appreciated the depth to which the author goes in this book, but I think it is most useful for counseling professionals. It is a bit tough sledding for ordinary folks because of the use of a fair amount of technical words and a dense writing style. Still, I will probably dip back into this one a lot looking for the fine details, which easier-to-read books had to choose to leave aside."
"Beatrice Chestnut's book is the best Enneagram resource out there, even all of these years later. I can't count how many times I keep going back to this book. Chestnut adds depth and nuance to a system that has created caricatures of the nine types. It's the perfect book for those who haven't seen themselves in the standard depictions of the nine types. She takes the piecemeal work that Naranjo had and makes sense of it and makes it intelligible for us. Now that the whole Enneagram world is starting to look at instincts and subtypes, it really shows how far ahead of the curve she has been all along. Also really happy to finally see her teaching online!"
"With this book you will realize you are not broken. Maybe you've spent your life getting therapy, and reading self-help books, yet are no better for it. That's because your type has everything to do with how you can grow. Working to improve yourself without the Ennegram is like being a handed a tool to build with, where you have a 1 in 27 chance of it being the right tool. If you study this and remain open and honest with yourself, you will become the version of yourself you've always wanted to be."
"Read this if you are ready to put in the effort to make some powerful changes in your life. I was surprised at how readable the book was and how relatable. The personality types are real and helpful, and it is relativly free of psycobabble and new age  gibberish. Just clear, concise ways to understand  some deeply ingrained patterns you have that may no longer be working for you."
"This is the most articulate, insightful book I've read on the Enneagram. Chestnut so clearly describes each type and then breaks them down into three subsequent subtypes. It's fascinating to see how different the countertype subtype can be from the other subtypes. I also thoroughly enjoyed the appendix which compares and contrasts each Enneagram type. If you love the Enneagram, this is a must-have."
"For enneagram lovers this is the book to go. It has an easy language but it’s very complete, going through each one of the subtypes. Really good!"
"As other reviewers mentioned, this is not a book for those unfamiliar with the Enneagram. I specifically bought this book for the extra detail, in particular regarding subtypes. Overall, I found the book helpful but not exactly engaging. Hence, the reduction in star. I am a self-preservation one though so I am bound to have at least one complaint. :)"
I was looking for an introduction to the Enneagram.  This book was very informative and concise.
There is a ton of information packed into this book. I'm reading it slowly allowing all the insightful tidbits to soak in.
"If enneagrams are your thing, then this book is for you.  It provides a deeper understanding of personality types and tendencies to aid your understanding of yourself and others.  A good reference document as well."
"So chocked full of information, I just ordered the audible version to listen to in the car."
Best enneagram book for learning about your type! The three instincts aspect to the book is especially helpful.
"If you are into the Enneagram, this book is so detailed!  I had mis-typed myself and got some serious clarity with the sub-types and how to work for improvement to my specific sub-type."
"The Complete Enneagram: 27 Paths to Greater Self-Awareness is a classic.  It goes far beyond just the nine basic enneagram types; it includes the 3 subtypes for each basic enneagram type.  Well written, not too academic.  Enjoyable and educational."
"Bea Chestnut has made an important contribution to our burgeoning Enneagram literature.  I find the book to be readable, practical and have a depth of perception most useful to the study of type.  Thanks to Bea for this great resource"
Amazing!!
The most psychologically astute enneagram guide I have encountered.  And easily the most complete and intelligible guide to understanding the instinctual subtypes. There is also a very helpful appendix included to differentiate between each type. I've read a lot of books on the enneagram and this one is a must have for anyone looking into the enneagram from a beginner to a long time practitioner.
Excellent!!!
Satisfied life is good reading this book✨
Good book on subject. Not the best but not the worse book on the subject. There are parts of this book that unique and helpful. I use this book as reference often. Buy it.
"Very thorough discussion of the personality types and subtypes, irelatively easy to understand."
"For all of us who know by experience that mastering the Enneagram is an illusion.. The Complete Enneagram is however a step towards a new depth in understanding ourselves (and hopefully others). Thank you, Bea for putting so much of you into this great work, Patricia Weijzen Peters"
Not what I was expecting. Can't say it was bad-just didn't appeal to me.
"Psychology fascinates me, but I had never heard of The Enneagram until last month, when I happened to be seated next to Beatrice Chestnut in an extremely crowded San Francisco cafe. I overheard her say ""book,"" ""agent,"" and ""Amazon,"" and simply couldn't resist asking her what she had written. She graciously told me about this book and her new title, ""The 9 Types of Leadership."" Convinced by her manner, I bought both books. For me, ""The Complete Enneagram"" is a whole new way of looking at personality. I was a bit skeptical at first--the concept sounded somewhat esoteric and also complicated, with a lot of material to wade through, but Chestnut's clear writing and explanations made for a quick read and--even better--a concept that makes sense and rings true. This book is very thoroughly researched, and includes many types of examples--interviews, diagrams--for a complete view. I found the psychological insights revealed in this book to be quite dismaying, because the Enneagram hones right in on what we need to fix--the patterns that tend to hold us back. Fortunately, Chestnut follows through with a strong path to improvement and greater life satisfaction. Well done!"
This work goes through all the Enneagram types. The book was useful but is a bit to work through given the repetitive nature of the book's structure. It also has a good comparison of the different types as an appendix. I appreciate that the headlines underneath each type provide a good outline of the different major points for each personality type. The only topic it doesn't cover is what each type looks like at various levels of high and low function.
I really love the way this book is put together.  It really helps you do the deeper work.  Thank you Beatrice for your work.  I bought the audio and the paperback.  I use them both!!!
"I love this book. It is such an eye-opener to understanding myself better, as well as my husband, daughters, siblings, parents,  friends, co-workers, etc. third time I’m rereading it."
"What I thought was going to be an interesting probe into psychological archetypes ended up being a bunch of foofy hocus pocus. There were some good insights. Unfortunately the appeal to the authorities of mathematics and ""ancient wisdom teachings"" destroys all credibility."
Best text I have ever read on the enneagram. I keep buying it and giving it away to friends and family.
"Thought provoking, insightful. Lots to learn. Love reading it. Will post another review when I've finished"
"I liked very much this book , indeed .Especially the summary descriptions of the subtypes( that is the best available source in English to date , but still limited compared to Naranjo's own book 27 Personajes and his other books and workshops , and especially to his intention and project , as far as i know , of writing a book for each type , going very deep in each subtype ) and , most of all , Chestnut's view on the arrows .Really makes sense . Also her correspondences with Homer's Odissey and Dante's Divine Comedy are very good and interesting .I wrote myself an article , associating the enneagram with Jesus' public life as a model of the stages of the spiritual-hero's journey,  titled ""Enneagram , Jesus and the Way "" that is published at Mrs Victoria LePage's website .  .I think this is an use of the enneagram that must be better developed for  spiritual seekers of our times . I've been studying the enneagram for 17 years , 10 of wich in the SAT school ( i'm from Brazil) .I'm no longer associated with Prof. Naranjo and SAT , and i've been teaching the enneagram for some 4 years now in my own way .But , i could see in Chestnut's descriptions of the subtypes almost verbatim quotations of  Prof. Naranjo's books and lectures ( not always with the references , especially the material related to his last book on the subtypes , in Spanish ...) . I wrote Almost Complete on the headline because i'd like very much to read the author's take on the wings , for example , more extensively , and on the Holy Ideas ( she exchanges the virtue of E3 , Truthfullness-Sincerity, for the Holy Idea , Hope , without explaining why  and doesn't mention the other Holy Ideas ) . Chesnut gives some very good descriptions for the ""crazy ideas "" of each type on the fixations, but , oddly , doesn't give the fixations proper and clearly for each type , only in the case of E3 , where she mentions ""Deceit"".  Also , i thought that her descriptions of the types tend to the politically correct , like calling Eights ""Undersocial"" , instead as Prof.Naranjo himself does , as Antisocial ( with its DSM correspondent characteristics ) .I think a more complete description would also include the more pathological traits of each type , the lower tip of the spectrum of consciousness for each type , the highest being exactly the Holy Ideas .And , in that sense , i also missed living examples , both from history and literature ( or movies ) .The descriptions tend to get too abstract , i think , without personal examples ( Specifically for example , i prefer ""Family"" for the Self-Pres 7 , instead of Ichazo's "" Defenders of the Castle"") .Chestnut mention few examples , like Marx for the Social 8 , but with the proviso of "" very likely he was a social eight "" , but , after reading some biographies on Marx by Prof.Naranjo's request and suggestion , and discussing that with him personally very much , and after all we know about Marx , that would be ""very certainly he was a social eight "" . And that's true to all other subtypes .Perhaps , again , a certain american tendency to be politically correct . So , for all i wrote above , Almost Complete would be a more HUMBLE title , i guess ...Anyway , that said , it is a  good book and i hope it gets translated into Portuguese , so that i can indicate it to my students .Best wishes , João Cláudio"
"“The Complete Ennegram”, by Beatrice Chestnut, is the most complete book that I have found on the Enneagram. It covers every twist and turn in discovering your true personality. I am enjoying this journey, and this book is leading me, well."
My favorite enneagram book. Very thorough and has a great deal of useful information. Well written. Well organized.
"Great cards. There are so many, which makes them hard to shuffle. So I shuffle in parts and then fan them out. I love that they have both light and shadow attributes for each archetype."
I purchased the archetype cards to help with building characters and I got so much more. I got some insight into myself. Please read the book that comes with cards. It helped a lot.
6 cards are blank but it’s just a printer error. All the cards are here. I went through each one! Looking forward to working with this deck!
"Nice card set. Quality. I've always enjoyed Carolyn Myss' work on the archetypes, but somehow have never been able to recall more than maybe a dozen at a time, and with effort. I bought these cards almost as flashcards, but they're made to be used in throws as prompts of a needed Archetype, and this makes Myss' concept useful to me in a deeper intuitive way. Her Light and Shadow Attributes on these cards makes the positive/negatives aspects of any archetype easier for a person to identify and understand about other people and themselves. Helpful and fun."
"I am a Reiki practitioner and bought these after attending an archetype workshop. The artwork on the cards is really nice and it was fun going through them and picking out the ones that fit my personality and friends' personalities. You can lay the cards out in front of you and get a clear picture of your archetypes, and the little booklet that came with it to describe each card was really helpful and interesting."
"Best used with her book, website or workshops.  Very limited information on the cards themselves but good for prompts and reminders.  Does come with a small booklet with the basic information to help you identify your 12 archetypes."
ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS cards!!! Quite beautiful!! Amazingly accurate and totally relatable. I highly recommend to all readers!!
A valuable tool in my card-reading toolbox! LOVE this deck and the psychological depth of insight it adds to Tarot or other oracles during a reading. I appreciate the work the author put into developing this deck. Many kind thanks!
"Whether you are a counselor, therapist, psychic, or are exploring your own interior landscape, these cards will help you move past superficial analyses and solutions to the core!Inspired by Carl Jung's psychologically rich concept of archetypes and the collective unconscious, this deck describes the positive and negative characteristics of 80 elements of the psyche which transcend culture and time, which are, in a word, universal.Just thumbing through the cards filled me with goosebumps as Ms. Myss showed me positive or negative characteristics of elements of my own nature that I hadn't recognized till now ... elements that I have been struggling with as negative, or depending on as positive, without seeing the opposite side and allowing them to operate three dimensionally in my life.These cards can easily be used for formal readings, as with the Tarot, or by simply pulling a card to see what archetype is working in a particular situation ... they are as surprising and inspiring and downright useful as the Creative Whack Pack, and as easy to use, because all the information you need is right there on the card!If you want to hone your abilities to reach profound psychological depths, go straight to the shopping cart button ... do not pass go ... do not collect $200!"
"The guidebook is lacking, IMO. Its just too brief. While its helpful in understanding the archetypes, its more like a flash card deck to learn them than anything."
"I have not figured out yet why they created cards and just did not put the information in a book. Maybe I am missing something. I like the information given, its interesting but a book format would have been better."
love these
Excellent!
good
"beyond expectations, really. excellent work packed on a few cards. of course not extensive, is not a book. good for coaching purposes"
Beautiful cards and perfectly sized.
Beautiful deck
"I got these cards because a friend of mine showed me hers and i really enjoyed going through the process and comparing cards with my wife and friends .My only complaint is that I wish they had more specific archetypes that came with the set. They talk about other types that are similar, for instance there is a Mediator card, and the book tells you about the Diplomat card but it isn't included  Other than that they are pretty good"
"I really like the cards and the way they present various archetypes by focusing both the positive and negative sides. The problem with this deck is that the quality is very poor. The first deck I ordered, upon opening it, I immediately found the coating on few cards came off right out of the box. I asked for an exchange from Amazon, and the 2nd deck that came was the same. Luckily (thanks to Amazon's prompt shipping), I didn't mail the first deck back yet & I was able to swap the defect cards out with the first deck. So, at the end, it worked out well for me. So, if you are going to order this deck, which is beautiful & inspiring, be ready to go through some hoops in order to get it right...:-)"
"Rather useless compared to the book. If you want something to use as decoration under glass on a tabletop, great."
I love Thich Nhat Hanh and this is one of the books you have to buy from him. This not only helps you love and be present for others but truly allows you to approach yourself in a whole new compassionate light.
If only every human could read this book.
Very good guide on love and practice of love
"bought this book because i saw a friend of mine have it, its such an adorable book"
The book is full of love
"This little book is gold, reminds us of what love is and means. And it tells us in simple words how to love deeply."
"Since purchase, I have used this book as part of daily readings and will continue to do so probably for life. Great way to start the day and build love of self and others."
Great book.
"Short, sweet, to the point.  No nonsense, just practical reminders of how to actually love.  Meta meditation.  Mindfulness.  Presence.  Offering joy.  Deep listening.  Understanding."
"A lovely book - on LOVE. Not a long book but a beautiful, inspirational book."
"Great practical information that I look forward to applying. It's a little whimsical at times, but then again, so is life"
Such a good read to remind ourselves to the basic principles of love Beautifully written. Well done.Universally understood and accepted.
Short but oh so pithy and useful.  So--part of an excellent series.
"A quick read, full of important knowledge. It's helping me a lot."
"Wonderful snippets of direct, simple, wisdom."
Great.
Deep insight and a book that I know I will need to read 100 more times before I can truly practice its teachings. Read it in 2 days and hope to read it again within the week.I just bought 5 more books from Thich Nhat Hahn. His wisdom shines through in this book.
"I am new to reading the writing vs of Thich Nhat Hanh, but enjoyed this book. I will try to use several of the meditations he wrote about in How to Love. Very quick read and enjoyable l e."
Excellent book
Thich Nhat Hanh touches the heart of love with simplicity and joy. You won't be sorry you purchased this lovely book.
Thank you!
good book
I brought a copy for myself and I’ve given copies to family and friends as gifts.
Good!
Insightful.
Helps keep you calm and loving. Increases patience. Helps you think more clearly about your relationship. One of many good books written by Thich Nhat Hanh.
Recommend this book to all.
Beautifully written book. Inexpensive.
"I recommend it, small but so insightful, so much that we can change to be better, BUY IT."
Thay has such a beautiful view of life. He has a method in his teachings that opens your heart and mind resulting in spiritual growth.
"Hi, Small book that is very peaceful to read. I agree...if you reject yourself and cause harm to self there is no point in talking about loving/accepting  others. Love self otherwise you have nothing to share.  (I agree....God can love us, but we need to love ourselves first to know how to love others.) In order to help another person you need to understand their needs/suffering/desires first.  Be a friend to yourself first.  The 20 questions near the end of the book are good. Past/future generations are in us. Blame/argue doesn't help...only makes it worse."
"Somewhat trite and not in the voice of other texts of his. This book feels silly where other books (Art of Communicating, Fear), are much more effective."
Great! :)
The book goes through how we love and accept ourselves. And how we bring that out to solve our relationship problems. It is a Buddhist's view but has a nonsectarian application.
This one is worth re-reading. It imparts many useful and beautiful ideas. Thich Nhat Hanh is to be commended. And I would be mostly correct (you'll have to read to fully understand).
Very informative
"It helps me so much to understand more about love and to reconcile my own conflicts. I hope many others can read it too, especially before entering into a committing relationship."
Simply beautiful in its guidance on how to love ourselves and others.  Happy that I found these words to guide me forward!
A great soul is Thich Nat Hanh. What a lovely world this would be if we took his wise words to heart.
It's beautiful
Best book to get into Ayurveda! Then go and purchase Eat Feel Fresh....
Finally! An easy resource to help me live healthier and grow in understanding of my body! I received the book yesterday after preordering and I am already 1/3 of the way through- I am so excited to get started on some Ayurveda-inspired daily routines and to try some recipes! Thank you Sahara for giving us this wonderful book and for building a supportive community around healthy living!
"I absolutely LOVE this book! It’s a must read for all health & wellness lovers! Sahara makes it so easy to read through each chapter and absorb all the ancient wisdom of ayurveda! I’m so glad I’ve read this book because it’s truly allowed me to make changes in my habits, routines, & mentalty, which of course has lead me to live a more vibrant, healthy life! So much is talked about in this book that is intuitive — it makes so much sense when you read it — yet for so long it seems to have been hidden from the mainstream until now! I’m excited for more people to get their hands on this book and educate themselves on how to heal themselves through the world’s oldest health system, ayurveda!"
"So grateful for Sahara and this book, which I reference daily. I’m a 46 year old plant-based mama and Ayurveda is new to me. I thoroughly appreciate how she lays it all out in such a basic understandable style. Packed with information. I am working to create a loving daily self-care practice which as a mom has been challenging for me — this guide is  making all the difference. Highly recommend for anyone hoping to learn more about Ayurveda who doesn’t have time to plow through a zillion books. This is the one."
"Sahara is an amazing writer, and so knowledgeable. This book breaks down a topic that isn't so simple, in a way that's easy to understand and gets you excited about what you're learning.The book gives you recipes, oils, practices, and routines that are catered to your own body. It opened my eyes to how important it is to find out what works for you individually, and not follow general guidelines that might not work for our body specifically.Sahara is a brilliant and compassionate soul, and that really shines through in this book. Seriously a must have!"
Great book to get an overall idea of Ayurveda. Interested to know more. If anyone recommends additional reading please comment!
"Amazing book! Borrowed from library first, loved it and bought a copy of my own to refer when I need!I love the reasoning provided which encourages me to practice the suggestions more frequently. I strongly believe in ayurvedic home remedies and holistic health."
This book has helped me understand why everything else I was trying didn’t work. I’m finally in tune with my body and I know what works. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for energy and feeling great! I feel amazing now! 🌹
"I first heard Sahara on a favorite podcast,  and before the episode finished I bought this book. Sahara's way of sharing information is addictive.  this book is so informative yet simple for beginners.  the knowledge is inclusive to all,  and I share info from this book almost daily!"
Easy to follow and is information even for someone with Ayurveda knowledge.  A good resource.
"This has changed everything I know about my body, my eating habits and my coaching business. I'll never go back, thank you for your light Sahara and all that you do! 💜"
"To be honest, if you consider purchasing this book, you a far from an idiot!  Our bodies and minds [and spirits] –Sahara demonstrates– are the true gifts of life.  If you take an interest in the world’s oldest medical practice, adapted for the new millennium by Sahara Rose Ketabi, it will be the smartest thing you have ever done!"
Really excellent book for those who are interested in an Ayurvedic lifestyle. Thanks to Sahara for share her knowledge and energy .
Informative book. Easy to read and understand. Recommend for those just learning about Ayurveda.
Easy to follow...informative
I like the book but it arrived torn.
Ill review when im doneGood so far
Perfect starting point for anyone interested in Ayurveda. It was so easy to understand - I couldn't put it down!
Following Sahara on social media during her journey off  publishing this book was such a treat and then seeing the finished product was even more enjoyable! What an amazing book. I look back at constantly through out the week for food knowledge and spiritual guidance in my journey with Ayurveda! Thank you for bringing me closer to this health system. My life is forever more incredible and changed because of it!
The book reaches its goals in the sense that it gives the basics and you can go further from there... But even by itself it is a complete introduction to ayurveda
This book is so professional and to the point. Sahara is so intelligent in the way she writes and it’s truly inspiring. I highly recommend this book to anyone curious on bettering themselves! :)
Learning this new healthy life style and the book breaks it down really well
"Love this book so, so much!!! Thank you!"
This book was exactly what I needed. It provided me with so many learning experiences and simple ways to bring my body back to health which has been huge for me. I am so buying your cook book :D
This book is great for beginners diving into the Ayurveda world and lifestyle. The price is great and totally worth it. I highly recommend buying this book versus any other book about Ayurveda.
"good description of ayurveda, more yoga postures should have been added"
"I am so happy to have found this book! Sahara has broken Ayurveda down and made it so easy to understand. I’ve gotten to part 3 of this book and can not put it down. It’s actually gotten me interested in look for my own Ayurveda practitioner. I definitely recommend this book, it will do wonders for your mind, body and spirit."
Great book very informative.
Sahara's idiot's guide was so informative! It was so fun to learn about balancing my Dosha! I am already excited for her next book.
great book for people who are new / interested in learning more about ayurveda. very easy to understand and follow.
Good product
"Incredible. Easy to understand. So helpful for pretty much any health issue.  Sahara is so knowledgeable. I keep recommending this book to everyone I know. Thank you, Sahara"
I absolutely love how this book easily spells out each Dosha and more importantly has recommendations for each listed out separately. Easy to reference.
This is a great read. It’s interesting and breaks the information down really well.
Great!

   This book has completely changed me, i started looking for healthier options and this guide became my life. From the doshas to the recipes, saharas voice resonates with such power. I am extremely thankful for this lady and her book. Its easy to read but full of ancenstral and sacred  information. Thanks for the gift of your words!"
Great book tonstart your ayurveda journey
"Sahara is an amazing human being sharing her story and spreading incredible knowledge in the process. It’s so refreshing to have come across such a real and wise soul - and I’m so happy she wrote this book. I’m pretty far along in my health and wellness journey and Ayurveda was definitely my next area to tackle and apply to my own life. This book is an incredible in depth resource for anyone looking to improve their health, spirituality, and knowledge."
I am loving this book ! Learning so much ! I feel like I really connect to my dohsa ! Thanks for opening my eyes !
One of the best book I've ever read. It really changed my life.
love this book it was exactly what i was looking for and what i needed in my life at this time. 10/10 would recommend!
Love this book and the techniques in it. The first breathing exercise I learned from it has really made a difference in my daily life. I feel lucky that someone collected all this valuable information in one place and I was able to pick this book up and gain the benefit of that. Thank you!
So many of us are raised to be who others want us to be.  Dr. Sue provides user-friendly guidelines and exercises on how to align the mind and body with our soul so we can more fully express our true selves.  I highly recommend this book to anyone serious about becoming more fully who they are here to be.
Still listening...but it is incredibly helpful!! I also got the book so I can reference directions for the specific codes!! I have already recommended it to others!!
I can speed read but enjoying this enough to slow down and actually enjoy the process of writing
Gift for the wife
Love this book so helpful it's awesome that the author is who does the audio!
Well written and motivating.  Should be in every yoga and energy worker's toolkit!
"I'm really happy to have a hard copy of this book, especially after listening to the Audiobook with Dr. Sue Morten as the voice narrating her own book."
"Extraordinary reading.  Energy Codes is more than a book.  When one receives this book, know that through diligence, one's life is changed forever."
"So far, this book has made claims of healing, recovering, and basically fixing whatever ails you, even in relationships and external influences. I'm not quite sure I'm totally on that bandwagon (although I very much believe in energy healing as I've had some success with it before) just yet as I try to maintain some skepticism just based on ""nothing has worked (long term) so far"" (including yoga, acupuncture and massage, eating right, maintaining an active lifestyle, and hours of meditation... and my western medicine doctors literally gave up in trying to help me - they recognize something is wrong, but they have run out of options to help). But, this book finally is giving me new ways to meditate and connect to my inner body, self, and mind which has really opened up, I don't know, ""channels"" in which I can sort of ""see"" in which parts of my body my symptoms are coming from. I've then asked my chiropractor and massage therapist to focus on those areas and I'm actually starting to see (although minimal and slow going so far) progress. It certainly gives me hope. I'm currently stuck having finished the chapter on the second energy code; I try to implement each chapter before moving on to the next so I don't forget techniques as I'm adding on and the second one is very challenging for me. Anyway, even if all I get out of it is better meditation practices, this book was definitely worth the purchase."
"There are not enough stars here to reflect how I experienced this work. Dr. Sue Morter is one of the most brilliant healers alive today. Being in her presence is a dynamic healing experience in itself and now she has captured that essence in this powerful book that can reach everyone, worldwide. This is her Gift to us, a truly awakening experience. Dr. Sue has a depth of passion and practicality that embraces and surrounds you.I’m excited that Dr. Sue has agreed to be the Voice in the audio book. Her vibrant energy is an experience not to be missed. Her tone is a healing vibration. Get the book, get the audio and feel the bliss. She’s amazing!"
I’m enjoying the book but am frustrated that I cannot find where the PDF is to download or view. I purchased the book on audible.  I’ve emailed Dr Sue on her website but no response yet. Anyone know what I’m doing wrong.
The energy codes ?
"I wasn't looking for ""other one of those"" books to read, but it was recommended to me by my therapist, thinking it would help me understand our energies and our ""blocks"".I really like this book. I found her break down of energies and all that very easy to understand without it sounding too woo-woo or too scientific. It was a nice blend. She explains things in a different way that I really appreciate, like not seeing a block as a wall you can't get passed, but as a gap in circuitry and you just need to figure out how to reconnect the circuitry.I love the incorporation of breath work and yoga. While I haven't implemented the breath work with my yoga practice yet (still getting familiar with the breath work), I cannot wait to use it and even teach it to in my own yoga classes."
Thank you Dr. Sue for consciously choosing to be the way you are and shine your special ray of light upon us. Thank you for helping humanity as a whole shift towards the better by unveiling and making our highest self accesible with this incredible book that explains the practices in a format that is easy to follow and understand. You have translated complex matters into a systematic set of codes that will help us all experience our wholeness and live our heaven on earth.
"I love how enlightening it is but after awhile, it gets repetitive.... many stories that are unbelievable mostly because it doesn’t give much support of how it’s true. Only thing to support it being true is that these people are now healed from taking her advice. It takes much more than that for people to practice and believe in a thing."
"Kind of redundant, slow read."
"really like this audio book, great content. I am still listening to it."
I absolutely loved this book and Audible I can listen over & over And have about 4 times the book I have been over a couple of times to get a different feel about the info and Dr Sue has videos on line that I have referred to several times. So much deep important information it takes a lot to absorb Love it So grateful for all the work
Awesome methods to integrate with your higher self & release diseases.
Yoga by any other name....
Just received the book I haven’t read it yet but I know it will be good
"I have just started reading this book, but so far I find it very interesting. I think I'm going to enjoy it!"
really good book
Recommended reading
Great information.
Practical applications for healing energetically. Love it!!
Life changing !
"There are no words to how MAGNIFICENT this codex is. Every word she speaks in here is pure and true.  This book is so powerful, beautiful, brilliant and humbling and filled with an abundance of wisdom that is pure truth. You may not fully understand everything the first time you read it,  I didn't either so it's important to keep going back to it. If you truly want to evolve and  change your life and become the best version of yourself than I highly, highly recommend the Sophia Code. Be patient and gentle with yourself while reading it. It takes time to fully understand and to integrate the teachings based on where you are on your own spiritual journey but I can assure you that if you read it with an open mind and heart and embody what is being asked of you that you too in time will experience all the gifts this book has to offer.  I am a reiki master, a Buddhist ( born Muslim)  and have always had a strong relationship with GOD which was always one universal consciousness of love and energy for me but after reading this book, doing her activations, attending the ceremonies and listening to 21 Days of Green Tara my life has elevated to the very exact place where she speaks in this book. So I can attest to you with 1000 percent conviction and sincerety that what she says, what the ascended masters are teaching us are soooo incredibly accurate and honest. Give yourself an extraordinary gift in this lifetime and read this book, do the activations, choose love always and see for yourself how your life changes in miraculous ways. I am living proof. Thank you Kaia Rai and Sophia Dragon Tribe for this monumental gift you have given me and humanity."
"The best thing about this book was the excellent service by the 3rd party book seller. Right from the beginning this book had the tone of a science fiction story and although I’m open minded (even if I don’t resonate), I’m willing to consider others points of view.  This book felt inauthentic to me so I didn’t get very far before I decided not to invest anymore time with it. You’ll have to see if this story speaks to you and use your own judgment. To each their own."
"Over marketed - spent more money on marketing, talking about herself and how great she is. Almost the whole book is describing words..It's scary how many people are a sleep still and only supporting people without substance or supporting people with out reading their book.I was disappointed:(""Sophia is a very sacred word to me and should be to everyone"" o will try to read the book again soon but I was very exhausted reading an entire book of diacritics words""I then went to try to and find more about the ""great things this women is doing in life"" to bring light to my review and my disappointment and was only found with another over ""media advertised ego base- instagramer, facebooker, person who seems to spend a lot of money on adverstising and mental energy on how she looks good instead of actually being  humanitarian. With everything she is able to channel you think there would be more on what she does instead of what she is""Just a question for everyone and hopefully a serious ""code of wisdom""I'd like to see her spend a little time volunteering in any of the organizations this area has in abundance and you'll soon realize an unmistakable fact—our communities are full of phenomenal women but they are usually hiding behind from the media. I hope we honor the ones we do not see and even the Men play a role as well, but for the most part it's the ladies who are organizing to provide a variety of projects for the betterment of the community and world wide. I know for the last 13 years of my life I have dedicated myself to passing the wisdom working with children. I'd like to see Kaia RA be it the arts, the needs of children, helping those less fortunate in terms of money or health, supporting literacy programs, beautifying, protecting, conserving the area, maintaining our history—the list is as varied as the types of women who make it all happen and not having to worry about marketing it after becuase people will know. Being a leader and knowing it.. letting the river women of wisdom share your name from the MOuntain tops of Mount Shasta .. carried down those many hills, through the ground, through the sky as ran, through all life, and each body we will share your story. So get out there girl and make the world a better place with the Sophia Code of Wisdom you hold! We need it!"" To many young girls and  women lack deserving love for themselves. They were not taught by society the code of wisdom. Women are more worried about their instagram followers.. a virtual world of ""virtual goddesstry"" and what people think of them matters more then loving their self honestly, instead they are more worried about and spend most of their time portray a false sense of wisdom, truth, ""goddess"" or humanitarianism. They for sure look great and would be great clothing artists and fashion designers! They have unforgettable style and pictures but they do not portray an actual role in society as the model or leadership they make up""""Marketing is dangerous, marketing can be evil work"""
"This sacred codex offers a potent transmission of Divine Sovereignty. Since discovering the Sophia Code December 2018, I have experienced alchemy and expansion in every area of my life. Many will be triggered by the purity held within these pages (so much so they may leave poor reviews), but those with open hearts to receive such high vibrational activations will feel the same relief I did when I first read this codex. All with love."
The Sophia Code is here to support ones higher potential through self-initiating. This can be achieved through initiations with the help and mentorship of the Divine Feminine Masters presented in this book...a modern mystery school...just what I always was waiting for...no need to travel or go to far away places . It can simply be done at home or wherever you are...brilliant...
"For all of those who are giving Sophia Code 1 star, ... this book is activational in nature.  It's not going to make sense to you if you aren't ready for it. We'll hold space for you in light , until this comes online for more of you.Kaia Ra is legitimate , authentic, and a beautiful clear channel. This book is a service to humanity right now.  I did take it slow, and did the audible as well , and each time you read this you'll get something different/more out of it. You just need to take it in chunks, for some of you that may mean 8 weeks, for others that may mean 2 years. My hope is that more people read this and the light continues to grow on this planet.  For those of you hating on here, I only have to say to you - choose love, then you'll understand.Blessings"
"This book was the most powerful book that I've read. Each chapter had synchronicities leading up to it; daily.The timing of this read was exactly on my soul path. I've been unifying my field of light, and this was the next step; keycodes to activate my gifts from past embodiments.I also had a couple visitations​ from the Ascended Masters. Just wonderful."
"If you are like me, that has been trying to honestly say you love yourself, then this is the book for you. I read it in my kindle 3 years ago and loved it. I spent every minute I had reading it, but I was not ready to process it. Recently I was drawn to read it again. I was saying out loud, what does it really mean to love yourself when I began to read it again. I have connected firmly with my higher self and that was the answer. I received and continue to receive tremendous unconditional love so I now know what that is .I have for many years given unconditional love to family and the world but never to myself. I now  love myself, respect my journey here, honor it, and have compassion for myself.  I could never say that before.  Working with the feminine ascended masters is on an going process. The initiations are so powerful. They are always there to help you too.  I also have reconnected with angels that assist me on a daily basis. We are not alone, not ever, and this is a way to find our true selves and empower us to allow our higher self to live through us. I will be reading this for the rest of life. It is a living word that continues to guide me and bring me out of the illusions of my mind and human emotions.. Every time I am rereading a chapter, it is as if it is for the first time. I cannot recommend it enough.It has truly changed my life.  I have been on a spiritual path for about 30 years. Have explored many avenues, but this one above all has connected me more than anything else. There is so much power in love and there is so much love in this book for you and for me."
"I am a channel. I am as new-agey and “woo woo” as they get. This book is not activating anything of divine loving light. Other reviews that touched on how disturbingly wordy and oddly repetitive the writing is are right on point - they are definitely coded to bypass your conscious mind and confuse/bore you into a trance so that they have access to rewrite your subconscious. Some authors do this in a very beneficial way - this author wants you to buy her $444 bracelets **omg Angel numbers! You must buy this!**and get you to join her “community” (spoiler: it’s a cult). I highly suggest you read their group guidelines in their Facebook group if you have any questions about what this really is. Sadly I don’t doubt that the author’s backstory is true, and unfortunately I get the feel she may still be under the influence of some majorly dark forces.  “Kaiara” is not to blame here as she’s probably not even aware of the manipulation. But protect yourself, trust your intuition on this one, and hard pass. If you’ve already started, rebuke these beings, break out the sage and tiger’s eye, and you’ll be fine. Just remember you don’t actually need anyone else’s activations or guidance to do any of this."
"To me, this is like a new bible for today’s ascension times. It rings of Truth throughout. In using the wisdom imparted within, Ive advanced in less than one year from a place of separation, shadow domination and suffering to now a place of increasing peace, prosperity and serenity, something I soooooo longed for but hadn’t yet realized. Today I’m in a group of women who read a chapter a week and call upon that weeks’ Ascended Master to guide us individually. It has really really helped as reach Keycode is accepted more and more fully within each time. Highly highly recommend."
"THIS IS A MUST READ!!! More than a read - it's a Sacred Ceremonial Reading that will support your Spiritual Freedom, Sovereignty, and Victorious Life! I have had the Honor of sitting with Kaia Ra in person and this Transmission is the REAL DEAL! The Sophia Code jumps off the Book and Activates your Heart. I have cried many tears of Love while reading this. As a MAN on this Spiritual Journey - I can Open my Heart to the Feminine Christ Rising in my own Heart with this Transmission. This is the BOOK of the HOUR for Humanity to cross the threshold of the Golden Age of Miracles. Thank you Kaia for your Courageous Lioness Heart to share this Intimate Journey of the Sacred Heart with the World. Love you! 1ove <3"
"This is a great book if you are wanting to get direct channeled guidance from Divine Feminine Christ aka Sophia! I love how there is a chapter dedicated to each Divine Feminine Ascended Master. The story telling is quite powerful and impactful. I did feel myself becoming more aware and increasing my power as I read it.NOTE: if you have issues with Jesus or Christ, then some of the chapters will trigger you. I took what I needed from the book and that felt like it was worth the money."
"I can not recommend this book Highly enough! Kaia Ra’s work is a literal living transmission of healing, and a return to innocence. It has changed my understanding of myself, my traumas and how to heal them into the Light. I also suggest ordering her audio initiations from her website. Thank you from the bottom of my sovereign heart, Kaia Ra!"
"I so love this amazing book that is for sure not a book - the word book does not even begin to cover what in in truth is! It is a tool, a tool to move beyond our limitations. As soon as I opened the package there was a flow of energy that gave me thrils through my body. So I knew then and there that this was going to be very interesting to say the least.I have completed 6 initiations now and every time I do a initiation i follow the guidelines in the book, I make a ceremony and honor deeply all that is happening and all that I am allowed to receive and shift. Wow deeply and deeply grateful that this work exists. Thank you Kaia Ra!"
"It was well worth digesting this book IMO.  I am prob 20 years older than the author and use a different language to express metaphysical aspects, so I took some time to get used to the symbology. Look at her videos too to get more info. I feel this book in my bones and my spirit is loving this."
This book came in to my life at the most important and perfect time. Every word of this book is a pure relfection of divinity. It has helped me along my journey to acension so much! I am so grateful for it and for Kaia for channeling it. Prior to reading The Sophia Code I had mentored with Isis and wanted to get to know other divine feminine ascended masters like her. This book perfectly introduced me to how I can access other ascended master mentors and download direct revelations from my own higher self. I cannot recommend this book enough! It is  truly a living transmission from the divine mother of all life.
"Oh my goddess, best book, most activating, I have so far ever read. I have read well over 1,000 books, none having this impact. It's just discovering what I've anyways known and finding my way back home. Brilliant! Eternally grateful. We are sharing this experience, which it truly is, in our monthly goddess group."
"This book is a light in the world at this time and calls forth the ancient memory within us to discover our sovereignty.  It is beautiful, heartfelt and the truth that the world has been waiting for. One of the few books that will never leave my bookshelf and will guide my life in a new way going forward. 💕"
"I haven’t finished yet, but so far am truly loving the read! It is very powerful and I can feel it as I read. If you are on the Path to your Higher Self or want to better understand existence I recommend. To those who have left negative reviews I think it’s time for you to soften a bit and open your mind, perhaps re-read the book when your ready lol!"
"This isn’t just a book, but a living transmission for the times we are in. This codex introduces us to 8 feminine ascended masters that are here to help us on our human journey. If ready, this book and it’s teaching can change life’s. I’m so grateful this codex found me!"
"This is more than a book. It is a transmission of energy and higher truth. It is geared toward the divine feminine, but that doesn't exclude men. It's about the energy of receiving grace and activating your sovereign divinity. It is a highly spiritual book that may not be for everyone. But for those who resonate with it, it is a transformational experience."
"This book contains profound Truth and Wisdom. It has layers of gifts and will require reading frequently, and even out loud, to uncover the pearls hidden therein.Saying that I loved it would be an understatement. It is a GIFT that holds a Presence that will touch a reader at any level.You just will not regret even holding it in your hands.Miraculous. Thankyou Kaia Ra for your Love and Dedication to bring this to us."
This is a powerful book with a lot of information to process. Very unique and very powerful. My only recommendation is to be reading it during almost a meditation state of mind where you can really feel what’s going on in the book and process it all. Be prepared to have a life changing experience if you have an open heart and mind. I light a white candle and read it before bed after kids go to sleep but that’s just my only quiet time lol.
"I just want say that I am so grateful that this book has come into my life. I was ready, and it has transformed my life and enriched my spiritual practice beyond what I knew was possible. Alongside reading the book, I have followed along with several of her youtube series such as 21 days of Green Tara, 9 days of Mother Mary and 9 days of Mary Magdalene, which have been so amazing and really helpful with explaining and going in depth with the book's teachings. Thank you Kaia Ra & The Sofia Code Team!!"
A beautiful book filled with wisdom love and help from far more than we ever imagined we could call upon for indeed that help wisdom and love.  I have listened to the author on prayer calls and interviews and her love and compassion for all is so clear and beautiful.  This book is a treasure for the planet and beyond.✨ 💖✨🙏
"This book doesn’t teach you something new, it reawakens the wisdom that you have always held within. I love this book and if you are walking the self-mastery, empowerment, and sacred embodiment path, you will love this book! Thank you for writing it Kaia! ✨ 📖"
"This book was recommended to me by a friend.  When I received it, I knew it would be something special, after reading the first few pages.  I had been looking to more deeply know the Divine Feminine for several years. The Sophia Code was all that I was looking for, and felt like going home.  It is the kind of book that never stops offering new understandings, new activations of Divine Feminine consciousness, as you are ready to receive them.  The Sophia Code is truly a profound and sacred text.  I highly recommend this book, if you have a yearning, deep in your soul, to remember the Divine Mother Creatrix that resides in all.  Reading it will change your consciousness."
This book is a living transmission of divine energy and wisdom from the ascended masters that will activate the divinity within yourself. I just keep reading it and my life ... and my self... keeps radically transforming for the better.
"I really don't know if I like it, as I was stopped on the first pages where it ways that if you read it, you vow and agree to buy the rest of the books and etc. etc.  I didn't like that and sent it back as that's against my feelings of integrity to demand that, asking you to agree to something before you even know what it is!"
The Sophia Code book was amazing!  I truly enjoyed reading it on my own.  I also bought the audible version of it.  It was so great listening to Kai Ra's beautiful and soothing voice.  This codex will definitely change your life.  I recommend it to everyone.  I would also recommend subscribing to Kaia's youtube channel.  She is extremely generous and has offered many of her teachings in live videos for free.  Enjoy!
"It's deep, authentic and life changing.  Finally the means of integrating the Divine Feminine without dismissing the Divine Masculine.  Bring your questions, doubts and suspicions - it's ok.  The Sophia Code declares that all beings are Sovereign and how to live this truth.  Making the blessing 'Namaste' a reality."
Reading The Sophia Code has been an mind and heart opening experience for me. The guidance and the activations were so sublime and powerful. At times I was weeping with joy in knowing that I can be part of creating heaven on earth. Kaia Ra is gifted with sacred eloquence in the transmission of this powerful and beautiful work.
"It's very disappointing to receive a new item and it comes looking like this. To a book lover this is the worst! I'm sure the book is lovely, which is why I gave it 5 stars. I'm just very disappointed in how it was delivered to me."
The wisdom of that book is eternal Truth I perceive in my core. Wish all readers to find it for themselves. Salute Kaia Ra for her bravery and willingness to manifest subtle Love vibration into form of this sacred text.
"This book has changed my life alongside the key codes in audio daily - this has gradually guided me into life changing acceleration in empowerment and stillness, courage and faith. Purpose will guide me on a wild dragon ride in the years to come.  Thanks Sophia dragon tribe team✨ Blessings Earth Angels 🙏"
It really is true that you can go into Bliss or Samadhi just hearing her speak the transmission ( I also got this on audiobook).  Amazing to be reading it right as 2020 starts. Thank you for the way you show and speak the Goddess.  Thank you!
"I feel so blessed to be told about this book. The day I began reading it, my life began to change and i continue to grow everyday based on everything I’ve learned from this book. I highly encourage anyone who is on their spiritual journey to buy this and keep it close and practice everyday. You will be so grateful that you did. ✨✨✨✨✨"
There is a lot of truth inside these pages.  I was incredibly moved.  Cried several times and will reread as part of my spiritual practices.  I read...everything.  :)  HIGHLY recommend.
Love it all.  Really powerful if you read it - especially the initiations - out loud.  Transformative.
I just finished the Sophia Code. It is a very powerful book!  I know I will be using this book as a continued guide and resource for some time. I have read and followed many alternative teachings. The Sophia Code is written in a way that is otherworldly. It speaks to me on a deep intuitive level. Please read this book for your own transformation and give it to anyone open to healing on another level!
"My boyfriend read this book and always talks to me about it, cant wait to read it"
"Amazing read, the activations are life changing! Beautiful stories, knowledge!"
"Everything that was missing in my Spiritual Sojourn, Women. The Feminine. Female archetypes."
"Wow. I loved all the powerful activations. It's an extremely potent transmission and a MUST for any Divine Feminine leader!

"A most powerful and sacred book.  Thankyou Kaia Ra for your outstanding courage, love and surrender to the holy and the sacred."
"If you are of the sensibility for this information and willing to invest yourself, I can truthfully say that this is the most profound work I have ever read.  It is written in such a way from Sophia through Kaia Ra as to affect change even by the reading.  Should you choose to work with the mentors it will prove transformative."
Beautiful book for all those who are ready to ascend.
I have no words to express my gratitude for the empowerment I have received through this Divinely guided book. Thank you Kaia Ra and the Sophia Dragon Tribe. :)
"If you have found yourself drawn to this book, trust this feeling. The sharing and divine love that fills every page is a profound gift. I have no words to articulate the shifts and changes to my awareness and heart that have happened in my world since reading this. I have the understanding that there are more books to follow. I so look forward to even more expansion and confirmation of my souls journey on this planet. Thank you Kaia Ra for doing the work and being so willing to meet yourself. Thank you."
"So glad I stumbled upon this incredibly powerful collection of insights, messages, and truths. I just loved the different goddesses and their stories that spoke to me on such a deep level."
"An amazing and powerful read that truly is from the Divine Mother. How could you feel so much love and wisdom in one book, if it were not from the Divine Mother Sophia? With love."
Another book whose time has come so inspiring to hear the stories of ascended masters in the feminine being channeled through this author. Super inspiring super uplifting transformational a must-read.
Finding this book is like finding a crystal in the dirt!  what an unbelievable help this book has been- can't say enough good things about it.  it's like my new Bible!!!!
"Excellent, well written and enlightening at a deeper level!"
Very powerful book....
"A new way of thinking and new inspiration.  It is hard to review a text on a kindle, with a book it is easier to review."
This book spoke to my heart and my truth.
"Captivating, Enlightening and transformational. This is one of those books I will keep coming back to the initiations moved me on such a deep cellular level. Amazing Kia Ra thank you for sharing your light with us🌈🌈🌈🌈🙏"
do not like the audio book- can't even get through it
I love this book it has really helped me develop spiritually
This goes out as a blessed be to the Sophia Dragons making heaven on earth. Realize yourself with the guidance of this book.
"How Kaia Ra managed to capture the essence of each of the eight Master's unique personality that make up the Sophia Dragon Tribe, and their gift of divine grace, is a testament to her powerful gift as a channel for the new generation and as an author whose time has come to shake things up in the world!This provocative gem provides the blueprint for awakening our God given inner genius through intriguing and super charged initiations that will leave you wanting to revisit each chapter over and over again.I quickly found myself in intimate relationship with each of the Masters, including Isis, Hathor, and Mary Magdalene. And what was more amazing was that I was in touch with each of their unique, individual expressions of love, wisdom and unwavering strength. I could feel the Maters communicating directly with me as they shared their encoded messages and powerful activations which have stirred within me a new sense of strength, purpose and clarity.I HIGHLY recommend this book!"
OMG. AMAZING. This book is changing my life.
Wonderful and mystical things start to happen after receiving this book. Get the physical book instead of the kindle version.
Absolutely changed my life
"This sacred text will change your life. If you are ready to wake up and step into your sovereign divinity, read this book."
An already mystical journey and I'm not finished reading it yet.
"The Sophia Code puts you in the driver seat to deeply connect with your Higher Self and thus your divine purpose.  Your life will radically change as you awaken to the truth of your being, literally. This book is magic!"
Absolutely amazing. Divinely timed and guided. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The time is now! And so it is.
She is amazing. Period.
"I wish she would have warned the reader prior to describing her childhood abuse. I was emotionally unprepared and it was very triggering to me. I was unable to read past the intro. I think it is inspiring that she has done so much healing work and is able to speak so openly. Shame thrives in silence. However, I felt like a warning was warranted for those of us who are not there yet. I won’t be reading the remainder of the book, even though she makes a great case that doing so will catapult my own healing. Honestly, that was a red flag for me. It felt off."
"This book is a powerful aide for awakening to the truth of your divinity being human. It helps the reader embrace the loving Presence of our Great Mother, the Divine Feminine aspect of All That Is, and to realize Her Presence within us.  The channeled transmissions (from Ascended Master mentors) it contains are a natural compliment to the Divine Masculine aspect; and, as such, it contributes to an awareness of our innate wholeness. It takes nothing away from our relationship with our Great Father, the Divine Masculine aspect of All That Is. They are (we are) One Being, differentiated (but never separated) for purposes of experience. This book helps bring this reality home for those who are ready to accept its transformational guidance and compassionate support.The Sophia Code is simultaneously drenched in wisdom, overflowing with love, and grounded in the very Spirit of Truth about which Jesus taught. I applaud Kaia Ra for her unrelenting commitment to live in service as an awakened embodiment of the Divine Feminine and for her devotion to the One Heart. If you are weary, this book will bring you deep comfort. If you are hungry, this book will nourish you. If you are ready to wake up to the truth of what you are, this book will change your life."
"Apparently, the book only contains the INITIATIONS and you have to SEPARATELY purchase the ACTIVATIONS for $13 each off of the site. So you are not getting a complete book but one that has a hidden sales tactic per chapter.I think that this should have been made clear in the description. There is a bit of a falsehood here ... when you think you are actually getting everything in the book (I got the audible version)."
"The second you hold this book in your hand you will be transformed. Kaia Ra's ability to bring you right back to your center and your truth is unprecedented! She embody's the Sophia Christ Light and reminds you of your Divine Genome held within your DNA. This book is an ABSOLUTE MUST READ if you are ready to awaken to a deeper part of yourself.Everything Kaia offers alters my life includng this book.I promise you, this book will change you from the inside out and you will not be the same person you were before you read it.Get the book. Emerse yourself in the energy and allow yourself to transform.Wait for the miracles, this book will change your life!Thank you Kaia Ra for embodying this mesage so deeply and sharing to the world!"
"Words can't express the power and the potency of the information that is coming through Kaia Ra. It's life changing to say the least. This book is filled with the unconditional love and wisdom of the divine feminine Christ consciousness and will give you the ability to connect to your own sovereignty, your own divinity and build a personal relationship with each of the ascended masters. A user manual for ascension on the journey of the beauty way. Prepare to be transformed. Highly recommended!"
"I think it is important to know this is not a 'read along' book. It is a Journey. A Journey to your Self. Re-discovering your divine nature and how you can use your own free will to re-connect with your Source at all times. It was for me very grouding, and created a deep self love I was longing for. The initiations are immensly powerful and have created many shifts for me on different levels. The concept of Sophia resonated with me, and the learning with the ascended feminine masters was (and is) profound. Very grateful to have found this on my Path."
Spiritual technology is a subject that I am very passionate about. I feel like this book is one of those that will make it's way to anyone who is supposed to read it.  I felt a connection on a deeper level when reading this book. It's hard to describe but one way to describe that is that there would be words written on the pages that would speak directly to my higher self. I would see codes within the words so I would often have to read the same page over and over before I received the entire transmission. It seriously helped me uplevel my consciousness. I am so much more clear about my future in the healing arts now. I am so full of gratitude for the ascended masters teachings and key codes. It took me 3 months to complete it but I savored this book. I'll probably read it again at some point. 100% satisfied with this book and can't wait till the next one comes out. <3
"I began to read this book and utilize its technology over two years ago, and I know it has been instrumental in my healing, understanding, and ascension. In this time I have become an open channel of the ascended masters and Spirit, and I use the teachings daily in my work with others. I know that the activations I began dedicating myself to played a tremendous role. It is indeed a divine codex, and for anyone who wants to open to the Divine and to the love that you are and came here for, it's an incredibly beautiful tool. I admire the courage and strength it has taken to make it available. Thank you, Kaia Ra. I am forever grateful."
"This is much more than a book to read. It is a tool for expanding and deepening your relationship to your mortal /higher /divine self and a serious crowd of multidimensional beings who are willing to assist you in no uncertain terms with unconditional love and guidance. Kaia Ra has found a way to use language as a powerful tool to transmute negative or outdated perceptions of oneself acquired thru ie; experiences of duality, social programming, spiritual disillusion, trauma ( thru many timelines and dimensions.) so that you may inhabit/remember/recognize your true sovereign  divine self. It is hard to explain how powerful this book is. My suggestion is to take it in slowly; weeks, months; let each chapter assimilate and percolate thru your heart, psyche, body, dream time, meditation, prayer. Listen in deeply, as many ways as possible to the profound beauty contained in this offering."
"The book in combination with listening to Kaia Ra on YouTube has helped me greatly. I find that working in combination was important because Kaia‘s YouTube videos and her monthly free offerings hope to bridge the gap of understanding for me.Listening to how this applies to the day-to-day world and where it evolved from as an offering to humanity was a key that has unlocked the beauty and live in this. It is a book and transmission that was created to deep in self mastery, not look to someone else to help you bridge your connection with God. The transmission is and empowerment to strengthen one Do you have the courage to connect to God, to listen to our guidance, and to stay on the path that Jesus and Mary taught"
"This book isn’t for everyone, and not everyone will resonate with it. But if it does resonate with you, I encourage you to fully commit to it and go on the journey of self exploration. This book will activate and awaken you to a different way of existence that is truest to our sovereign divine nature. Treat this work with respect and care and honor your own journey. If you are ready to change your life in a massive way and completely shift the way you think, this is the book for you.Beyond grateful for this incredible work as well as all of the other work of Kaia RA and the mystery school!"
"Interesting book but not for everyone. Very woo woo. I really enjoyed certain parts, however, it's too long. Quite dense & you'll need to break it up over multiple listenings. If you're very spiritual, this will resonate."
"The work of Kaia Ra and the Sophia Code came into my life through the recommendation of a friend at a time in my life when I was struggling on a daily basis to make it one more day.  I was in a state of deep grief, that was so deep I wasn't sure I was ever going to make it through.  Coming across the Sophia Code and Kaia Ra feels like it essentially saved my life. Hearing Kaia Ra's story, listening to her monthly prayer calls, reading the text and working with the ascended masters  has me alive again.  I am eternally grateful and very clear the transmissions in this text are essential for these times of great change. It has altered my life and continues to do so on a daily basis.  I highly recommend this book to anyone drawn to it.  There is a reason."
"This is a Great book for those who KNOW their on a SPIRITUAL JOURNEY! Not intended for those who are ONLY inquisitive!!!! ( If you do not resonate with Spirit Guides, the Divine Feminine, the Astral Realm, being Psychic or a medium, any of the elemental goddesses and so on, then this book isn’t for you.) And do not leave a bad review, for this isn’t your path!! This is a definite must have in your possession, if it is your path! Note taking is an awesome idea for remembering details to help you evolve! Namaste 🙏"
"To say I recommend this book does not feel like enough. It is more accurate to say, I will be able to have a much more genuine conversation about spiritual growth on a global scale, among my started brothers and sisters, if we all do the work of reading this text soon.  This is why I have included it as a text book in my upcoming Modern Priestess Mystery School.Instead of a recommendation it is a plea to give yourself the gift of understanding more of yourself and understanding how supported you are, even when you feel alone or powerless.My prayer is that we give ourselves the time and permission to explore what it could look like to discontinue our collective addiction to suffering. One way to start is by buying this book.I am praying for more creations of this caliber in my lifetime and my daughters lifetime. A flooding of books, films, music, media that can match the impressiveness of the Sophia Code."
"This is the most amazing book that I have ever read and it appeared at just the right time.  Reading this book 1 time transformed my life in a positive way, in many different ways.  It’s written with such higher level intelligence I feel I could spend a whole year just on one one chapter in order to fully extract all of the information provided.  I also love listening to Kai Ra speak, she has a powerful and loving presence.  I am very great full that I was able to find her work and message!"
"There is no book like this one and if you’re called to a revolutionary new way of being and perceiving to shift into a more abundant and soul-centered way of living, this guide will take you there. I cannot put it down and I take it absolutely everywhere I go. Trust your heart and lean into the love it offers you through the vehicle of this sacred text."
"I have recently started working with the Sophia Code book and the initiations, I have not ceased to be amazed. The initiations are beyond anything I could possibly have imagined and yet I find that there is so much that I already ""know"". Trully I am re-membering knowledge from past lifetimes and I KNOW that the Sophia Code is what I have been wiating for all my life in this incarnation.Thank you Kaia Ra for your courage, persistence and love in bringing the Sophia Codes to our awareness."
"This book is so beautiful and has transformed me on so many levels, I cannot begin to describe. I read it over and over and get more each time, almost like it is an entirely new text and touches me on a deeper level with each new reading.  I completely recommend it.  I have purchased the hard copy, kindle, and audio and have given it as gifts.  Going through each initiation has truly initiated me and changed me, bringing me new intuitive skills and a more blissful life. If you are looking for a portal into magically divine life changing empowerments, you are in luck, this book is it!"
Such important info in this book.
"don't waste your money. go for a daily walk. Well, you may like this I’m just going through the blahs and getting burned out on self help, mindfulness. I am believer that this works. Often you/I have to put books down and when the right moment hits it really helps. You have to want it and believe.  I find that taking time to relax, not to force this on yourself,  one step at a time. No hurry, read and reread helps repetition."
"I was really hoping for more prompts to make me think and write more. Some of these prompts are boring like ""take some deep breaths and notice your breath"". Just not entirely what I was looking for. I would have returned it but, stupidly, I didn't read through before I wrote my name inside."
Not what I expected. Goes week by week so not day by day. Ok book but you can't really bounce around in it like is says in the description.
This journal is soooooo good I don’t even have the words to describe how helpful it is. I’m gonna buy one every single year.
"Gave as a gift to my sister, who has been trying meditation lately. She was pleased with it."
Absolutely love sharing with my clients!!
This has a lot of great suggestions for things to do and be aware of our surroundings. I love taking the time to do these during my day and look forward to the next one.
A nice size book to hold when reading in bed.
I really liked this book. It’s not too much fluff like a lot of books like this are.
Very pleased with this purchase. Thanks.
"For anyone who is interesting in the concept of our personal human energy field this is THE book.  It covers many subjects relating to our energetic field from Chakras to Auras, Meridians, Theories of Existence, Chi; and much more.  With great detail and beautiful color photos and drawings it discuss the science of how our bodies are electromagnetic fields, and the subtle structures of our being.  If you have ever said:  ""I'm getting a weird vibe from that guy."" this book will tell you why.  A GREAT value (for the price) and the information."
"A friend, co-worker, and Reiki student referred me to this book. She sang it's praises non-stop. I agree with her. It even has information on chakras form Native American culture and African culture. It's very well researched."
I'm glad I didnt listen reviews. It gives as much info. as promised: it is an encyclopedia and it should be treated as such. It provides a broad spectrum of many obscure subjects that are hard to find anywhere else. I'm glad I purchased it.
I am do excited to resd this book.  It looks as if it is jammed packed with all kinds of information!!!
"Really it's a great book but Amazon deliverer left my package in the rain and this book got ruined, fortunately I was able to dry it out before the pages got all torn and I can use use it.As for the contents of this book you will not regret it, it's really an encyclopedia of the human electro magnetic biofield and sources many traditional systems of thought, so there is a huge contrast to studyI highly recommend Cindi Dale The Subtle Body."
"The ""Native American"" section contains info from known fraud put together from new age misinformation. This publication disrespects actual Native American teachings, culture and heritage."
"I received the book today. I flipped it through with excitement and got surprised. The male figures are repulsive. Pictures say thousand words. I cannot unsee those. Apparently, the author and illustrator had some other agenda beside the ""energetic anatomy"" and the ""subtle body"" thus instilling a not so subtle message. This book goes to the garbage can."
"Cyndi is truly the expert behind the energy body. I'm blown away by how simple, yet effective, her techniques are. I'm looking forward to reading more of her books! I've tried the ""Subtle Energy Technique"" book too, which I highly recommend!"
I had checked this out from my local library and loved it so much I bought it. I use it often as a go-to reference. The stand out for me was the amount of great info on anatomy & physiology as it relates to the body energy in addition to the chapters on chakra systems. This is a great book to study for foundational knowledge on the topic..
"For many years I was an arch-skeptic when it came to the subtle systems of the body, but then a great deal of personal experience lead me to do a U-turn, and for more than twenty years I have been teaching others how to feel, sense and work with these systems, with often remarkable results. Though critics still love to call this ""Woo,"" the tide is turning against them, and this book is a huge help.Any book about the ""energetic"" or ""subtle"" systems of the body will always attract a mixture of breathless enthusiasm and mean-spirited criticism. And sadly there are still some who believe that any mention of these systems is somehow New Age or occult, although there are almost one hundred cultures around the world that have recognized and discussed them, including the Fathers of the Christian Church. This book provides a wealth of well-researched evidence for skeptics and enthusiasts alike.Although you can have a look inside the book at the top of this page, and also on the Sounds True website, I think that it is helpful for a potential reader to see a breakdown of the six sections and forty chapters to get a good idea of the contents of the book.Part I: Energy and Energy Healing1.

If you are new to the field it gently leads you by the hand. There is also a wealth of information for the more experienced practitioner or researcher. Despite many years as both a researcher and practitioner of a number of methods that use the subtle systems of the body, I found a lot of new material in this book.Cyndi Dale writes well and I thought that her views and opinions were very fair and balanced. My only small quibble is the use of the word ""Energy."" I prefer the term subtle ""systems"" composed of the inseparable twins:  First the subtle energies and second, the subtle fields that carry them. Without energy, the fields could not actualize, and without the fields, there would be nothing to carry the energy.The book itself is beautifully produced and easy to navigate. I am delighted that Sounds True is producing ever more high quality books like this.This is the only book on the subtle systems that you need. It is well worth the price, and is not only a reference and textbook, but also a wonderful book to browse through.Very highly recommended.Richard G. Petty, MD, author of 

  
Healing, Meaning and Purpose: The Magical Power of the Emerging Laws of Life"
This book is a very good book of knowledge to read.  It's good to look up questions you might have about all the energy around our bodies.  This book is exciting to learn from the truth of our energetic anatomy.  I will buy from this supplier again.
"I have read this book multiple times! The information about the chakra system, meridians, and other topics is interesting, and the book uses colorful graphics in easy to understand language. Everyone needs to learn about this for self healing and general health. Energy is all around us and all we have to do is to tap into it whenever we need it."
"Incredible, very complete, an adventure in discovering information that everybody should know since an early age about the body and energy. Exiting, love it!"
"I feel the explanations are not great and really as some other reviews have stated, clearer inforamtion could be found on the internet. I do not think this item is worth it."
"The reason I bought this book was I found it in a book store and went through the contents andscanned the book and knew I had to have it.  So I ordered it from Amazon because of the price.If you are into energy, healing, the body or whatever this is the book. Just scanning through thetable of contents you will see it a must have. It covers a thorough look at anatomy and physiology andalso all aspects of energy fields, energy bodies etc.  You will learn all the energy practices.A good book."
I have several other types of this subject.  This is definitely worth the purchase to add to your library.
"If you are interested in learning more about your anatomy and the energy that surrounds us, you will love to read it.  I will not be selling this book back. it will stay on my shelf for years to come."
Wife like the book.
"The book is a general collection of some of the best known subtle energies in the world such as: chi and kundalini, with a more extensive explaining of these two main streams. I'm also a pathologist and accupuncturist in Taiwan, and my suspicious of the existence between the link of meridian points and connective tissue, this book proves my hypothesis and incredibly others have already done. There is no mention of course in western medicine,  but in the near future, the grouping between physicists and medical physicians are much needed. The era of Biophysics could enter a new age. Chapter 21 is very enlighting for western physician. Page 310 explains the Chakra development and age and the final development of the Twelfth Chakra: 49 to 57 years, this finding extraordinary match the commentary of the book ""Meditation and Kabbalah"" by Aryeh Kaplan, Page 82: The best time for the deepest levels of meditation is in old age, when the intellect is well developed and the pull of the body is weak.....This reflects the Talmudic teaching that such mysteries should not be taught to an individual unless he is ""halfaway through his years"". (This part is using the intellect to attain enlightment through the way of the 72 letters by the Abulafia system, a little different from the Provence school of the Ten senfirot where emotions are more important than intellect, but meditation dependences of the personal character to choose itw own path). It is a pity that the book ""Medicina Magnetica"" by William Maxwell is only found in microfilms and in Latin (I found that in the web page: [...]), because by using a more easy method, my guess is one could analize it in the outpatient office rather using a more complicated and expensive machine."
Came with book corners and pages bent and a rip on the cover.Looks like a great book but destroyed in packaging and delivery.
"This book is great and comprehensive-really tackles all angles  of energy work. For someone relatively new to the concepts of subtle energies, like me, this would be a great buy. Has lots of charts, and large scale pictures. Just great!"
"I found this a very comprehensive, well illustrated and well written book that lives up to its name. However, I was hoping that it would also include information on the Universal Calibration Lattice, a new part of the energy anatomy discovered by Peggy Phoenix Dubro, the originator of the EMF Balancing Technique®. Maybe in the next edition?"
Good book. Anyone into the anatomy will love this bookl highly recommend it as a gift for any med student
"This book is amazing! It has many charts for hand, foot, and ear pressure points. It is packed with so much information. I highly recommend it to everyone."
Very powerful book.
"This should be on every Energy Worker's bookshelf!  This book is designed to be an overview of many different topics on Energy Work, inviting you to explore topics you find of interest more thoroughly on your own.  It is an excellent ""encyclopedia"" on what exactly Energy Work is, citing lots of research to support its existence.  A great starting point for anyone who wants to learn more about our subtle body energy and why energy medicine works."
"Great pictures and easy to understand description.  Bought because it is required for upcoming training in Anatomy.  It will remain a ""go to"" resource."
Great book. Very well prepared. Informative. Well structured. Simple but accurate and up to date summaries for each section and good bibliography to enable further research as needed. Well illustrated and useful on that account.Great value for money.
"Fascinating book, I am constantly finding something of interest in the mind, body, connection.  Studying energy healing now and this is really interesting."
I gave this as a gift & she seemed quite pleased with the book
"Very good book. I recommend it to everyone who has no idea about the energetical anatomy. It is the abc of traditional Chinese medicine. It includes everything, but absolutely everything."
"Absolutely brilliant book.  Very visually pleasing with good, structured illustrations.  Very informative and would highly recommend for anyone working with energy."
Good read
Brilliant book loved it
"This is a wonderful book, and not the least are the fantastic amount of excellent illustrations.  It is a compilation of other people's work, but none the less is a terrific overview."
Very interesting book I loved it
It is very simple to understant the Subtle Body and the meridians.This Book is very semple and very healpull.
EXCELLENT BOOK! Highly recommend.
"Awesome book, just can't put it down!"
Excellent book covering all sorts of Energetic Theories down to the Quantum Level Recomend this on the Kindle Fire HD with its colour graphics
These are gonna be my new favorite cards to use the pictures are amazing 😍😍
Absolutely beautiful deck that really spoke to me.
Great deck but i hate that amazon dropped its price just after i ordered it :( and this is going all the way to Trinidad and Tobago
Love it.. Gorgeous.  But im missing a card. This is a stunning deck.  Ive always been drawn to it.  But I am missing a card.  Missing the STRENGTH card.. How do I get a hold of the seller to get it.  Im so bummed.
I got these cards and all of them have a beautiful and unique illustration on them.  They are very delightful!
Is very beautiful. I like the print quality.
Beautiful art work and nice booklet! My wife loved them.
I love the pictures they re beautiful. The 6 of coins and the nine coins may look the same but they aren't so you have to count and read the cards.
This deck is great awesome graphics very powerful deck!
Thank you beautiful tarot cards . I love collecting tarot cards
"Thumbs-Up to this deck, and I'm hard to impress."
Beautiful artwork but it was missing a couple cards. Overall great deck.
Excellent
"Love the graphics of these cards they’re about the same weight as playing cards so not super heavy duty, easy to shuffle."
Great buy
These cards are amazing. They are well made and absolutely stunning. Each card tells a story and the imagery is just one of a kind. Corresponds with the rider waite deck.
This deck is the best deck I’ve ever received in my life . It came super early . Not only did it come early but it also came high-grade . The cards are very nice and thick . The box it comes in is absolutely perfect . And the art work !! Stunning . I’m so ecstatic . Thank you so much !
"Card stock is nice. The cards slip a little, but I personally like that. The art work is beautiful. The booklet is very helpful. The box is nice; however, mine came a little damaged which I will just assume was caused during shipping so not their fault (I assume). Over all great deck."
Absolutely stunning amazing art work can’t wait to use it! Arrived in great condition no complaints here. Comes with a small book in the deck to explain the major and minor arcana. Treat the cards with respect and I hope anyone who gets this will enjoy it like I have.
"The weight of this deck is very nice! The cards are thicker than the ones in the Night Sun deck, and the booklet is a bit more specific."
"Christmas gift for my daughter. She loves these! She's a fan of the design/theme (loves sugar skulls,etc.)Beautiful art work! Unique & well made, perfect size!"
Beautiful art
Just got this deck after waiting MONTHS. It is absolutely beautiful. I’ve been reading cards for years and I can tell this is going to be one of my favorite decks to use. The illustrations are just incredible. I HIGHLY recommend to any tarot card reader.
"This deck drew me in as soon as I saw it online and I had to get it! The imagery is just so beautiful, and it has a very uplifting energy to it. A lot of the cards that might be associated as negative in the rider Waite deck, give me a much more positive, hopeful energy. You can look at each card over and over again, and feel more new energy every time."
Very beautiful cards. Larger than expected. Very detailed. Love them !!!
Love this deck. The images are beautiful.
very colorful. great art. brief messages. not for beginners.
I get so many compliments on this deck and it has quickly become my favorite. The art work is amazing
My wife who is into tarot cards love this deck! The art really stands out and despite me the husband not knowing much about readings had a good understanding of the meaning behind them. Definitely recommended for those into tarot!
I love this deck. Omg love it. I always wanted to get it every time I’ve seen it. I finally did and couldn’t be happier. ;)
ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS DECK! My first tarot deck and I connected with it right away. The art work is stunning and the vibes are loving!! I highly recommend getting it!!
I love this tarot deck. Amazing images. My absolute all time
Pretty but VERY slippery
One of the most beautiful decks I own
I love this deck! the cards are beautiful and quality; comes with a little handbook.
Absolutely breathtaking!
This is an amazing deck so looking forward to the oracle deck coming out in sept
"The artwork for this deck is stunning. I will definitely buy another once this deck wears down. Great quality though, I don’t see that happening any time soon"
Got these for my daughter she loves them.
"I use them as advice cards. One a day. Completely love the designs! Literally, they’re so beautiful."
This deck is gorgeous!!!
LOVE IT
"We purchased this deck and had a long wait. Now that we have the deck we went and bought another. Basic symbolism follows the RWS theme. The colors and images are both original and colorful. As much as the deck follows the RWS theme for Tarot, the deck shows plenty of allegiance to the Santa Muerte Grimoires. Bravo to the creators of this deck!"
Beautiful cards
"I love this deck,very accurate!"
beautiful deck
Wonderful imagery.
"I felt drawn to this deck and it feels right for me,  I use it all the time and I absolutely love it"
Great product worth the money!
"Bought this deck and love it.My personal Pros: Beautiful art! After saging and energizing them, I feel they connected with me quickly.My personal Cons: The cards are a little slippery because of the gloss and I'm having trouble shuffling quickly. Also the numbering to see like for example ""5 of cups"" or ""6 of wands"" etc is small and I have to bring the card closer and squint sometimes to see the little number. Wish the numbering was bigger.Overall, really love this deck and my readings have really been accurate!"
"I lost my mother 3 months ago, the greatest heart break I could never imagine. I pick this book up here and there, and really does speak to the trauma, discomfort, the support, lack there of, and what moving forward looks like. Different for each of us. And what we feel is entirely okay. Highly recommend."
I knew my mom was very sick and that eventually I would need this book.  I bought this book about four weeks before my mom passed away.  Her death was sooner than anyone anticipated so this book was there for me when I needed (and still need) it most.  This book will help guide the person in grief with what to expect and the emotions following the passing of the most influential person in the world in a child's life.  Just pick this book up.  It is a comfort manual and is absolutely necessary in this time of grief.
"I lost my mother almost two months ago to advanced stage breast cancer. I had recently given birth to my second child. My oldest was 20 months. I have two children who will have no memory of their grandmother and when she died, a part of my heart died as well. I just purchased this book and haven't read the whole thing yet; however, Elaine gets it. I finally feel like someone understands. Everything she speaks of is exactly how I'm feeling. It is comforting to know that I'm not alone and how to get through this very painful process. If you are struggling after the loss of your mother, get this book. It has been a tremendous help."
I gifted this to my Mom who just lost her mother a few months back unexpectedly. My mom seemed a bit unsure of reading it at first but now it’s a book to comes to often when she’s having a hard day. A million percent recommend!
This is an amazing book to help you through the death of your Mother. I wish I had known about it sooner and read it shortly after her passing.  It helps you understand what you are going through. I have also bought this book for family members and friends when their Mothers have passed away.
I purchased this after the loss of my Mom.  I was not ready to read it at the time.  Now at 14 months since Mom passed it have been able to get through difficult times with the soothing read.  I have been through a grief group but the ability to get a different perspective is helping
I liked how the author really beared her emotions to the point where it seemed like I was sitting face to face with her. So comforting...
Excellent book for anyone that was close to their momma. Really put together well. Emotional. I lost my momma 15 months ago. Very hard walk.
Purchased this book after just losing my mother and it did nothing but make me angry. The author is not a therapist. She does nothing but tell you her experience and some generalized info that a quick FREE Google search could tell you. I threw it in the garbage
Just started reading this and so far it is on point! I lost my mom a year ago and it definitely makes me feel like there are other people out there that understand the grief of losing your mom. Highly recommend
I recently loss my mom to cancer. She was my best friend and I'm having the hardest time in my life. This book is extremely helpful. I've recommended this book to several people that I know going through the same thing. My only wish is that there were support groups like this book. The book is great!
Your book is a Godsend.  I wish I would have discovered it sooner.  It is so comforting to know others have been and are going through what I’m going through.  This book expresses my feelings and thoughts perfectly.  It has put my thoughts and feelings into words in a way I would never be able to.  Thank you so much for your encouraging book.
Very well written.  Author speaks from experience.  The Facebook page for readers has been invaluable.
Purchased for a friend and she said it was one of the best gifts I’ve given
"Nice reading but doesn’t get very in-depth. Most of the information I already knew but still, it was comforting to read."
This book helped me extremely after losing my mother! I strongly recommend! Very helpful!
What an amazing book
Guidance
I suddenly and unexpectedly lost my Mother in May. This book was incredibly helpful in my beginning stages of grief and healing. I highly recommend it.
I cried so much but I needed this book.
It will give you the basics if you’re a novice but there are better and more detailed tarot guides available. The meanings are defined simply and are very brief. I was looking for a more extensive guide and this was not it.
"Not easy to understand and a little bit stodgy. I deleted it from my kindle, it was just too annoying. And way too esoteric. I gave it 2 stars because the information is not bad, it's just presented in a way that doesn't resonate with me."
Incomplete information.Inverted cards are not even touched upon.The spreads and card layouts shown in the book are the LEAST used variants.I doubt whoever edited this book has EVER used a tarot deck.
"Very poorly packaged. The book didn’t come wrapped in anything, so it was bent upon arrival, which was kind of disappointing for those who don’t like their pages creased. As for the book itself, it’s much more informative than the little booklet the Rider-Waite Tarot cards come in and I’m glad I purchased the two together. I like the various different meanings it gives for each card under different contexts. Overall, a great purchase - just needs to be packaged more securely."
"This book spends too much time explaining the details and never actually explaining the accepted basic meaning of the card. I'm a beginner and I'm very displeased that I bought this book. Maybe if you are more advanced, you could get some use out of all the drawn out explanations of symbols without the basics."
So I dont like this book. It's not what I thought it would be. Not only does it not have reversed answers but the upright answers are not good either. Not sure what approach these writers used but if wasnt for the fact that u would lose half my money just to ship it back. I would have returned it. Just glad it wasnt that much.
"Takes a very Christian outlook, and some of the interpretations just don't make sense. I was hoping for a more thoughtful, in-depth study of the symbolism of the Tarot, but this is just another quick fortune-telling approach. Some of the most interesting symbols aren't even explored."
Nicely made with color but lacks a lot of information.  Did not meet my intuitive self.  Bought other.  This is NOT the Ultimate guide to Tarot.  Only the tip os iceberg.
"I haven't read through it yet, but in a quick perusal, it looks like it will be very informative and useful during my learning stage with the Tarot cards and readings."
"Incredible delivery speed, it arrived in 4 hours, I am more than amazed, and the content of the book is excellent.  Thanks for such a great service."
Fun and entertaining.
Not the greatest writing. Vague. You'll get more info from the tiny booklet that comesworth the deck. Waste of money
I loved it!
"I am still reading it, so far very happy with it!"
"This book is small , but it has a wealth of information in it .  The  meaning and significance  of the 10 most important symbols in the illustrations of  each card are described in detail.  It really made me study the  images and symbols on each card. There is also a one page  summary for each card with a brief primary, spiritual and Daily meaning  . I refer to this book  each time I do a spread and each time I seem to notice  something in the illustration that in the past I had not  observed or recalled .The goal of this book seems to be to  teach a person to see the symbolism in each  card illustration  and  apply it to your interpretation of a reading .I would  definitely recommend it  if you want to form your own interpretation of the cards as they apply to your question or situation and not just rely on someone else's  opinion of the meaning of  each cardFor me,  other Tarot books that  give a specific interpretation  for each card seem to be  too vague to be useful  and often the  interpretation  doesn't  seem to apply to the  question I asked."
"Excellent book, easy to read and reference the info that you are looking for.  Definitely recommend!"
the best tarot cards
Gifted this the ultimate Original go to Deck
Love my cards
Very useful in tarot reading
This was shipped from Good Will. Great condition but a bit pricey considering where it came from.
Wish the book was bigger..
"I have the cards, but without this book, I would be lost. Easy to understand, Very Helpful."
Beautifully illustrated with accurate interpretation of the Tarot!
Just what I needed to learn
"I bought the tarot book, not realizing cards were included, so this is an extra set.  The book that came with this set is also really good. I'm learning just for fun."
I love the book. Simple to use and a great help to reading tarot cards for yourself or others. Very helpful for people trying to get started on the practice.
hard to get into... idk maybe its me?
Good guide for beginners
love it
Fantastic book everything you need to know about the tarot card world
"Several irritating print errors of cards throughout book and felt some interpretations of symbols far too contrived, would not recommend"
"Am only just getting into Tarot, this book is excellent"
Perfect
This is a fabulous book and very different from other Tarot books and I own quite a few. The book draws your attention to all the wonderful symbology in the deck. Definitely one to add to anyone's collection.
Good read
"This is one of the best handbooks on any form of divination or prediction I have come across, both in layout and scope. I cannot recommend it too highly."
Perfect
"Good book, slightly bigger than I was expecting but a very nice read. I really like the book."
Though these cards are on the large size ine can better see the beautiful artwork and images
love it! exactly what I was looking for! there are a lot of books out there which give you some predetermined explanations but this book focuses on the symbols in every card so that you have far more possibilities of the interpretation and you can get a far greater in depth reading. I find it also very helpful to just get to know the meaning of certain symbols which are repeating everywhere!Well well done!I love when the cards and symbols finally spin a web and you can start understanding and not only learning meanings by heart!
"C'est un livre intéressant car, il explique bien la signification de tous les symboles sur chaques cartes. J'ai été un peu déçu vu qu'il avait pas ce livre en français, j'aurais aimé qu'il y ait un exemplaire de cet édition en version française. La partie interprétation lors d'un tirage, je trouve que c'est un peu brouillon et manque d'informations. Il ont mit l'emphase sur la signification des cartes plutôt que de l'interprétation. Je m'attendais à un peu plus sourtout, venant de cette maison d'édition."
I have been reading Tarot Cards for over 20 years...this guide used with the Rider-Waite Deck is perfect for those interested in reading Tarot Cards.Great for beginners and the more advanced readers...it is always a great source of information.
"I really wanted to love this book but was really dissapointed! When I saw the page layouts which break each Tarot card down into all the symbols with closeup pictures I was so excited. The Rider Waite Smith deck contains many layers of symbols, even the sky tells a story. I understand that symbols have many meanings but I really didnt get what the authors were on about most of the time. They would read to much into the colour of something or some tiny detail but then ignore the really obvious message of the card. I do think some of this could have been lost in translation as even some sentences made no sense. Even so they seem to have a very obscure interpretation of the cards and symbols. They seemed to go out of their way to find negative meanings to very positive cards like The Sun or 10 of Cups. Sometimes they seemed to misidentify obvious symbols such as the winged cherubs as 'elves' or the dragons head on a court card as 'a stone'... I could go on. It did help me spot some interesting details I had not seen before but thats about all im afraid. If your going to purchase this book please use other sources for the meanings of the cards and symbols to compare."
"I have a set of Tarot cards, but it got annoying having to look up all the meanings on my phone.  This book is easy to use.  It has great pictures, it's easy to reference for a quick card of the day, or to do a whole spread.  Perfect for someone just learning how to read cards."
"Unlike some reviews, all pages are in the correct order and none are upside down. The book is interesting, giving not only general interpretations for each card, but descriptions and interpretations for 10 to 12 major symbols found on each card. This can help when doing a reading. However, as the book states, the final interpretation of a card, or a spread, still comes to individual intuition."
"This is a great book for explaining the symbolism on each and every card.  On two facing pages one page shows the card, with a few general meanings about the card on it.  On the facing page is a rather indepth look at different symbols on the card and what they mean/symbolize.  It has interpretations like ""on this card you see ""x"" which represents ""y""."" However it doesn't say much about how to interpret the cards in a reading, and how the cards may be interpreted differently for different kinds of readings.  I was hoping this was more of a ""how to"" book, rather than just an encyclopedic categorization of each card.  I am just learning tarot cards, and at some point when I have more knowledge, I am sure this book will be of more use.  For now, not very helpful in using or interpreting the cards."
"I thought this book would help me understand the meaning behind the cards being pulled, and although it somewhat helped, a quick google search was more efficient and more knowledgeable. I do have to say that the book was good when describing what the images in the card meant but other than that there is nothing. You think you might need this book, but you really don't. More expensive than the deck too."
"I received it today and I've flipped through it. As helpful as it is, the first 20 pages or so are upside down and reversed. It's quite disappointing. Please be aware before placing an order as it seems a few people have had this issue."
"The concept of the book is great as it has each card broken out into pieces and each part described, i.e. the colors, the patterns, the number people, the horns etc all have a meaning. However it's not described very clearly. It's difficult to understand as it uses a lot of old language and point form type notes. I prefer to use the internet rather than the book."
cards are great
Easy to understand guide.
theyre good
Actually thoughtvthis interpretation of meanings were very dark.
I like it and recommend it. Easy to use.
"Good quality text, very in depth and insightful"
Very helpful!!!
Clear descriptions
easy to understand the book
I love this book! It makes understanding the Rider Waite Tarot so much easier!
"Beautiful artwork, shipped on time."
A really great book for understanding the Rider Waite Tarot cards.  Really discriptive of all the cards.  Many  indepth .explanations of the meanings.  A really super book.
"There seem to be so many different interpretations of Tarot. I thought I would enjoy this, There is a lot of detail to assimilate to get you thinking. but I didn't seem to be on quite the same wavelength."
"This is a fantastic book, if you're interested in the symbology of the Tarot Cards. Advanced book for people who like to think."
A complete joke of a book.The author knows absolutely nothing about tarot. The worst study of the RWS I have.
"Although this 'Ultimate' guide contains a lot of useful information on the symbols, it entirely omits the meanings of reversed cards. Brilliant."
Amazing product exstreamly happy A********
very informative
Book was good although I found it hard to use the information when using the cards
"I'm still getting to know this book, but it really doesn't seem to line up with any of the other books that I've been referencing. The descriptions are very to the point, and I'm afraid might be too limited for a beginning such as myself. Key imagery and meanings seem to be left out.I'm going to come back to this book once I've got a stronger working knowledge of the cards and see if this is a nice quick reference tool."
"This is a beautiful and unusual set for anyone who is interested in oracles and card reading sets. The artwork on the cards is lovely and has a whimsical feel to it, and the cards and accompanying book are presented in an attractive and sturdy box so would make a perfect gift."
"I love these cards, the packaging and design overall, the quality of illustration seems to vary from card to card and personally, I felt some designs could have been left out to enhance the overall quality of the pack. Anyway, as a tarot reader it's a completely different experience working with these. I love the design and it is a beautiful deck generally, with some really pretty images (blossoms, plants, cups of tea). I've tried combining them with a Rider Waiter deck to deepen my readings and it's quite interesting for getting info. This deck does take you on a different journey and that's pretty interesting: I love the history behind the concept: the creator is a traditional tea leaf reader and interpreted this into the physical deck.My biggest downside with this set is the quality of illustration: some cards are lovely others, not so much. Also, it might be because I'm relatively new to it and perhaps it's tradition in tea leaf culture, but there are quite a few different cards with dogs on to represent various positive things. There are around six or seven! Unless you adore dogs, how many dog cards does an oracle pack need? Like many other card readers, I am an animal lover but this seemed an odd decision and feel the meanings of the dogs (friendship, for example) could have been given a slightly nicer image of nature (seeing a pack of dogs on a card isn't something I would naturally find as positive as say, a flower and it jarred with the overall aesthetic). Personally, I felt there should have just been one dog cards and one cat cards max or other wildlife (plus very sad to find the only cat card had a negative, nasty meaning!). Again, this is probably me and it is subjective: there are a lot of cards in this deck so it's only a small part.Generally though, those small complaints aside, I would definitely recommend the deck though, overall, it's lovely with its circular design. It's of a great quality and feels quite personal which is nice due to the style of drawings. It has lovely traditional imagery in places and would make a great gift for someone into collecting oracle decks. :)"
"These arrived and as a card reader my clients absolutely love this deck .they arrived super quick ,illustration is beautiful.highly recommend."
This is a great round deck. Very substantial amount of cards and there readings. As well as 12 month cards 6 astral house cards  draw string bag for card mixing. Great in depth guide book. Highly recommend easy to use.
This is such a delight to use. i love to have a look and see what the week ahead will have in store. It has been mostly accurate for me and for others have been reading for. It also a agreat tool along side the tarot for that extra piece of clairifcation I love the round cards there are many and are provided with a bag to shuffle pick from however this ripped within 2 mins literally the card caught snagged so I use a velvet bag I brought in its place. The book is nice too with its descriptions and tips.. I would definately recommend these cards.
"I bought these cards having joined Rae Hepburns face book group and discovered she had created these cards. When I looked at them I thought they was just lovely. I always wanted to read the tea leaves but I found it hard to read them as Rae does and so thought these cards would be ideal.Little did I know I would be asked to give readings on her group as one of her four readers , just in such a short time with fantastic feedback from Rae herself, nor that I would soon be giving Rae a reading with the cards she created, along with 50 of her members. These cards are just brilliant and well worth paying out for something that I use and enjoy reading for others. My only groan is the silk bag which split , a red or gold velvet bag would be ideal rather than a thin silky bag that is too light to hold 200 cards plus your hand when picking the cards."
"Well packaged, arrived quickly.  Love these cards so much.  There’s so many of them that they come with a bag to shuffle them in."
If you are starting to do readings these cards are great for an accurate insight to the past  present and future I would 100% recommend these cards !
Fabulous deck. Always wantef to read tea leaves and this makes it possible...and accirate according to the feedback ive had from clients
"Really pleased with these cards, you get alot of cards for your money, & a good quality guide book to help you interpret the meanings although its written on the card.Different to tarot cards a welcome edition for insight when read with taro cards, pleased i brought these cards."
It’s an interesting read that’s for sure. Worth taking notes and it does leave you with some self reflection. The information is common knowledge but somehow you just see it differently when you read his words. This is the first book of his I’ve ever picked up due to a recommendation so I’m not a hard believer or anything but I still could follow the reasoning and semi sound logic that comes from his voice.
This was a very inspirational read and a great addition to the lessons taught in The Four Agreements. This is the third Don Miguel Ruiz book I have read and I intend to finish them all. Highly recommend!
This the third book by Don Miguel Ruiz that I have purchased and read.  Until i started this book I never gave much thought to what the voice in my head has been saying to me and the power it held over me.  I am now so much more aware of that voice and in the moment I challenge the validity of what it is saying.
Love this book. Opens the heart and soul to growth
"What a wonderful, enlightening book, giving us all hope of seeking and finding the truth that sets us free. And when we are set free, we are free indeed."
everyone should get slapped with this book. Don Miguel Ruiz is a genius. Should be required life reading for all children and adults. teach this in schools please!!!!!
All Miguel Ruiz books are wonderful. He keep on turning out these wonderful reads. Don't miss this one!
Love love love
I love insights from this author. This book does not disappoint.
"This work was very impressive. The only caveat that prevents me from giving this a full 5 stars is I would have liked to see more information on the Toltec traditions specifically as opposed to the comparisons of other belief systems. I understand the usage to create a mutual ground for understanding, but since the Toltec is in the minority of beliefs, I would have liked more information on the lore, at least."
"As always his books never disappoint. I feel sad when I actually get toward the end.  I'd just like to read his art and never stop. Makes me feel great , whole and in control towards the right path, this time over."
"As are all of Don Miguel's books, this one gives the reader a very clear look at the story of Adam and Eve, The Tree of Knowledge, and The Tree of Love.  It is so well done, so clear, so insightful. Yet it is gentle enough to read to a young child when teaching about the many myths of creation.I found peace and understanding accompanying my clarity, opening me up to so much more on a spiritual level.For those of you who are many times confused about Christian myths regarding creation, this is a must read.  Stressed here is that we are far more connected, one philosophy to another than separated.Again a wonderful idea for a child to live with as part of his/her personal beliefs."
Amazing book! Everything I have studied and believed for the past 30 years is all here in this book. Thanks for sharing this truth with the world.
I really enjoyed the information /insight presented in this book. It caused me to think about my thinking; and things I have/had choose to believe about myself and subsequently about other characters in my story and the I value(s) placed on them and myself.  The effect has been to consciously live/feel/love my story more in the present moment.
"Great book! The pages did come undone from the binding after the first day of reading it, so it's weird to hold. But the book is a fantastic read."
I enjoy this book as a supplement to other works but less impressed as a stand alone.
"If you need wisdom and deep understanding, this book will give you detailed explanation backed with facts and help you understand who God creates you to be. A most read for everyone. It is time we all write our own story."
"This tape is better than the original Four Agreements; nice companion tape.  Very interesting and I love Peter Coyote, I could listen to him for hours."
"... Just as inspiring, if not even more thought provoking.In this book, Ruiz talks about how knowledge is ""the root of all evil"" (within us) and how this information has programmed us to believe it without question.The knowledge we take as ""truth"" is nothing but the images and the stories of others, which comes from the stories of those who trained and educated them.We need to unlearn all of the ""lies"" (information) that we have taken to be truths about ourselves. If we can do this, says Ruiz, then we will become able to write our own story, based upon love, appreciation and gratitude for ourselves. Unconditionally. And when we are able to do this, we become the primary character in the story of our own making, no longer trying to be what we are not.It is difficult to go into more detail, therefore I highly recommend you read this book. However I might suggest you prefers this excellent ""story"" with ""The Four Agreements"", followed by ""The Mastery of Love"".  If you read them in this order, you begin to see more clearly, although it can be challenging at times, HOW to achieve the  that Don Ruiz portrays in this book.Read it slowly, take it in, ponder on the concepts, and see where it takes you.Good luck.I love you!Cam"
"After reading excerpts and reviews, I became convinced that this would be the perfect follow-up to ""The Four Agreements"". In short, I was right."
I enjoyed this book but not as much as the mastery of love or the circle of fire. It took awhile to really get into it but about half way through I began to resonate with what he was saying!
Very eye opening
I like this book
Better than any medicine
"A great spiritual book, that guides you towards going beyond identification with your mind, ego, and false beliefs. Ruiz calls the ego mind the ""storyteller,"" and he points out it is telling lies. The book helps tame this voice in your head. The author also describes his own spiritual journey and awakening, where he reencountered love, returned to common sense, and regained his own authenticity.The book is great for overcoming negative thoughts, and false limiting beliefs: so you can move from fear based states of being based in lies, towards love based states of being based on truth. It guides you towards being authentic, instead of pretending to be what you are not.The author tells that we are born in truth, but then grow up to believe in lies and he says one of the biggest lies is the belief in our own imperfection. He describes, how the real you is full of love, and how ultimately we are all one being.I recommend this book, since the spiritual truth and reality Ruiz describes is aligned with what I encountered, by grace, in my own spiritual awakening experience. Our true nature is incredible.

If you want to be more confident on your path of truth this book will be a great and gentle guide.
"If you are a christian this isnt for you , contradicts the bible, pushing new age beliefs."
This book changed my life so I had to buy the audio to share with others. If you get in your head a lot or talk yourself out of things often this is the book for you!
Love all his books!
Wonderful continuation of the 4 agreements. Dive in and be ready to have your mind blown. Stop fighting that voice and just let it go.
"I love don Miguel Ruiz.  I own all his books on both paper & CD.  His Toltec wisdom makes more sense to me than anything I have ever heard, and is a source of peace & sanity in this crazy world.  The Voice of Knowledge is just magnificent!  It's far more spiritual than his other books & extremely moving.  The CD version of this book is narrated beautifully by Peter Coyote which, I found gives it even more depth & meaning.  I recommend you buy both!  I enjoy reading the book first, then listening to it on CD repeatedly.  The more I listen, the more I learn.  Ruiz's books/CDs make wonderful gifts!  I have bought multiple copies & given them as gifts!"
A great guide to getting a clearer understanding of the Knowledge versus Truth. Loved this book and it inspired me to get his others and read them. Few books clear up our misconceptions as his books.
Really good resd
"I recommend this book to all those who are searching for a better life. This book sets the foundation to a life with truth, love and God.Thank you Mr. Ruiz for sharing your knowledge with all of us.  Ever since I was a child I believed in something greater. I believed in truth, and in the beauty that surrounds us. As I grew older I forgot the simplicity of life but at the age of 32 I was awaken by the light.  Your words inspire me to keep living in the light, in truth and in the presence of God."
"This book showed up in my library, would not open. No problem with other books."
very good book
"I have read tons of spiritual guidance books.  Simple easy to remember, challenging steps.  Complete and all one needs to be honest with self and others in a calm, loving manner.  I highly recommend this book along with the Four Agreements."
Exceptional accompaniment to the Four Agreements. Is a cornerstone of understanding my thought matrix and how to change it! Also allows for understanding on how we as a species got this way! Recommended for anyone who wants tr know the truth.
I like this book
"I chose this rating because this book has helped me see all the things that I thought that I lost, as well as help me see all that I deserve . This book gives me hope in myself. It helped me see that I'm extraordinary, all I have to do is put into action my beliefs."
Life changing book. Loved it. Have read it three times now.
Great book
"I love this book. I own it on audible. Bought it for a gift, but now I am selfishly reading it myself before giving it to the intended recipient."
Don Miguel Ruiz writes great books
bought to complete my set
"Great book, great wisdom, great author.  I have read most of what he has written. Very nice message."
how to create a spiritual connection with a more practical application to daily life.
Love Don Miquel Ruiz. I have read most of his books. When he writes I feel like I am right there listening to him.
great book
"This book is one of the best books I have ever read. I have read it many times and reccommended it to many other people. It make's a lot of life's problems and challenges in life much clearer. We can look at things in many different ways, we have choices how to view the world. I think this is a must read for everyone. Really! We create our reality and this book helps you stand back and view your thoughts from another perspective. Excellent Book"
"This book was like the Bible to me easy to read, but so practical. Full of commonsense, things that have to be applied to ones life, to get the full benefit of the knowledge. It's not a one time read it has to be practice."
Personal information
"I found this book full of wisdom and purpose.  Life viewed through Toltec  understanding makes more sense to me in how best to encounter my life, than most religions can deliver."
"Very, very important book, MUST read! Thank you so much!"
"The book is just okay to remember what ""the four agreements"" and ""the mastery of love"" teach. For people familiar with these books it can be quite repetitive. For the ones who start with the author, it's just fine."
Awesome!!!!
"Very simple reading and understanding. Insightful, enjoyable, helpful.  Brings you back to uncomplicated and awareness."
Wonderful book life changing opening to oneself journey of real truth our authentic self knowing the difference of lies and truth.
"I purchased this book after seeing the four agreements posted on the classroom wall of a colleague and asked her where they came from. She loaned me her copy and I was surprised to find how it connected to my own life experiences. A must-read for anyone who believes they have lost their ""true self."" Thank you, Dr. Ruiz, for sharing your story and inspiring me to create my own heaven!"
I've read just about all of the Don Miguel Ruiz Books. This is an excellent read and is an extension of his other writings. Great read and can be read in just a few hours.
gift
Keep learning
Book was in excellent condition and arrived as promised.
You must have open mind on reading different views of religion.  It can be deep & also great advice.
I am a long time fan of Don Miguel.  The Four Agreements are life altering.  This goes further to explain how you can change your mind and change your life.
"This book, for me, filled in the blanks from the fourth agreement. I had so many questions.I came from an ultra religious background. This is all very new to me. I got hurt by the church and was feeling bad. A friend recommended that I read the fifth agreement. I did, then I read the fourth agreement . I know a little backwards but that's okay.I am no longer angry at the church and realize that it is truth for them but not me. I do not take it personal. This is so much easier and I like the person I am becoming because of these books. I realized I was creating my own hell complete with panic attacks and anxiety disorder. I am a free spirit and this book is simple and common sense. I will read it again and again.I am in a happy place now and all I changed was me with the help of Don Miguel Ruiz."
Don Miquel Ruiz's book The Four Agreements changed my life 10 years ago as I laid in the hospital and this book uplifted me when I needed a swift kick in the pants.
Excellent book 📖
"Interesting point of view on living authentic life. Don Miguel Ruiz is an intelligent, savvy person. Each chapter is summed up by the main points. This is a guide for life, and I hope to start using my notes on it soon."
"Voice of Knowledge is a book that makes you stop and think about yourself, your choices and about what is happening in our world today. So important to the health of each individual and to society."
At first it seems like the words are trying to hypnotize you but as you keep reading it feels like its actually dis-hypnotizing from your current state of understanding.
the voice kept iterating!
Excellent eye opening life changing book you'll be saying Wow over and over again...
"I am reminded of the teachings of my parents through this text, and I very much enjoyed the recap at the end of each lesson."
Great author.
"This book is anyone who wants to start fresh. Discover their true being. How to exist in love, happiness and truth. Do not live in lies but breathe truth."
love this book I have told everyone of my friends to read it
"Interesting perspective on heaven and hell. As always, his philosophies are simple yet complex to apply in real life. Thought provoking."
"This is a lovely book that would benefit anyone seeking answers. It is beautifully and lovingly written. I found peace in reading it. It is a great guide to following your inner knowing and not to rely on outside forces, to trust the greatness that is within You."
Excellent book
Interesting and logical concepts that's worth a read
Good product and good service
The best thing about this book and other books in the series is the that they are to the point and anybody at any level can pick them up and gain something from them.
cant recommend this or book or this author enough. it has been so inspiring and useful to me
Lovely
great book really helpful practical advice. totally recommend this to anyone.
"Great book, third book by Ruiz i have read so far! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
"Absolutely brilliant, simply put, easy to understand and grasp. I started to feel a transformation in my life by the time I was only half way through the book. Know your truth, live your truth. The truth will set you free!"
would read it again and recommend it!
Great read!
"This is an excellent, objective description and summary of many personal accounts of near-death experiences.  It really made me think and the book acts as a springboard for investigating this subject through other reading.  Dr. Moody does not claim to ""prove"" anything in his writings, but he does make a compelling argument for survival of the soul beyond bodily death.  I highly recommend this short, easy-to-read book.  Especially the first three chapters that describe the various stages of the near-death experience."
Pretty good book!
It was ok. I was hoping to have more specific detail of each experience.
"Great book with historic value.  The interviewees have to search for words because the terms NDE, white light, life review, etc. were not in the lexicon of contemporary culture at that time.  I can't believe I took so long to read it, having had an NDE myself in 1982.  If I'd seen this book sooner and brought myself to read it (despite my fear of being labelled a kook), I might have sought out IANDS sooner..."
Old style good.
"I read this book when it was first published, it is not overdone with hyperbole or ""glorious"" concepts,"
Was a gift for someone who enjoys this topic. They deeply enjoyed the book.
Great book that is interesting and well written.  It matches my religious beliefs and my own personal experiences.
"This is, of course, the classic that triggered much public curiosity about what happens when we die.  It is the foundation on which much of the scientific research into near-death experiences is built.  Recommended for those who have little or no knowledge about the subject."
Recently my wife died. I've been reading many points of view. This was different than I expected. I knew all about the book before reading but the author has a very even handed balanced style. I believed him. He didn't seem to have an agenda. Who knows?  But the book was very thought provoking.
thank you for your service  Thanks for a good job.  i do not like writing these reviews at my age it becomes tiresome.  Pleaseexcuse me from them.  I will still order as i have always done.  Thank you
I would have much preferred to see more personal stories and a lot less analyzing and interpretation.
"The book was delivered on time.  The book was in the shape I expected, which was ""used but in good shape"".  The only thing was that the book didn't have the same cover design that was shown in the picture.  It was the same book, but it must be a different edition?"
received as stated fair condition
"If you want to know more about matters of life and death, there are far, far better books than this one. Copyright says it was first published in 1975. Maybe Mr. Moody has come a long way since then, but I don't know as this is the only book of his I've read, so far.I've been studying this subject for about 8 years, now. This book has serious problems regarding the impressions it can leave you with. The only part of this book that I find useful are the cases of NDEs Moody's recorded. I applaud his efforts, and they are admirable. He's done a lot good in this area.However, with respect to this book, his philosophical and religious speculations leave a great deal to be desired. On these subjects he didn't have the shoes for the territory. He's even inconsistent in his speculations with some of the accounts of NDEs he's relating in this book.IF you want to read on a more seriuos level about what's beyond this life, then I suggest Michael Newton's two books on ""life between lives."" Look up his name here and get both books. There are others that have written on this subject too, but Newton is the only one that I know of who spent decades with hypnosis patients and compiling his data. It makes a difference. To have someone relate to you what they know from a near-death-experience is very limited. Deep hypnotic states reveal far more.I also highly recommend Brian Weiss' book, Many Lives, Many Masters; also read William Buhlman (2 books) and Robert Monroe (3 books). Weiss has written other books, but read the one above first, if you're new to this topic.If your're a serious minded seeker of after-life knowledge, you'll get nothing more than a few cases of NDEs in Moody's book, and some seriously flawed meanderings on philosophical matters. To some people that may make no difference; to others it will. This book is also written in an extremely casual style, rather on the level of news paper articles."
"I'm twenty years old and going through an existential crisis thanks to Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. My brain cannot accept ""avoiding"" inevitabilities, such as death, regardless of how normal they appear to be. If it exists, and if it will happen to me and I am aware, I feel the need to know everything about it and take a stance on it, so to speak.Unfortunately this is not easy with the topic of death. We do not understand it, for whatever reason. We prefer to ignore that it ever happens because all we know is here and now. We could fret over the unknown, but it infringes upon our happiness, so we choose to ""forget"" about it as long as we possibly can. OCD has made this mostly impossible for me in various stages throughout my life and I finally got sick of dealing with it. I put it off best as I could using small comforts, learning about religions, and ignoring it if at all I could find a way.Eventually I got tired of theories. They didn't mean anything to me. I've had personal ""spiritual"" experiences myself that are highly suspect, and I'll admit it, but my brain was never convinced. So I decided to at least try and dig deeper for what we do know about life after death. My expectations were low, and I was prepared to deal with nothing but speculation. Given that the only information we as living humans would have about death will come from people who have returned from it against all odds, I was not prepared for the depth of continuity, detail, and undeniable clarity that I found in this book.Life After Life was one book I bought in a huge pile of others to address many concerns I've had, and it was the only one I took a chance on regarding death. I wanted to know facts, even if there were few. I wanted science and history and accounts from everyday people in Joe Six-Pack language that would make even a skeptic say, ""That might be worth my consideration."" This is where Life After Life delivered. I had it pegged as a book that would provide me with as-good-as-it-gets information about the afterlife, without an agenda. Needless to say I wasn't expecting much. People are mostly interested in dispelling fear and I just wanted to know the truth, whatever it happened to be. What it happened to be was, quite simply, amazing.The book introduces itself with Moody's credentials, biases, personal history, and investment in his studies. It was nice to know this about him. Throughout the beginning, where he inserts many passages from dozens of people regarding their experiences of the ""afterlife,"" he does not seem to show any personal slants or implications about the information he received in his studies. He tells us plain and simple: these are the things that many people seemed to agree on, regardless of their religious, personal, cultural, and emotional history. The similarities in the stories alone were amazing to me right off the bat. The explanations of what people felt, heard, and saw were clear regardless of how many times they expressed difficulty in putting their experiences into words.Moody breaks down the timeline of events very cleanly from start to finish, making the surprisingly uniform recollections in their supernatural nature very easy to digest. Someone with no knowledge of philosophy or medicine would be able to understand clearly.The section that really got to me was Moody's commentary on ancient spiritual or philosophical material, based purely on the similarities of their contents to the experiences of ""20th century Americans"" who likely didn't know anything about Plato or the Tibetan Book of the Dead. The latter was the one that astounded me. Ancient tellings of life after death lined up almost completely with these modern experiences to the point where it shocked me.The material present here is convincing, well written, diverse, and very, very detailed. I did not think any of these things would be true when I decided to invest in the topic.I went into this book daring to ask for what little I expected. What I received was immense comfort that I thought I would never, ever receive until I really did die. I want to thank everyone involved with this book (and this kind of research) for their dedication to a topic that our society would rather not talk about. At most it is terrifying, and at the very least it is interesting. Either way I appreciate the wonderful read and will return to it whenever I feel doubt again."
"Headline:  Book not as described.This book was totally covered with messy underlining in red felt pen.  I purchase second hand books a lot, but I've never received a book that was so marked up."
"Having read ""Evidence of the Afterlife: The Science of Near-Death Experiences,""by Jeffrey Long and Paul Perry, before ""Life After Life,"" at first I thought Dr. Moody's book was like reading something I had already read before. Not bad, but not anything new. I was pleasantly surprised, however, when it went off in a few unexpected directions.""Life After Life,"" like ""Evidence of the Afterlife,"" attempts to put together some rudimentary statistics and find common elements of NDEs (Near Death Experiences). I say rudimentary, because Dr. Moody says the number of cases he compiled is not high enough for deep statistical analysis. This is in contrast to ""Evidence of the Afterlife,"" which compiled a large number of cases from all over the world through use of the Internet.It should be noted that with ""Life After Life"" being published long before ""Evidence of the Afterlife,"" the cases compiled by the Near Death Experience Research Foundation (NDERF) are almost identical, making the two books very complimentary to each other.Where ""Life After Life,"" shined, however, was a section on comparing modern NDEs to some ancient texts. Among those texts were, The Bible, selected writings of Plato, The Tibetan Book of the Dead, and Emanuel Swedenborg, a Swedish philosopher and scientist from the late 1600s who also wrote about the subject of the afterlife.Of those texts mentioned, The Tibetan Book of the Dead, in my opinion, read so much like an NDE that one could attribute parts of it to someone that had nearly died during a car wreck in 1992, and it would hardly raise an eyebrow among those familiar with NDE experiences. Once again, showing that the ancients had a higher degree of knowledge and wisdom than we care to give them credit for.A few other topics were also discussed that were not included in ""Evidence of the Afterlife."" One was on hallucinatory drugs, such as peyote. Missing from the discussion, however, was DMT, often described as the spirit molecule. While interesting, this discussion was short and on the lite side.The other topic that was more interesting to me was a somewhat more in-depth look at NDEs of people who had committed suicide. These were pretty uniformly described as being negative experiences for the person who took their life, but ended up surviving the event. This differs from ""Evidence of the Afterlife,"" because it contained very few, if any, negative NDEs that I can recall.All in all, I am not disappointed in ""Life After Life."" The biggest knock against it is that, by luck of the draw, I had previously read a very similar book. However, it should be noted that in the 30-plus years of data collected between the two books, very similar in this case, is really astonishing. Then throw in the similarities of ancient texts, and one understands that this is a phenomena that dates back to the beginnings of recorded history. One could also speculate that it goes back well before recorded history, as well."
"Having recently lost our 40 year old son, my wife and I searched for “proof of heaven”. We first read “Imagine Heaven” by John Burke and became excited - hearing about Near Death Experiences. Dr Moody was cited as the expert on NDEs so it was a natural course to follow up by reading “Life After Life”, an amazing and ground breaking objective reporting on NDEs. This book will capture your attention and encourage the belief that there is indeed... Life After Life!"

  , etc.He wrote in the Introduction to this 1975 book, ""I have never been close to death myself... I cannot claim total objectivity on that basis, since my emotions have become involved in this project... I write as a person who is not broadly familiar with the vast literature on paranormal and occult phenomena... my religious upbringing deserves some comment. My family attended the Presbyterian Church, yet my parents never tried to impose their religious beliefs or concepts upon their children... So, I have grown up having a 'religion' not as a set of fixed doctrines, but rather as a concern with spiritual and religious doctrines, teachings, and questions. I believe that all the great religions of man have many truths to tell us, and I believe that no one of us has all the answers... I am a member of the Methodist Church... I am not trying to prove that there is life after death. Nor do I think that a 'proof' of this is presently possible... All I ask is for anyone who disbelieves what he reads here to poke around a bit for himself."" (Pg. 3-6)He states, ""Despite the wide variation in the circumstances surrounding close calls with death and in the types of persons undergoing them, it remains true that there is a striking similarity among the accounts of the experiences themselves... one can easily pick out about fifteen separate elements which recur again and again in the mass of narratives I have collected..."" (Pg. 21) He admits, however, that he is providing ""a composite of the common elements found in very many stories... no two of them are precisely identical (though a few have come remarkably close to it)... I have found no one person who reports every single component of the composite experience. Very many have reported most of them (that is, eight or more of the fifteen or so) and a few have reported up to twelve... There is no one element of the composite experience which every single person has reported to me, which crops up in every narrative. Nonetheless, a few of these elements come fairly close to being universal."" (Pg. 23-24)When questioned about their lives up to this point by the ""Being of Light,"" he notes, ""The being... does not direct the question to them to accuse or to threaten them, for they still feel the total love and acceptance coming from the light, no matter what the answer may be. Rather, the point of the question seems to be to make them think about their lives..."" (Pg. 61) Later, he adds, ""One man who met the being of light felt totally loved and accepted, even while his whole life was displayed in a panorama for the being to see. He felt that the 'question' ... was whether he was able to love others the same way."" (Pg. 92-93)Perhaps more controversially, he observes, ""Even those who previously had some traditional conviction about the nature of the afterlife world seem to have moved away from it to some degree following their own brushes with death... not one person has painted the mythological picture of what lies hereafter... in most cases, the reward-punishment model of the afterlife is abandoned and disavowed, even by many who had been accustomed to thinking in those terms... many seemed to have returned with a new model and a new understanding of the world beyond---a vision which features not unilateral judgment, but rather cooperative development toward the ultimate end of self-realization."" (Pg. 97-98) He also states, ""Not one of the cases I have looked into is in any way indicative to me that reincarnation occurs."" (Pg. 141) Moody later came to endorse reincarnation, however (see his 'Coming Back' book).Regardless of one's views about life after death, this book is ""essential reading"" for anyone with even the SLIGHTEST interest in the subject."
"Raised in a Christian society I have done extensive theology research linking the various world religions similarities.  Dr. Moody’s findings are interesting in that these people do not share just one set of beliefs, but yet they have all told of a “common” after death experience.  His book is factual and yet inspirational even to the most agnostic at heart.MC Hansen"
"This book was a good book to read it makes you feel better about life and death. It doesn't matter if you don't belave in life after death, because when you read it the book makes you think, could there be a life when you die. The author has style in his wrighting and he explans lots of what he puts in the book. Dr. Moody says there are many things that people expernce one of them are death. in his book he says he knows people that have came back to life.The things I like about this book is that it made me feel better. It made me look at death in a different way like I never wanted to die. I always though that everything was over and I would just be gone ,but now I think different about it and im ok about the whole thing of death. I think there is a God and we do get to see him in another life. He also has a gold book that says if we were nice or bad.The author tells about when he was a yong kid he got to know a teacher when he was in college. This teacher had told about his near death experence, but Dr. Moody did not beleave in it then later on in his life he talked to more people that had experence the same thing. Thats when he started to want to know more about this near death stuff. I think don't think somethings not true just because you have not experence it your self. there are other people that have and could live to tell about it. Thats why I think this is a good book to read it could change your life or it could change what you think about death."
"In 1977, my uncle died. His daughter gave me Dr. Raymond Moody's book, Life After Life. It took me less than two days to finish and set me on a path that would lead to writing a book of my own.Dr. Moody was so intrigued by similarities he found in his patients' Near Death Experiences(NDE's)that he researched and interviewed others who had NDE's. Thus comes the creation of this anecdotal work, the first that I am aware of that addresses--more or less scientifically--NDE's. This first book was met with such a great response of letters from more people who had NDE stories that he wrote a second and then a third book, extending findings based on these letters.Having written a book myself about my experience with a ghost who actually moved something in front of me, I have thought of Dr. Moody often as people respond to Aaron's Crossing with their own ghost stories--stories so intriguing, that my next book will be a compilation of these first-hand experiences, just as Dr. Moody's second and third books were filled with responses to Life After Life.The main message for everyone in these books is the comforting validation that death is not the end. There is something more. Life After Life is a primer for those interested in exploring ideas on the Afterlife."
"Before reading this book, I didn't believe in life after death.  After reading it, I did.  I'm not the gullible type.  This is a sincere book, not a fraud, and its conclusions are reasonable.  While many other books in the  New Age section seem questionable to me, this one doesn't."
"I am a doctor who has witnessed death and have been told by patients that have been rescuscitated of their death experiences. Imagine my surprise when I found that Raymond Moody has collected hundreds of accounts of death experiences and references the ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead discussing similar encounters!  This book is so comforting to those who are facing death or have lost their loved ones. No matter what religion, race, age; all have similar stories.  I found this book fascinating."
"This book Life After Life was about peoples experiences of dieing and entering the afterlife. This book i would suggest you read it if you are intrested in the afterlife or have any fears or doubts about dieing. it really helps you realize that dieing is not the worst part of death. It is the anticipation of dieing that is the worst. This book sucked me in from the beggining but lost me every once and a while. So if you think you can stick through this story without geting to lost like i did, i really suggest you read this book. It is not to long and not to hard to read. hank you for reading my review and taking my advice on the book titled Life After Life"
"The book Life After Life is a book about peoples experiences with death and how they felt emotionally and physically during these experiences. It is a good book to read if you have any doubts or fears about death and lets you know that death is not the worst part about dieing. It is you waiting to die that is much worst than the actual experience. This book was wonderful keeping me intrested the whole way through, but got slow at a few parts, and lost me a little. But once you get past that i really liked this book, and i think you would to. So in conclusion i really suggest you read this book if your looking for something to read and be entertained."
Wonderful book to read after losing someone you loved.
"The author ask this question: What is it like to die? Also he says that is a question which humanity has been asking itself ever since there have been humans. I see the author been asking that question everywhere but never got the answer.I love that kind the question; that really feet to my mind. Listen apparently human composed in 3 parts. Such as body, soul, and spirit. The body its from the earth, that earth reincarnate by the food we are eating. The spirit its from God. He has gave us that one since the binning of the first born. That continuous since. Each person Received from their mom only. That goes on in on until the end. Soul its in our blood that controlled our emotion or power. To be clear the spirit guided the soul and the soul make the body move.The main thing the author looking for: what is it like to die? When we are die our body stay in the grave and return where its came from back. The one who do good their spirit and soul went to Abraham Bosom. The one who do evil went Torment. They both waiting for the judgment day. Let me telling you spirit and soul never die, because they both from our God: nothing from him could be destroy. To finish don't worry to die that only to meet God easy, but don't force to die because it's a great sin. If anyone die in sin it's impossible to meet him. Personally I recommenced this book to anyone."
I absolutely love this book! Actually I love all of Raymond Moody's books. This is one I just couldn't put down and it is one I will never forget. I HIGHLY recommend this book for anyone that has had a near death experience or is just curious about the subject.
"I love the card quality, the color quality and images of this deck. They shuffle nicely and are easy to grip.I've had this deck for 18 months and feel super connected to it. The booklet has some really nice descriptions for each card and I appreciate the time in creating it."
"Second purchase, hoping these would be the gold embossed cards, they were not. Disappointed... will likely return.Wish there was a way to communicate with the seller before posting the review. Im a firm believer of discussing purchases prior to reviews. Unfortunately, I do not see an option to contact seller."
"It took a while for this deck to grow on me due to the way the cards being broken up into different categories and having to look them up that way in the guide. But now that I've gotten use that, I do like them. My reads with them are very accurate and I've recently begun to incorporate them more frequently."
"I purchased this as a starter deck. This is my first deck, and it's a good deck for the cost, in my opinion. The cards are wide and thin. There are some that do stick together, but I was able to pull them apart without messing any of them up. The card images are very nice, and looks like the product shown. The booklet does give a good brief description of each card. I understand that with readings the interpretation of each card depends on the person receiving the reading. I am just getting started in all of this, and I think this deck is good for a person just starting out."
"Love this oracle deck, nice enough card stock but will eventually flake off because of shuffling and flyers, maybe I'm just a bit rough lol."
I am new to tarot and when I saw these I had to buy them because they called to me. The cards are strong sturdy with vivid colors and images. The deck includes a booklet which will help me as I learn.
"It’s exactly what I was searching for. I’m a newbie and it’s user friendly, love the book that comes with it. I played with my cards for hours after reading this book. Hoping to become knowledgeable in tarot and use these as intended. I was hoping for the gold trimming as many reviews have images."
this was my first Oracle psychic Tarot deck. I'm very pleased with the guidebook and everything that came with it. It is very easy to understand and interpret the cards. Because they all had different color codes which makes it very good for beginners who are just learning.
"Unfortunately the cards I received didn't come with  the gold edges. Bummer. Pictures are beautiful and I feel the quality is good. Not sure if the lack of the gold edges was a manufacturing mistake or if it is no longer available. Either way, I like them."
"I love this tarot deck!Many beautiful cards & the perfect choice for me!I instantly bonded with them & have found my readings, already to be accurate!"
"I received my cards today, but I was under the impression that they would have the gold trimming and they did not. Other than that they came on time and they are nice the only reason I’m giving 3 stars is because of the missing gold trim."
I literally LOVE this deck. I use it a few times a week. At this point I have about 8 decks but I find myself coming back to this one all the time. I love the artwork on the cards. My readings are always spot on and leave me feeling so restored. I connected immediately to this deck.
When I got my deck I opened it and I connected with it right away. When I shuffled 6 cards fell out and they were telling my story. I love it!!
Beautiful accurate and super addictive.  Helpful in ascending your higher self if your a ☆lightworker☆. Otherwise AWESOME! MY FAVORITE DECK I HAVE.
"Well, I received the deck and did exactly what the instructions said to do... As I examined the cards one-by-one I noticed that the ""emotional loss"" card has a PICTURE that look's exactly like ME on it. Everyone I have showed it to has freaked out and they simply can not believe it. Over the past 3 years I have suffered tremendous emotional loss, including a 16 yr relationship with my high school sweet heart... I've only done two readings and my mind was completely blown by both... The art work is beautiful and I just feel really, really, good about this deck...I'm not making this up; its the truth. I'm blown away."
"Very happy with my purchase! Me and these cards bonded right out of the box...it was meant to be! Very easy to read without the guidebook ( that’s the creator’s intention as written in his own word) and the reading made so much sense! My cars arrived in perfect shape! I love the colors and the guide words written on them. I believe these are a must for anyone wishing to read tarot intuitively, also very beginner friendly. Get them!"
"Really love them but was disappointed that mine had no gold on the edges and front of the cards were scratched. Had it not been for all I would have given 5 stars! Really wish I had the money to buy another deck and try again.  I still recommend you getting a deck! Take the chance, because even with the disappointment I still love my deck!"
"Cards took a minute to warm up to me, but once they did , they've not failed to deliver just what needs to be heard.My clients love them"
"This is my second time ordering as my first deck became wilted as I used them so much. This deck seems to be a bit more thicker than my first order and lacks the gold trimming on the cards the way my first deck had. Nonetheless, I adore the images on the cards and they are one of my go tos for readings. Very happy with my purchase."
I am new at using the cards. Very pretty artwork. I bought this deck of cards due to the reviews
At first I wasnt sure if I was using the deck right or if they were just being uncooperative but as I went along with my readings I ended up getting amazing results & getting answers to what I needed.
"Lovely cards, but it feels like an element is missing..."
I am using these cards regularly in my readings.  This is my 2nd tier.
Awesome 👍
"These are extremely different from my other 2 Tarot decks.I REALLY like them.  I enjoy the fresh outlook on the Major Arcana.  The Chakra cards are my FAVORITE.  They have unexpected information.Every time I have used them, they have been accurate.  One time, I didn't realize HOW accurate until later in the day.John incorporates Tarot, Color, Numerology, Charkas, and personal response."
Good quality
"Love the look and feel of these cards, just starting but was drawn to the artwork and metallic edges. Great purchase."
Good Product and Prompt Delivery
Beautiful design
"Very happy with this purchase! These cards are very large, thick with a thick golden edge. Beautiful artwork."

   J'ai été agréablement surprise! Je n'avais pas vu les cartes je les ai acheté en pré-commande. Elles sont superbes, glissent bien sont douce au toucher (mat) et les images sont superbes. J'ai connecté tout de suite avec elles je les adores 😍."
"This kind of information is priceless and life saving. At the very top of a self help (physically, mentally, and emotionally) health book."
"This book is really awesome ... another great way to look at your ailments.***Also consider ordering ""The body is the barometer of the soul"" by Annette Noontil."
"So much information, very comprehensive! Lots of great suggestions too."
"Evette , the author is a master and beyond. This book is superbly helpful for working on stuff. Evette is also an authentic healer in person. She's turned things around for me. thank you!"
"The book is quite big in its coverage over many pages.  Upon reading some parts, many of the sentences and even paragraphs are choppy. In many instances the writer or editor doesn't have basic complete sentences so the reader, me, can understand the theme or topic better."
This book is fabulous. In the work that I do I use it several times a week and has been extremely helpful in finding emotional contributions to physical Illness. People are usually either shocked or amazed by how much sense the book makes in regards to their issue. Worth every penny
I was really looking forward to getting this book physically.
This book is great for people like me who are into metaphysics!  I was able to help my aunt with insight about her sciatic pain.
So far so good with this book - it seems scarily accurate to the conditions I have looked up. I am looking forward to really getting into it and using it to help me and my clients.
Love this book. Very user friendly and informative! My new bible.
Fascinating and insightful.
excellent
I was not at all impressed by this book.  I think found out this information and  a lot more on my own!! Unfortunately it was too late for me to send it back
Book arrived in perfect condition. I am delighted to have it and looking forward to discovering and reading. Thank you.
"A basic guide to further investigation. metaphysics is now (and likely always been , the best tool for one to know thyself). don't stop searching though."
"I have am a psychologist, a board certified hypnotherapist and spiritual.  I am open to alternative healing, etc.  But this is way too simplistic.  The connection between our minds and our physical selves is so much more complex than what this author portrays."
"This book is like a bible!  I was almost overwhelmed by the detail and great content shared in this book. I found the emotional components related to each disease to be very accurate and the key points shared in the book to be extremely helpful! Evette also clearly explained the Key Points under each disease and emotional components, which issues and blocks to focus on when approaching certain diseases.  The Key Points are explained very well. If you are a an alternative practitioner then you will find that in the a session with a client has already been mapped out for you in the Key Points under each illness. This was so helpful, as Evette recorded all the right questions to ask a client.I particularly loved the first 4 chapters in the book, where Evette explains the history and foundation of Metaphysical Anatomy and a little bit about their personal development seminars content, which was high level information but easy to understand and interesting.She also explained how to become a better alternative practitioner by sharing great tips on how to improve your practitioner skills. I am an alternative practitioner and found this to be very helpful and insightful.This book is a must-have for all holistic healthcare and well-being professionals and I look forward to working with it for many years to come."
"Metaphysical Anatomy takes a deep look at the mind/body/spirit connection of disease and illness.  While there are other books that address this idea, Metaphysical Anatomy takes the subject much deeper with more insight and suggestions. When I have looked up issues with myself, I am frequently surprised at how the information accurately pertains to my personality, past experiences and view of the world.  A very good book that raises the bar compared to previous published books on the same subject and will make you look at your well being from a different perspective."
"You cannot deny that it is a brilliant book. Ms. Rose has take this to another level, with clarity and much information on many ailments and diseases. However, the reason that I give it two stars is it lacks the how. You know what it is and reasons but then empty with solutions."
mediocre writing.  it's an expensive book. i say just pass
"Good book, very interesting!"
"J'aime les perspectives de ""recherche"" de la cause plutôt que les ""le plus souvent c'est ça"" vu dans d'autres livres du genre - je suis la ""moins-part du temps"".C'est un bon outil de coaching aussi."
great book
It's good discount!
wow love this book
This book is an immense source of much information on healing and helps greatly with my Theta Healing. I recommend it to other healers.
"Metaphysical Anatomy is the only book you will ever need. It it amazing, insightful and a great aid."
Amazing
Amazing
"very in depth, informative and complete book.  it is like a house brick so take time to read it."
Brilliant - book - good reference book one I will return to over and over again!
"The book is great and has a lot of very useful information. However, I had hoped for clearer suggestions for improvements as I find them vague and therefore not really practicable"
"Fantastic book.  Very comprehensive.  Something everyone working within health care should use as a matter or course.  Western medicine has a lot to learn about health and every doctor should possess, read and use this book."
Once you have got your mind around the reality that emotions and emotional history are powerfully linked to illness in a causal way then this book is invaluable as part of our armoury for self healing.
"Quite an eye opener!  We have been very impressed with the scope of this book, and, so far as we can tell, its perceptive approach to pathology and to health problems that we see each day in our clinic.  It must have taken years of experience and research to compile this comprehensive book, and I am so glad that it is being shared for the benefit of all.  It seemed like a lot of money at the time, but now I have it, I would say it is money very well spent.  It is helping us as therapists to assist our clients far more precisely, and indeed to help ourselves.  It could not possibly tell us how to help others, as each person is individual, and alternative therapy is not la process like prescribing drugs This is about understanding others better, where the person is  come from, what their deepest subconscious thoughts might be, and it is for us, as therapists, to work it out from there, using our own skills and strengths, how we might help others..  Thank you Evette for a wonderful addition to our therapeutic libray."
OK
"Really useful. Gives you many “ouch” moments when you realise things you didn’t want to face. Originally, I wasn’t convinced by the book, but the more I read, the better I find it. One thing they should definitely correct though is the typos. Frankly, those are really annoying."
I did think it would have had a lot more information unfortunately it doesn't explanations are brief and not much background or solutions. The solutions that are there are very generalised ie indicates emotional issues that need clearing and releasing. I had assumed it would have been more in depth and practical
"This fabulous book is an a-z bible of physical ailments along with the associated limiting beliefs to test for and insight into the associated issues.  As a Theta Healing Instructor I shall be recommending this book to all of my theta healing practitioners not only on my Intuitive Anatomy courses, but on all courses. It's the kind of book that you read through once and then refer to over and over again.  Great for healers to test themselves as well as their clients. If you're interested to find out more about Intuitive Anatomy please check out my Theta Healing website. [...]"
"Excellent book, I'm a member of a 12 step recovery program and found this book to not only expand my spiritual knowledge but it also challenged my current Christian beliefs."
"this is the 5th on I have bought for myself and friends, and I will buy more. Pastor Rorbert."
Richard Rohr has done it again with this easy to understand interpretation of the twelve steps. He displays each passage with conviction and as a result a better understanding of what Bill W meant so many years ago. I would recommend it for anyone who is struggling with the steps or wants a reliable explanation.
This is truly a must read.
Fr. Rohr is becoming a favorite author of mine.  This book has a lot to offer people of all faiths and people in all walks on their spiritual journeys. I can't wait to learn more!
This book is very deep and thought provoking. I enjoy it.  I usually read only a few pages at a time to process it. I'm in recovery and it definitely hits home! A great choice for any one who wants to grow spiritually
"Maybe my favorite of the Richard Rohr books. Simple, straightforward application of recovery steps to a deeper spirituality."
good book
This book is a powerful comparison of the twelve steps and the Judaeo-Christian. It provides powerful insights for anyone working the twelves steps or interested in the twelve steps.
Richard Rohr does a very good job of breaking down the 12 Steps. Very edifying and educational.
Provides me with so much comfort healing and meaning when confronting my suffering. Also it gives me another path to work the steps
This book gives words to my feelings. It has been a joyous adventure. Thought provoking. Heart wrenching. I love it!
Good
A must-read for anyone who struggles with finding their own very practical personal relationship with God and anyone who have ever wondered about the indispensable wisdom of the deep connection between spirituality and recovery within any 12-step program. The path for healing life from whatever ailment it has inflicted and to truly understand and enjoy the walk.
"Father Rohr presents a clear insight into the connection between Spirituality and the 12 Steps. I have come away having a better appreciation of the need for healing. It is a process that can take a lifetime. I would recommend this book to people who are in any way ""suffering"" from any kind of addiction."
"not only is this book for everyone, it helps the non-AA significant other understand the 12 steps and what the AA person is setting out to accomplish and bring into their life, and in turn can bring into their own"
Book was recommended to me by a friend.  I too highly recommend it to anyone who wants to understand the 12 steps and how they relate to the Bible.
Excellent
"This book is actually for Christians, telling them what they am learn from the 12 steps of AA. Or is it a book for addicts? Not sure, but the way he wrote about the steps, and about Christ, was really moving and compelling. It made me want to read every book he wrote."
"This is an excellent book that is very appropriate for classroom or group use, as the author was gracious enough to provide real page numbers. The Kindle Edition can easily be used with side by side with others who have a printed version, and making citations in papers gives uniform capacity to research the works you write. Highly recommended."
Well written look at the 12 steps by a non alcoholic. A must read for anyone who struggles with addiction and a must read for those who's lives are touched by addiction.
"As a Licensed Substance Abuse Counselor, I have been looking for a resource that brings a more transformational Christian perspective to the twelve steps.  I have been an interested follower of Richard Rohr since reading 'Falling Upward' and haphazardly found 'Breathing Under Water'...best find in years to augment my work.  I will recommend this book for Christian-oriented clients in all stages of recovery.  Thanks Father Rohr!"
"Rohr lays out how we can become more like Jesus, rather than studying, arguing, and struggling with what we believe. He sees that Bill W., the author of AA leads us in a real and deep journey of spiritual discovery and transformation. He brings deep personal and biblical insight to our journeys. I recommend this book to all who are seeking or considering real transformation of their lives."
Richard's comparison of The 12 Steps of AA and the Bible/Jesus' teachings is spot on. Thank you.
"A beautiful book for both the church and the 12-step community. Richard Rohr is a gem. ""Religion is for people afraid of hell. Spirituality is for people who have been there."""
Inspirational!
This book brought me peace and hope as I am trying to move on from my suffering! I recommend it.
I have been a part of a 12 step program for nearly 27 years.  This was a wonderful spiritual insight into how God works in the life of those who follow the 12 steps.
uitstekend. n oproep op alle christene. Dit is n boek om te herlees en herkou
Great book
remarkable book
Great book on the spiritual aspect of addiction and recovery
"I found this book to be very helpful to me. It gave a Christian perspective to the 12 steps and pointed out how they followed the message of Christ. More importantly, they helped use these steps more effectively. I recommended this book for beginners or oldtimers on the spiritual path."
I am re-reading it and so are my friends.
Great book for church book study and for connecting with the recovery community near you!
If you belong to a twelve step program it open doors to better understanding. If you are human and broken it opens new doors.
"The Wisdom of the Twelve Steps have given an open invitation to me through Richards incorporation of the related Scripture passages to face my own demons , and to accept the gifts that life gives , in many opportunities.I have shared and given the book to others. Thanks."
Richard Rohr at his best!
Really superb writing that will push you to your own limits!
This writing helped me realise that I am a co-dependent of note and I now look forward to recovery through the 12 steps. May it help you as well.
These concepts were instrumental in helping me understand relational tensions. Practical wisdom that is useful for every type of relational encounter.
"This book was well thought out by the Hendricks.  They offer ways to become aware of yourself and your issues so that you can continue to grow as your own person and in relationships with others.  For those who are searching, I highly recommend reading this book and doing the practices.  It will behove you."
I love Gay Hendricks work. This work is insightful to the psychology of relating. It has practical methods to having more conscious and loving relationship across the board.
Not just about love but life. Could just as easily be titled Conscious Living. Thank you Mr and Mrs Hendrix
Extremely userfriendly and helpful whatever stage of relationship you might be in. Insightful and Practical.  Highly recommend.
"I've read all the top selling self-help books, this blows them all away. It really gets to the root of our issues and what's causing them (we all have them to different degrees) and gives ideas on how to effectively manage them."
"I am still working my way through this book; however, it has been life changing in the way I see my life and my role in it.  Looking back at the patterns I have learned along the way that I keep repeating, but now can acknowledge and change."
I read this years ago and lost track of it for some time. I was pleased to read it again and find that it still resonates with me. I much prefer being conscious :)
"Simply an eye-opening account of how our past relationships can be onstacles in developing long-lasting loving relationships. If you are in any type of relationship, this is a must read for you and your partner!!"
"This book has literally changed my life.  It is easy, concise and so profoundly true that it rings within you that chord that is perfect."
nice coloring book
Enjoy this so much
Gave as a gift to my mom. She isn't able to find farm coloring books in stores and does not do any online shopping.
Nice coloring book with beautiful designs
My favorite book. Kids love it too.
Mom loved them. Pictures are very detailed.
Great book
Very nice
I love the scenes.
"I am 55 and love the wonderful world of coloring! I have introduced t friends and family to this fabulous hobby.  These books by Teresa Goodrich are gorgeous, inexpensive and heartwarming.  Keep Coloring!"
Great book
this has been rcomended I look forward to reading it.
Exceptional book for survivors of trauma.  It offers hope for the future.  The science behind the theory helps build confidence in the described method to help relieve the symptoms of PTSD.  The book is very different than other books on trauma.  It is well worth the read.
good
"Coming from a background of childhood abuse, this book has given me a much better understanding of how and why trauma happens. It also provided me some easy tools to use in my everyday life to help me overcome anxiety and depression. I have read many, many self help books, but this one was different. It explains how our bodies react physically to the thoughts we have and how to keep the fear from becoming overwhelming. I can honestly say this book has been more of a help to me than 90% of the other books I have read. I am very grateful to have found it."
Excellent thank you .
Hard to read but helpful
"All should read this book.  Wow, it has made such a difference in our lives as we understand how to deal with trauma in a way that allows healing and understanding.  A welcome break from the 'relive it' over and over that so many believe is necessary when all it does is more damage.  Levine is amazing and uses his own trauma to explain the healing course."
Bravo!
"I've worked as a social worker and therapist for years and I was amazed at the intuitiveness and practicality of the author's modality, It really makes sense and seems to be another path to obtain healing and freedom from those traumas which we've stored in our very cells. I'm still learning from this work and will consider taking his training. In the meantime, I'm goping to use his plan to do some deeper work on some of my own trauma's."
Very interesting concepts
Dr. Recommended great read!
"Lays out the process whereby people become traumatized and how they can move through and beyond their traumatized state. An excellent read, and I would go so far as to say everyone should read it, because everyone knows someone who suffers from these sometimes ""invisible"" symptoms."
good read
"When dealing with childhood trauma, I heard about Peter Levine and this book and Waking the Tiger - I bought both.  I read both and then recommended these books to my family who had been through the same traumas.  I have to say these books helped me in conjunction with counseling and other therapy.  I highly recommend them."
great book
"I agree with the comments about this book.  I have the book and a couple of his other ones and I learned from them, they were my first knowledge of what trauma could do.  I want to make a specific trauma comment and since the author has helped me alot what better place to do it!At age 60 I am finally and only recently past the terror of early, continuous and prolonged childhood abuse because of the healing work I have done on my own.  I recommend books and techniques from Alice Miller, Peter Levine (of course!), David Berceli, Babette Rothschild, EMDR, EFT, PARTS/EGO STATES work, NLP.  I am a little leery about unsupervised guided imagery and meditation because they can be so close to dissociation, I sure did.My comment is that with early abuse in whatever form the child has to create coping and defensive mechanisms to be able to survive mentally.  These PARTs then prevent the child from growing naturally like all children should.  As an adult these PARTS drew me to abusers and perpetuated actions which continued to retraumatize me.  I didn't know any better.People who experience trauma as adults can use the techniques the author describes and those listed above to get back to normal.  I have come to the awful realization that I have no NORMAL to go back to!  My former desires and reasons for living no longer exist.  They were based on avoiding reality, lessening the pain and terror, and plowing through dissociation to be able to function.  While I don't have the terror anymore I am still trauma parallyzed (Freeze, surrender) as I have been for most of these 6 decades and I don't have the NORMAL interests and motivations which would help me get past that.  ""I"" do not exist.My hope from this review is that this Catch 22 can be added to trauma discussions.  I don't know what can be done to create a resource or if there are even more people like me out there.I guess a correlary is to emphasize the need to help children who do experience trauma, as early as possible.  (Another of the author's books.)"
A book for anybody residing in a human body even if you don't identify with trauma. I think we all have trauma hanging around in our bodies waiting to be released. You maybe a soldier with PTSD or a average ordinary person with quirky health issues and the same thing happened to your body.It is up to us to learn how our body works and this is an excellent start.
"I have been run over by a car (2y), robbed at gunpoint (6y), assaulted at knife point(22y),  raped (14,17,20y), and raised by a frigid mother and self-immersed father.  I'm just now realizing the limiting effect my youth and a earlier life experiences.  This book was an informative, convincing read - I know my body is Other to me and desperately want to do the work to change this reality and feel this was a great introduction to what I need to do.That said, the author is a very intelligent, cultured man who used this book to showcase his erudition a bit too much.  Overworked (underworked?) and redundant at times, I had a hard time reading this some evenings. The author was too ever present, I found myself more aware of him than of the excellent information, at times."
This is a really great.  Gave me a lot of information about internal symptoms that one experiences.
Peter Levine is an expert in the use of Somatic Experiencing for those suffering from trauma. This is a classic!
"This book makes me cry, shriek, laugh, shiver, quake, tremble and tremor.Complex knowledge on trauma (recovery) laid open in an accessible way for anyone who is interested!"
"recommended by a psychiatrist specializing in trauma, it has made me see things in a different light. There is hope."
Never before have I had a book experience where the author was so accurate about my internal experiences while offering hope that true and lasting healing was possible.
"This book gave a solid view as to the how and why we hold trauma, ways  to help others  and ways to avoid."
"This is a very helpful, readable useful book for therapists working with people who have experienced trauma. This book is a must read for all therapists."
Excellent book for understanding what happens in the mind body connection after trauma and how to heal it. Thanks Dr. Levine
"Recommended for everyone with an interest in working with trauma. Particularly in the area of building expertise and knowledge around somatic experiencing,"
So far this has has been an interesting book to understand the biological respone to trauma.
"Some interesting information but don't feel the doctor has heart...very much in the head...at the loss of heart...I would not go to see him...Much prefer Dr. Alice Miller's ""The Body Never Lies"""
I love these cards they are insightful and though provoking.  The art work is beautiful.
"Its okay, good meaning and small cards. Dont use them often."
Excellent oracle. The readings for self and friends have been quite accurate and revealing.
This is one of my most favorite decks. The artwork is beautiful and it’s easy to understand.
"I bought this used on Amazon and it came with book and cards. I am totally in love with this deck. I never liked the art too much but after hearing so many great things about the deck i decided to buy it. The guidebook is amazing. I like that each card has a name on it. Like 8 of cups is ""letting go"". The explanation of each card is so spiritual and deep it totally gets me. I have gotten some very deep and amazing readings with this deck. I am slowly falling in love with the images as well."
This is my go to deck since I started dabbling with cards.  Aligned with the traditional tarot which I like.  Find it very expressive for doing readings.  Beautiful art.
"I only recently acquired and began using this deck, partly because I already owned many other decks and didn't want to have to learn a new one.  The names on the cards often don't match the names in the Waite-Smith tradition, so I was concerned that I would have to learn a whole new system of interpretation.  Once I got the deck and started using it, however, I was quite impressed.  The art work is quite beautiful for the most part. (In any deck there are always some cards that are not appealing.)  Because I know the Waite-Smith deck quite well, the interpretations of the equivalent cards in this deck turned out to add a depth of understanding to what I already knew.For those who are considering getting this deck, I would recommend going the the OSHO site online which has an OSHO tarot option.  There you can see the cards and read the accompanying text.  You can also do online tarot readings with this deck at that site.  It's a good way to judge whether this deck will appeal to you and be useful in your readings.  It's important to read the book that accompanies this deck because it explains the artist's choice of symbols and how the cards related to concepts from Zen Buddhism.A couple things I did not like about the cards (though for the most part I really fancy them):  The use of the name ""schizophrenia"" bothers me because I work with schizophrenic patients and find this use of the term to be shallow and insensitive to people who suffer from that illness.  In addition, I showed the cards to a Jewish friend who felt that the ""Miser"" card drew on the old stereotypic image of Shakespeare's Shylock, which is offensive to the many in the Jewish community.  Also, the ""we are the world"" card seems trite and reminds me too much of Disneyland.These objections aside, I do recommend this deck, especially if your are intrigued by Zen.Addendum: Having used the deck for a while, I find it is better for reflection and meditation than for regular readings.  It tends to ""accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative"" a bit too much.  I still like it, but the deck is beginning to feel rather New Agey, saccharine, and goody-two-shoes."
Seriously the best tarot deck for diagnosing mental ills and hurdles
I got billed for TWO of these and only got ONE...it was exactly what I wanted
I am always amazed about how right on the Osho cards have been for me and in readings for my friends.
Excellent quality card set.
Love it
Book only. No cards.
Beautiful art work
Very nice
Amazing deck & book. Very easy to interpret & use. Amazing illustrations.
Perfect condition.
Love the insight and artwork great for personal inspiration and development
Wonderful cards
best tarot cards that I own & I have about 6 different setsLOVE OSHO
This is a wonderful deck.  I am very happy with it.  Thank you
Great condition
The seller insisted this item is new and perhaps it is but the color of the cards are white on the ends and usually that happens when cards are banged around a lot in their box.
My favorite cards!!
Great!
I understood that this would come with the complete set of tarot cards since it says (cards) but was dissapointed when it turns out to be only the book. I need the cards to go along with the book.
"A psychopath, a schizophrenic, be careful!!!"
"Only received the book, the word ""cards"" was in the product title, thought they were being sold with the book, too."
"Dear Amazon,I don't even want to give this one star, I was so shocked at the quality of this product! This was a birthday present for one of my best friends, and we discovered that when she pulled her first card the pages were out of order and not even printed sequentially, page 56 than goes to 123 so some pages are actually missing altogether.I would of course like my money back or to exchange this deck of cards for one that is of excellent quality, and I'm not sure how to go about that.Thank you,Susan Stanko"
"i bought from a 'used' dealer. 'cards' is in this title. but i only rec'd book. make sure you check w/ dealer before placing order, or you may be dissappointed."
"I waited so long to put this deck in my hands, I nearly cried upon seeing their beauty.  Such a perfect tarot deck. The lining of the cards a radiant silver.  Never have I seen such a magnificent deck. Catrin is one of my all time favorite artists but this one far surpassed any expectations I could have had. The booklet inside a quick run through of each card meaning. I love the extra choices between the more masculine cards. I'm just in absolute awe and can't wait to do my first reading with them."
I purchased Catrin Wetz-Stein’s Mystical Moments Oracle deck and was so enamored by her artwork that I searched for it and discovered she was creating a tarot deck!  I preordered this deck in October and just received it.  I absolutely love the visuals and symbols in the cards - her art provides the reader with so much more depth and meaning.  I don’t mind a glossy finish at all and the card stock - to me - is the perfect weight.
"I have quite a few tarot decks and this deck has leapt to the top five of my favorite decks. These cards are ab-so-lute-ly beautiful! I am struck by how the artist was able to incorporate the traditional meanings of each of the cards in incredibly unexpected ways. Masterful! And, no, the silver edges DO NOT flake off. I have not observed any instance of this happening when I use the cards. The glossy finish, IMHO, brings out the gorgeousness of the colors the artist chose to use. Also, the addition of the female Kings among the court cards is an intriguing addition, and I am grateful for their having been included. As I mentioned earlier,  I have many tarot decks and it's been awhile since a deck has surprised and delighted me. This deck has in so many ways. I purchased the companion Oracle Deck and I'm pleased with both of them and use the concurrently and they offer me rich, evocative readings."
I ended up returning this deck in the end because of gloss. I just did not like it. The artwork does not disappoint but sadly gloss made it feel cheap to me and I couldn’t bond with it.  They should red-do the deck without the gloss this artist deserves it her work is beautiful
"I got this deck on a whim and am surprised at how much I love it. I saw all the reviews in regards to the quality of the card stock, I don't mind it. They are very glossy so can be slippy but again this for me is not a deal breaker. I enjoy that they are wider and because of their thinness easy for me to riffle shuffle (my hands are smaller). I really like the silver edging and despite my rough style of shuffle it is holding up well. The guidebook although small does what I always hope for, actually explains the purpose of the art on the card. In the deluge of decks coming out so many creators make widely varied interpretations of the card images without making any mention of WHY certain things are on the cards. Not here, the guidebook beautiful explains reasons why things were created as they are. I love the nuanced interpretations and meanings I get from the images. I feel like my mind can play between the guidebook and intuitive hits. The feel I get from these cards is sweet, playful, and off kilter but direct--akin to the feel of Alice in Wonderland and Secret Garden, there are pretty straight forward answers but you can also go much deeper if you want. Again so much of these reviews will come down to personal tastes, preferences, and aesthetics. If gloss is a no go, this will be a pass. I love the artwork of the oracle by this same creator but regifted it as I couldn't connect with it, while this deck I did not expect a connection and felt one upon opening. I also love the inclusion of the extra Emperor and King cards, fun to mix and match and be intentional in the energy I want represented for reads. Really enjoy this deck and highly recommend if gloss and thin card stock isn't a deal breaker for you."
"Gorgeous! So glad I bought these to go with my Oracle of Mystical Moments deck, also by Catrin Welz-Stein. The box is sturdy, but not bulky, which I like. The cards themselves are the same height as the oracle deck, but wider (comparison in last pic). Still comfortable for my stubby hands to shuffle, though.The imagery is delicious! Obviously I connect with Catrin's surreal artwork. I love the different representations of the King for each suit, as well as the Emperor. I also included a pic of the ones that caught my eye. The silver edges are the cherry on top. I can't wait to read these cards. If you love the oracle deck, and are thinking of purchasing the tarot deck, I highly encourage it!"
"Beautiful art work. The cards have a gloss finish which I am not a fan of. They don’t feel good in the hand. The silver gilding is cheap, hurts when you shuffle and flakes off everywhere. Such a beautiful deck but, the quality leaves much to be desired."
A beautiful Rider Waites style  eccentric psychedelic mysterious mash up of a deck. Great silver sides and the gloss makes the beautiful colors pop. Silver flakes??? None. Hurts to shuffle??? Maybe my fellow reviewer  needs an orthopedist. Highly recommended.
"I saw a review on YouTube and my intuition was on ""the fence"" over this deck. I Returned it! First off, ""if"" you are a Tarot reader this deck might be hard to read. A GOOD intuitive tarot deck should NOT have you ""look"" down at the titles of the cards. The image itself should accurately convey the meaning of the cards. This deck FAILS to do that.  I personally like decks that stray from the traditional Rider-Waite system but it should at least adhere to its fundamentals. The images are amazing but most of them (not all) have ZERO to do with each card's meaning.IMPORTANT TO NOTE:True Tarot READERS (who take their spiritual path and divination seriously) SEE NO COLOR or Gender! We have ""evolved"" to a higher existence to see beyond our current form! If we put other ethnicities or cultures of people on this plane of existence into our Tarot decks, it is because it has a depth of meaning for a user to see more clarity as to what the querent to asking about. ...nothing more..What is disappointing about this Tarot deck is this annoying ""need"" for ""white people"" to inject their bizarre obsession with ""gender identity"" OR authors who ""force"" their ideology into their works. This deck is polluted with it.For example: You have two sets of KINGS one is men and the other is women.  The hypocrisy in this is ""if"" you are going to do this then why didn't the author make ""men"" QUEENS as well???  I have more ""male queens"" in my life than I do female ""kings"". LOL!!  It makes no sense honestly.The other annoying thing is the ""need"" to have the TOKEN Black women in this deck.  I'm a ""Black American"" (*not African since I have never lived there nor am I a native*) and I DO NOT NEED Diversity. I NEED a ""spiritual tool"" that conveys ""meaning"" and depth regardless of the skin color or gender of their characters.  **NOTE: I have seen Tarot decks with people of color or other ethnicities but it was done to ""aid"" in the suit's ""meanings"" NOT FORCED to conform to some sick political ideology of our current society. And it is obvious that the author is anti-male because once again... No black men. I mean...If you're going to go Black at least do both genders! Just sayin..... more hypocrisy. That's how I know this is not done to aid in the depth of the cards. Just a shallow/ ego-based ""need"" for a white woman to put in the cards to satisfy other idiots ""egos"" who are brainwashed in this kind of psychos. Only white people ""need"" diversity to satisfy their twisted EGO. As a Black Woman, it's insulting, to say the least!Tarot is a spiritual TOOL period.. there should be no need for gender identity/feminism/diversity injected into it.  In 60 years when this deck is in the collector's hands, people will look back at how PSYCHOTIC our society was over this crap!The author is traditionally an Oracle deck creator. Oracle decks came into existence recently onto the divination scene. They have been around for a long time but were not popular until recently.  I have been reading for over 30 years and Oracle decks are NOT Tarot. I feel like the author needs to do more ""study"" on Tarot and create images that honor it."
The imagery is is stunning. The cards are difficult to shuffle because of the way they were printed. All the cards were cut image face up so it's easier to shuffle evenly image side up. The uneven shuffling is also caused by the silver gilding and gloss finish which makes it difficult riffle shuffle the deck. There's 83 cards so it's best to shuffle image side up and broken up in small stacks of cards. So far the gilding is holding up. The gloss finish does make the cards a bit slippery to handle and the cards themselves are thinner than other decks. It seems they traded sturdy cards for gloss and gilding. The imagery is stunning which is why I'm keeping it.
Thanks so much!
Full of information.  Useful and complex.
"This book is an excellent guide to using protection magic.  It helped me to obtain peace in my life.  I always felt that hiddent forces were influencing me, making me angry and belligerent.  Since I began using the practices outlined in the book I have become much more calm and relaxed.  I recommend Protection and Reversal Magick to anyone dabbling in the magical realm."
Great book. Solid stuff inside that REALLY work when applied properly. Hail to the Goddess Hekate.
Great addition to any library collection!
Good material here to be integrated into a practitioner's personal paradigm/current
Plenty of Information
Informations in this book are very accurate.The author definitely has a very deep understanding with sorcery from diverse cultures and painstakingly complied his knowledge into a simple to understand book for the general public who are interested in this topic or are in need of some help.
"GREAT BOOK, FAST SERVICE"
Jason Miller has an amazing ability to distill a system down to just the essential to produce magic that works with out too much pomp and ceremony.
"This book has been the dominant topic of conversation in my house since I received this a few weeks ago.  From my teenage kids to friends to my husband,  we've reconnected with the topic of faith in a new way.At one time, we were deeply religious but like many others, grew weary and disillusioned with the God religion portrayed.My kids have said, ""The book describes God as how I pictured him.""  (Meaning, he's a lot more loving and kind that we realize.)Do I buy everything Walsh (uh, er, God) has to say?  Nah.  But that's okay.  And I suspect God's fine with that too.  ;)But I am grateful for the biggest takeaway and that is reigniting a curiosity and hope about our Creator."
This book will shake your beliefs
"I read it, thought it interesting !"
I loved this book. So glad I found it!
So far so good. Great book for expanding sprituality.
best book ive ever read
Good book makes you think
Good reading.
Great book
One should read this book many times and make it a mantra for life....
"Super item, great quality and most of all we'll worth the price, standard arrival time as expected  a a a"
All of his books are very good have read over and over again.
You should have an open mind when you read this book. I found it inspirational but it is up to the reader to decide what it means to them.
"Great product, swift delivery"
good
one of the best books!
Thought provoking and challenging and above all sensible and accessible.
"very good, very spiritual needs time to read as makes you think"
Great
very interesting
"This book of spells is as good as any out there on the market. In fact, it is better than most for several reasons.First, it is inclusive. For example, there's actually a spell to help a disabled child reach their fullest potential. Really, nothing has been forgotten in this book. Love, money, careers, health and healing, travel, fertility, protection, justice, peace... you name it, the topic is covered!Second, it advocates for a healthy lifestyle. Unlike spells of old (mix this with a little wine and drink) this book actually acknowledges that there are individuals that suffer from illnesses like alcoholism and provides a spell to aid in such healing. In fact, I cannot find a single spell that advocates practicing anything that could cause potential harm in any way, shape or form.Third, most of the supplies needed to work each spell are everyday household items. One that quickly jumped out at me was ""Bubble Wishes for Urgent Needs."" All it required was some bubbles and edible seeds. With kids who are bubble crazy and trail mix for every day snacks, the spell was a cinch to create (not to mention effective).Now for the BUT...With all the good I have to write about this book, I still can't give it five stars. Unfortunately, the author never once (from what I've read) shared the importance of opening or closing a circle before casting. For regular practitioners, this is nothing new and easy to overlook in a book since we've already established our routines. However, this can be counterproductive (and even potentially dangerous) for those who are new to the craft. If there are ever additional editions of this book, I would highly suggest that the author include a general knowledge chapter in the beginning of the book before providing the spells. Otherwise, I did enjoy reading this book and will surely use it as reference in future rituals."
"OMGoddess! I received my book and I can't put it down as there are so many spells for the modern Alchemist to enjoy.  Wow, I'll be very busy planting good seeds this Springtime. Prompt delivery and all as a Prime Member.  I'm so loving it!!"
"This book had great reviews so I just got it but I was more, meh. I like that it has a great variety of spells for all sorts of things but it does not go into enough detail for me. It is set up by what you will need, timing, and the spell.  The timing is very general for example it might just say Friday or before bed or whenever the issue arises. Some spells don't tell you for how long they should be done.  No info on proper disposal of left over spell materials once completed. One spell calls for a couple of items then doesn't even say how to use the items in the spell! I haven't read through them all yet. However, if you are new to the craft they are simple and basic to get you started. I actually used a few of them as a base to create my own spells which was actually quite helpful. I give it 3 stars for these reasons."
"I feel as though many of the spells are just ""fluff"" & kind of silly. With that said there is some decent stuff in here to use to build your own spells. The author does not discuss opening & closing your circle or other ritual traditions, it's like a straight up cookbook that doesn't tell you how an oven works or the chemistry behind the bread you bake, which is fine if you know what you are doing. Overall I'm glad I added it to my library & it's got some interesting spells to expand upon."
"I love this book and use it often! Love the  gorgeous hardcover; no damage to pages or binding! Font is easy to read and intro pages for each chapter have nice illustrations. I do wish they'd include a list of everything you'd need in one section (what crystals, candles, oils, etc) but other than that, it's great. Would recommend!"
This has spells for anything and everything! I love this book! Don't waist your time on collecting spells through 40 other books when you can have them all in one book!
"This book isn't BAD, but it also doesn't provide much information.This book is like a list of spell ideas to try, with a list of what physical objects you'll need and a few notes about the main gist of casting that spell. If you already know how to cast spells, but are running short on ideas for what spells to cast or it hadn't occurred to you that magic could help with your specific problem, this book may help you! Perhaps you didn't realize that you could craft a spell specifically to stop your sibling who's always taking your things, or to find your missing keys.But here's what the book DOESN'T teach you.It doesn't teach you how spells work, what processes are involved. It doesn't teach you why any of these spell components work or what they do- what effects different elements, colors, lunar phases, or herbs do. It doesn't teach you how to raise energy for the spells. It doesn't teach you how to cast SAFELY, with no mention of why one might need to cast a circle or make sure the caster isn't draining energy or unintentionally hurting someone. It doesn't teach you anything about the holidays that some spells are based around.I should also mention that the way the spells are organized is a bit confusing, and if you're OCD this will probably bother you. Some spells are organized by final purpose, like ""These are the love spells, these are the money spells, these are the travel spells"" but then other sections are organized by casting method, like ""These are spells cast using candles, these are spells cast with the help of fairies, these are spells that use color associations"" even though those sections overlap."
"I really like this book. You can find pretty much anything you can think of in here. Also a great reference if you want to try your own variations but need a starting point. Amazingly enough, it is very light for the size of the book. I was expecting it to be encyclopedia heavy, and it weighs no more than a normal paperback."
"I absolutely love this book. It is very thick and contains spells for basically all aspects of life. The spells are simple and doesn't require you to buy 18 different herbs or other clutter. It is clear and concise of what needs to be done. I recommend this to all. It is the best spell book I have, It is powerful and worth it!"
"Poetically simple spells for every possible purpose. I bought this book after a friend shared a spell from it, and I've found it lovely to work with and extremely effective. One example - during Venus Retrograde, I had vivid nightmares multiple times every night, about people and places from the past, and using #678 immediately banished the dreams after no herbs or crystal work did. I am not usually drawn to direct spellwork in my magickal practice, but I would definitely recommend this book to others. The author covers a wide range of topics, and they're easy to modify for your own needs or materials on hand."
"Its bigger than I thought. I love the spells-they seem to be easily adapted also. Great book, especially for the price!"
"The introduction mentions karma re: not doing spells that cause harm (which you shouldn't be doing because that  is not good energy to invoke, plus what you do comes back to you). Yet there is a spell to ""Turn Your Cheating Boy- or Girlfriend into a Woodlouse or a Cockroach or Worse"". While this spell is metaphorical -you visualize turning the cheater into something icky but small, therefore having no power over you, and send it away-  it still incites a certain amount of negativity. The Powers That Be can be fickle; something REALLY bad could happen to the ex, like actual physical harm, due to their now helpless condition. It'd be better to do a spell trapping your PAIN and Anger and the Power that this person had over you into a handful of sand, then take that sand and throw it into any running water- ocean, river, aquaduct, storm drain, etc.- and as it disappears, visualize it melting into the element of Healing (Water) and going away so that you can be free and healed (extra karma points if you are capable of including Healing for him/her).This book also cites that its spells will call for ""simple materials you'll find in your kitchen cupboards, the garden, the supermarket, or online"". One spell calls for a fairy ring, which is a circle of growing fungi found in grassy or woody places. I've had a yard all my life and have never found a fairy ring there. No substitute is given, and a novice might give up without realizing store-bought mushrooms laid in a circle on your apartment floor will work.On the good side, it does say to not be OCD about any of the spellwork and to not be too worried if your candle doesn't light or you're wearing light yellow instead of white (although again, I disagree in some things she says like not to worry about the direction that you use when casting a spell. Moving clockwise vs. counterclockwise DOES indicate different intents and produces opposite results. When you go through a door, the direction you take matters as you can end up either inside or outside.In actuality, one can do a simple yet powerful spell even with just a candle, but some rules, like moving in the right direction and invoking the right Element(s) for your purpose, should be followed.To be fair, I have yet to find ONE book of spells that is the Only One to use. Spellbooks are like cookbooks in that each one will provide different materials, instructions, and procedures for producing the same result, and ultimately I do like the author's writing that ""true magick comes from the heart, soul, and mind, and if you have good intentions and the spell really matters to you, there is no wizard in the sky to mark you on a scale of 1 to 10"".....and that is certainly something I agree with and thoroughly believe in.So I'm keeping it because, upon flipping through it, there is a lot of good stuff, but I would NOT recommend this for a Beginner."
"I’ll start off by saying that this is not a terrible book, but it could definitely improve. when i received it, about 30 pages in one spot were all bent inward and wrinkled, i was able to bend them back but they’re still a little wrinkled, but not the authors fault. Now to the actual SPELL part, some of these are not even spells, like the “teen” section, its very sarcastic and they’re all just fake spells. maybe just for fun, but I disagree with them as I feel like it can make young witches feel as if they’re not taken seriously. not THAT big of a deal but still such an odd section to include, especially since teens could use spells for healing, and dealing with negative emotions and other things. Gave the impression that the author was running out of ideas. Maybe that’s just me lol."
"The book has a ton of spells, everything from how to get someone you like to notice you, how to distance yourself from negativity, how to protect yourself, how to get lucky on exams, to how to attract wealth to yourself. I would say this book isn't for beginners, as it doesn't explain the details and principles of Wiccan (i.e. no harm done, keeping your work space clean, etc) but it's really the ideal book once you know how to use it. By the way, all the spells are white spells, so they don't harm anyone or anything.The quality is fantastic, I got this book pretty fast. Highly recommend this beautiful Grimoire."
"Closer to a C minus. Too much wasted effort towards Love and Jobs for starters. Those areas have always remained under the genuine category for me. While some of the spells have low  practicality in my assessment.  Any spell that takes more than three lines and four qualifiers to explain it's purpose is riding the edge of ridiculous, as opposed to the practical. My sense tells me there is just too much Wicca influence among these pages. Too bad that many of the pages fall short of universal application."
"This absolutely burns me up what they try to pass off as a part of our religion! This book is strictly for teenagers who believe that what you see in TV is real! If you are serious about your Craft then this juvenile attempt at spell casting is not for you! I feel beyond cheated, I feel  as if it were blasphemous at the very least."
"I actually really liked this book. It's got a lot of good ""spells"" and it's very inclusive. However I do wish it included more things rather than just repeats of the same spell. (Yes unfortunately it does that) Granted, some of them allow you to chose from different levels of difficulty and where you are on your journey but that is a little disappointing. For new practioners, and beginners I would suggest getting a Wicca for beginners book with this, as it doesn't tell you how to cast a safe circle, appease certain tricksters and release the corners. Not everyone follows the rules depending on what they practice but if you're a beginner I think it's best you know all that before trying anything from this book. A lot of ppl harp on the book because it doesn't give you the information you need to cast safely, but I think the book was intended for those who already know what they're doing. So just be safe and read up before you try it.Definitely a good book to have as part of your wiccan library."
"Its got 50 Love spells, 50 Money spells, 50 Career, 50 Health and Healing, 50 Holiday and Traveling, 50 Fertility, 50 Good luck, 50 Magick for the hearth and home, 50 Wishs, 50 Magick for all seasons and celebrations, 50 Animal, 50 Protection, 50 Spells for friends and neighbors, 50 Justice and Peace, 50 Spells for all seasons, 50 Astro, 50 Angel, 50 Spells for different ages and stages of life, 50 All kinds of magick, 50  Traditional Magick made new.  Each spell comes with detail instructions you must follow the way it states.  This book is good for any witch.  Or for whatever you are using it for.  But just remember the law of 3.  What you send out it will come back to you in 3 folds.  Blessed Be.  Harm none do as you will"
"A huge reason why I identify as a witch is because I love and respect nature. That’s why I was pretty horrified to see so many “spells” that involve littering. Please DO NOT release balloons into the sky!! This is bad! I also think it’s it’s not cool throwing things into a natural source of running water.I really wanted to like this book, but I just don’t resonate with her type of spellwork. To me, spells should be more about intention and personal power... these just felt like cute rhymes to use in petty situations.It takes a lot for me to return a book to Amazon, but I know I won’t be referencing this one ever."
"This book was awful. The table of contents did not match the pages, it was very confusing trying to find a specific page. The garbage can was it’s final resting place. Awful☹️"
"Just got the book.  Looked in index for ""selling house"".. See page 510.  Page 510 is ""to guide outdoor cats safely home at night""  Huh.....great"
The book is fine - packaging was lacking and caused damage to the book. The book was not wrapped and in a box with other items bouncing around. Amazon really needs to properly secure books for shipping. The book content is great but quality feels flimsy and light for a thick book. If that makes sense.
"Lots of Spells for just about anything under the Sun. Some require more ingredients than others to do for any one spell. You just have to find the one that fits your situation best or substitute the ingredients as needed. The pages were a little confusing when you're flipping through the book, and the table of content is off with the number on the chapter and pages. The quality of the paper isn't the best but it's a big book so maybe it's the best for filling up a big, thicker book."
"So I was curious what kind of spells I would be really getting from a book with 1001 spells and it really didnt disapoint. The book is sectioned out in a way where it is easy to find what you are looking for. There are some hidden gems also.There is a spell for almost ANYTHING or ANY SITUATION In this book! The spells are easy to read, understand and execute. You dont need a bunch of materials and they are so simple you can adjust to make them your own.This book can be for beginners or well seasoned practitioners. I think that there is a little something for everyone in here. I hope you enjoy is at much as I do."
Stop looking for spell books and look no further! This book has tons of easy to follow spells for your needs. It's a beautiful hardcover book filled with goodies you don't want to miss! It's a STEAL for the price too!  I highly recommend you buy this book before they are all gone! A definite addition to your witchy collection that is sure to please!
Came in great condition! Well organized.
"This is not for beginners, there is no introductory chapter explaining anything about spells, why/when you can and should use them, etc… this is not something you want to go into willy-nilly. There is definitely things you must do before and after spells that should be recognized in ANY spells book! If you’ve done this a bit (or have done your research) like myself, it’s not a horrible basic book. For those who have troubles with the index, don’t worry it took me a minute too… Like most indexes it gives you a page number, not a spell number!! For instance, weight loss says #398… this is page #398 spell #763!! Have fun!"
"This is my all time favorite spell book. This book is huge and the hardcover is beautiful. Looks so much better in person. It sounds weird to say, but even the smell of the pages is amazing. It has a vintage flare and every spell inside the book is simple to follow along or edit to meet your needs. They have one for almost anything you could need. Would recommend to anyone looking for a Wiccan spell book."
"I wanted to use this for a very specific reason and for guidance on spells and being more spiritually inclined..It was okay. Not bad but not great. The book did offer some very insightful details on how it's your spiritual journey, do as you see fit. I just didn't quite get what I needed out of the book. It's not the authors fault, they did a very good job of writing this book and for some people I bet this is the best book ever...but unfortunately for me, it was not."
"If you are looking for a cookbook of spells, this is just for you! Finally I have found a large collection of spells of every kind. The binding is beautiful and the pages feel satisfying to the touch. A book that gives off the heat of good vibes and teachings. A happy addition into my collection!"
Book came with a couple of pages partially folded in back of beek lile something was pushing in the edges for awhile got that straightened out though. While looking through the book and realizing there are aome spells that are just not useful and some that are seemingly useful. Not what expected but still nice for my collection
Among the best of it's type.

   Absolutely perfect! I bought this for a friend, and as soon as it got here I knew I had to order another for myself."
"This is spells and spells alone so not for those completely new to the craft.  So for all beginners take head to cleanse, plus, open, and close your circle.That aside, this book has nearly every spell you could need and many do not require hard or expensive tools.  Highly recommended."
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! As a fairly new Witch, and horrified to ever cast what I thought a spell was, I was/am ever-so grateful for this treasure grove that guides us through some ethics and realistic spells. I give it an ""A."" *I suggest to not jump into spells first though*"
"Live the book and the content! The only reason this is getting three stars is because i seem to be missing 33 pages. From 375 thru 407. It doesn’t look like anything was ripped, but clearly this is an issue with the publisher. Anyone else have this issue??!!Update!!: it’s not missing pages. The publisher left out pages 374-407 and pgs 407-438 are printed twice."
"The spells themselves are good and yes, there are a lot of them. But there are no page numbers, so unless you want to search through page after page, it's a pain in the behind. I don't use it, will be giving it away."
"A treasure trove of spells and you can never, ever go wrong with Cassandra Eason!!!  I love it!"
There is literally something for everything you can possibly think of in this book! Most do not require a lot of items and the book is really pretty!
I found this book to be a good book for spells. Of course not every spell in the book will I ever use. But their are many I will.
"Meh. Not very helpful, better books out there for sure- keep scrolling"
"Less is more. Have not found spell that feel right. Just don't feel a energy with this book. I will keep searching and perhaps makes some substitutions. Overall, do not recommend!!!"
this book is one of the best out there. I haven't tried any spells yet but after combing through the pages I can not wait to jump right in and begin.
This is a fabulous book that covers a wide range of subjects. I use it as a reference book. I like the binding also. Nicely illustrated and easy to read
That my book and read multiple pages of it and I enjoy reading it that’s a great spells and it was very helpful and simple to understand
"Book came quickly, it was packaged well, and the spells are well organized into categories.Easy to understand, perfect for any kind of witch out there."
I haven’t got to read everything yet but what I have read there is so much to it. Easy to read and I like that it puts when to do the spells. And there is a spell for anything and everything.
"And after reading it, decided that I'd buy a second for my sister, who is also practices the craft. That being said, it's definitely worth picking up."
Only thing is that there’s no description for the spells like I’ve seen in other books. So some are a bit confusing on exactly what to use the spell for.
"The book is simple, and really delivers into spells we all wish to cast. GET THIS! YOU WON'T REGRET IT. PS it's like 30 bucks @ Spencers, so this is a steal"
I received a COMPLETELY DESTROYED book that I’m unable to even OPEN! The only page I can see is ripped. The pages are all connected and then connected to the cover!!! Wtf is this?! DO NOT BUY THIS!
THIS IS AN AWESOME BOOK !!!!  IT'S OPENED MY MIND & MY CRAFT TO ALL KINDS OF POSSIBLES~~ BLESSED BE~~
Very easy to understand and read. The spells are explained perfectly and even a beginner can use!
Has a bunch of useful spells. It’s hard cover and very well made. Great quality. I was so happy with it that I bought 2 more and gave them as gifts and the recipients loved theirs as well.
Not easy to reference until you really sit and get to know the book and even then it's not easy
I am loving this book so much! My absolute favorite book in my collection. I just wish some of the ingredients were easier to find...or for cheap!
Interesting book.  I wish the print was darker.  It's on the light side so it's a strain on the no-so-young eyes.
Great price for this book and has a spell for pretty much everything.
Used some of these spells and they were extremely effective
I've only skimmed the book so far because it really does have 1001 spells but they are all so simple and easy to understand.
I like this book it has super easy spell with items that are to get or you have hem on hand already. Great book I will be looking for more great read by the author. Thank you Cassandra Eason
Has a lot of spills in it aren’t as easy to do is I thought that was going to be
"Bought this as a gift for my sons bday, he absolutely loved it."
I haven't had much time to flip through the book but what I have looked at has been great. Simple spells with simple ingredients.
This is the first spell book that I have purchased and I am so glad I did. I would highly recommend.
This is a great book with a lot of resources... I like to use as a primer and change around what fits more to me !
Not exactly what I expected. Not really a spell book more of rituals.
Wish it was in order according to topics but it’s what is says it is a book of spells. It is very beautiful and if you understand the whys you can definitely make some your own .
My friend recommended this book and i'm SO happy I purchased it. It came super fast as well. So many spells for all different reasons. Love it
"Love, love, love. Great for beginners and experienced one!"
I like it I just was expecting jars and potions but it’s more of “vocal” spells
Great book that has every spell you could ever need
"It's a nice positive spell book. There are no bad, negative, evil curses. Examples, good fortune, wealth, happiness etc."
"I bought this for my wife, and she loves it."
"As long as don't take the spells seriously,  it's fine.  Honestly, more joke than truth"
so many crazy spells and very good ones
Perfect addition to any witches library!
Spells for almost every situation.
Lots of spells to learn and study.
"Pretty concise book, but doesn't cover as many different topics as I'd like."
I really like the book it’s big and easy to read mine came a little damaged from one corner but overall good value
Wonderful book that I cannot put down..Blessed Be!!
Good beginner book
"The ONLY thing I didn't like about this book is that there are no page numbers. At all. Makes the table of contents pointless and makes quick referencing difficult. Other than that, this book is great! Spells for any occasion or situation!"
Very pleased. Offer so much
Gift for sister
This was a gift.
I love this book!!! Very informative.
I love this book. so much information on different spells.
"Good book, useful information, but a lot of unaccessible things needed for most spells"
Great book! Although many spells to combat specifically; antisocial people that I don't quite get...
spells for  everything  you can think of except no curses or hexes
"not sure what to say except it’s a good book i love it, it has so many spells for literally everything and it tells you exactly what you need for the spell and how to do it"
Perfect for curiosity or actually using them for spellwork
Amazing’ I love this book! Very organized sections! A must have!
Good spells for a pagan. Be careful with this book.
This is a gift for a special person. Looks interesting..
"Good book, easy to follow"
very informative
This book is not what it represents it's more of a collection of useless data than actual working spells
My fav spell book
Beautifully put together and much bigger than I thought! Can't wait to use it!
"Great spell book, there are some interesting spells for all occasions! The service was great as well!"
I love this book!!! It has so many useful spells and easy to follow instructions. I will defiantly be buying more from this author.
A Spell For Anything Possible. Great read
some of the spells on her just don't really work out for urban/modern day witches. if you are looking for examples of spells honestly just search online grimoires instead.
The book is amazing but the box came slightly crushed and the bottom of the book bind was torn. It didnt ruin the book but I like to keep my books in good condition kinda made me sad.
This book has a spell for every occasion. It has everything you are looking. If you are looking for a book with nothing but spells.
love
Great book
Fast shipping! Product as described!
Just got my book and wow! It exceeds my expectations! I can’t wait to really dig deep and start working with some of these spells!
Very fast delivery.  Book is perfect and highly recommend to buy from.
"was given as gift, came fast and exactly as described"
This is an awesome book and I would recommend it to anyone
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
        
    










  
  
    
   It had a lot more than I expected. I can’t wait to read tonight. Great for beginners."
"Dislike when I first opened my book, the seam/binding was already coming undone!"
Plenty of spells for beginners or long time witches!
Very interesting book.
"I bought this for my daughter, and she is in love with it!"
This book has everything that you would ever need. It has loads of spells that are right for every occasion. I would 100% recommend it.
This book just doesn't have many spells that speak to me. There is 1001 but yet i can only find a few that i would actually do. Also doesn't give enough details.
Absolutely love the book. Can't say yet whether or not the spells actually work....
I love book can't wait try some of spells. Very easy instructing.
So many ideas and uses it’s perfect
I love this book. It has a good variety and most of what's inside is practical.
I love my book.
I love it. My only complaint is that the words are small and blue. Very hard for me to see
This book is fast becoming my go to for spells. It has a wealth of information. Love it!
Super basic.
My daughter lives it
100% would buy again. Has everything and more! Also perfect for a witchy gift. 10/10
Slot of the spells are not based in a particular order and alot go against basic beliefs of most  people practicing witchcraft. Would have given a one star but felt over all that it rated at least a two.
"Very beautiful looking book, got it for my girlfriend and she loves it."
Amazing
Good read
Its was a great jam packed encyclopedia of spells. I am excited ti see results. Very informing and interesting too.
Love it
Love this book.
This book is so far so amazing and very informative
Beautiful book! Love the colors and presentation!
"easy to use, wonderful organized layout, great for me as im just venturing into this aspect of the practice"
"Thick book, great spells. I was very happy with it"
Beautiful book
Informative
This book surprised me wonderfully because I didnt expect a grimoire so complete in the kindle store but I'm glad it was like this
"Used item in pretty good condition.  Price was a little high for being used (listing stated used, but said nothing re writing being in the book), but otherwise item is as described."
I love the book but unfortunately it came water damaged in one corner. The pages are wrinkled (would love a replacement)
The pages came bent.
"I loved this book. It is easy to use, it has like a recipe book layout. variety of spells easy for beginners like me"
Way bigger then I expected. Great value
Good book
"I love my book,ty💜"
Very thorough
Cool for kids or teenagers. Nothing of great substance
Such a beautiful book! It's much bigger than I thought it would be. Just a gorgeous book. So many practical spells! Love it!
It’s Stright too the point no extras. It really is 1001 spells. A bigger book then I thought but nice touch too it!Photo is book comparison size.
i love how informative this book is
There are no banishing spells!! No dark work spells!!! What the heck? Peaceful a** book!! Sometime so need to rock somebody’s mf world!!
Great book for someone like me that isn't comfortable writing their own spells just yet.
"I like it, don't love it because I would really really prefer numbered pages and actually a detailed contents list. It makes it hard work trying to find where things are, all it provides are the chapters and you have to grab chunks of pages and flick through to find the chapters! I would of also liked it to have an explanation of each spell, letting you know about it and where you can best use it, and handy hints to help. So there's a bit of guess work involved with them. Also, and this is kind of major, some of the spells are impossible in the winter time! I'll have to wait till the weather warms up again to do the ones I want to do! Because they involve the ocean or lake or body of water. There should of been a spell provided with much easier solutions as an alternative, for the ones that require things that are difficult. It's below zero here where I am, with snow, not going to freeze to death getting to water, and also don't want to be seen by the whole world doing it either!! haha. Nothing worse than people wondering what you're doing and looking like a freak of some kind. haha. I haven't done any spell yet because of this issue. Might update later if I complete one and it worked."
Better and bigger then expected!
I love this book. I got this for my own self healing and I see how it can be useful for my friends.
The best
wasn't I was looking for personally but its a nice book
The book has a lot of different spells they just weren’t for me. Seemed a little more kiddy than I would have liked it to be.
This was for my sister
"Bought as a Christmas gift, Book is legit!"
This book is the tits for spells for almost anything and everything
Love this book
"Nice size, fast shipping."
Just as described.
"Love it! It's a hard cover book and its pretty big! Likeitsays;""1001 spells"" Just have to put it to use ;) IT HAS A ""SOULUTION FOR EVERYTHING"""
I really love this book its got some great stuff in it!!
"i love this book, it's complete and it's perfect!!! i'm a newbie, myself, but it gives all the info you need and it has beautiful spells that you would love to make"
Seems like a great book but they sent/charged me for 2 when i only ordered 1. Now I just have 2 of these
Very nice book. I would highly recommend it to others
A book with great spells. Easy to navigate and understand. It just feels magical!
It has a variety of spells and necessities!
It was very good item
Omg I loved this book and it really helped hope you also get this book shd dd d dd d d
"Okay spells. Nothing to write home about. You might be able to find a spell for almost every situation, but the validity of said spell is questionable"
Great book. A spell for everything!
I love it
Love it
"Nicely organized, good read."
It was not what I was expecting the spells are childish. Not really my cup of tea
Love it
The one spell work
Wonderful! So useful! Great resource to have!
SO many spells! Pretty easy to follow along
Love love love it
Beautiful have already started looking through very pleased with it
Very nice hard back book. Concentrated on positivity. Would recommend this to my friends
"We have this book at my local library and I loved it so much, I bought my own! I've already used my first spell!"
This was a gift for a friend and she loves it.
So many spells.....so little time!  Love this book!
Really good spellbook!
Very nice book
I would recommend.
Absolutely love this book. A perfect addition to my library. Thank you!
Love it! Came very prompt!!
Has a lot of pages! And it’s amazing
High school spell book .meh
Gave as a gift. She loved it!
i love this book.
"Beautiful book, lots of good spells."
amazing!!!!
Performed a ritual that came to pass the same day.
The only spell book you will ever need
I love it
This book is fantastic.
"I have never seen a spell book that was this comprehensive! You will not need another spell book after purchasing this one! The book itself is beautiful, my favorite purples and pinks, but it's also a good sized feels substantial in your hands. There are pages and pages of amazing spells, more than I ever seen my life, and I'm already marking pages to come back to."
Very pleased!
It was okay. Most spells in here require too many ingredients though.
Absolutely amazing. Has a spell for everything!
I love it!! Has everything I need!!
Took up an interest in spells and wicca related things; this was reccomneded to me by a friend and it's really cool and helpful!
very basic
"This item arrived in great shape and was exactly how it was described. It was a gift and, when I presented it, the recipient was thrilled. She loved it and couldn't stop looking through it all evening. She made positive comments about what she found in the book."
All I needed
We love the size.
It’s okay it does have a lot of different spells but not what I expected.
Great book
10/5
Absolutely love it! And it’s huge!!
Love it its a big book im super excited i got it
Very fast delivery. Only problem I have is that the corners are a little bent
Loved!
Good book to have in the library.  Even though some of the spells seems simple. Good for a novice spell maker.
It's a beautiful book
I loved it very good quality and easy to read
"So I was searching for voodoo and this came up. When I got back from the store, this, and a few other items were on my porch. So as far as shipping, this gets five stars. When I first opened the book, there was a really good authors note, telling the reader about how the author spent 40 years researching and writing this book, and how on the last year, she had a really bad illness but, her family helped her finish this book, which shows her dedication and about how much she cares that the reader has a good experience. The book is put well together, and has a section for each of the spells. Over all, this book is easily 5 stars!"
A good book with practical spells
"I love the variety of spells, but I wish there was an index. Also, my copy came with some pages partially ripped :("
"I saw the same book at the book store for much more money! Great book, easy reading."
This is a good book but it is lacking things and could use better organization so that it isn't scattering you by best days to use.
"This books spells are need some many stuff to me.For example, need some many candles or many materials.It's doesn't simple to me.I had expected for something more practical and simpler. But it's doesn't to me.It's my personal opinion."
I am so happy I bought this book!!! Its very beautiful and very easy to read and understand. Most of the spells are used with simple household stuff. Great book and speedy shipping!!!!!
"LOVE IT.. GOOD QUALITY,GREAT SPELLS.."
"Great book, excellent condition."
"Very informative & easy step by step,A lot I didn't have and am having fun learning them...!"
Beautiful book and I luv it but I think the spells are not well put together
"To be fair, I cant say anything about this book as I bought it for my wife. She likes it though!"
Lots of spells I mean for mostly anything no evil spells lol and the ingredients aren't hard to get. I did a money spell .... let's just say I'm still waiting
Great addition to my magic library
Seems easy enough. Spells for everything.
Love this book!!!!!
As expected.
the book provides many folk lore stories.
"Awesome book, easy to read."
This book will be put into use. I love being a Prime member.
Good book. Great for advance Wicca
LOVE IT
Good information in this book. Haven't tried anything yet. But will.
"I haven't read cover to cover but from what I have read, she dont ask for rare hard to find items, which is great. It's a bigger book than her Spell A Day, which i enjoyed. Spell A Day was abit too small in my hands, this one is abit more normal sized."
I love this book!
"When i resive this book I was happy but when i start to read it I was so disappointed, the speel in this book is just joke I don't see one that I would try.  I think when I get the book I would have what I am looking for,  nothing like that the book only big that all about it nothing more."
Very nice
Lovely book for the price
Thank you !!!! :-)
Good book
"Gift for a friend, but it looked nice upon flipping through it"
"Product was definitely not new.  Looked like a cat had chewed all along the top cover and the back leaf was broken, oddly, in the very center, as if the book had been hurled forcefully at something (a person's head? a rock?).  Won't impede research, of course, but certainly not what I paid for."
KIDS BEEN WATCHING TOO MUCH SUPERNATURAL
"I had the book, didn't like it pretty much immediately, sold it quickly after. I've been doing this for a while (not right hand path, white or light magic) but it seemed interesting due to the reviews & apparent variety; most of it is just garbage. It requires odd & specific ""ingredients"" that almost no one has (at least not on hand) & maybe pretty hard to even obtain & utilizes them in ways that didn't make sense to me, as a seasoned practitioner. I didn't use anything from it or gain any new, helpful information. It tells you how to do ""spells"" but it has nothing to do with witchcraft basics, or anything like that; so as someone who doesn't consider themselves a beginner, it MAYBE good for someone who is, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone starting out either way.  Of course, you expect there to be some fluff when it comes to a book of this size, claiming to have over 1,000 spells in it, but to me it just seemed like thats what over 90% of it was."
"I’ve always wanted this book and I finally achieved that... only to be disappointed.The spells are all over the place. I personally go to the protection section a lot, but it’s just baby related things. I don’t have a baby. The Table of Contents says certain spells start on a page, but the chapters don’t line up like that.Protection spells starts on 287 according to the TOC. There are no page numbers in this book at all, just spells by numbers. That spell number is ACTUALLY listed under the “Giving birth and early days of life” category that’s not even mentioned in the TOC.The spells are all over the place... I just want a simple house protection spell. I shouldn’t have to individually read through 1001 spells to find basic home protection. And if you’re going to have subcategories, at least list them in the TOC."
"I wanted a book of spells without fluff. I couldn't find any books other than this one that didn't have 5 chapters on how to do spells and what spells do, then a few listed toward the end. This book is just spells! They are basic spells that only require a few items to perform. I wanted quick and easy vs lots of items and things I would have to search for, or never heard of. Very impressed with this book. I will be using book tabs to organize for quick flip to what I need."
"I bought this in an actual bookstore and was honestly compelled by the design. I just flipped to a random page and was extremely disappointed to see a spell that literally told people to shake off glitter outside. That is just so dumb, irresponsible, and completely inconsiderate of the planet. How can I trust the rest of this book when this so-called witch doesn't even know about basic planetary mindfulness? Do not shake glitter outside, I beg you.P.S. you really shouldn't be buying something like a spellbool from an evil mega-corp like Amazon. I just wanted to review it for you."
"Majority of spells are either too specific, something from a movie or TV show, or simply just crap. Don't waste money."
"This is a great book, but you can't be new to the craft and use this. You have to already have knowledge about the basics of witchcraft. It's missing important steps from casting your circle to proper disposable. Along with other important steps and things you need to know to make the spell more effective. But for more advanced witches, this book is very helpful."
"Love this book. 1001 truly has spells for anything.  I also, so far, have not seen any overly complicated or with so many tools you need (candles ect.) spells that you end up in the poor house.  lol Really good reference book"
Love this book! Lots of interesting spells. A little bit of everything.
"I didn't buy this book from Amazon but this is a great spell book that can help with most ""normal"" situations. I've been struggling to find a job for the last two months and then I used spell number 51 for ""Instant Money"" and it said to wait 12 hours before getting again if I didn't have any results. That next morning I got a call from a clothing store. They asked if I could come and do an interview that same day. I went in and she only asked a few questions before she printed out my paper work. I got the job that fast. I feel like Spell 51 contributed to that a lot and I'm grateful."
"This is a beautiful book. It's aesthetically pleasing and simple. Just spells - anti-dogmatic, you may apply them in any practice. Worth it!"
"This book is one of the most ridiculous, jevenile pices of rubbish I have ever encountered."
Interesting!
Just wondering does this book of spells really work and has anybody done a love spell before and it actually work and I'm talking about a person falling in love with that person
Another amazing easy to read book by Ms. Eason who in my opinion is the one and only expert on this subject. There is every spell 'under the sun' in this thick encyclopedic style book easily obtainable ingredients. Buy it and I promise it's well worth the money.
Nice book!
"Does this book have a spell for gutting a fish and laying up its heart,  gall, liver?"
"fake and not worth the $13, sorry i wish it was real too."
Bought used. If I could give a 10/10 I would.This book is really helpful. There’s about 2 spells on each page. I have my book with about 60 sticky notes to mark pages.I plan to try these spells ASAP.The ingredients aren’t hard to find at all.These spells are easy enough for beginners to use. A variety of spells for any person. The spells are easy enough for someone young or old. They even include spells for pets. If I come across someone who needs a specific spell.. this will be the book I refer them to.
"I LOVE this. I’ve only gone through 1/4 of this book and I’m baffled at the variety and it’s not like other spell books where you have to have 10 different things for one spell that you wouldn’t possibly have right on hand. The ONLY thing I don’t like about this book is the table of contents tells you the different sections on certain pages, but they number each spell. So, fertility spells might be on page 132 but if you flip through the pages and see #132 it’s still in the money spells section. The actual pages aren’t numbered. It’s literally no big deal though. This is an AWESOME buy."
"Used a protection spell and a confidence spell on my friend and she broke up with her abusive boyfriend that night LOL SHOOK. love this book though, really simple spells and I just LOVE how they're laid out in the book."
I like that it has a lot of spells and that’s easy to understand most stuff easy to get and it’s easy to do
I am so happy to order this book it gets so many spells did I can work with I hope there she have another book then I can buy
This books is awesome!!!!! So much in here! Excited to use it etc!
Love love love this book! If you are considering buying it just do it!
I have learned so many different spells with just this book alone! It has also helped me and given me a basis to build my own Book of Shadows on and I have this book to thank for that!
"Every heavy duty hardcover, well binder love it!!"
Would recommend for beginners that can’t decide what book to get
Great little spell book!
🤘🏻
Love it
I just received this book last Saturday and I did my first working on Monday out of the book and it has been working like a charm all week!! This book has a little bit of everything in it. I love it.
I absolutely love my new spell book spells are easy to follow or add on to I'm very happy with my spellbook
No dislikes
"I bought the for my daughter's birthday. She absolutely loves it! It does have everything you need for every purpose and true to the astrology of the universe. I highly recommend this amazing book. Also it's beautiful and we'll written. The information is short and to the point so you don't have to read between the lines!!! I will buy it again for myself!!!? Love it, will be cherished."
Good book. Bigger than expected. Recommend!
Fall in love this book yall
Fab book. Loads of spells which are easy to follow. So far they have worked. Very happy.
"Very helpful for dipping in and out of especially when having a creative block for your own spell work. Certainly not a guide book that I would follow strictly as very basic and simple spells which is great for beginners and for getting the job done. But I certainly will keep this with me lifelong. Anyone who decides to buy the book, please look into the 'world peace web spell', it takes all of us working as a team to get this one going. blessed be x"
"Where do i start? Right from the beginning when you wanna read the chapters, you go to the index chose the numbers  assigned to each chapter, right? WRONG!  Forget that here, I cannot understand the index of this book, the numbers are just random (maybe I should use these index  for the lottery i sure would get better luck) they should guide me to the chapters, pages that  i want but I find reading something totally different from what I thought I was looking for. Crazy, why I gave 3 stars rating. I am a fan of Cassandra Eason I have a  few old books from her,the spells are always very exciting, and  for each intent whether is healing, purification, you name it, I love her, but i think she was on trans on this one, or had  a few while compiling the final stages. I m at a loss!"
"This book is lovely and light for the amount of info in it and the spells look interesting and easy enough to perform.Highly recommend. Lost of spells to cover every area of life and pretty much every problem you may come across.  Let the magick help you and those you love to find a peaceful, happy loving life."
"Had the same one when I first started practicing but lost it. Couldn't believe it's still in publication. Sentimental and a great source of comfort. The hard back is BEAUTIFUL. I would just say that it's a struggle to use the contents as there are no page numbers in the book, but apart from that it's lovely. A spell for every occasion."
"Great book, something for every occasion and the spells don't require complicated ingredients or huge rituals. True witchcraft!"
Haven't had time to go through all the book but what I've seen looks real good
A usefulk and practical book of spells from a well known author. I am pleased that I now own a Kindle copy.
quick delivery nice easy spells can work with a positive attitude
"The book doesn't have page numbers. The spells have numbers, but they don't correspond to the chapters listed in the contents; you just have to flick through until you find what you're looking for, which is weird.Other than that it's a really nice book and pretty good value."
"Essential book for every witchy person. Spells for everything included, easy to use and most ingredients are things you'll have at home or can easily purchase"
A well written and comprehensive book on the subject of spells. Clear and easy to read and use.
Excellent book as always loads of spells which don't need lots of stuff to practice them. Excellent delivery as always.
Like this book very much has literally all the spells you will need
A wonderful looking book the Recipient was overjoyed with it! Great gift
"Well written and easy to reference through the index at the back. Fantastic selection of practical spells for all situations and seasons and can confirm that they have helped and worked in my personal practice. 10/10. If you’re thinking about getting this book, I wouldn’t hesitate. 🥰"
"So many great ideas! Easy to read, she doesn't bring anything too complicated or difficult to find!"
Easy to follow and interesting things to discover and you don't need to be professional
"Awesome book! My 3rd book by Cassandra Eason. She never fails to deliver to the purpose. The spells are super easy-much to the convenience of a novice, as long as the intent is pure and purposeful. I love all Eason’s book for the same reason-no jazz and frills with all her spells & rituals. This book is a treasure trove of spells for the tiniest concern one may have. I’m gradually building up my Eason & Cunningham library, for one coz their books are best sellers, also expensive (in INR) and mainly because you never know when they’re OOP and hard to find. I’m just still halfway through this book and am amazed at the simplicity of the spells, trust me I’ve read many ancient books that call for elaborate rituals, rare & gross ingredients and honestly, I never will delve into that stuff, but Eason delivers such pure and clean methods who’s outputs are just the same. Buy it while you can. Eason’s books are packed with information & knowledge and no, you won’t regret it one ounce. Seller shipped quick. A+++"
"The best book  ever, I help people and this book works , highly recommend...... 😄💞💚💜💙💚💞"
"This is such a great book  to have,  great spells , easy to follow just amazing ."

I love this book its awesome...and very useful for witches and if you not  witch then you need to understand Lot's of things...but allover awesome book useful for me ... great spells ..great book ..hard cover....and yaa this is Smalls good tooo
"Excellent quality, very simple spells but as the title says, it's not for everything. There are only a few very common topics"
Great book but its all fake it says just for fiction
Good book with lot of spells for different types. Gives very basic steps for each spell. For beginners Easy  spells can be easy to Used from this book.However detailed information on conducting spells not given especially for beginners.For advanced users this book is more useful.
"Es macht seinen Job. Es ist schön gestaltet, die Anleitung ist meist sehr verständlich (sofern man Englisch kann) die 'Zutaten' hat man oft entweder zu Hause oder kann man leicht besorgen. Meistens versteht man auch sehr gut was der Spell bewirken soll nur ab und zu muss man ein bisschen darüber grübeln. Zur Wirksamkeit kann ich noch nichts sagen bzw. ist das auch eine Glaubensfrage"
Awesome book and good quality print!!! Love it!!!
En este libro encontrarás muchos hechizos que son muy útiles para los problemas de hoy en día. Además el formato es precioso. Lo recomiendo encarecidamente.
"I am very happy with my purchase! It is exactly as described. And it is such a beautiful book, inside and out! Well worth the money I spent."

Literally a spell for anything!!!
Lovely book
Awesome book!
"It  had attempted to carry out a good luck spell, in the late month of December 2016 only to discover that approximately, 3 days later, my car was stolen off my driveway......May be it was pure coincidence, that it had happened....or may be the timing that I had carried out the spell was wrong and as a result, the spell backfired on me!!!  But I had also read somewhere, a few weeks later, that carrying out spells, such as protection, career opportunities, good health, contentment and peace of mind etc, should be done when the moon is waxing and NOT when the moon is waning.....I guess, this may explain, where I went wrong......but I won't condone this book, as I will give it another go, in time but with a lot more caution!!!As I am a beginner on making spells, I should have carried out more investigations before purchasing this book...but as they say experience teaches wisdom!!"
"This book is a large, thick encyclopedia style book with just about every single spell included! There is everything from dealing with bad neighbours, anti-social behaviour, to love and finding and keeping it! This is an amazing book from the Master of all things Magickal."
great book.
A spell 4 every occasion.
"Perfect, just perfect I love it!"
"I was really excited about receiving this one but it turned out to be very ""white magic"", light and fluffy, to the point where it made me sick.I ended up giving it away."
Perfect!
Informative
Very good book. I'm so happy to get this book
"Arrived on time, exactly as decribed.. Can't wait to read it!"
I love it. Clear and simple. Thanks again and delivery was first class and arrived right on time.
Interesting book
"Beautiful deck, very detailed descriptions of the aspects of Kali in the accompanying book. My only warning is the same that comes with Kali mantras: If/when you call the goddess into you life, prepare for radical shifts. Kali is as much the goddess of destructions as she is the divine mother. She will burn down the areas of your life that are not serving you, the blockages keeping you from where you are meant to be. You have to be ready and willing to experience major shifts, or else they might hit you harder. Just know that whatever the goddess burns away, it is only to make room for more beautiful things in your future. Jai Maa Kali!"
"This deck was gifted to me by a sweet soul sister of mine as we both share a connection to Ma Kali. Kali has been a powerful presence within my life, and she’s not for the feint of heart. She will guide you through POTENT transformation! But oh is it all so worth it. This deck is absolutely STUNNING. The artwork, the prayers, the energy of the cards as well is just truly divine. I love how Alana explains in the booklet about Kali’s energy for those who may not already know. I feel it’s important to read that first. Alana is one of my favorites when it comes to oracle cards, and you can feel how Kali worked with her in channeling through this deck. If you feel drawn to Kali’s energy, then this is a wonderful deck to have in your collection! I will say again, the potency of her energy is beautiful, but approach with respect always.  Having worked with the deck once already, I somehow dropped a glass jar of turmeric, it shattered all over the floor, but it was only the bottom of the jar. I knew it was a message from Kali. That’s just one example of her energy, what seems like a shattered “mess” is truly the liberation needed."
"I got hooked on Alanna Fairchild’s work when somebody pulled a card for me out of her Earth warrior deck. I bought it immediately. Then I discovered her Mother Mary Oracle. At the time I was experiencing a major crisis in my life that led to a dark night of the soul. I had nothing left in me. The Mary deck in conjunction with Rebecca Campbells Work your Light deck got me through months of crisis. I love her decks because of the visualizations and prayers that are included with the cards interpretations. I had nothing left inside to even Come up with a prayer. I was pulling cards up to Three times a day to get through and they were always right on target and always gave me hope. I learned how to surrender and felt comforted. It was truly a tower card experience and that’s where I discovered strength in Kali so you can imagine my excitement when she came out with a Kali deck! I even pre-ordered for the first time in my life and was so excited that it came early. when I need to comfort I turn to Mary. When I need strength I turn to Kali. And if you resonate with Alana. No deck is a disappointment. I do readings for others and I always start with her Crystal Mandala Oracle. I Call it the n your face deck and always ask people if they’re ready to hear truth or I won’t use it. These cards are amazing, life-changing and they have taken me to a life I have never thought possible! If you were looking for spiritual growth, you will find it here. I highly recommend all her decks I own most. Depending on what you need, where you are at in your growth, there is always the right and perfect deck to use"
"This deck, like previous ones by Alana Fairchild, is a great tool to connect with the divine feminine energy of the goddess Kali. I've always been curious about Kali and I'm glad to have this deck in my hands. Everything about this deck resonates with her fierce and abrupt energy, from the meanings of the cards and the guidebook and the astounding artwork. And not only this deck is great by itself, but it works well along the other Goddess decks by the author."
"I can't remember exactly how I learned about Kali, but I'm so glad I did. She's helped me so much and the more I get to know her, the safer and more loved I feel. I'm going through a horrible divorce and need guidance. As I looked for Kali-related things on Amazon, this Kali Oracle came up and I bought it instantly. I'm so glad I did!!!!These cards and messages have literally saved me from doing irreversible damage to myself and others. Whenever I need some guidance, when I need Kali the most, I use this deck to help me. The art and messages are beautiful and so awesome. You won't regret buying these!"
"I know that in the  small ""TarotTube"" community on YouTube, this deck has been controversial.  I had my doubts when I ordered it, but once I looked at the images and held the deck, I noticed its beauty and power. Mother Kali cannot be contained. I do not support cultural appropriation but I also believe we need to be open to new visions and perspectives. Perhaps the artistic expression in this deck is not for everyone, but it is clear to me, the creator cared about what she was doing. Also Kali is not the only goddess deity who has been re-interpreted. Look at all ways the Black Madonna has been re-imagined.  As an individual with strong ancestral roots in Italy, should I be offended that people outside of my culture are including images of the Black Madonna in tarot decks?"
"This deck is everything I hoped it would be! I have been hotly anticipating the release of this deck in the US for months now and I am so happy with it! I own a few of Alanis Fairchild’s decks and each one is the phenomenal but this one really speaks to my soul. I have been working with the Kali energy and this deck turns up the intensity of our experience together. The artwork is captivating and radiates the wide breadth of the expressions of Kali. The cards & book are insightful, provocative and very deep. I am in deep gratitude for the consistently inspired gifts that this author shares. If you are interested in working with the radiant transformative energy of Kali Ma this deck is perfect. Blessings on your journey ~"
"I love this deck! I have done readings for myself and for friends. I highly recommend this deck to anyone interested in working with goddesses, specifically Kali, or someone wanting to connect deeper to the Divine Feminine/Divine Mother energy. It comes with a very in-detail guidebook and the artwork is truly beautiful in my opinion."
I am in complete awe of these cards they are beautiful and the energy is unreal..I was too excited to open them
"I have been wanting this Oracle Deck since I first saw it as Kali is One of My Divine Feminine Deity Spirit Guides and as soon as I opened the Box I was OVERWHELMED WITH Her Spiritual Presence with Me. I was Guided to shuffle the deck 1 Time and then split the Deck and I received Card 11 and Card 22 and then I was Guided to shuffle the deck 1 more Time and take the Bottom card from the Deck. First 2 Cards 11 & 22 are Master Numbers and I knew that I was going to get exactly what I was meant to receive Upon My First Reading for Myself and the Bottom Card was 16 which is the number 7 in numerology. The Reading was absolutely AMAZING & SPOT ON with My Life, the cards shuffle like a DREAM not TOO Big but not TOO Little but just Right for my small hands. The pictures Colors The guidebook everything about this DECK has EXCEEDED ALL EXPECTATIONS AND MORE!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ORACLE DECK to everyone and anyone who is trying to decide should they purchase the DECK I Say ABSOLUTELY YES!!"
The information is incorrect in the booklet about Kali. The names and explanations are not right. Kali is the almighty goddess in Hindu religion. To use that as a oracle card with misinformation by someone who is not qualified is not correct. It borderlines cultural appropriation.
Oh my gosh are these cards ever beautiful and superb card stock!!  Nice and large which I like in an oracle deck and so far every single one of Alannah's decks have been awesome!!  Can't wait to a reading!
"This deck is beautiful amazing and I love how they depict her! Bold and vibrant colors, very informative, very relatable, raw and real. Definitely felt her presence over my shoulder as I did a flip through! And flip a card out that I definitely needed to hear. The book also gives suggestions and ways to invoke her. Just effing love it entirely."
"Not only are these cards beautiful beyond expectations, their impact felt more than visual. I am thankful they are now available again. Also appreciate that Amazon shipping was fast and efficient."
Beautiful ❤️ Beautiful ❤️ Beautiful ❤️.
The artwork on this deck is magnificent! As soon as I saw this deck I knew I had to purchase it! It has wonderful messages and will help you on your life path tremendously!
Caught off guard by how pretty this deck is. Book and explainations truly capture the essense of Kali and is a must have for any collector or oracle.
Everything about this deck I love except when it comes to doing live readings which I got it for I can’t do it because I cannot pronounce all the names of the cards lol but other than that it’s great and perfect card
"As with all Alana Fairchilds decks, this is absolutely perfect. Never ever disappointing"
This deck is soooo beautiful and powerful! The energy is real here.
Very deep work...Very powerful...WOW...
Another amazing deck by Alana Fairchild! I love working with these cards for insight and perspective. The supportive messages are so filled with wisdom and grace. Highly recommended!
Alana Fairchild is at the top of her game!
I am amazed at the quality of these cards.  Thoughtfully made for sure.
These cards are ABSOLUTELY gorgeous!!!!!!!
Kali is an amazing goddess.Alana does a great job with this deck!
Better than expected
"I haven't really used them too much, but it's an absolutely beautiful deck. Beautiful, detailed images. Nice, thick cards, and I love that it has the guidebook in the box."
This deck is a feast for the eyes. The artwork is just amazing.
"FANTASTIC addition to my decks. Powerful clear guidance, and the cards are beautifully designed and illustrated."
"If you feel called to this deck, go for it! Lovely messages."
Great quality and easy to do readings
"I live Alana Fairchild's decks and books, however some of the art really detracts from the power of the messages. This deck has the same artist that disappointingly did the art for the Isis deck, which I also love except for the art. In that deck, Isis, who should be depicted as a black Egyptian woman, and in this deck, Kali, who should be depicted as Indian, are both painted in the same white Barbie form (though the skin is sometimes green or blue). Even for the crone goddess form of Kali, she looks like she could be 17 - 26, definitely nowhere near ""crone"" age. They all look essentially the same between the Isis and Kali deck, regardless of the meaning of the card itself.As for the book, it would be helpful if there were a few keywords or key phrases attached to each card. As it is, the reading is very long, and while that is nice because it goes in depth, it can be hard to extract a clear and differing message from each of the cards, and the meaning can feel somewhat vague and similar to each other.All that said, I do enjoy the messages and rituals found in both these decks and all of Alana's decks, and do recommend them to others (after sharing my general critiques of each)."
"Kali is known as the black goddess, goddess of time & goddess death. Kali can be frightening to some until they become familiar with her story. Kali represents empowerment, so I was excited to start working with these cards.I documented my readings for three weeks before writing this review. The readings were accurate but required a bit of soul searching. I would recommend this deck for someone familiar with Tarot and Oracle to better understand the guidebook and artwork.Recommended Deck."
"I have had this oracle deck for several days now and I am always so fascinated and caught off guard when I pull cards because of how accurate they always are. Kali’s energy is so refreshing, clear, loving and so welcoming that simply feeling her energy makes situations flow with ease and peace. This deck works so well for me that I decided to buy 2; to only use one and savor the other, allowing it to be display. This came perfectly in the time of need. I will forever be grateful that this deck was created with depth and for building a personal and sacred connection to Kali and her ancient energy."
I’m a fan of several of alana’s other decks but this one feels very inauthentic.  It doesn’t capture the dark goddess if you actually know and love Her. It feels heavy and manipulative. Not sure what happened as I’ll continue to use other decks of hers that I like
"Unfortunately I had to order from a company in Australia as I missed my chance on Amazon. My only regret is not purchasing sooner. This deck is intricately designed, powerfully worded and the energy is just astounding. My readings have been nothing less than on point every time I've consulted this deck. Do yourself a favor and add this to your collection if you have the opportunity. You will not be disappointed."
"These did not feel like Kali to me. They felt more like the author's interpretation of Kali. Some of the images--I felt nothing. Like looking at a comic book. It was very strange, as it appears everyone else on here does like them. I was really bummed, as I like Kali and was waiting for it to finally be available. Oh well."
This deck is absolutely beautiful and you go into the many different aspects of Hindu Goddess Kali. The book is well written and the words are so beautifully written. Easy to shuffle and great card stock. I have no complaints! Three hoodoo sisters approved!
"Not for me. Really wanted this deck but was put off by art and darkness. I’d be worried about giving this to someone going through a dark night of the soul or hard time because it’s got a lower vibration with some twisted images. Note this above image of what reminds me of a clown crossed with a demon. But the book seems to be focused in a good direction. I didn’t read much after seeing the image above I felt it wasn’t a deck for me.  This at first glance seems focused on pain and suffering, working through it and being empowered through it. The art is dark and I was disappointed by that. The darkness leads me to wonder about the authors direction and alignment. Who would want to connect with or even put some of these immages into their mind? This deck is clearly for a specific audience. I’ve never felt anything but love for alanas decks. This is a hard pass for me."
"Just as I would do with any other usual oracle card deck, I begun with consecration of individual card on a smoking sage. As I progressed, at a point I felt completely overloaded in my temple and crown chakras and throat choked for breath and I quickly discontinued the consecration .Unlike the energy of Kali I’ve personally experienced, it was totally different. It appears to be tantric and extremely cathartic. Her gentler forms like Bhuvaneswari and Lalita Tripur Sundari too feel overwhelming. I personally have developed a separate kind of connection with Matangi in my real life , but if according to the card imagery I would have seen her for the first time, I’d never even think of connecting again with her. The Chamunda card at index 31 ( which looked like a further deformed Joker from Batman series) freaked me out. It was a wildest version of what we have in Kalighat shrine ( the gentler vibe).Goddess Kali was a raw ferocious energy upon the Day 1 of her creation. But she has evolved with gentility over time. The energy on cards is near to raw , and manipulative. It feels completely different.The common things with all cards is three intense piercing eyes , which I assume could have been gentler at some places. The imagery of Dhumavati looks incorrect. The crow and chariot and her old age are important associations that are missing. The Chhinmastika card must appear with blood being consumed by the head from body along with two other blood consuming entities. The essence of mother sacrificing herself to nurture others is totally absent. The Kalratri card is misspelled as kalararatri, which means night of quarrels thereby completely changing what Kalratri means. Durga is gentler version of Kali. I don’t know what three eyed intense skulls got to do with Durga. Fundamentally, skulls represent unsatiated desires of Adishakti when she failed to marry Lord Shiva in her incarnations preceding Parvati. So what those incompletion skulls are doing there which are already resolved by incarnation of Kali ? Kali never had a baby form, the child image lifted to the moon card is Lord Shiva as a child who sucked Kali’s anger from her breast.Kali is definitely ferocious but she has evolved over time so as to regulate her intensity over the devotee or channeller calling her upon.I’d really like to ask Alana Fairchild how did she go about this deck creation, her interactions and channelling with Kali , her choice of images ( which are incomplete and some lacking symbolism) and also why she chose the artist and how closely she was working with the artist. The deck is very much debatable and needs discussions."
I have been waiting for these to become available for ages and they were every bit worth the wait! I love these cards... All of Alana’s decks are amazing but these with KALI feel so powerful!!! I love the images and rich colours of the artwork.  Perfect for these times!!!!
I literally love the cards. If you're a beginner It may be difficult to interpret this cards meaning at first. But overall cards are very relatable. If you adore kali then it's a must have a lot of information in the book. Also use the invocations carefully they're very powerful and take care of the cards because Kali is not really the one to be messed with.
"I love this deck. It emantes strength, power, confidence and deep love. Every card has such in-depth message. One of the most fascinating point for me, being a Bengali and Kali Maa as a deity - her roots come from Bengal - the creator has done such a fantabulouslyfantastic job of not only researching the minutest details regarding the various facets of Kali Maa, but also, symbolised it with such characters and traits, let alone the design of each form (which will blow anybody's mind) as well as the chants that have been ideally translated from Sanskrit to English in the most apt manner. I cannot begin to say, how ecstatic I am to receive this deck and these cards.Also, an advise from my own personal experience, it speaks to only those who listen to their inner being the most. Don't buy to make it a part of your collection. Buy it only when you feel you are ready for these cards' strong blessings. They are gentle, yet serious cards. They are loving, yet imparts honest guidance into your life. I emersed my readings with this card with my chakra healing sessions with my co-creators and it always elates the experience, even if the same card comes repetitively, every time there is a new message during my healing, counseling, teaching, guiding sessions.PS to all the future buyers: remember you are a powerful being and these cards will boost you even further more.Blessings and Healings to one and all who played a magnificent and majestic role in creating this beautiful, abundant card deck.Thank you.Raeyna Mandal"
"It's a beautiful, powerful deck. You can feel the energy of it. The cards come up in sturdy box, which is also beautifully designed. The images are beautiful, for some they are very strong. But when you really go through them, Booklet you will get comfortable and feel the connection. Booklet has sufficient information to understand the card messages. I asked for the message, it's really guided me very well and I am following it. I have noticed that when you read from this deck, it's better not to use other decks. Give some break before using other cards, it has strong energies. When this deck entered into your life, change your lifestyle and come out from your comfort zone. You are entering into a different spiritual level. The creator made name mistake in one of the card, that's why deducted one star from it. I hope they will correct it soon. I am agree that we Indians knows many things in in-depth but I also believe if creator Alana created any blunder on name of Kali Maa, Maa will not make this happen. The images attached for your reference. Thank you seller to provide original deck and Amazon for good delivery."
A gorgeous deck with layered insights. A must have for anyone with an affinity to Hindi deities and cosmic consciousness. Works best for practiced channelers and nature worshippers.
One of the most beautiful deck I have. The messages are resonating very well and helpful. Kali made a lot of changes in my life and others too. But the process of change can sometimes be a bit painful but it's worth it. Just surrender.
Must must must buy deck I love the quality of the cards its beautiful smooth velvet finishing  and beautiful artwork and am so impressed with the deck love it so much
I love the aggressive colors and the wildness of Kali devi. The illustration can be very powerful and not meant for those who are faint hearted.

"Hermosas ilustraciones, inspiradoras incluso antes de consultar las instrucciones del oráculo."
"magnifique, kali parle a mon âme! par contre les textes sont forts longs, parfois vagues et trop philosophiques, et il est complique de tirer dans le livre a cote."
"Es hermosa, llego antes del tiempo estimado y en muy buenas condiciones."

Très jolies
