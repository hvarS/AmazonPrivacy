Review
"Dear Tabitha,Thank you, thank you, thank you for the delicious words you are feeding our souls. I am already into Part II and looking forward to finishing the main course. I get tickled because I can hear your voice in my head as I am reading. Wise beyond your years and divinely guided in love, you share lessons you have learned along your journey and for that we thank you. Finally, we thank you for being a shining example of how sharing and cultivating our gifts can lead to the life of our dreams. Also excited to try out some recipes. Y‚Äôall go get the book if you want, Cause that‚Äôs yo‚Äô business!"
"Often we see folk who have made it big and think they had no obstacles and have none now. Tabitha is clear that just like all of us, she‚Äôs had challenges and she shares her journey as a path to light our way. I read this book in one sitting. To God be the glory."
I ALREADY LOVE THIS BOOK! ‚ù§Ô∏è Very inspirational and empowering!
"Absolutely phenomenal so far! I had been looking for books specifically from those affected by autoimmune disorders, like myself, and when I read the description a few months ago, I knew I had to preorder it.Halfway through the first chapter, I immediately ordered it for a dear friend.As I‚Äôm reading, I can hear her calming words and tone and it makes it even better.Thank you for sharing your story with us, Tabitha! üíó"
I listened to the first chapter for free a couple of weeks ago and I couldn't wait to get the rest! Im giving you 5 stars just for being you Tabitha Brown ‚ù§‚ù§
I know this book is going to be amazing because Tabitha is an great inspiration!!!!‚ù§Ô∏è
"I read the book in her voice the whole time lol but on a serious note, I bought this book right before something very hurtful happened in my life and reading her words of wisdom and encouragement has really helped me. I've even thought about going vegan but I love seafood too much and that's my business :)"
Excited for my forever friend üíï

"This book came right when I needed it. I lost my father this year, mom became ill. This book was at my door on the day my job let me go. I have been taking it slow and reading and absorbing each chapter because there is so much wisdom and nuggets of knowledge throughout this book. Worth every penny and so happy I bought it as soon as she announced it for preorder!!"
I love Tab! Her personality shows through her writing. When I found out her audio book was in her voice I had to get that as well! She has such a humble spirit but she worked on it. Such a positive and uplifting message. I also ordered for my brother.  I wish I could order many copies just to give to people to lift their spirits. I've been following her for a while watching her vegan recipes...even tho I'm not Vegan. Just get it or the audio version or both like I did!!!
"I‚Äôve been following Tab since the TTLA video and have cried, laughed, and cut up with my Internet cousin, friend; mentor along the way. This audio book by Tab herself is a GEM!! I got it on CD to and Audible. Y‚Äôall Tab us a whole INSTANT NY Times #1 Best Seller & we cried together on that too!!"
"I am in the second chapter and Love it!!!  I work from home, in between calls this keeps me going!!  It's one of the best books that I've purchased.  Will report again when I finish it!  Which will be soon, I know!!"
I preordered the physical copy and the audible version and I‚Äôm so glad I did. I can seriously listen and read this book multiple times. This book is so inspirational and life changing. It gives you the push you need to follow your dreams and live your best. Amazing read!!!!
I got the audiobook and the written one because I need Tab to get me together when I am on the go! Just trust me and get this goodness in your life. Her goodness is real and this book is on time!
"I brought 3 hardcovers.  2 as gifts.  I got 1 hardcover for myself and the audible.  Tabitha‚Äôs voice warms my Heart and Soul and I just couldn‚Äôt pass up her Beautiful cover.  I‚Äôll probably be buying more.  Mrs. Tabitha Brown, May God continue to Bless You and Your Family Abundantly.  ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèΩ"
"Your message is your testimony.  I wasn't expecting to cry the ugly tears that I did but man, this book touched my soul in so many places and filled so many cracks. I got some work to do and I appreciate the loving way your book reminded me.  In the process of reading a part of your book, I actually stop and took action...I had to, I couldnt proceed without it..I was moved to action. In the coming days, I know I'll be moved to more action.  Thank you Tab for your life and transparency to the world.  To Patricia and all of the thousands of ancestors connected to you...thank you.  You birthed a REAL ONE."
"I loved everything about this book it is so relatable to me and what is going on currently in my life and I thank the Creator of All for sending this Earth Angel to us all. She keeps us uplifted, inspired and encourages Us to keep holding on. I haven't read a book in a good while and I am so glad that I chose this one. Tabitha Brown, I may not know you personally, but I sure feel like you have become a part of my Village and I thank you. Love and light to you and your village always!!"
"I am a big Tabitha Brown fan and follower.This book is definitely ‚ÄúFeeding my soul‚Äù.  All of her revelations and inspirations are very encouraging. I already know what I know, and know what I need to do to be the best version of myself, but, it‚Äôs also good to get a reminder. This is what this book is doing for me, reminding me to be the best me yet."
I‚Äôve been watching Tabitha Brown on social media for a couple of years now. She is such an inspiration and blessing to many. I finally ordered and received my copy of her book last Friday. I decided to get into it today and I can‚Äôt put it down. Thanks Tab for sharing your life‚Äôs lessons with us all. You are an amazing woman. You inspire so many people no matter the age. My 15 year old son even watches you on TikTok. We love you Tab! Keep doing what the good Lord has purposed you to do!
"Tab did not disappoint!!! So many nuggets!!! Read it twice in 2 days! It‚Äôs that good. Reaffirming positive affirmation, and self love. A win all the way around."
"When I see Ms. Tabitha Brown I listen closely because she has a presence about herself, and wonderful nuggets she's dropping to help better people in a troubled world, whether it's physical health or mental health. Thanks!"
"Loved the advice and personal stories.  WIsh it had more of her recipes. Since I am not on TikToc I have only heard about her famous carrrot bacon, I was hoping to find it here. I wanted to use this book as a jumping off point to staring to have a vegan lifestyle. But I am such a fan of Tab and her unique style, I am happy to have bought the book just to support her."
"Uplifting, encouraging, funny, inspiring, and motivating!"
I'm not even done...only a couple pages in and I absolutely love it....I hear your voice as I read and you give me so many things to think about....I've been waiting since you said it would be released and just as I'd hoped and prayed it is phenomenal....thank you tabitha brown.....when does the next one come out? :) :) :)
The strength she exuberates from her struggles helped me through some of the darkest times of my life. Gratitude is in order for this woman.
‚ù§  Wondeful book! Bravo Tabitha üëèüèº  If you haven't got it yet this is your sign.
This book is indeed a MUST HAVE! I really don't have the words to express how it has blessed me. Don't hesitate......get it and read it IMMEDIATELY......you won't be disappointed!
I enjoyed this book.  She talks a lot about God. Which may not be some people's cup of tea.  It was enjoyable to read about her life experiences and how she reacted to them
"There is nothing not to love about Tabitha! She is gorgeous, funny , gives great insight about how to be real without yourself and take care of yourself. Love her!"
"It's simply a must read...not just for us women of color, but for every individual here on God's Earth ‚ù§"

"This book is GR8T so far üòá!! I am starting Chapter 4, but each chapter that I have read so far was plain out GOOD!!!! Tab U DID THAT!!!!!!! üíù"

Thank you Tabitha for allowing God to use you, and for recognizing the lessons and blessings, and pouring them into this book."
"I read Tab‚Äôs book while on vacation in Montego Bay because ‚Äúit‚Äôs my business!‚Äù And it refreshed and reset my soul! I can actually hear Tab‚Äôs voice as I read. This is an addition to the New Testament called The Book of Tab‚Ä¶her life is an epistle read of mankind(2 Corinthians 3:2)!

This is a very good book. I feel like I know her even better cause of her struggles. Love her!
I like that she talk about real life issues and was honest. She gave you nuggets for life.
"This book was a great inspirational, self reflecting read. It has me shedding tears in the first few pages. It took me all of 5 days to read and now I‚Äôm going to order more to bless others. It feels as if she just poured herself out to us and allowed God to use her how He felt best!"
"This book was so well written. It made me laugh, cry and it definitely motivated me to pursue my dreams. Thanks Tab!"

"I pre-ordered this book on Audible because I love to LISTEN to Tabitha! I am only 3/4 of a way through as I just got it yesterday BUT I had to stop and review it NOW!!! I am purchasing a copy as well. So many gems I want to highlight and see in black and white. However, if you can only do one,  I recommend the audio book because she brings the stories in this book to LIFE! So incredibly talented. I've never read a book so full of wisdom, authenticity, humor, love, grace, patience, HOPE, and peace...or heard a person speak these things in this way all at once. The world needs more of that. Tabitha is divinely here in our lives at the right time. She and this book have inspired me to cultivate and share more of these things. I'm gaining more insight into myself as a human being and my life personally as I read. Thank you Tabitha, you are a divine vessel and teaching us that we are as well, everyone in their own way. WHAT A BLESSING YOU ARE TABITHA, TO MYSELF, OTHERS AND THIS WORLD! All the gratitude, love, and blessings sent your way! P.S.- I know what everyone is getting for Christmas this yearü§£"
She is a BLESSING---Thank you Tabitha---you are a Shining Star--keep Shining Lady
I received my audible book today and starting listening!  Tabitha is truly a gift from God.  I love her gentle heartfelt messages and TPAs.  I am on chapter 4 and want to savor every sentence and message.  I will probably buy the hardcover to add to my collection of special books/authors.  Blessings to you Tabitha - I knew when I first saw you on FB a couple of years ago that you were special!!
"All I can say is WOW!!!üôåüèΩ  This book is a must read! I had a lot of admiration and respect for Tab before reading, now it‚Äôs elevated to another level. I love her spirit, transparency, and love for God!! I didn‚Äôt want the book to end! I started yesterday and finished today! Couldn‚Äôt put it down!!! Great job Tab! üôåüèΩüòçüëèüèΩüíó"
Great book. Real knowledge and experience. Thank you Tabitha Brown. Life will be much easier when armed with such knowledge and experience!
I can‚Äôt wait to read this book once it arrives on in 2 days. Go Tabitha Brown!! Feeding Our Souls
"I am not vegan, probably never will be. I happened upon Tabitha Brown a few years ago, and found her absolutely fascinating and delightful. This book is pure Tab, straight forward and honest. Do yourself a favor and opt for the audio version. Hearing her tell her own story is priceless!"
"Tabitha Brown is so easy to listen. Listening to her tell her story is like sitting in a room chatting it up  with a girlfriend. Tabitha can‚Äôt hear me but I am right there with her, saying ‚Äúyasss‚Äù that‚Äôs it. The book is  motivating, empowering, full of lesson, and just soothing. üòä"
"I ordered the Audio book and didn't expect her to be the reader, but it is so awesome to hear her words in her voice. This book is so encouraging and so good."
This book allows you to take a deep inventory of your life and find ways to improve the way you live and love.  I have been a fan of Tabitha Brown for quite some time and this book has elevated my appreciation for the gifts that God has granted.
Authenticity comes through. It's beautiful.
"I love every word of this book and I thank Aunt Tab for writing and sharing her love, experiences, visions and dreams with the world. I thank God for using you for His purpose and Glory. Thank you, God bless you and continue to share. I love you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
I love Ms. Tabb! I can‚Äôt wait to read! Cause that‚Äôs my business.

I hope you will enjoy this book as much as I have!! x Maria"
"To play devils advocate here:I get some peoples apprehension to Pastor Mike. He is well aware he may not be everyone‚Äôs cup of tea.I say all that to say, I can get how this book and the Crazy Faith series can convince you he is nothing more than another prosperity gospel preacher. It‚Äôs funny because if you believe he is a false prophet he‚Äôd tell you to ‚Äúpray about it‚Äù and ask the Spirit, and go with whatever the Holy Spirit says to you. So if you haven‚Äôt gotten the book yet , and surged through these reviews and felt uneasy. Pray about it and ask God.I‚Äôve watched Pastor Mike on repeated occasions say ‚Äúif ANYTHING I say or teach does not sit well with YOUR SPIRIT. ALWAYS go to the Word of God.‚Äù On repeated occasions he tells people to ALWAYS trust the Word of God before word of man.I‚Äôve watched Pastor Mike stand on the pulpit and repent for former teachings where he said God told him he misinterpreted His Word/scripture and to repent on that same platform, and so Pastor Mike did.I‚Äôve heard him preach how we need ‚Äúto seek Gods presence and NOT his presents‚ÄùIf you only go by this book, his social media, or have only seen a sermon or two I understand you believing he is nothing more than another mega church prosperity gospel teacher. I truly do. And Lord knows we do not need anymore of those.I highly recommend  his sermon series : ‚Äú Who is the Minster Here‚Äù where the ENTIRE series is based on spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ to everyone everywhere. How WE may be someone‚Äôs first or only example of Christ, and as believers it is our job to live in a way that glorifies Christ in order to bring others to salvation.‚ÄúAnchored‚Äù the sermon series is about Jesus being an anchor in your life. Staying tied to Jesus NOT for blessings, but simply because He is our savior and we NEED to be solely dependent on Christ alone and Christ alone‚Ä¶ not our jobs, not our relationships, none of those will sustain us in this life. ONLY Christ our savior will.‚ÄúThe Upgrade‚Äù sermon series is a teaching on the Holy Sprit and how we need to rely on the power of the Holy Spirit EVERYDAY and in EVERY area (finances, relationships, family, decisions making) in our lives. It teaches how we have the Living Spirit of Christ inside us that will lead us to repentance, to forgiveness, to push us to lead a life that pleases Christ.The Forgiveness series is based on how we as believers have an obligation to forgive. We cannot harbor hate and resentment, because it goes against God commandment to love everyone. How we cannot go before God with unforgiveness in our hearts knowing He saved us despite us following short of His glory DAILY. We need to forgive others as Christ has forgiven us.I say all this to say‚Äîplease don‚Äôt let this book or his social media deter you from exploring Christ further.If the book isn‚Äôt for you, understandable. I get it. And that‚Äôs coming from someone who enjoys Pastor Mike.Pastor Mike teachings has changed my life. I tithe faithfully, I read my Word, I worship God, I strive to be forgiving and understanding. I had no idea I had the Holy Spirit inside me, and how to use the Holy Spirit as a guide to live for Christ.I‚Äôve learned how to have a RELATIONSHIP with Jesus, and not to only seek Him when I need something. I‚Äôve learned in every area of my life I need to be dependent on God, trust in God. And times when I can‚Äôt feel God, or feel lost and forsaken‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve learned how to stay ANCHORED to Christ even during the storms of life. I‚Äôve learned that culture will twist and pervert the teachings of the Bible to justify sin and to always pray and trust the Word of God above all things. From P. Mike I learned that.He truly is more than a prosperity preacher, I promise LOL.BUTTTTT I get how some antics (for me it was the basketball thing after Kobe‚Äôs passing, and the car on the stage ‚Ä¶ ) it was a bit much.I get how some antics and examples can be a turn off. But I also understand how some people absorb differently, and some of those SAME antics that might turn YOU off ,  just may bring OTHERS to Christ‚Äîespecially this younger generation.Now about the book, as much as I appreciate Pastor Mike. In my opinion, this book is Crazy Faith the series in written form. I know because before my book arrived I started watching the series again and even the jokes are the same. Some things even typed out verbatim from the series.I feel like the book is more for people who may want the series in written form, or for the people who have no idea there even is a series.I never leave biased reviews so I‚Äôm not gonna give this 5 stars because it‚Äôs Pastor Mike.My sole purpose honestly in writing this review is to push some of the sermon series he‚Äôs done that glorify Christ to people who will write him off simply for this book.He‚Äôs a man. He admits that constantly‚Ä¶to call him a false prophet may be a little but if a stretch though. As Pastor Mike would say though‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúPray and ask God to reveal his (Pastor Mike‚Äôs)  heart to you.‚ÄùAnd if your Spirit continues to be uneasy then find someone who is right for you.I know this was long, and if you‚Äôve gotten this far remember (or hear for the first time) that Jesus loves you.Be kind to people.Be kind to YOURSELF.Please take care of your physical body.Please take care of your mental health.Pray all things. God hears you, and His timing is perfect (doesn‚Äôt make the waiting any easier though)And as Pastor Mike would say ‚Äúit‚Äôs about PROGRESSION, not PERFECTION.‚ÄùBeing saved doesn‚Äôt immediately mean BAM you‚Äôre changed and living for Christ is now easy breezy, unfortunately  you‚Äôre gonna fall short of Gods glory constantly because you are human and ONLY JESUS is perfect and sinless.Another P. Mike quote ‚Äúif you give God your heart He will HELP you change your habits‚Äù so call on the Holy Spirit for help and guidance every single day, multiple times throughout the day.So be patient with yourself as you go through life making mistake after mistake. Repenting (sometimes even repeatedly for the same sins)This does not mean justify sin.P. Mike taught me it‚Äôs not okay to KEEP sinning just because you KNOW God is merciful and will forgive you. But it is your responsibly to take accountability and confess the sin to God and repent and turn away from sin.A lot of people like to think only massive obvious sins need repentance.P. Mike taught me being angry can be a sin. Like ‚Äúintentionally‚Äù harboring anger goes against Gods commandment to love and is a steeping stone that leads to other sin.Murder stems from anger and unforgiveness.White lies can be sin because you‚Äôre intentionally being deceitful.So that white lie can be a stepping stone to full blown lying, cheating , and stealing.God sees all, and we need to live and speak as if God is watching at all times (because He is).Don‚Äôt do things just because you can hide it from humans, because you cannot hide it from God.This are all things I‚Äôve learned from 5 years of following P. Mike.Don‚Äôt let this book specifically deter you from life changing teachings.This isn‚Äôt to push you to Pastor Mike, it‚Äôs to push you to Christ. Find who works for you. To each their own. As P. Mike would say it‚Äôs not about the messenger but the message.Be blessed. Be kind. Seek God and pray all things."
"Crazy Faith is the second book of Michael Todd, pastor of Transformation Church in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The book‚Äôs premise is that God has big crazy plans for His children and that we must trust Him and take a leap of faith if we want to experience His promises. And this book is a blueprint on how to live in crazy faith. Each chapter corresponds to a step of crazy faith. They are Baby Faith, Maybe Faith, Waiting Faith, Wavy Faith, Lazy Faith, Trading Faith, Fugazi Faith, Stating Faith, Fading Faith, and Saving Faith.In this book, Todd uses a mix of his personal and biblical stories to teach and illustrate the power of crazy faith. I appreciate his zeal for God and wanting to live a life of faith as Scripture commands. But unfortunately, that is the only positive thing I can say about this book. For a book about faith, Crazy Faith has very little Scripture (especially those that talks about faith). The book focuses more on this author‚Äôs testimony than the author and finisher of our faith‚ÄîJesus Christ. Furthermore, this book is laden with false teachings and unbiblical notions.  Here are a few of them.‚ÄúCRAZY FAITH‚ÄùThe most glaring issue with this book is the author‚Äôs definition and application of faith. Todd defines faith as ‚Äútrust in something you cannot explicitly prove.‚Äù And crazy faith is ‚Äúhaving thoughts and actions that lack reason but trusting fully in what you cannot explicitly prove.‚Äù This is not entirely biblical, as faith in the Bible means trusting Christ based on divine assurance and confidence. The Bible never equates having faith with lacking reason or being crazy.More concerning, though, isn‚Äôt how Todd defines faith, but what he has faith for. He rightly says that faith is based on God, not us or things. But the ‚Äúcrazy faith‚Äù Todd refers to throughout this book isn‚Äôt penitent faith unto salvation but faith for wealth and health. For instance, at the beginning of the book, he proposes an exercise to identify our level of faith in different areas and includes things like career goals, relationships, hopes, dreams, etc. We are supposed to believe that God has miracles in these areas and that we must have faith they will come to pass. When the Bible speaks of faith, however, it is first and foremost believing in the name of the Son of God for salvation. Not material things.EISEGESISTodd repeatedly adds things to Scripture that isn‚Äôt there and forces it to mean something it doesn‚Äôt say. He even writes, ‚ÄúChristians need to learn to read between the lines to hear what the Bible doesn‚Äôt say.‚Äù  Todd effectively follows his own advice and says things the Bible doesn‚Äôt. Take, for example, the story of Jesus healing a paralytic in Luke 5:17-26. In this story, four men took a paralytic man to Jesus for healing, and when they couldn‚Äôt get through the door, they went through the roof. The Bible doesn‚Äôt give details about these four men, like their relationship, motif, etc. But Todd takes it upon himself to fill in the blanks and uses his ideas to teach. For example, when Jesus told the paralytic to take up his bed and walk, Todd implies the paralytic had a choice to have faith. Todd says, ‚ÄúRomey [the name he gave the paralytic] has a choice; depend on his own understanding (‚Äúmy body is paralyzed; I don‚Äôt know if I can‚Äù) or trust in the LORD.‚Äù So Jesus made ‚Äúan illogical request,‚Äù and the paralytic had to decide to stand up in crazy faith or not. But that isn‚Äôt how the story goes in the Bible. Scripture says the man was immediately healed and stood up at once. He didn‚Äôt get on his feet in crazy faith; Jesus already healed him.Furthermore, Todd analyzes details of little importance to the story and turns them into grand spiritual lessons for all believers. For example, he says Jesus told the man to pick up his mat because it was his testimony. Consequently, we should always give our testimony. Of course, all of these are not said or implied in the story; Todd adds these things for his benefit. He ignores the most fundamental principle of hermeneutics: interpreting Scripture as the author intended and the original audience would have understood it.NARCISSISMTodd not only reads into Scripture, but he also reads us into it and makes every story about us. Whenever he uses biblical stories for illustration, Todd always identifies us with the characters and turns the story into a parable for our lives. For example, in the paralytic story, we are the friends who must have an active faith; in the story of Jesus walking on water, we are Peter. Jesus is calling us to accomplish something great, and we must step out of the boat in crazy faith and experience our miracle. And so on. This is a terrible way of reading Scripture. The Bible is not about us!  We are not supposed to read the Bible and insert ourselves in it; instead, we must see how it points to Jesus Christ (John 5:39). He is the main character, and the Bible is about Him.Todd‚Äôs narcissism goes beyond reading himself into the Bible. As you can tell from the cover, this book is mostly about him. Almost every chapter feature his accomplishment in becoming a megachurch pastor despite not having a seminary degree, buying his new church venue, etc. He does credit God for doing all this but takes it too far by comparing it to the glorious resurrection of Christ. In chapter 7, he says, ‚ÄúMortal men don‚Äôt get crucified, lay dead and wrapped in a sealed tomb, and three days later pop out with the keys to death a, hell, and the grave like it‚Äôs just another day at the office. But with Jesus, God made an exception.‚Äù He then says God also made an exception with him and urges us to believe we are also the exception. I don‚Äôt know which is worst, Todd reducing the gospel as just ‚Äúan exception,‚Äù or putting us at the same level with Christ.In Todd‚Äôs worldview, we are at the center of the universe, and God is a supporting character whose job is to give us what he wants. Todd says, ‚ÄúWhile you build your relationship with God, work on your craft, and pump up your faith behind the scenes, God is building a platform with your name on it.‚Äù How self-centered and prideful is this? God is not building our platform. He is building His Kingdom for His glory alone.SCRIPTURE USED OUT OF CONTEXTUnsurprisingly, Todd also uses Scriptures out of context. For example, he uses Matthew 18:20, which says, ‚ÄúFor where two or three are gathered in my name, there I am among them,‚Äù to teach that when Christians get together and agree in faith for a miracle, Jesus will show up. The context of Matthew 18:20 is church discipline.  As mentioned earlier, Todd claims that God is building our platform and uses 1 Cor 3:6, which says, ‚ÄúI planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.‚Äù This text refers to spiritual growth, not a blanket promise for fame.Todd even partially quotes Scripture to twist its meaning. For instance, in chapter 9, he says we must make faith-filled declarations to hear them and build our faith. His text is Romans 10:17, which says, ‚ÄúFaith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.‚Äù But Todd conveniently left out ‚Äúthrough the word of Christ.‚Äù This text is about having true penitent faith from hearing the gospel, not believing in a job promotion by making personal declarations.PROSPERITY GOSPELThe thesis of this book is that God has a big crazy miracle for you, and if you have enough faith to believe in the impossible, God will give you what you want. He says, ‚ÄúHow would you feel if I told you that you could walk out of God‚Äôs store with everything you have faith for?‚Äù This is really just prosperity theology, the idea that God will always give us health and wealth if we have faith in him. In fact, Todd‚Äôs church affirms this on their website. They say, ‚ÄúWe believe that, as part of Christ‚Äôs work of salvation, it is the Father‚Äôs will for believers to become whole, healthy, and successful in all areas of life.‚Äù This is unbiblical. The Bible doesn‚Äôt teach that God always wants us to be healthy and wealthy on this side of eternity or that we will always get what we ask for if we have crazy faith. God promises that if we repent of our sins and believe in the name of  His Son, we will have eternal life. He also promises that we will have tribulations in this world and suffer for His sake.WORD OF FAITHThere is also many Word of Faith teaching in this book (which isn‚Äôt surprising as it usually goes with the prosperity gospel). Word of faith is the belief that our words have the power to speak God‚Äôs promises (mainly health and wealth) into existence. The premise behind this teaching is that, since God‚Äôs word has power, and we are created in God‚Äôs image, our words also have power. Todd affirms this in chapter 9 of the book and says, ‚ÄúWhen you start saying what you‚Äôre believing God out loud, it puts a demand on heaven and establishes a higher level of accountability with anyone who hears you say‚Ä¶but until you let it escape your mouth, it won‚Äôt have as much power.‚Äù And ‚ÄúWords have creative power-and God chose to give that same power to you and me.‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt provide any Scriptural basis for this because they are none.God‚Äôs words indeed have the power to create things; however, we do not have the same privilege. The Bible never says that we have the same creative power with words as God. Nor does it say that things will happen if we declare and decree them. Lamentations 3:37 even says, ‚ÄúWho has spoken, and it came to pass, unless the Lord has commanded it?‚ÄùI recommend watching American Gospel for a thorough refutation of the Prosperity Gospel and Word of Faith.EXTRA-BIBLICAL REVELATIONSLastly, Todd teaches extra-biblical revelations. He says, ‚Äúall of us receive instructions from God in some form or fashion,‚Äù and mentions a few examples when God spoke to him outside the Bible. This is unbiblical as well. God speaks to us through the Bible (Hebrews 1:1-2), and no Scripture affirms that we should expect to hear from God outside it. We receive our instructions from the Bible, the whole Bible, and nothing but the Bible (2 Timothy 3:16-17). The idea that God speaks to us through outside Scripture is not only unbiblical but also dangerous.It causes Todd to say that no one can ever be 100% sure they hear from God. It is ‚Äúalmost always a maybe,‚Äù and as such, we only need to have faith at 51%. Scripture doesn‚Äôt teach us to have 51% percent faith or live life always wondering if we hear from God. This scenario only happens when we stray away from the sure word of God and venture into the realm of subjective extra-biblical revelations. In that case, you will never indeed be sure that God is speaking to you, and you undoubtedly need to be crazy to follow through with whatever you think that God is telling you. But when you read Scripture, you can be 100% sure God is speaking to you, and obeying Him is not illogical or crazy.Furthermore, God is not the author of confusion. When He speaks, it is unmistakable and authoritative. There is no instance in Scripture where God spoke, and people wondered whether they actually heard from God. Abraham did not bound his son on an altar for sacrifice because he thought God might have told him so.CONCLUSIONThere are many other theological issues with Crazy Faith, but I got tired of highlighting them because there were so many. Todd says in this book that he has never been to seminary or studied theology, and it really shows. This book is filled with false teachings, unbiblical statements, narcissism, and Scripture twisting. His different stages of faith are not supported by Scripture and, frankly, a bit silly.I absolutely do not recommend this book nor any teaching that comes from Michael Todd. It is my sincere hope that he will repent and learn to handle the Word of God rightly. Until then, mark and avoid him.*I received an ARC from the publisher, and this is my honest review.*"
I counted days until the day The Book came. It was worthy to wait and Pray for it. This is something unique and unforgetable. Buy one for everyone You love. You will love it ! Praise God for this book.
"This book + sermon series CHANGED MY LIFE! God can use anyone to do anything! And I've now taken the saying into my life, 'It's only crazy until it happens'.It's so true that what's counted as crazy in one season will be seen as faith in another! God bless Pastor Todd + my TC Church for extending the teachings of God past the pulpit. Can't wait for the next book!"
This book is an amazing testimony of the life of Micheal Todd. Showing us how to step into crazy faith and live our life for God. Just as all his teaching it shows the unlimited things God can do with the strength of Crazy Faith
"This book follows the faith journey of Pastor Mike, and those at Transformational Church in a fun, engaging way. If you are looking to read the Bible, this may not be your top choice. If you want to hear how faith worked for what would seem on the surface like an ordinary, young, naturally undeserving Black man; and then be motivated that God can do the same for you, if you walk in crazy faith, this is for you. I'm not from Tulsa but I love Transformation Church and how the Represent the gospel. I posted a picture of the chart in the first chapter. I definitely can grow my faith in certain areas.Disclaimer: Some of the analogies and references are comparing worldly artist. If you know the artist, even if you don't listen to them, you will find the humor and understanding of the analogies on an engaging cultural level. If you don't, you just might be the uptight, can't take a joke, hypocritical type believer who loves scrutinizing everything but yourself. Jkjk.... kind of.I like the flow of the book, I think the cover is well excuted. A non-believer could enjoy this and maybe cross over to our side and experience new life in Christ."
So far so good! I can hear Pastor Mike‚Äôs personality in each sentence! The quality of book is great too.
"1st day,  1st chapter and I'm already recognizing how I shortcut my own possibilities.  This is just the faith injection I needed to begin to dream again."
"Great morning....I was going back and forth about writing a review because people's opinion is just THAT . An opinion.... INCLUDING my own...... However, I TRULY want you to read the book, in it's ENTIRETY BEFORE going off ANYONE ELSE'S personal opinion......First, I Agree, Pastor Todd may not be EVERYONE'S ""type"" of Pastor.... Just like I know I'm not everyone's ""type"" in my calling, gift, profession.... YET I AM here for WHO I'm called to touch and need a Blessing to..... And that is what Pastor Todd is ..... HERE for Whom God has called HIM TO......I HAVE been following Pastor's Todd's ministry since about 2017 (sporadically)..... Until RECENTLY, THIS year, in the ANCHORED series, I began ""attending"" service WEEKLY virtually... Shout Out TC NATION! ANCHORED BLESSED my SOUL TREMENDOUSLY especially during the current season that I am in....... That's just to give you a little back story...Now BACK to Crazy Faith....I followed the ACTUAL Crazy Faith Sermon Series and was BLOWN AWAY by the how Pastor Todd could ""MEET"" people where they ""ARE""..... And THIS BOOK is an EXTENSION of that... He's EXPLAINING it in a Way that whether you are a Babe in Christ, Still learning the Bible... Whether you are a LIFER in the church (which I am myself AND a Preacher's Kid!)... Whether you are old ... Young... Black... White.. Asian, etc..... His ability to RELATE is spot on..... IF you are TRULY OPEN to receive the message......BUT, If you are ""HOLIER"" THAN THOU.... More focused on ""Religion"" than RELATIONSHIP... Then THIS BOOK is NOT for you ...(ALTHOUGH honestly, It is, but your Judgement and Desire to pick it apart, will NOT allow God to Speak to you thru itü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è... Because REMEMBER, If you TRULY know God's VOICE.... HE can speak thru ANYTHING... INCLUDING a Young Black Man... That is NOT the Stereotypical image of a Pastor....)....I Digress.....This Book is PRACTICAL.... And YES he shares his Testimony... There is NOTHING wrong with that.... In FACT, If Pastor Todd can be used... That tells me SO CAN I ..... If certain parts of the book are not your type of ""cuisine""... Learn how to ""Eat the Meat... And SPIT IT the Bones"".... Gather what's for YOU and leave the rest... You WILL find something to feed upon......So, this became a longer review than expected... Yet I said all that to say... GIVE IT A CHANCE..... We READ, LISTEN, Ingest WAY WORSE living in this world, on a Daily Basis..... TRY taking in something that can Bless your Soul...."
I've been waiting for this to come out and its finally here. Mike todd is one of the realest out there.
"First of all I can't see how this book would get less than 5 stars...I would give it 100 if I could!  This book is absolutely amazing and when I first cracked it open I couldn't stop reading it. I love the way MT breaks down the Bible stories to help me visualize myself. I watch his sermons ever Sunday and I find his book just as engaging as this book.This is a must get and in all you do ask GOD to help you ""read thru the lines""!"
This book and his sermons on crazy faith is a real eye opener. For anyone unsure where to start in your faith journey it is here!! Through this series he has blessed so many people including myself as I had faith to have my student debt paid and be debt free. The pastor and the church helped to make that a reality for myself and so many others! Get the book read it then go watch his sermons on YouTube!! This is a generational blessing for your family!
"I‚Äôve watched Michael Todd preach at Transformation church for roughly 5 years now. Michael is honest, open & transparent about his own sinful nature as he preaches each sermon and never fails to teach me something new‚Äî with the bible to back it up. I trust Michael‚Äôs guidance in my own walk with Christ as he has only ever pushed me closer to Jesus. I have learned countless lessons from his sermons over the years. I am excited to read this new book and look forward to the extraordinary things that the TC nation will continue to do in the future! Even if you don‚Äôt buy this book, look into these sermons... available as a podcast or on youtube! They will change the trajectory of your life. Praying strength and wisdom over you as well as this church that I love so deeply."
"From Relationship Goals to now Crazy Faith, Transformation Church and Pastor Michael Todd have been life changing for me. Grateful to God for finding this church!You need to join if you haven‚Äôt yet"
"See it Before You See It.The Crazy Faith Series in 2019 revolutionized my relationship with God in countless ways. I listened to the series 3x. I am a part of TC Nation for 2+ years with Transformation Church my Home. I am forever grateful for Pastor Michael Todd, Natalie, their team, and pray for them regularly.I have read the Bible daily now for years, have taken studies with Beth Moore, Priscilla Shirer, and Lifeway Women among the community that has poured into me. I am incredibly grateful to how God deposited Mike Todd, TC, the series, and the others He had me devour. It is a JOY to watch the Crazy Faith journey unfold with the Todds, TC Team, and TC Nation.One of many reasons I am trusting God for so much and living out so much of my God-Given vision, passion, purpose, community, and traveling globally now. I take regular time to get quiet with God, pray, fast because of God and this community influence with weekly service.My testimony ""mat"" of walking from self-hate to love, devaluing to purity, corporate to calling and bondage to freedom is attributed to God first and foremost. It is also  LARGELY attributed in countless ways to Michael Todd's life message, this community, and the constant reaffirming and growth. #gojointhechurchnowI avidly anticipated the release of this book. I preordered months ago.It just ""so happened"" that when I woke up today I didn't feel well - travel bug.I immediately thought it is no accident it is on the day after the Audible book + book release.I loved the release with Vous Church too! Go listen on YouTube!I received it that God gave me the space to listen to the book. I loved the relatable breakdowns of faith, testimony, and the HOT approach always (Humble Open Transparent). I believe this is to demonstrate reliability for our own stories, testimonies, and transformation.The deeper dives beyond the series, new material, and the PDF. The diligence, excellence, and value are evident at every step. The heart behind it all is evident.The journey with the book both showed me how far God has taken me, my mat, the areas the Holy Spirit is working on me, and the ways God wants me to grow from Fixer Upper to SkyScraper in key areas further. The revelation and clarity are WOW. I believe you will feel the same, and get exactly what you need for your own transformation and progression journey.The only thing that surprised me he didn't read the audible. I laugh so much so many times when he speaks!At the same time, I trust this was done with prayerful consideration with God. Aaron did a great job!I feel like God is letting me know to regularly read this and assess where I am with the PDF.I believe you will feel the same.Praying 1 John 4:18, Gal 5:1, Gal 5:22, John 3:16, and Romans 12:2 for anyone that sees this.Get this book. Listen to the series. Join the church. It will change your life. Praying for #toddsquad #tcnationIt's only the beginningIt's only CRAZY UNTIL it HAPPENS"
"I enjoyed this book, until I got to page 184. This is the point in the book where Pastor Todd reveals he aligns to a current but unsubstantiated media narrative that paints one group of people with a broad judgmental  brush. It‚Äôs a narrative used today to manipulate and divide people. So, sadly, I can‚Äôt help but question if he wrote this book just to make money. Page 184 shows what‚Äôs really under all his entertaining style ‚Äî and it‚Äôs not truly of God. Truly wish I were writing a different review."

  ¬†Absolutely amazing. Michael Todd came to our Church Ribbon Cutting/Revival in Chicago. New Life SE was overwhelmed of the Love and Anointing he poured amongst us.üß°"
"This book is everything! I would advise getting a notebook and track what God is telling you while reading this book. It opened up something for me, and I am ready to walk in Crazy Faith!"
Amazingly well written book definitely recommend this book to others.
"Check Pastor out on IG, He is awesome, and so is his book. BUY IT Already!!!!!"
Awesome word in a book. This book will help you to build your faith and help you have hopes and dreams again and utilize your visualization skills again. You won't be disappointed and if you are read it again.
Its only crazy until it happens!
"The book is great if you're a reading and love highlighting. It's a lot like his series, but just in book form. It really inspired me to live a crazy faith life! It's only crazy, until it happens!"
I follow Transformation Church and Pastor Todd. I watched the whole Crazy Faith series and this book goes beyond. I appreciate that he told his story and tied it to the Bible. Forever grateful that this church is a part of my life!
Was still able to read it just disappointing
"As a minister's kid who grew up in the church, I've NEVER had faith broken down the way Pastor Todd broke it down in this book. I always appreciate when God's Word is simplified for the average person to understand."
Everyone needs one!! Crazy faith is what we need today and everyday!!
"Great book to grow stronger in your faith! It doesn‚Äôt matter what stage of life you‚Äôre in, there‚Äôs a lesson in faith for everyone to learn."
My faith is stronger than it‚Äôs ever been since I‚Äôve joined Transformation Nation almost a year ago. This book is a game changer!
This book is a must buy. I absolutely loved it and am about to read it a second time.
This book really is wonderful. Strengths my faith more and has helped
Just the push I needed to trust God BIGGER than I ever have before!
A great read! Definitely speaks to you
One of the greatest books I have ever read!!
"Just got the book in the mail and skimmed through it. Going to be diving deep into it starting tonight. I didn't want to wait to leave a review though as I can't recommend this book enough! The sermon series changed my life in such a significant way and I can't wait for others to understand this message of Crazy Faith and the difference it will make in your life. I can't wait to dive in and I know there is so much more for me to learn and understand around these concepts of Crazy Faith.""It's Only Crazy Until it Happens!"""
Please don‚Äôt mind all the people that took time to write an essay as if we don‚Äôt fall short of Gods glory! This book is anointed and practical at the same time. Beyond this book this pastor has helped push MANY people closer to God (The devil won‚Äôt do that) his anointing and teaching has helped those as babes in Christ! That‚Äôs why we have the Holy spirit to help us with things we cannot fully understand or comprehend on our own! So we cannot fully depend on man anyway. So no matter who bashes this man for not being a theologian it seems more personal rather than trying to Glorify God. if you don‚Äôt like the man cool but Take it up with God and pray for this man if he‚Äôs sooo bad and what he‚Äôs teaching is so bad to the kingdom of God
"I never write reviews! Let me say again, I DO NOT WRITE REVIEWS!This beauty however compels me to be bold. I thank God for Pastor Todd, His wife, children and church family. WOW! ""So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God."" This is scripture from Romans 10:17. I purchased the audible version and hard back versions. I wanted to hear the word spoken through Pastor Todd. I too wanted to encourage a dear friend journeying through life in prison. Sadly, the hard cover is not allowed in prison thus the only reason for 4-stars.Transparency is key! The truth spoken in the transparency of this servant's life is encouraging to say the least. NOTHING I heard is unbiblical. EVERYTHING I heard speaks life to those with an ear to hear. God can be seen through this entire journey in this book. I'm thankful God allowed it to drop at such a time as this. Crazy Faith is indeed what's needed now. He is an on-time, NOW God. Faith is key!!! Did you here what Hebrews 11 says? Without Faith it is IMPOSSIBLE to please God. Like....for real! FAITH is the weapon of defeat in every situation and circumstance. Life...for real! I'm praying for those who are unable to see and hear God for personal barriers toward Christ. I too am praying for those who choose not to believe the simplicity of who God is because of personal barriers toward Christ. Lastly, I pray for those who put position there mouths to speak against what God is using Pastor Todd and his wife to do this life. Those who love Christ know we are instruments for divine purposes. May God be glorified and may his glory rain  down on Pastor Todd, his wife and kids, and church family forward.Thank you for being willing to serve my Father, Lord God and King, Jesus."
This book is a faith booster. This book is a picker upper. I'm really enjoying this book because during this time of covid my faith droooed more than I realized and in this book Pastor Todd puts everything into perspective. He helps you to see you and where you are in your faith. IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY... GO GET THE BOOK!!
"This book is a new-age, law of attraction book masquerading as a book about faith. If you are interested in learning about truth Bible principles of faith, this is NOT for you. This is a wolf in sheep clothing."

  ¬†GREAT READ!! Highly recommended‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
"This book will tear down so many walls of misconceptions one has regarding faith & the story behind this book is inspiring too as we all get waiting seasons in life and having faith before you see the miracle is the real game! ""SEE IT BEFORE YOU SEE IT! "" This one is inspiring as well as eye-opening!"
"I have just started to read this book. In the Acknowledgments, I noticed this, ""If all wives loved as she does, fewer men would be looking over the fence."" How about ""If all husbands loved as he does, fewer women would be looking over the fence.""? I am serious."
"This book is rooted in religion. It is written solely for straight persons. The author over uses gender pronouns unnecessarily to push outdated gender norms. All the stories of couples are relatively the same, with the wife doing all the cooking and cleaning, and husband working too much and not spending quality time. The author credits himself a miracle worker whenever possible, including after convincing a woman to stay with her emotionally abusive partner based on the idea that if she treats him nicely even while being abused he will eventually come around. The basic, good principles of this book (which should be common sense) are overshadowed with very problematic ideals that may be triggering. It is important to note that while the author has a PhD he is NOT a psychiatrist, nor was his back ground in psychology or social work. His studies were in anthropology. He is a counselor through his church, and attended religious institutions for his education. He does however have clients refer to him as Dr. This is very misleading, and could be detrimental to persons seeking serious help in areas where emotional, physical, or substance abuse is at play, or in relationships where one or both parties is coping with mental illness."
"The book was pretty good, it had some valid points and learning that there are different ways that people express their love was important. What I think pulled away from the book was the underlying religious agenda to preach about God. It totally turned me off And I thought it was completely unnecessary to deliver the message. Of course if you are a religious person then this would be right up your alley."
"I liked this book. I bought it around the time I started noticing my wife was being combative pretty often. I wanted to understand her, and for her to understand me better. We took the test but the entire time she seemed to make a joke out of it. It turns out, when your significant other is verbally and mentally abusive there is no book that can help you. With a normal person, this book will help you understand the way your partner thinks. I still have this book and will use it in the future when I find someone worth it."
"Absolutely every person should read this book.  When I complained about something my husband did that annoyed me, he would say, ""why don't you ever tell me about the things I do right?""  Super evidence that he is a ""Words of Affirmation"" person.  I am an ""Acts of Service"" person.  So if he does something around the house or yard, I tell him what a good job he did, how great it turned out, and I thank him.  These are not big deal things.  If he drives I thank him for driving,  If he empties the trash, I thank him.  Stuff most people take for granted, the ""Words of Affirmation"" person needs to HEAR them.  This guy thrives on compliments.  I on the other hand, thrive on things like someone doing the dishes, or cleaning the floor.  Don't buy me roses. To me, it's a waste of money!  You have to read this book to find out which of the five languages you speak, and which your loved ones speak."
"I was once asked to read this book by the only person in the world I love.....I refused.  At the time I figured it to be some shrinks opinion on how we should all be in our relationships....what the hell does he know I thought.....what if he is wrong and my future wife bases our whole future on just what he says.....I imagined this book to be some guy with opinions on how to fix problems that he knows nothing about because he doesn't know ""us"".  It's not a good feeling as a man to agree to read a book on relationships because you feel like you're putting everything into the authors hands.....and what if he ""doesn't understand"" or what if the advice doesn't apply to us.....what if it makes things worse between us because he advises things we don't believe in.....no....I'm not reading that I told her.I thought no matter what we would always figure each other out and we would be ok......I didn't see being asked to read this book , was a cry out from the woman I love hitting a boiling point and her attempt to communicate to me in a different way......the same things she's been trying to for a long time.....Being close minded that day costed me so much regret and misery....I used to wake up to the most beautiful smile in the world and now I don't....I recently ended up reading this book and I couldn't put it down....sounds crazy but it's true.  Instead of being some guys opinions or......typical shrink talk that in no way could apply to each specific relationship.......I found it to be a book that opens up the mind to the understanding of love.....and how it is not this one universal ""language"" we all feel we should be the same with.....I once told her....""nobody taught me how to love, I'm growing....learning"".....I pleased with her to understand I love her.......we simply didn't have an understanding of how and why we didnt approach love the exact same way as each other.....only makes sense that it should be the same right? You bicker and argue and it drives you crazy......why doesn't she understand you think.......the book is not an excuse to use or justify a true bad relationship let me add.....but it truly answers so many questions.....it is really a language of love.  Once understood, this book leaves you feeling like a fool and only wanting to apply so much of what you've now learned to your future together. It takes away the work of trying to understand the things that at the time make no sense.....and allows you to focus on what's important....loving instead of wasting precious time.  Read it carefully and I recommend reading it together.....I didn't get that chance but I can guarantee reading this book with who you love will allow you both to stop frequently throughout the pages and talk,learn,smile, probably cry.....but then go on to a much happier fulfilling life together once the book is closed. It can save so much if you only let it.*Update 12-1-17I drive a bus so I have nothing but time to think as I look out the window and look up at the sky looking around me. You would probably think of screaming kids and noise but for me it is driving in my own little world and using time to think about lifeI am a trainer so I spend my time trying to help people learn how to maintain their body and prevent problems. And the funny thing is that it is are very choices of what we do to our own bodies that I am teaching to have to change. All of our problems nutritionally and physically and even mentally come down too poor choice and repetitive habits that we know we need to change but never do until it's too late. Every single person reading this can relate to thatMy point about what I do is that I spend a lot of time trying to fix my body because professionals out there either won't take the time to do it or I don't have the money to spend on who is needed. I have spent countless months doing stretches and exercises and what I have found is a lot of times I'm doing the exact same stretches and exercises that don't seem to be working. Soooo......why not do different ones then right...... what a lot of reasons it may feel good, you may not know any other stretches or exercises, you may simply believe that if I just do it one more time again tomorrow....THAT it will finally help..... you just believe in that stretch so much that in your mind you just say I'll keep trying. You are maybe even making things worse by this but you're honest to God intentions are to completely cure one of the biggest problems in your life,  pain...... I think you see where I'm getting at.Getting a little long for whoever is reading but there is a lot of meaning here that can help who knows thousands of people as long as this review remains online......I will just end it like this..... last night I took a stretch that I have been doing for over 2 years and I changed it in a slightly different way....... a lot of the pain I normally get daily is gone.......just to put a spotlight on that sentence .....I'm saying that what I had been doing for so long..... trying to cure one of the biggest problems in my life that hadnt been working............that I continued doing........ believing in and depending on.... to be my much needed answer.......It wasn't until I allowed the idea of the same stretch applied in a different way, that I ALLOWED life to be better for me.I did not say this stretch doesn't matter anymore and say forget it to never exist again.....no, I used it to COMMUNICATE with my body in the same exact physical form....just different language from mind to body....because I always believed in it.Belief can be amazing and help you....it also can be your own worst enemy when refuse to change your ways.....lots of time I lost believing my way instead of another.....all while would have given anything to accomplish my goal......once again I stood in my own way......but I didn't give up.....otherwise pain would still be here and I wouldn't have came on here to add all these thoughts.You have to go into the book with an open mind because if you do it with the mindset of wanting it to say what it is that you want to hear.....then you can never let the life-changing words happen.......you're learning a language as you read...not what's right and wrong but what was being lost in life.Keep in mind this is a book about the language of love so if you think about when you go to school to learn a different language...you are taking the difficult step of taking time there in order to understand.....be able to take what you understand and apply it.....and be able to communicate in a NEEDED way once you learn....AND THEN USE......communicate and UNDERSTAND eachother.Just think how you feel when you meet somebody and you want to communicate but you can't and you get frustrated.  you are trying to figure out what you want the other person to know and they're trying to tell or show you..... it becomes stressful and sometimes you end up walking away from each other never knowing the real meaning that was right there between the two of you.  When you are able to speak the same language this simply does not happen.....The same two people if we're able to learn the same language, could come back in front of one another again and.....just imagine......imagine the possibilities with that communication.......so much never lost again.The exact same message and the exact same feelings that were always there, except now instead of the stress of not understanding,  there is the excitement for anything to be possible just by coming together and understanding.....The power of language is amazing........think of when you meet somebody and they're able to speak five or six different languages, you are in awe and wish you could do it.well imagine being able to speak the one language in life that is the most unexplainable, powerful language and meaning of life, love....I would also like to mention the fact that if these two people sat down and learn each other's languages together how helpful that is.....and how much easier it is to be able to learn how to communicate with the exact person that you're trying to ........spending time helping each other learn different languages.......TOGETHER.Bus is parked."
"It is definitely a good book for couples and it has improved my relationship with my wife.  If nothing else it shows you what things your partner is really looking for out of their spouse.  I quickly found that my love language was ""Acts of Service"".  Though it might not be sexy or macho to say that, it means more to me to have the dishes and laundry done when I come home after work or have minor home improvements taken care of before I get home.  My wife and I have 2 small children and our house is hard to stay clean because every room feels like a mess.  We do clean it all the time but it feels like a losing battle.  My wife's love language is ""Words of Affirmation"".  As you can tell from all these Amazon reviews I am much more of a writer than I am a talker.  My wife is always looking for me to say how much I love and appreciate her because I don't say it often enough.A big part of improving your relationship with your spouse or boyfriend/girlfriend is to sticking with a date night to make sure you have quality time together.  Especially if you have children or a high stress occupation.  My wife and I have been together for 10 years and got stuck in the rut of an endless routine of doing everything we could for our kids, followed by daily chores and left little time for ourselves.  Committing to 1 date night a week has really helped our relationship and improved our communication.I recommend the book for sure and found it inspiring and worth reading.  All couples can benefit from reading this book.  The only downside is I wish it could have been a little longer.  The stories from the author are interesting and I would have liked to have heard a bunch of his other examples of couples that he has dealt with.  It was a short book and my wife and I finished it in 4 or 5 days and that was reading it slowly.  The price is easily affordable.  I found it best to photo copy the test quiz at the end instead of writing in the book so we can give the book to any family or friends who are struggling with their relationship."
"After reading some reviews saying that the author was stuck in old ways, very religion based, and stating that a woman should have sex with her husband even if she doesn‚Äôt want to, I chose not to buy it. After trying to find other books I came back to this one and decided to buy it JUST for the quiz in the back. After the quiz I ended up reading the whole book. NEVER did I think or read anything the bad reviews said. I NEVER read a section in the book suggesting you should sleep with your husband just because he wants to. As a matter of fact, he says that sex will come after each spouse feels they are being loved properly and that sex is not the physical touch love language. NEVER did I see him suggest a woman should stay in a bad relationship and suck it up. I‚Äôm not a religious person and the very small amount of religious mentions did not bother me. If you're only looking for problems in the book, then why read it? I think this book can be extremely helpful and guiding towards bettering your relationship. You get what you put into it!  The only thing he suggests is that before giving up and calling it quits, you learn your spouses love language and test it out daily for 2 months. He says this to BOTH spouses. This is teamwork, not only one sided. He uses examples where both spouses are making mistakes and have to put in work. It is very eye opening and helpful. So please, for the sake of bettering your relationship and understanding how to love each other better, get the book and give it a chance."
"We have all heard Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus.. but what he heck does that really mean and how does it apply?  IDK, I did not read that book.  That is why I am reviewing this one instead.  I bought two copies so that my wife and I could both read it. This book really gave us perspective on our relationship and has helped us work on our communication skills.  While we may have intuited things about each other, this book gave us a more concrete idea of what we were doing, thinking, and how we were not communicating optimally for each other.  In the week since we have read the books we have applied the principals and focused on communicating with each other using the specific love languages that we speak best.  I daresay that I am becoming multilingual.  This book is a total game changer.  If your relationship is struggling, the book with give you the tools to fix it.  If your relationship is good, it will give you the tools to make it great.  If your relationship is great... Awesome!!! still, read the book and make it even better.Further, you can use these languages in the book in other relationships as well, so that you can relate to other people in their own best language"
"Great read! My husband bought this, and at first I was offended. I didn't think anything was wrong with us and I took it as kind of a personal attack. However, we started reading it together and it has just strengthened our marriage. It has reminded me to not take things for granted. It has helped me re-focus and better understand my partner. And it has helped me realize that we are two different people at the core, so what works for me isnt what best works for him and vise versa. Would recommend to anybody in a relationship that wants it to be long lasting!"
"I should have done my research before buying this book. It‚Äôs incredibly dull and written in an almost patronizingly simplistic style. Here is a small excerpt: ‚ÄúA doormat is an inanimate object. You can wipe your feet on it, step on it, kick it around, or whatever you like. It has no will of its own. It can be your servant but not your lover.‚Äù Really? The book is also geared solely toward heterosexual couples, and doesn‚Äôt too heavily favor the female spouse or her journey to self-actualization. It is full to the brim with filler material, repeating variations of the same examples and explaining simple concepts over and over. The only reason I finished the book was because I didn‚Äôt feel I could fairly judge it without having seen it through. Having done that, I‚Äôd say honestly, you could Google the basic concepts of this book and save yourself the money."
"The general theme of this book makes sense - a relationship fails when our emotional needs are not being meet by our partner. It encourages the reader to make the decision to commit to love, an act that involves work and a small amount of sacrifice for the joy and contentment of one's partner. If you love someone, this makes perfect sense and now you have some tools and insight to do so.However, there were two glaring issues I had with this book:1. The religious, specifically Christian, bent of this book was off-putting for me. I think the 5 languages of love can be applied by anyone regardless of their creed. The paragraph at the end recommending that the reader seek Christ to better understand love revealed the author's limited understanding of love, Christ, and religion in general I felt.2. This book glazes over the issue of abuse (physical, verbal, emotional) on more than one occasion. I do not agree that a person should stay and try to fix a relationship in which they (and potentially their children) are being physically hurt. Chapman mentions that those whose primary love language is touch have the vulnerability of being physically abused, but barely mentions the need to seek proper counseling or protection. The example of Ann and Glenn in Chapter 12 was especially alarming. I feel there are some relationships that should end for the safety of those involved, but I'm not sure if Chapman agrees.So read it lightly, enjoy the simple black and white examples of couples whose problems are quickly solved with the help of Mr. Chapman, and use your own common sense when applying his advice."
"I was already familiar with the concept of Love Languages and know mine and my husbands. I‚Äôve wanted to get this book for a long time because I knew it would go more in depth. It has great ideas for how to express your partners love language. My husband and I are pretty solid, but I feel like this will help bring us closer and get us through the future rough patches that all relationships have."
"Very disappointed. Extremely shallow. My wife and I went through it...found it lacking in depth, in help and in addressing real issues. No true solutions. -- Dont waste your money, honestly"
"The cheesiest book I‚Äôve ever read. Any book that uses the words, ‚Äòlove tank‚Äô seriously is garbage in my eyes. I felt so silly the whole time I read it and I didn‚Äôt get anything useful."
"This book states sex is a dialect of the Physical Touch love language. (chapt 8 pg 109)Later on (chapt 12) the book discusses sex with an example from an emotionally abusive marriage.""But if you express an act of love [SEX] that is designed for the other person's benefit of pleasure, it is simply a choice. You are not claiming that the action grows out of a deep emotional bonding. You are simply doing something for his benefit. I think that must be what Jesus meant.""  That is the advice the author gives a woman in an emotionally abusive marriage. He is advising her to sleep with her husband 1-2x weekly as an ""experiment"". At the end of the chapter, the author concludes the husband is now happy with his marriage. If you are struggling, like I did, with the Bible quotes regarding love and hate that the author uses to back up his ""experiment"", I suggest Eph 5:29.Our couples therapist recommended this book, and my husband used it in therapy to pressure me for more sex. (Physical touch is his love language. Not PDA, not massages, just hugs,  french kisses, and sex). We were having sex pretty much weekly, despite problems in our marriage, until he used this book to pressure me for more sex.  I just reached the point where I couldn't do it any longer. No amount of praying or trying to show love could get me through it anymore. Sex has to be given freely. If there is a point in a relationship where sex can't be freely given any longer, but is still expected, that is sexual coercion.I don't agree that sex is a dialect in one love language. Why does sex belong more to physical touch than quality time? Or any other love language? This book makes some good points, but the sexual coercion theme runs throughout this book. I cried a lot over the book, especially the author's use of Bible verses in chapt 12 to support the premise that giving a man sex (if that's his love language) can heal a broken marriage even if the other partner isn't willing to work on the marriage. I don't understand how a book that is this damaging has helped so many marriages. The Love Language theme has some good points, it really does. But be careful. Sexual coercion isn't acceptable, and loving someone enough to put their needs ahead of your own isn't always the answer.*Edit 6 months later*Obviously, I was reading this book because of marriage difficulties. Since I wrote this review, it seems there may be some emotional abuse in my relationship. If there is even a hint of any form of abuse in your relationship, maybe start with the Boundaries (Cloud, Townsend) book first. I think this book only works if both people are genuinely trying. Chapt 12 is deeply troubling, because both people were not trying and there seemed to be emotional abuse. Expressing love requires safety. The woman in chapt 12 didn't read safe to me. I wish the author had checked up on her after the ""experiment"", not just declared success because he heard her husband was happy. Maybe it all worked for her also, but we don't know. I'd like to know what she thinks."
"Not worth it, just religious propaganda over a pretty good interpretation on relationships"
"I read this book a few years ago, and it is one that I plan to refer back to and reread over and over again as I go through different stages of my life. I had read this a few years after my divorce and quickly and easily realized how this book might have helped in that situation. I am of course grateful for my personal journey up until this point, but it was great to become introspective and use this book to think back to certain times where resentments had grown between me and my ex and just to see where we didn't have the words to express where we felt under served (we were young!). In my current relationship it has helped me very much. I now understand the way I receive love and the way my future husband receives love. I recommend this book to every single one of my friends that are getting married, are in transition, or are totally single. It helps so much to recognize the way you appreciate being loved so you can easily identify how a significant other works with you to make sure you feel loved, as well as how best to reciprocate how they appreciate being loved. If I could have given this 10 stars, I would have!"
Used as a self book with a spouse. He used it as a cheating tool
"I love this book!! This summer has been a summer of self discovery for me, I decided to read a handful of Self help type book. This was recommended by a friend and let me tell you it opened my eyes! Since I'm not married I read this more as a how to proceed in the future. I know he wrote a book for single people but I didn't like the sample so I decided to go with he original. Since I'm single I reflected a lot on my past significant relationships and realized a lot of problems Chapman spoke about in the book or counseled on were things I encountered. amazing read I've been recommending it to all my friends and basically can't stop talking about it!"
"Love this book VERY informative. Is extremely surprising how much similarities this book have to so many married couples. I have laughed , cried and even become shock with the accuracy it has in this book. Not only did I learn a lot from this book I TRULY RECOMMEND it to ANY couple married or not trying to make changes in their lives or relationship. The author is truly a genius if I‚Äôve had known about this book earlier I‚Äôm sure my marriage could of been saved from a lot of headaches. I‚Äôm not giving information or details of the book because I feel it‚Äôs in YOUR best interest to read it your self and see EXACTLY what I mean. Plus I don‚Äôt do spoilers soooooo. Enjoy the book hope it helps you out and give you the knowledge you need and allows you to view things differently."
"This is THE best self-help book on relationships that I've come across. It helps you understand that the most important aspect of keeping a relationship thriving is learning what the other person needs and values and then delivering that in the best way you can manage. Some people value words of affirmation (a compliment, a spoken acknowledgment of your better traits, gratitude, etc.). Others enjoy getting gifts, or when someone does something for them, etc. The most common mistake is that we usually try to show love in the way that WE value, but not necessarily in the way that's important to the other person. So we keep speaking the wrong 'love language' and simultaneously missing the message that our partner is sending.If you sit down and discuss with your partner what tickles your fancy, and listen to them, it will go a long way in improving how you interact. It's also worthwhile to talk about what you don't like in your partner's behavior, and the same for your partner, so that you understand the things to avoid.Laying all this out can initially be painful, and difficult for men in particular or those not accustomed to opening up their feelings. And fixing your own behaviors takes practice and time. But it is essential to do so, because if you keep doing the same thing and getting the same undesirable results, well... don't expect your relationship to magically get better. I watched my parents repeat this same toxic circle their entire lives, and figured there had to be a better way to communicate and get along. There is. This book will help you get there. It should be essential reading for all couples."
"I guess I think my headline says it all.  If it works for you, great.  I'm not impressed"
"My wife and I bought this book and read it together. The most valuable binding experience we had from this was criticizing it after we finished.Don't waste your money on this  The amount of useful information it provides is about 10 pages and all of that is already available for free in easily digestible summaries online. Unless you enjoy reading repetitive, unrealistic (I suspect made up) stories, self-aggrandizing drivel, and a very odd push of religion, you'll find nothing of real value here."
"First and foremost, my book arrived in a timely fashion, and was in great condition. No surprises there. So A+ on the condition and shipping of the item.As for the book itself, I do recommend it to every couple, but with a little advice.You can easily find the quiz on line to determine your love language ranks....there are 5 and the idea is that we all need a mix of them, but most people have a dominant (or two) language that makes them feel the most loved. So go take the online test to get your ranking (way faster and easier than doing the book version) and then head to the book to learn more about them.The book is helpful. The concept seems solid and the methods effective....with one caveat....I personally think that everyone‚Äôs love language changes. For example, what I needed to feel loved 10 years ago vs. now, is drastically different, now that my life is different. What ranks as #4 on my list now, most certainly would have been #1 then. Even smaller changes over smaller periods of time can change it. 6 months ago what is now my #1, was definitely more my #3.So I think it becomes important for a couple to understand ALL 5 of the languages and be able to communicate with each other when their needs fluctuate and change, as life is not constant and unchanging.If you keep that in mind and work together, this can be a very eye opening and helpful technique for you and your partner to better express your love in the ways the benefit each other, making for both of you to be much more satisfied and happy.Best of luck and happy reading!"
"Should be called ""The 5 Love Languages: For Heteros"". Interesting read and definitely provided some insight, but the book caters to hetero couples. Perhaps there is another book out there catered specifically to same sex couples."
"After my husband cheated on me and returned home to try again a few months later (we had been married 9 years with 3 kids), this book helped us BOTH tremendously to heal and understand how what happened occurred and to help us guard from this happening ever again. In our case life got in the way with a total of 6 kids - 3 being teens and we drifted apart unintentionally when a woman co-worker swooped in to tell my husband he deserved better not knowing anything about me. Oh and Our older 3 teen daughters dad had just committed suicide so I was trying very hard to be there for them and didn‚Äôt spend enough time on my husband I guess. This made her seduction too powerful. He thought I didn‚Äôt love him anymore when I did and let his guard drop when he found the attention he craved. As he pulled away, I pulled further away. Any way, We read one chapter together almost every day until we finished it. I highly recommend it for every new couple and couples struggling. It has been challenging to forgive but every day is better and our relationship better than ever. We have been back together for over a year now so Thank you!"
This book was recommended to me and I'm am so glad I read it.  I love to cook for my family and after reading this book I now know my love language is about getting recognition for my efforts.  It's also helped me realize how to better recognize the needs of my husband and children based on their love languages.  I think everyone can get some helpful insights from reading it.  I have on both audible and book.I was able to read the entire book over a 2 day period.  Maybe 4-5 hours.
"One of my best friends told me I should read this book since it always felt like as much as my husband and I truly loved each other we couldn't always express it correctly to each other for the other to really feel that love and I read the book first in at most two days and then told my husband, who is not an avid reader at all unless it's a sports article like I am, that he had to read this book not just for the sake of our marriage (which was always good but could always be better) but in a way to even understand himself and me as a person better. After he got to a certain point I told him what type of person I was and what type of love I was pretty sure I needed and he was able to tell me the same and we took the little test to be sure and he continued reading it and I reread the parts that I thought were important for me to digest even more fully to be able to show him the type of love he needed.. Mind you, we are both very different types of people and require and naturally give very different types of love, but after reading this very very helpful and eye opening book we were then able to finally show each other our love for one another in the language the person understood more fluently and it helped us to understand what the other person really needed from the other. I show him my love for him with my acts of love, dinner when he gets home and a clean house and that's all he needs to be truly happy, never would have guessed that was all it took.. And he learned I needed him to be there to truly felt loved by him..sometimes I know he can't always give me exactly that due to long hours at work and whatnot but ever since reading this book, he'll send me little texts during the day while at work just to tell me about his day or call me at lunch and for him that's nothing but for me, it's everything because I know he's thinking of me and that gives me that little extra bounce in my step while he's gone all day because I know he loves me and is still thinking of me when he's not with me and out working or anything else. Every married couple, no matter how amazing you think your marriage is, or even every couple in general, both parties should definitely read this book. It's I'm positive the most dead on accurate book I've ever read, and will make any relationship, no matter how long it's been, go from great or possibly even falling apart to feeling like that honeymoon phase again where nothing in it could ever be more perfect, no matter what your little flaws are. It's pure genius."
"I wasn‚Äôt too crazy about this book. My fianc√© and I took the quizzes in the back, and both of us had results that matched each other‚Äôs presumed language areas. Some of the wording was...interesting. The word choice seemed extremely gender biased when male vs. female pronouns were used. I also wish they would have used the term partner instead of husband and wife. I think this would have made the book more inclusive."
"I've read dozens of books on the psychology of relationships, but this is one of the best and most useful I've ever seen. Gary Chapman's unique concept of ""The 5 Love Languages"" (Affirmations, Quality Time, Acts of Service, Gifts, and Physical Touch) describes how knowing and using the 5 love languages can improve and deepen loving relationships, while misunderstanding them can cause harm. The information in this book is well-organized, easy to read and understand, and includes lots of stories that are not only interesting, but clearly illustrate the author's point. There is also a self-assessment tool at the end, plus links to additional info online.Dr. Chapman's basic concept is that ""5 love languages"" are commonly used in committed relationships to express love and affection toward one's partner. Chapman explains that loving couples can run into trouble if they don't know and understand their own dominant love language or that of their partner.  A relationship can thrive if and when each person understands which specific love language is most important to themselves and also knows and honors their partner's most important way of receiving love, which is often different from their own. All 5 of the love languages are equally useful and valid; none are better or more preferred than any other. They simply reflect how an individual's unique needs, expectations, and personality are expressed by the ways they most want to receive love from their partner.Dr. Chapman devotes a chapter to each of ""The 5 Love Languages"" using stories from his practice as a licensed Marriage and Family Counselor to show the need for using the correct expressions of love and how using the wrong love language can damage an otherwise good relationship. For example, if a wife's dominant love language is affirmations (including compliments, encouragement, appreciation, and gratitude) but her husband doesn't understand how important these positive words are to her, he might think it's OK to tease her about her looks, accuse her of being lazy, or criticize her cooking. When she needs kind and supportive words but hears insults and put-downs instead, she will feel unloved, no matter what else he does to show he cares. He could surprise her with flowers, hug and kiss her when he comes home, fix the leaky faucet, or offer to take the kids to the park, but still, if he does not give her the words she needs, she will feel unappreciated and unfulfilled. On the other hand, if the husband's dominant love language is spending quality time with his wife, but his wife thinks that taking good care of the house & kids and cooking him a nice meal every night is the best way to show him her love, he will feel resentful and misunderstood. What he needs most is for her to set aside time for listening and sharing with him, for making plans, and spending quality time one-on-one. If she does not understand how important quality time is to him, that will damage their relationship. Having a weekly date night is probably the most important thing this couple could do to improve their marriage.""The 5 Love Languages"" is written specifically for married couples, but the advice could easily be applied to ANY relationship, including family and friends. The author has written other books using the 5 languages concept, such as ""The 5 Love Languages"" for parents  - how to express love to their children and teens. Some kids thrive on physical touch when young, but the kind of touch is likely to change when they become teens. Some kids rely on quality time with one or both parents, while others want more time alone but still need to hear lots of affirmations. I wish I had known about ""The 5 Love Languages"" when my kids were little, but now that they are grown I can still use what I've learned to improve all my relationships.Overall, this book is the real deal, both important and useful. I highly recommend ""The 5 Love Languages"" to anyone wanting to learn how to improve and express love in their relationships."
"The entire book can be boiled down to this: Discover what makes your partner feel loved, and do that. Somehow the author has managed to convince people to pay him for that bit of common sense along with a generous helping of misogynistic, uber religious, 1950‚Äôs-esque ‚Äúwisdom.‚Äù Waste of time and money."
"In the acknlowedgements Chapman mentions his wife who is so loving and if all women loved their husbands like she loves hers, husbands would not go looking over the fence. This put me off right at the start because it heavily implies that when men stray, it is their wife's fault. We all know that a man can have a wonderful wife who is beautiful and have a beautiful family and everyone does their part -- but the man still strays. Look at Chris Watts who murdered his wife and two daughters. What did his wife do that didn't ""love him"" enough that made him engage in adultery and then murder? Could it have really been his wife's fault that he did all of that? If only she'd loved him better or more or in a way HE demanded and wanted? He could have just divorced her, but he murdered her and two littel girls, his own flesh and blood. Why? Because he wanted another woman. Tell me how love from anyone could have stopped him.I'm still reading the book and think it's important to understand the ways of giving and receiving love so there's a lot to get into here. The concept is really good and helpful. I think it's helped me in relationships not just with men but with family and friends and children. Know your own love language, listen and pay attention to others' love languages. The advice here can help people understand why their communication has broken down or faltered."
"I was asked to read this book by my wife. As usual, I put it off and procrastinated. Not thinking that a simple little book could do anything to improve our lives.Looking back I remember the desperation in her watery eyes as she would ask if I read the book she'd continually leave on the counter.I did eventually read it. After it was too late. After my stubbornness and misplaced pride,  no, arrogance had thrived on to the point it didn't matter to her anymore if I read it or not.By that time she had moved out, we had the most civil divorce probably in history. I thought I knew what she wanted. And whatever that was, didn't involve me. If only I had read this book.It was like a light bulb turned on. So many miscominations and sour interactions. Became so obvious it was uncanny. I was elated. I finally understood why I had been failing as a husband.  Why I felt unable to communicate with my wife. There was hope on the horizon.......I read it 2 weeks before she killed was by her new boyfriend. Who Inturn killed himself afterward. I had every opportunity to stop that event from happening. That is a burden I will carry forever.My point is; if someone you love asks you to do something as simple as read a short little book.  Make the effort and at least humor them. You might be surprised what you find out about yourself. Or don't, and the worst possible fate of hell could curse you and scar your soul."
"I think the ideas and premise of the book are great and amazing.  I have yet to implement them with my spouse but have already heard myself saying some of the examples describe me to the T.  I gave the book a 4* instead of a 5* because of 1 simple statement.  The end he says he didn't write it for financial gain, or to be new York times best seller, he simply wrote it for you the reader.  Less than a page later he says goto my website to get study guides and info.  You goto the website and its huge advertisement for purchasing more.  I get it this is a business and you have to make money, but then charge me more for the book and give me the study guide for free because it is supposed to be about and for me."
"This book is wonderful!  None of it is rocket science, but it sure does bring everything into perspective and allowed me to realize lots of things in my relationship with my husband.  I also taught me a thing or two.  I am very glad that I read it and I also handed the book over to my husband to read.  We have implemented some of the suggestions this book highlighted and it has helped our relationship.  The key is that we were both willing to work on our relationship and this book gave us some tools to use.  Our relationship is not perfect, but it is much better than it used to be and for that I am happy and thankful.On another note, this book is a very quick read and an easy read.  The author is not preachy."
"Do NOT buy this book. FIrst off, not only are ALL of the situations presented completely sexist and play into gender roles, but also it's a flat out misleading and dangerous book. I found another review on it, and it sums it up perfectly. It promotes a codependent and score-keeping relationship, not spiritual by any means. Do not do not do NOT get this book."
"My husband and I have been struggling for years with our relationship. If took an affair on his part for me to open my eyes and realize we were not nurturing our marriage which lead him to stray. I have chosen to forgive him and we are working towards a better marriage. On our journey it was suggested we read this book. I could not put it down, had it read within 24 hours. He also has read it in a short amount of time. I knew  exactly what his love language is without the quiz but mine was a little more tricky. I took the quiz and two ranked pretty high so we decided to work on both of them. I have high hopes that our marriage can and will be saved. This book is very well written and makes so much sense. Highly recommend. I have even suggested my friends read it just so they don't struggle like my husband and I have. So if your marriage is in trouble pick this book up and give it a second chance."
"This book has 5 stars, I thought I might find some earth shattering approach to solving relationship, but there is none to be found here. While the idea is simple and somewhat true, it is an overstatement of the author to claim that all problems in marriage can be solved thru learning the love languages. Additionally, I believe every person converses in these 5 languages of love and that theyre equally important, it's not like every person has one primary love language and that the rest can be ignored, so the whole premise of the book is flawed in my opinion. If youre struggling in your relationship this book is definitely not gonna help you, you will need a more radical approach, this book (if it's of any use at all) is maybe good for beginners and people looking make their relationship even better, but this won't take you far, there are other more radical approaches that I would recommend."
"Although a good read, I would not have bought it had I known that there are so many religious references.  I think I learned more about Jesus than relationships."
"There is a brief caution near the end against using acts of love in a manipulative way, but a couple of the examples were questionable.He advises one woman to sleep with her husband when she doesn't want to do so. Supposedly, it saved her marriage.He says not to let people treat you like a doormat but then gives an example where a woman saved her marriage with an uncooperative husband. Seems like a setup for blaming yourself for not trying hard enough if things go wrong.Overall, though, they are good guidelines to think about. Things to watch out for when dealing with partners. So, not all bad."
"I speed-read this book as a young teenager, and the impact was so big that I didn't realize that love was also an emotion until last summer. Gary Chapman's main premise is that romantic love is temporary, and therefore you also need to commit to love your partner in ways that they best appreciate. These tend to be in 5 main categories: words of affirmation, acts of service, receiving gifts, quality time, and physical touch. While the author hardly ever mentions scientific credentials, I find his theories consistent with Gottman and other love scientists. Likely, people are more emotionally receptive to different things due to how they were loved as children. I believe this concept is likely scientifically sound, given how oxytocin is regulated. The author writes from a Christian point of view and occasionally references scripture. With overconfident and underqualified authors, this tends to get on my nerves, but Chapman's concepts seem to be correct, and from what I can tell, he usually uses scripture accurately. The most valuable aspect of this book is the author's concept of love languages, explained simply with practical examples of what he means. As a result, this book is very approachable and is precise enough to be useful even if the author's approach isn't scientific. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the conscious nature of love after limerence, both as a standalone and as part of supplementary literature."
"I started reading this book and between having a full time job, two kids, and endless housework I managed to finish it in 3 days. This book is amazing. I have never heard of ""love languages"" until this book and wish I would have known about it sooner. If you are on your last straw and cant take the lonely feeling, the feeling like he doesn't help you around the house, the feeling like you aren't appreciated, this is the book for you. It will help you understand why he doesn't do whatever you may do and realize that not everyone has the same love language. I just finished the book tonight and starting this second I feel like I can overcome our marital problems with the help of this book. From this moment on I will speak fluent in love languages language‚ù§ this is my first review after having Amazon for three years with maybe over 100 orders but this book can help you if you're willing to put forth the effort!"
"This book is life-changing.  While no self-help book will address every single problem that can arise in relationships, I feel like this book probably comes pretty close to it.There are a lot of things that can screw up a relationship, and some of them--like chronic dishonesty, outright abuse, etc.--cannot be surmounted with any amount of work.  However, a great deal of relationship problems stem from breakdowns in communication.  This book can help people get past that particular hurdle, which can go a long, long way to then creating a meaningful, intentional space in which differences may be worked out more effectively and lovingly.I would recommend this book to anyone in any relationship, romantic or otherwise... because its principles apply across the board to any loved one.  And even though co-workers are not usually what we consider ""loved ones,"" it even applies to them.  I would ESPECIALLY recommend this book to people who are making the decision to get married, and I would tell them to keep it at eye-level on their bookshelf and to take it out and read it periodically during the course of their marriage to keep its wisdom and advice close at hand at all times.  This stuff is relationship GOLD."
Okay.  This is what I learned.  This is good and great for anyone looking to improve your relationships.  HOWEVER it‚Äôs NOT a substitute for anyone with ‚Äúanger management‚Äù issues.  This book does NOT help with that.  I‚Äôve had to learn the hard way that I need to love myself first before this book could work for me.  My deep suppressed anger has become too difficult to control and this book only exacerbated my will to suppress angry feelings.  So if you don‚Äôt have anger issues this book should work great.  If you have anger issues please get an anger management book FIRST!
"Normally I round up for ratings, but in this instance I chose to give 2.5 stars a solid 2, and that‚Äôs only bc I feel 1 star would be too harsh. So, okay- I came across a whole TWO SENTENCES that actually gave me insight and SOME wisdom...But everything else was utter garbage. I mean, wth is going on here?! I can‚Äôt be the only 1 who feels this book is ridiculous(ly) overhyped..?! I‚Äôm sry but- what a joke. I‚Äôll concede to the fact that understanding your love language and how that correlates to your relationship can, indeed, be a helpful tool for couples... But also not really? (Obvs, this is assuming your partner is even willing to put in the effort to apply these tactics). I was already aware that quality time and affection was extremely important to me, & that my partner appreciates much the same. This book gets recommended all over the entire internet and actually had me believing I‚Äôd find some insight into a better way to connect with my SO; instead what I got was (again) common sense packaged as a revolutionary idea. Equally as disappointing was the realization that, the majority of the couples‚Äô stories usually starting (& ending!) with most of the onus and/or suffering primarily upon its female counterpart- proving to me that Dr. Chapman is not my brand of reliable advice.Don‚Äôt waste your money on this ‚Äúself-help/improvement‚Äù BS. Not to take away from those who‚Äôve actually found insight here- if you did, I‚Äôm so glad and to each their own!! But if you feel my review is helpful to you, & you‚Äôre still somewhat curious and rly want to see what this love language stuff is all about: do yourself a favor and just go take an online test to ascertain your ‚Äúlove language.‚ÄùBut PLEASE- DO NOT waste your money on this book!! It‚Äôs just more scam-filled, self-help BS masquerading as some secret to lasting love- as there is literally no such thing (meaning some ‚Äúone-size-fits-all‚Äù secret), just don‚Äôt even bother."
"I heard about this book years ago and said I was gonna read it but never did. I finally got it and I can't finish. I love to read and when I get good books I usually read them in 1 sitting,if they are interesting. This book had some pretty good observations, examples,ideas and advice. The format is kind of hard to stick with after a while. I had to keep stopping to wake myself up and force myself to continue because it got repetitive. The content is useful but I didn't really learn much about what my love language was. Do you have one,many,a primary and secondary? I guess I might need to just start over,try it again and finally finish,but jeesh I had to start pages over several times because I would doze off,get lost and miss stuff."
"First, thank you.  Thank you Gary Chapman for your thoughtfulness, insights, and willingness to share.  And thank you - each and every one of you who took the time to share your feedback on this book.  You brought me here.  Your experiences led me to spend the money and to take the chance.  All of you can't be wrong.  This is one of those times when Amazon works so well for all of us.My marriage was literally in crisis.  I was searching for answers to unanswerable questions.  My wife and I were going to a very dark place.  Twenty-four hours later, after we spent time reading the first few chapters of ""The 5 Love Languages"" together, we have a start.  This book seems to have been written just for the two of us.  Chapman's analysis of the daily interactions taking place in a marriage are spot on.  His analogies make clear and perfect sense.  We both understand the commission we have been given:  we're committed to learning a new language.  Chapman makes it very personal and speaks directly to us.  His examples are relevant and explanatory.I haven't found the answers that are so elusive.  But we have a path out of the darkness if we both choose to take it. No matter the current state of your relationship with your partner, there is something in this book for you.  With gratitude to all of you, good luck making your relationships what you would wish them to be."
"Wooow wooow wooow!!! Loveee this book so much!!!! I'm so glad my sister told me about this book, and I definitely recommend this book to anyone!! I just wish this book had more pages because I'm scared to finish it, so far it's really helped me and husband with some problems we are having and I came up with the idea that we would take turns reading to each other and it's helped alot with opening up about our feelings. Even if your not having problems with your relationship I so recommend this book just to read it and have the knowledge for future relationships."
"I'm not one for self-help books. By choosing to read this book, I didn't expect any miracles either. I assumed it would be a book filled with advice that I could choose to (or not to) follow. While it does provide a lot of recommendations and advice, this book offered a LOT more than just, ""try this. try that. it'll be great. etc. etc. etc.""I checked this book out on a random hunch from watching the show Working Moms. The main character is discussing what she's learned from it (in a hilarious way) and it got me to thinking, ""I wonder where my wife and I act/react/respond differently."" So, I went and bought it because...worst case scenario - it's a dumb book and I stop reading it. Best case scenario - there's a learning or two and it isn't a waste of time.This book was the latter.Our marriage has been perfectly great so far but there's always room for improvement, right?I think this book helped me understand the different ways we both perceive needs/wants in terms of how we do things, how we want things, and how we want to be recognized or appreciated.Don't get me wrong, we're still the same people - but the book provided different communication outlets for us both to talk through and better understand the other. So often we can't figure out why he/she acts/feels a certain way or does a certain thing but there are reasons. We can't all be the same (that's boring) but understanding the why and how to engage better with those whys can be a big difference-maker.You only get in what you put in - so if you read the book - be prepared to talk it out and be open to change. Otherwise, you'll have read a book but gained nothing."
Seems more a matter of opinion. Very little research to back any claims. More of a series of anecdotes and reflection of  the authors experience with his clients.
"Seriously, the most simplified, easy-to-read way to get your relationship back to where it was (in time). The book gives  you relatable examples, and simple exercises you can do. Basically once you find your partner's love language, it shows you little everyday tasks you can do to help your partner feel loved. Loved people love back. Similarly like a couple shared in the book, after one week, I already saw improvement in our communication. We were putting in effort to meeting each other's love language needs, so we communicated better. We used to speak to each other about normal things with almost resentment in our tone. Now that our needs are met, and we are each feeling loved, we are back to communicating as a loving couple should.It is to also be noted that even though this is geared towards married couples,  my boyfriend (32M) and I (30F) are not married, and it still applied very well to our relationship.The book also includes two quizzes to find your own love language. These are based on your gender. So I must note that for anyone that may not appreciate that.I personally found myself smiling while reading it, because being able to see some issues real couples have, and how they react is eye opening. There were times where I thought maybe one of them was overreacting or harping on something that wasn't a big deal, but in reality I probably would have reacted in a similar way.Overall, 100% worth the buy. So inexpensive, and you will be going back to it again and again for reference. I honestly feel good when I read it. If you and your partner both have open minds and are willing to actually put in effort (which is honestly not much), this is what you need."
"This number one best seller in the relationship category has everyone fooled. This book makes so much sense at first. If a husband lives by this, he will get divorced even still. I implore you to research rebuttals about this book first. Please read  the rational male or ANY.....any red pill award books. This book is grossly misleading and damaging to men. You will loose your frame and she will gain control of the marriage. That is all"
"He should do some revising to make his examples more gender neutral or at least random. It seemed like every time he was talking about a ‚Äòshe‚Äô she was nagging and complaining. Whereas every ‚Äòhe‚Äô was out working to support the family, of course! Even the FAQs at the back of the book were ridiculous... what if my wife won‚Äôt do this? What if my wife won‚Äôt do that? I doubt it will be the men having trouble getting their wife to read the book or speak their love language. Like others suggested, I think you could just google the concepts and get the idea."
"You would think we would all know what is taught in this book since we all act like ""know it alls"" and how ""everyone else is at fault"" for our broken hearts. Gary Chapman Sir, I was one of those people. Thank you for your insightful and down to earth explanations and advice. My Husband and I thank you.  We both have 2 primary love languages and were speaking to each other in completely opposite dialects! We love each other just didn't know ""how to say it."" We even downloaded the app to check on each others love tanks.  God Bless you and your work. Amen."
"Overall, this was a great book. I am am atheist and there are several times that this books uses God, faith or certain religious texts to get it's point across however, that was something very easy for me to look pass.The overall message of the book was great and refreshing. It was interesting to see some of the things I do or don't do in this book as examples of other people's mistakes or accomplishments. I will definitely be giving this to my wife to read. I think this will help both my wife and I on building a stronger marriage."
"I've heard a lot about the five love languages. Social media, talk shows, and other websites say to help your relationship you need to speak each other's love language before you try to work on other problems. You need to be sure you're doing what you can to fill each other's love tank. I was skeptical on reading reviews because someone mentioned the author talks about religion too much, and I'm atheist and don't personally feel religion has anything to do with my love life. However after reading it I don't feel like the author overly stated how religion and love interact. He mentioned his personal experience with religion and love, and how a patient of his was able to understand love language better through their religion. I feel as though these things are entirely appropriate. Although I'm not going to go into detail about my relationship, I will say that asking each other every day how our love tank is on a scale of 0-10 has really opened up communication between us. I also feel as though the author was able to put into words some of the things that I was feeling, but unable to say."
"This is such a good book that I actually enjoyed reading, I had been in a reading slump before this book and I could never read self help books! This book changed that for me- it read with a personal story to explain each love language which helped to understand it more! I feel like my relationships even with my friends have gotten better, and if anyone is struggling I recommend this book! It's appropriate for all ages, it almost never talks about intercourse except for very briefly mentioning it. Overall, I'm glad I read this book while I'm happy in my relationship instead of feeling horrible- even if I was in a bad state in my relationship, this book would help so much!"
"I made me think about my marriage, i had a idea of what was going wrong this put my thoughts in clarity. I pay close attention to certain things and i knew i was on to something. This helped me tremendously. i just hope i can apply the concept now and love regardless if I‚Äôm loved back.  that part i can see might be tough. It‚Äôs like investing all your money with no return."
"A good perspective about love. Although I've naturally communicated love through each of these languages before (I know most of you readers have too), but it draws emphasis on areas needing more focus. After you get complacent, it's easy to forget to do these things - it reinforces the idea that Love is a discipline. It challenges you to give first and understand what the other person specifically needs. There needs to be reciprocation and with a lot of handwork there usually is reciprocation. It's also important to understand that certain things you do are not appreciated because it's not that person's primary love language. If you're having problems, you're basically going to have to do things you're not used to that allows you to give what is needed. Four of the love language are also applicable to our coworkers and friends - similar principles of dealing with people are expressed in many other books like ""How to Win Friends and Influence People."" However, this book has made me more aware of what I think is my primary love language and my partner's love language as well. Many thanks to Dr. Chapman."
"This book gave so much clarity on so many things about myself and boyfriend of 6 years and the reoccurring problems we've always came back to. After reading this then having him read the parts i needed him to read( because he didn't want to read the entire thing so i underlined the jist of it) , I've felt huge improvements and i truly believe these improvements will stay with us from now on. He now understands what i need to feel loved and why i didn't, and i with him. We spoke entirely different love languages so the message never quite came across the way it was supposed to. Now its working better for us both. I have a list of people who are waiting to read my copy because of how much i went on about this book. Even if your not having relationship problems, please read this book. This should be taught in school. Not just for romantic relationship but for family and friends as well."
I read this a little too late for my last two relationships (I‚Äôve known about the book for 6 years) but I finally pulled the trigger after my recent split. I really liked the book. The actual concepts are easy to understand and the examples provided for each are helpful (although they feel a little fabricated?). I‚Äôm not sure if this would‚Äôve saved my relationships but it definitely gives me another level of perspective and will help me potentially understand my SO better. I wish he would provided a little better insight than ‚Äúlook to God‚Äù for loving the unloveable but I feel there‚Äôs enough supporting content to get the picture of what to do in those situations.
"I first did the online ""quiz"" on the author's website (5lovelanguages.com) to see what my ""love language"" was.  The quiz itself was straight forward, and I don't disagree with the scoring results.  Intrigued, I purchased the book.  While I find the idea of a ""love language"" interesting and helpful, Chapman is obviously a very straight religious male with an underlying belief in traditional family values and male/female roles.  I found his writing style simplistic and unimaginative, as if he was writing to an audience with little higher education.  I was also disappointed that he doesn't include any mention of same-sex couples or relationships.  Another reviewer mentioned their distaste of Chapman's religious overtones, and I too found this to be irritating.Overall, I think the concept that people have a tendency to express (and wish to receive) love in a particular ""language"" is helpful.  I just wish the author could move beyond his overly traditional and limited views of what makes up a relationship, and embrace a more inclusive approach.  Not everyone is straight, Christian, or living in the 1950's.I'd like to see someone offer a well-written book about the concept of ""love languages"" while focusing on gay and lesbian relationships (and leave religion out of it).  Now that would be a book I'd be happy to buy."
"Don't listen to the bad reviews , people seem to be caught in details that don't matter and missing the point completely!Some of the examples used of specific  couples might not be your ideal, or hearing a couple bibble phrases quoted , a couple times in say a religious couples example story  might not be your thing. But! That is not the point! It's not the big picture! The point is to teach you 5 basic primary ways peoples needs, need to be met to feel loved. So (Unlike some opinions here) it does apply! To same sex couples ! And even non romantic relationshipsIt isn't outdated! People get triggered and miss the big picture. This is an amazing book and it fan teach you so much if you focus on what matters. The point, is to teach you to recognize the way your loved one and yourself needs love to be expressed to feel loved. And how we waste our time by showing it in ways that don't eate as love to them.We all can benefit from this book."
"I received this book as a wedding present 4.5 years ago.  I put it away with other books that I had with no interest in reading.  4 years later, i was going on a business trip and grab the book to read while i was on the plane.  Best book of my life.. I would recommend this book to anyone weather married or not this book made a tremendous difference with my husband I let my daughter read it I bought one for my daughter in law I told my boss about it and I let him borrow it best book ever"
"This was a great read to understand how your partner's love needs can be met. Learn their language, start speaking it, and things can shift for the better. The only part I didn't like, were the Christian undertones (it's not listed as a Christian book and has a conservative/square feel) and the lack of awareness that partners are not male/female all the time. It needs an updated version, where it is all-religion and all-gender/relationship encompassing. Other than the old school feel, the information itself it highly helpful. I do recommend partners read this and apply the concepts. And it's a quick, easy read!"
"I never realized that we have ways of showing our love and ways we want to receive it - and they don't necessarily match.  I can't see how any couple couldn't benefit from this book.  A friend recommended it to me and I was hesitant because I do not read these types of books, EVER.  But, I trusted her and her husband enough and they have a great marriage so I thought, why not.  Glad I did.  It was well worth the read and I find myself going back to check things here & there as time goes on.  I enjoyed the couple stories and could definitely relate to a couple of them.I recommend this for any married / committed couple."
"Think you know your partner's ""love language""? Think again!  Think you know your own, so that your partner is meeting all of your emotional needs? Think again.You might just be inadvertently speaking 2 different languages when it comes to that!What makes me think I'm showing my love to my husband, it's not necessarily 'his' language, and vice versa, I've learned after 8 years together.This book, whether one of you or both of you reads it, will definitely help you grow closer in your relationship. Whether or not you're having communication problems or any other problems in your relationship, this is a book worth getting. I wish I had it sooner."
"Bought this after reading about the love languages. I thought it might help my then-husband and I understand each other better. I found it helpful and insightful. It‚Äôs very short which was a plus. I think I read it in a day or 2. He refused to read it. So while idk if it would have saved our marriage, it did help me realize that I wasn‚Äôt getting what I needed and he wasn‚Äôt going to make the effort and I deserved better. I think knowing your love language is helpful in a relationship simply the way any other personality type can be helpful. Sometimes it gives a little insight into why things are the way they are. It‚Äôs not the be all to end all but just another piece of the puzzle"
"Often we don't understand why others don't feel as loved as we think we are showing them.  Come to find out if you are showering someone with gifts that really desires quality time then you simply will never provide that person with  what they see as being loving.  Often what we do for others to show love is our ""love language"" so it really isn't hard to see what other's do and do in return what they are doing.  If someone gives gifts often, chances are that is how they perceive love...give them gifts and they will feel loved.  Apply this basic principle to the other 4 love languages and you'll be far ahead in all of your relationships."
"This book really helps you take a look at what is emotionally important to you and your partner(s) in a relationship. I would recommend this book to anyone who feels disconnected with their partner despite the fact that they are trying their hardest to improve their relationship. Nothing hurts more than giving all of your time and/or energy to someone only to have them act like you aren't trying hard enough. The author breaks down the feeling of ""being loved"" into categories that make sense, helps you identify which categories matter to your partner, and then gives you examples of how to use your time and/or energy more effectively to show your partner that you love them. This knowledge can also be used to help communicate your own emotional needs to your partner(s) and help them understand how they can fill them. I particularly liked the ""love tank"" analogy that the author used to compare our emotional needs to the gas tank of a car."
"My husband and I have been married 17 years now (met on eHarmony), and we still go through this book every year as a sort of marriage ""check-up"" to see where we are, and what we can do better in meeting each other's ""love language"". We just went on a short trip for our anniversary and took the book with us...spent lots of time reading it out loud to each other, and lots of discussion...it was great!"
"This concept could probably be better summed up in an article. I wanted some communication tips, but there's a ton of anecdotal evidence to sift through to get to anything helpful. It's a bit religious and cheesy - just not my bag. My mother might like it."
"After 18 years of marriage I finally read this book at the suggestion of a counselor as I'm struggling to recover our relationship from some almost impossible odds.  I was impressed by the book and the lessons in it, so I also asked my wife to read it.  That was 2 months ago and I have to say it's honestly an amazing difference in our relationship and I really believe that we're going to work through our indifferences in part due to this book.  We also use their app (Love Nudge) which is pretty helpful.  Not only is this book fun and interesting to read, but the lessons in the book are ones I wish I knew 20 years ago!"
"The basic advice of working out your differences with your spouse is worth reading this book.  It is a guideline on how to understand and approach common differences and create a common language in order to effectively communicate.I'm not a fan of all the religion in the last few chapters.  It doesn't  add to the content but seems artificially inserted almost gratuitously.I would recommend this book as I feel it helps me understand my own needs better, and the needs of others."
I don't care how long you have been with someone - 1 day or 25 years - this is a fantastic book.  I did this for singles 20 years ago and now did it with my fianc√©.  I can't tell you how much we got out of it!  I have boasted about it to all of my friends and I have three of them doing it with their husbands and they are loving it too.  Well worth the read.  We did it together on a road trip.  Read a chapter out loud and then talked forever on the topic.  One tip - go to the back of the book and take the questionnaire assessment first and then read the book.  It helps you key into the areas most applicable to you.  My friends are doing a chapter a night a couple times a week....  Invest in you and your significant other.  This was very rewarding.
"This book is mostly written for married heterosexual people. The book doesn‚Äôt discuss any other kind of love relationships. Fortunately, many of the concepts of the five love languages can be applied to a lot of different relationships. Some women may find this book too ‚Äútraditional‚Äù, (Jesus says you should go have sex with your husband who isn‚Äôt loving to you to please him and save your marriage) and others may find his message at the end too religious. (Jesus wants us to work at loving those who don‚Äôt love us and if they don‚Äôt come around, at least we tried). I‚Äôd say the first 10 chapters of this book have some use, and there‚Äôs nothing to be lost by attempting to define how you love and want to be loved."
Let me start by saying I wish I had read this book decades before I did. It has touched my personal relationships is such a positive way. I will also say as a therapist I use it often in my practice with my clients and feel that it has helped many of them as well. It so simple explains how misunderstandings come about in relationships and are overlooked. It provides you with practical tools to implement in all relationships not just romantic ones. This author is amazing! I have read other books penned by him and highly recommend him. You will not be disappointed in this book it is transformative
"Whether you are Christian or not you need to read this book. The heart and soul of this book is to cause people to understand themselves better and to understand others better. It really isn't just about marriage but all relationships. It is pretty obvious the world we currently live in has problems and people have more problems with others more than ever, probably because they don't understand others or themselves. We are all human and humans have emotional needs, this book is about what those needs are and how to get them met. If you are angry with someone, frustrated with someone or hurt by someone you need to read this book. I love when it talks about the ""love tank"" being like a bank account and if withdrawals are being made but never deposits sooner or later that love tank will be empty or even in debt. God bless and happy reading!"
"A friend at work gave me a copy of this book.  My husband and I went on a long road trip and so I thought what better time to read it together.  We really enjoyed the book.  Even though we've been together for over 30 years we never knew about Love Languages or that ours were different.  It really opened our eyes and helped us think about how the other person might be feeling.  My son and his girlfriend started having some differences and so I sent the book to them.  They started reading the book together and really enjoying it.  It's really helped them work through their differences.  Relationships are a job every day, but with this book it makes it a job I want to go to every day.  :)"
"As someone who is pretty far removed from religion I was not at all ‚Äútrigged‚Äù by the religious undertones of this book as some of the reviews suggested. Yes, the author has a religious background but even I felt he made some very interesting points using fairly infrequent references to the Bible, big deal.Furthermore this book was enthusiastically suggested to me by my good friend who happens to be gay, so please don‚Äôt think this book is exclusive for ‚Äútraditional man-woman‚Äù relationships or offensive to all LGBT+ couples.Overall I thought this was an extremely interesting read that spoke to me in every possible way. I‚Äôd recommend it to almost anyone whether you‚Äôre single, married, just dating, have a good relationship, bad relationship, whatever. Hope this helps :)"
"My husband purchased this book as a gift, we just got married in September and with covid things have been hard working from home and having quality time so he shared this thinking it may help us get back on track with finding ways to create quality time. We love reading a few chapters and sharing how we can relate this is a wonderful book and guide for newlyweds, I know it‚Äôs brining us closer together and teaching us so much more about eachother"
"This book came to me in the middle of the Pandemic of 2020, someone that I don‚Äôt know, but during a meeting at work mentioned about it. She may have thought people were having issues, I purchased right after the meeting. Took me a while to read it throughly, but because I started and things were not clear at home- well, we‚Äôve tried, but I kept reading it slowly. All of the sudden a couple of chapters made me try some of that and it started to work. So I kept reading and to my surprise my tank started to be full and my wife‚Äôs as well. We are still in a better process, but things are much better now then it was before. I hope I can give this book to someone that may need one day! Amazing!"
"I actually bought this is a gift for my daughter but couldn't resist reading it before I wrapped it.  I will be purchasing my own copy, so I can answer the questions at the end of each chapter & write notes of habits to experiment with to improve my own marriage.My marriage is in a good place, however, I saw ways that could make my marriage better. This is a great book to gift.I took the quiz at the end of the book & was really surprised to discover that my Love Language isn't what I thought it would be. I can understand why the Love Languages was chosen - I had 2 score the same. I based my questions on my relationship with my husband because I realize I have a different Love Language with my children.I purchased the paperback version. The font is a good size and the sentence spacing & margins are pleasing to the eye.I started reading this on Friday evening & was done by Sunday evening.The cover & back look just like the images shared."
I like that this book is available in different buying options. I have nothing negative to say about this book.
"I read this book in about two days, I couldn't put it down. I was so interested in the content and how he explained himself and his line of thinking involving these love languages and how everyone communicates and understands appreciation and love. The book itself is flimsy and the paper pages feel incredibly thin - it struck me how different it felt compared to a normal paperback book, but it wasn't enough of an oddity to get me to stop reading it. Great book, great read, it will change everything about how you approach communicating things to people, not just your partner."
Bought this as a gift for two different friends.... One whose marriage was struggling because they weren't communicating well and the other whose relationship was struggling with understanding each other's love languages. This book is excellent for understanding how your partner shows love to you and how to express to your partner what love looks like to you. It is also important because it allows you to see those same things from their side as well. There's an online quiz where you can find out your love languages. This book helps to explain what each of those mean in depth and how to figure things out together.
"Don't get me wrong, there are many great ideas in this book. In fact, this book might save your marriage or your long term relationship. But both partners have to be on board with the ideas in the book. A ship cannot have 2 captains in charge. Which is why, historically, marriages that lasted had one Captain and one first mate or Captain/sailors; you get the idea. Seeing Mr. Chapman speak, makes me realize what a different world the boomers lived in. He seems like a really nice guy and I'm sure his relationship is great. The problem these days in the 21st century is that honestly, people are so spoiled and entitled that they cannot maintain a relationship. In addition, they probably learned some toxic stuff from growing up in a single parent home where relationships were few and far between. Until society and courts hold people accountable for bad behavior, marriages will continue to fail at higher and higher rates. And books like these will work for fewer and fewer people. If you are a male, you are better off working on self-improvement. Get in shape, work on your career/earning potential and be a high value man. You will have more success with your partners this way. Never get married."
"I decided to read this book because my partner and I don't always communicate that well. I read the book, and we both did the quizzes at the end. I then explained my love languages to him (I was 50/50 on two languages) and then explained his (50/50 on his languages as well, one of his being the same as mine). It was a nice discussion and now he is aware of what I need and vice versa. Something the author mentions is a 'love tank' and how full or empty your love tank is based on how well your partner is fulfilling your needs. Its something to ask your partner, once a week, once a month, etc. We do this ever so often and its nice to get their perspective on how they may be feeling and what you can do to fill their 'love tank' and get closer to each other. Great read."
"The concept is pretty simple.  There are five ways to communicate love, and each person has one (maybe two) primary ways.  It explains each ""language"" and gives examples of how that person might feel or react.  And it gives examples of how the other person's partner might improve on showing love in that particular way.The book is pretty short.  I'm certainly not a reader and I covered this book in 3 evenings.  The words, sentences, structure, etc was written for anyone to read.  You don't have to be a literary critic or have a degree in psychology to read any of it.  I would recommend it to anyone, with or without relationship obstacles.  It's just good stuff to know."
"I read this really quickly. It was easy to read. Already I can see benefits to my marriage. I didn't quite think some of the irritating things my husband was doing were his love language. He likes to do things for me that I preferred to do myself. Now I let him and I thank him and I am grateful. I know I should know and do things myself, and I tell him to let me do that and he seems ok, and I am less irritated. He is very bright and loves to be busy. I am going to reread and discuss things with him although he doesn't like to go too deep into feelings and thinking about feelings."
"Fantastic read! So easy and quick to read as well. Can't believe I didn't discover this until 10 years into marriage.  We were in such a great time in our marriage when I read this, but had we read it years ago it would have saved some unhappy times we struggled through.  He gives easy to follow steps to figure out your spouses love language and how to put his words into action. It's so simple yet so effective. And if you're already madly in love like we are or if you're a newlywed, you can't go wrong with reading this book to prepare for the hard times ahead or to give your relationship extra strength here and now."
"My Mom was going to a Church activity centered on this book, & asked me to go with her. In preparation I downloaded the Kindle version & started reading. I almost put it down after reading the first few chapters, but then, as I came across the section on ""Physical Touch' I started to realize that this book had something I had been praying for for years: 'How to help our Special Needs Daughter, who was having a scary increase in her unexplained seizures'. Yeah, I know it's a Marriage relationship book, but this book holds a key to understanding our daughter, a key I was clueless about! Our daughter would curl up in a ball, express ""I am scared""constantly, & was almost paralyzed in situations outside our home, and was getting worse and worse. Due to her disability we cannot reason with her, or get her to explain her feelings. We've been trying everything to help her, including increasing all her medications, counseling with a physiatrist, fasting & praying, you name it! Reading this book made me realize that what she was unconsciously crying out for was physical touch. My husband & I do not have the need for that #5 primary love language, and we honestly didn't see her need for it. Within 3 days of giving her long hugs, and back rubs, and physical closeness, she has not expressed being 'scared' or 'worried' once! AND she hasn't had a seizure in over two weeks. It's a miracle! Other reviewers have criticized this book in that it is a 'no brainer' for anyone who knows anything about relationship issues, etc.. but I beg to differ. I have read so many self help books, and have talked to many people in an effort to help our daughter, and this is a huge breakthrough I've never come across before. Plus, I am using this now on my marriage, and my husband says that he feels like he did back before we were married when we were courting and so madly in love. This book is seriously a life changer. If you have relationship issues with anyone you love It will help you understand them in a way that you had no idea of before."
"It's a good book in that it may help us understand our partner better. I like the writing style and it was an easy read. I do believe that the concept is oversimplified and it does not factor in people not pulling their weight, absent partners, selfish attitudes etc.  This system will work in an ideal world. Unfortunately, we don't live in an ideal world and not everyone in a relationship always plays fair. Sometimes people have mental issues or medical issues or whatever. Great book. WIll help many couples but not all."
"Truth comes through many places in our journeys, and this book has some valuable life applicable facts we can all apply and share with others.  The Author is a ""real deal Believer"", as those who know him locally, always have wonderfully kind testimonials to share about He and His Wife.  Thank You for sharing Dr. Chapman ;)"
"I re-open this book all the time, especially when I realize that certain people are obviously receiving love differently than I'm giving it! I wish I had read this sooner. Because of how we grow up we feel love and give love differently, and turns out there are a handful of different ways to do that! I am a Christian and I was recommended this book from Christian friends, so I'm very surprised to see that nowhere in the description does it explain this, because it definitely is from that point of view. I do think it's written with other Christian approaches in mind as well, such as a husband leading in a marriage (not bossing, leading), and loving your enemies well, so that can be a little weird to read if you're not expecting it to be from that viewpoint. But it's very eye-opening, especially on how to love others with certain actions that I wouldn't do unless I understood why they appreciate that."
"Got this book to go through with my boyfriend on road trips, so we're working through it pretty slow.  It's been fun though, and sparked a few great conversations (and a few debates) that have helped us learn more about how we think and react to certain situations, even outside of the love languages.  I believe the author is speaking from a Christian perspective, but so far neither of us have felt that he is pushing anything or trying to say that Christianity is the only way to have a healthy relationship.  We both recommend this book if you want to learn more about your SO and spark some good conversation!"
"My husband and I read this allowed together (I know, it sounds cheesy) and it was the best conversation starter on some really important topics. We learned so much about each other even though we had been together for over five years. I also learned more about myself and the way I communicate and the things in our relationship (and other relationships) that I need to work on. I don't think it's ever too early or too late to read this book. Easy read. Love the author. We read it while going through pre-marital counseling and that was wonderful."
"This book deserves more thank 5 stars! It is amazing. I just got the book on Sunday and have finished it already. I could not put the book down! It gives amazing pointers and tips and tricks. I had so many people recommend this book to me, I don't know why I waited so long to get it. I have convinced my husband to read the book and he is already half way through it.It is an easy read and keeps you involved. There are parts in pretty much each chapter of the book that have you do some written work to help figure out what exactly you want from/in your marriage. To anyone that is newly married, or has been married for 50+ years...this book is for you if you are having any kind of difficulty in your marriage, or just want to get back on the same page with your significant other. I guarantee you it will help you work on things that you didn't even know you needed to work on. Heck, even if you think your marriage is perfect, I suggest you read this book. It will bring to your attention things that you may need to work on that you didn't even know you needed to work on"
"I had read this title somewhere years ago and I had loved it soo much. Since we are neither dead nor stupid, we are willing to change to become better who we are in order to make the life more fun, easy and entertaining for ourselves and for the others around us.I had used this several times in my life;""I have a terrible headache but you suggesting a great pill that works for the stomach"".I could not find the right wording for that dilemma. After reading ""Five Love Languages"", it has become so clear with the wording and formula by Dr. Chapman. I think everyone needs to read this book to understand the others around him/her better.It is not great for only married couples but it is also a great resource for any teachers, friends, siblings, etc.Happy reading, guys!!"
"This book is absolutely worth a read. Skimmed some of the critical reviews and my only response to them is, unless you're the easily offended type, at worst you might find the book a bit dry/boring. I read this book while going through premarital counseling at the advice of my officiant, and I enjoyed reading it. It goes through a lot of good ideas and material to think about on how to be a better husband or wife, I would describe the overall philosophy as servant love. The overarching idea is that you express love to your partner without expecting anything in return, and if both partners are doing this, this would make sense to lead to a happy marriage.The book's author seems to be Christian, and references the Bible a few times (maybe like 10 pages out of the roughly 200 pages the book spans), and concentrates on a heterosexual marriage, however I don't see why the same ideas could not be applied to a homosexual marriage (this is coming from a heterosexual man, so take that as you will), just replace sentences he/she with she/he or whatever, the author explains toward the end of the book, that while men and women may seem to be more likely to have certain ""love languages"", the same concepts apply to both sexes and men and women may have any of the five love languages-- it's unique to each person.Overall, I enjoyed the book, it made me think about ways that I could be a better husband, and how to appropriately express the ways I want to be loved to my wife, and think about how I can express love to my wife in ways she will feel loved. I would definitely recommend other couples read this book, and take the love languages quiz (which can be taken free online), it is definitely a good communication tool, as clearly, not everyone expresses love or feels love in the same way, which is really the book's focus."
"One of the best books I've read to truly understand what's important to you and your spouse.  After 25 years of marriage this book has really helped us to finally get on the same page and understand one another.  Although we've always felt we listened to one another, this book will quickly change your opinion on what you ""think"" is important to your spouse and what ""really is"" important to them.  I wish someone would have given this book to me as a wedding present early on in my marriage.  Do yourself a favor...if your marriage is important to you and your truly committed to working on it...but the book and read it.  Then, re-read it!  Yes, you'll get even more out of it the second time around!!"
"This book was recommended to me by at least three people.I can say it was well worth reading and also an easy read. I finished it off in two sittings. This book does touch a lot of romantic relationships but it is something that can be used with friendships as well. Even as a single person I have no regrets reading this. It made me reflect on past relationships in a different way.I even have a better understanding of my own love languages now and what I need to feel loved, It shed light on why some past relationships were so traumatic for me and why they were hard to let go."
I truly enjoyed reading this book in my book club and although for me most of it was common sense. I have always believed that communication is key and asking for what you want is necessary in any relationship. Assuming anything is never good in a relationship. This just reinforced my beliefs and for those who need more help this book is a definite go to book.
"This book is great! It is important to understand that no everyone loves the same. Everyone has a different way of showing and expressing love. If you were receiving it the way you want, but you see your spouse if flourishing you in other ways they might just have a different love language. I bought this book when me and fiance were going through something and I wanted to try to fix us as much as possible. I am an affection person. I love to hear it, see it, feel it. Were he feels love when getting and receiving gifts.  The bigger or more expense the gift the more you love him! After reading this we were able understand each other more. It been about a year since I read this and our language as changed a little. This will always  be a great tool to revert back to."
"Interesting read. Good advice, but by the time most people will read it, I'm not sure it is really going to stop the freight train of a failing marriage. Basically, if you can't figure out what your partner needs from you to feel loved, ask them. If that can't/won't answer, this book isn't really going to help. Try putting down your phone/computer and talking to them about something you two used to do together. Or want to do. I doubt it's read a self help book."
"I'd had this book recommended to me several times, so I decided to finally check it out. I was honestly blown away by how helpful it is in understanding your significant other. Gary Chapman does an excellent job of going through the different communication types (Love languages) you can use, and even after only a few days I've seen a positive change to my relationship! (And it was already pretty great!) It's a very quick and easy read so it's well worth your time if you have a few hours free, the happiness it will bring you will pay off forever!"
"This book has helped my marriage so much! Now that I understand my husbands love language, I can better communicate with him. Before, I realized I was nagging and pushing him to do things that I wanted done, without realizing I haven‚Äôt met his love language in return. I just finished the book, now my husband is starting it. I can‚Äôt wait to see what he gets out of this also! Thank you for saving my marriage Dr. Chapman!"
"I felt this book was well written.  The examples were relatable and the concepts paralleled what was discussed in my intercultural and interpersonal communication courses in college, applying them to a more personal level (the differing cultures being the differing love languages and dialects.)  My late pastor (rip) discussed this book in church nearly a decade and a half ago.  I finally read it now in my early 30s after a broken short marriage in my early twenties and countless mid to long term dating relationships until now.  I can see how I may have misinterpreted love languages of others to the detriment of our relationships and vice versa a bit more clearly based on the insightfulness within the book and I plan to apply this new knowledge to a future relationship in hopes of more understanding and success."
"This is a great book. I have bought this book three times, giving it away to friends each time. But this most recent time I purchased The 5 Love Languages, the printing is atrocious. Ink globs, missing/smudged letters, and the special gradient tone boxes at the end of chapters look like copies of copies of copies (like page 71). It's ridiculous, and I could never give this copy as a gift."
"Approx 2  years ago my partner were in counselling at his request. I did not know at the time but he had been unfaithful to me and he was grappling  with his feelings towards this woman. I did not know how to react to this counselling as everyone knew what had happened except for me. We were given this profile to complete and a photocopy of the 5 Love Languages. We were told to go home and talk, this obviously did not happen and my partner left me 5 months later to take up a relationship with the other woman. Three years later he is still unhappy and swings between the other woman and myself, as the mother of his teenage children. I recently found this book and have just completed it, I have downloaded it for my ex and invited him to read it. Together or alone I know there is hope for future happiness for both us. I will now download and read the book for teenagers so I can send the girls into the world with full love tanks and the ability to have happy and healthy relationships. Thank you for sharing your insights."
"I haven‚Äôt read a book cover-to-cover in a long time, and I NEVER read books in the ‚Äúself-help‚Äù genre, mostly because I think they are cheesy and tacky. I only decided to read it when my spouse wanted to read it together, I really liked the idea of reading a book with him. I really enjoyed it and really liked the examples that he gave from personal experience and also from couples he has worked with. Sometimes it felt so cheesy and too good to be true but honestly I have tried a lot of the things this book mentions when struggling with a relationship in all areas of my life and things have never been better. I recommend this book to everyone now."
"I gifted this book to help a former partner, that I never stopped loving, despite some emotionally abusive behavior. I like to believe that everyone has decency and kindness at their core and that they want to love and be loved but perhaps have difficulty understanding what real love is all about.Gary Chapman has written a book that is easy to read and understand, has wonderful examples and doesn‚Äôt take a long time to read cover to cover.  To be honest, I found it very compelling and could not put it down.  The best investment you can make for your partner but you do need to walk the walk as much as talk the talk.I plan on gifting this book to each of my children with the hope that they have beautiful, solid, loving relationships in their lives and perhaps help save them some unnecessary growing pains.  Life is about the adventure you live and share with special, loving people by your side, the joy of giving to others and not the material things or blindly racing to the finish line.You have one life to life and give, make it a great one!Thank you Gary Chapman!!"
"{possibly some spoiler content} This is a wonderful book that everyone should read who are in relationships.  It is one of those books that monumentally communicates common sense bits of knowledge, that we somehow lost along the way.  It is a book of realigning how to view each other in relationships.  It reminds us that our specific needs and our partners needs are not always the same.  It reminds how we need to identify what needs we come into a relationship with and the same about your partner's needs.  People often have relationship problems when they view their differences of needs as an incongruity.  The theme of this book is that each partner is different and each partner have different needs.  Partners need respect their own needs and the respective needs of their partners.  Additionally, I find Chapman's discussion of God as welcoming. Often self-help books try to stay away from issues of God and spirituality as somehow trying to remain neutral.  In this book, the discussion of God works."
"My husband and I really enjoyed this book. I wouldn't say this book ""saved"" my marriage  but it definitely helped. Saving a marriage requires both individuals to be willing to identify the concerns and own your part in what may have gotten you two to the current state of the state.  We were able to identify our love languages, respectively. I also thought, along with therapy, it was a great conversation starter. A lot of the couple scenarios presented in the book were relatable so my husband and I were able to converse on a few topics that were identifiable."
"The book gives helpful information for all stages of a relationship in my opinion. I am engaged, twice divorced and I practice these 5 and I am thrilled with the response. Our relationship is built on Love, Trust, Respect and Admiration. I am so grateful for the book. I wanted a healthy relationship and this has given me some tools to get myself on track and to have exactly that! People always comment on how Happy we ""look"" and ""Are"". It's this simple application."
"What a great tool for relationships, everyone should read this book. It will definitely change your relationship and they way you see the other person. Will also help you know yourself way better. And the best of all, is that uses very simple words that anyone can understand with real examples from Dr. Chapman experience in his career. Highly recommended. Also, will recommend to read along with this one, The 4 Agreements. These 2 is the perfect combo for a complete life change."
"Yes the book does have some cheesy, anecdotal stories but the overall concept is important to understand. I wish I had read this 10 years ago. My husband and I (who have been married for 11 years now) read it together and it has really made a big difference in how we interact with one another. We learned that we both receive love in different ways and we both express love in different ways. This helped us to speak each other's ""love language"" so we could effectively communicate love to one another. It really has made a huge difference in our level of contentment within our marriage."
"I love this book!! So insightful. Not just for people who are married. Even if you just want to be a better significant other to somebody or learn more about yourself, this is an excellent resource. My fianc√©e and I bought this book and read it together as a form of pre-marital counselling. We intended to have pre-marital counselling before we get married. Unfortunately, both our busy work and college schedules didn't allow for it. So instead we both read this book. We both feel more confident going into our marriage and ready to fill each others love tank. hope this book helps you too."
"It‚Äôs okay. I see some valid points in the book for sure, so there are helpful tips. But to be 100 percent transparent, I find the men in the book completely chauvinistic, even the author is at times. It caters to an older mindset that younger generations cannot identify with. The depth of the stories in the book are very dated‚Äîmeaning, I feel like I‚Äôm reading the extended version of the script, MONA LISA SMILES. I would gently suggest taking the online test and researching how to expand upon the love languages of your partner/friend/family member, in order from greatest to least, and be creative with how to do that in a loving way."
I love this book.  My husband and I read this together. I learned I was loving him all wrong. This book gives tools and exercises on how to love your spouse the way they need to be loved. I highly recommend this book to everyone in a relationship and definitely to those going into a marriage.
"I wish I read this book before my husband and I got married and I am currently looking to participate in Gary Chapman's next marriage counseling to see what is next.This book is a must read by all - single, married, divorced.I actually bought this book for several of my married couples for them to read.  And ironically, my brother's marriage counselor instructed his now wife and him to read the book during the premarraige counseling.This book is a easy read.  You realize things you never thought about before.  Gary does a great job sharing real life examples which you can relate to.I'm actually going to go back and read it again!  Shoot maybe a couple more times because you learn some much from it."
"I was recommended this book years ago, and I wish I'd read it sooner. It's interesting to learn what your love language is and what/ how things are interpreted in your heart. It not only helps you to understand yourself, but the ones you love. - friends, partners, relatives- I found it wonderful and insightful. Now I can show the ones I love how much I love them in a way that means the most to them and I can tell them how to love me back."
"Reading the negative reviews, people are over thinking the basis of the book.  It may strike a different chord for everyone but I think it is a very good book with easy to understand, fundamental ideas about love after marriage and finding out what we need and our partner needs.While it may not address every couples individual needs, I think it‚Äôs a great place to start to feel connected with your partner and discover what you may need that you don‚Äôt realize.  It will certainly open up dialogue and help each actively think about your marriage and ways to make sure you don‚Äôt put it on the back burner."
"I don't like reading and this was boring for me. I should have bought the digital version. I understood the concept of the book but it just didn't help my wife and me and it wasn't actually a me problem, it was a wife is Bipolar issue... We are somewhat in a better place than before... I honestly don't even know where to book is anymore, thus why the digital would have been better, plus text to speech would have made the book better."
This book is really fantastic to evaluated how you want to be loved and how you should love your partner. I am happy and confident in my relationship but I really loved this book. I felt like it helped me understand more about how to love my husband and what I need from him. It is very well rounded about how to look at each love language and why people might need each one. There are real examples of how big of an impact this makes. Me and my husband read this book separately and I do feel like it helped us show each other love and appreciation in a different and more effective way.
I often use this book in my work with couples to help them understand that the way they show love or wish to receive it may not be the way their partner does. This is a simple effective way for couples to communicate their love in a way that is well received by their partner. This book is based on biblical principles but can be used by those normally turned off by biblical insight. The concept of love languages is enhanced by the biblical backing but can be used stand alone. That's one reason I love this book. It appeals to those wanting biblical insight and even those that don't. That makes it a good addition to any couples or therapist bookshelf
"While I get suspicious of writers who simplify solutions to a problem, I think this book is a good starting point for couples.  It is an easy read and I would recommend people to think about these concepts early on in their relationship to prevent conflicts later on.  Think of it like having a prenup discussion, but at least you‚Äôll know if your primary and secondary love languages are words of affirmation, gift giving, spending time, acts of service, or physical touch."
"I remember i saw this book among my moms luggage before she went on a trip and i had heard about it from a former manager at this restaurant i used to work at so i began reading it. I became hooked on it because of how good the information was. It explained a lot of things about myself i didn't know how to explain to other people.I wasn't able to finish it before she went on her trip (only completed about 18 to 20 pages) and i had learned that she had borrowed the book from someone she worked with, but it was enough for me to make the purchase.If 18 pages of a book are enough to make me want to physically buy it (and I am someone who prefers audiobooks over actual reading) then it is definitely worth a gander."
"Love everything in this book. My fianc√© and I learned many new ways to communicate and I‚Äôm so glad we learned each other‚Äôs love languages to set ourselves up for a successful marriage. It is obvious the author did his research and I love the examples of couples that were given. Definitely a book every couple or really person should read. Even if you‚Äôre single, it‚Äôs very introspective to find your own language and you‚Äôll be able to save yourself so much time when you do find your new partner."
"Why did I wait so long?!? Highly recommended by trusted friends so finally committed to buy and read it. Clear writing of illustrations made the concepts easy to understand and apply and can be so universally applicable to relationships other than just in marriage. For a small book, it‚Äôs a deep and meaningful read. Great price for such effective relationship guidance. I‚Äôm looking forward to reading other books by this author."
"This book has great approach to opening up discussions and understanding your spouse. The 5 Love Languages are really easy to understand, and if you‚Äôre not too sure of what your Love Language is is after reading the book there are 2 quizzes at the end that have no right or wrong answers. One is designed for the husband and the other is  for the wife to take. This book isn‚Äôt full of technical jargon, and the chapters are really easy to read. There are even suggestions at the end of every chapter with great ideas on how to start speaking your spouses‚Äô Love Language. It‚Äôs a great book if you‚Äôre looking for a new approach to making your relationship stronger."
"What a great book.  My wife and I wish we had read it earlier in marriage or even pre-marriage.  We will definitely be giving our daughters copies when the time comes (currently 13 and 15 years old).  We have even discussed and shared some of the topics with them.  They understand and I think it will help them in their future relationships. As we all know, you can't just slide through marriage.  It takes work, study, and dedication.  But when you get it right, what a true blessing from God!This book helps you see your own needs and expectations in marriage as well as your spouses.  My wife and I have learned as much about ourselves as each other.  Is great for people who have hit a rough spot in their marriage or those just wanting to grow their marriage and meet their spouses needs in a meaningful way."
"It's a fairly good book that helped me learn a bit about myself and process that into change. Some of the advice was far too late since that relationship ended before I read this book. However, the book does bring somethings into light that I had not looked at before. I suggest that men read this book as well because it seems that far too many women are the ones attempting to make changes and the men don't start till it's too late.Background: I am a 24 year old male and I approve of this book."
This book may have saved a stupid man from losing the best woman that has ever showed him attention . I was skeptical about this book my wife tried to get me  to e.resd it with her and like most I was not interested in what this was well months went by we separated then the unthinkable happened I was in a horrific motorcycle accident almost died from injuries but I pulled through I swore to her I was going to change if I only had the chance well I got it and I still didn't read the book of course I didn't remember she wanted to read it time went by and wouldn't you know it is fell into the same thing  I was doing what to me showed her I loved her bought her a motorcycle and all kinds of stuff but until now I didn't realize how she needed to be loved and now I love her so much I started to read the book even did the exercises they help me learn how to be a better husband to my beautiful wife  who means the world to me so everyday I am going to show her I know how to love her cause the dislike for chores is nothing compared to to the feeling of emptiness felt without her
This book has shed a light on marriages and has given me the ability to see the different love languages and understand how this works. I have dug deep to understand my own language given my current situations with family deaths and how I can get back to me and what I need to do that. I found who I am and what I need to be fulfilled and what my husband needs from me. Definitely a book worth reading whether you have problems with what you need or not. It shows us how different we all are in our need to be fulfilled.
"I love, love, loved this book. It was such a straight for the point, practical and amazing read that kept me engaged. I would've liked probably a few more listings or examples that people could reference and use for their loved one who needs words of affirmation. That is minor, really, because the book was just great. Even my ""that's not me, I'm not an emotionally expressive lovey dovey person"" , macho, I lift, and don't do that emotional stuff of a husband has actually read the book and is almost finished. The fact that he told me he was already more than a couple chapters in tells me that he himself is also engaged and I already see such of an improvement in big ways for me and huge ways for him as he is stepping out of his element to love me the way I need with Words of Affirmation/Physical Touch being hands down my #1s, Quality Time close second, Acts of Service and Gifts falling after. In turn I'm learning extra ways to love him as he needs and wants as well. I'm so pleased with this book I want to create a painting with our His and Hers Love Languages written out placed in our bedroom framed (hey, whatever works right...).So thankful God touched someone with the knowledge to potentially change the entire culture of what it means to be married and the vows of for better or worse with a book. Thank God üôåüèΩüôèüèΩ"
"My husband told me six months ago that he is divorcing me. I was and am still thunderstruck. I have slways done everything for him and the family, including working full time, cleaning, cooking his favorite meals, taking care of rhe kids, mowing, taking care of the dog, buying the Christmas and birthday gifts- it has not been fun doing all the work all the time and then falling into bed exhausted every night. He never helped me or seemed to value my sacrifices, and was not much for gifts.He had expensive hobbies from photography to motorcycles and hunting, but he did seem to appreciate the gifts I racked my brain to come up with, if they were toys- not if yhey were practical, though.Now I see: my love language was service and gifts and his was quality time. I had no idea why he did not help me, and He probably had no idea why I seemed to prefer housework to spending time with him.We are still in the process of the divorce, an adversarial practice that precludes any chance of reconciliation. I understand so much more now- if only I had read this years ago, Ricardo!"
"I was able to get through this easily.  The other review statements about the chauvinistic comments in the foreword I just took with a grain of salt. You take the whole premise of the 5 love ‚Äúlanguages‚Äù and that‚Äôs what you really need to take away from the book. No matter what his own personal outlook or moral compass, considering this book only speaks of heterosexual relationships, there may be a book he‚Äôs written for others, but any relationship can use these 5 ways to consider what your ‚Äúcurrency‚Äù is and what your significant other‚Äôs is. You can even use it for friendships, if you want to use more of a head evaluation as to how you can improve your relationships you want to keep."
My boyfriend are currently reading and it's changing things for the better so awesome!!
The author has done a great job of breaking down the complexity of marriage into 5 easy to understand languages. The book is filled with examples that support the different languages. Love the test at the end as well. Of course this doesn't cover everything that's out there in a marriage but really lays a strong foundation about what to think about  and what concrete actions to work on to make change.
"This is a great book. Some people mentioned that the book is common sense but I would disagree. After reading it, yes it made a lot of sense. The fact is that the 2 highest love languages for my wife are the two lowest for me and vice versa. I was completely ignorant to how deeply important these things were to her as  for me they were not very important at all. It also made me realize how I show affection. I read the book first and then attempted to talk to my wife about it before she ever read it and she couldn't necessarily understand. When I mentioned I was ""physical touch"" she began to mention how I didn't like certain things. I had to try to explain about dialects and the difference between having a full or empty love tank and had to just tell her to read the book. At least for me, if you are physical touch with a love tank on empty you withhold forms of touch outside your dialect because it is just a reminder of how you are not getting the kind you need. My wife has just started reading and hopefully will come to the same realizations. I just wish it was tran"
"This is a great book to reflect on self healing and understanding why you are how you are in your love language. What your needs are and seeing others needs more clearly. That just becuase I need to be cuddled doesnt mean my boyfriend needs or wants as much physical touch. He needs words of affirmation which he constantly does to me. But I need physical connection and attention to feel loved. So it's been nice realizing this. I'll take a step back and forfill his needs for verbal communication and its helped strengthen us alot. Then in return without me mentioning it I've noticed becuase I'm meeting his love language needs he has been alot more touchy which forfill my needs. Lots of good insight, an easy read. I enjoyed this book alot."
Just started reading üìñ this book and I‚Äôve already had a ah...ha... moment. Can‚Äôt wait to finish the rest of it.
"I cried when I read this book. This year I ended a thirty-three year marriage. I know there's never one answer to relationship problems, and I don't know if these techniques would have made the difference in mine, but I can see clearly now how the path taken led my ex and I to a place with no exit besides divorce. I hope others will read this guide and use it to help save salvageable marriages. Too late for me with my life partner, but with God's grace, maybe I'll have another chance. Thanks for the truly superb wisdom of love languages."
"A must read for the basic principles which I found very valuable, no matter if you are married or not, if you are a human being, you gotta have this in your daily life, but BE CAREFUL, read it under your own risk, and please use the logic with the concept. Example: sex should not be counting as part of a ""language"", neither house tasks. You do your stuff in a house bc you are a big grown up adult who knows that if you live in a house you need to do part of the cleaning, if you think otherwise you were not prepared properly for life by your parents. SO yeah it's sexist, it has horrible examples, and as a cherry of bitterness on the top has some religious background. BUT I find the main idea and relationship observations very useful.Take what's best leave the rest in the trash can!"
My wife and I got this book and really really enjoy it. I come from a family that shows love through physical touch and words and my wife comes from a family that love was shown by gifts and quality time.  So I bet you can guess just how awful our communication was when It came to the love languages. I really feel like this is something that can help people on the communicate levels in ways that they don't understand. For any husbands out there that don't want to read this book I suggest the audiobook.  And I would also like to say coming from a man's perspective that you can't understand how important this stuff is until you understand what it really is. I encourage people to also buy this for anybody who is planning to get married. This could have saved my wife and I a lot of fights if you would have read this book before we got married.
"I foudn out about this book while joining a learning group called ""Every Man a Waroir"" EMAW for short. Man, you husbands and husbands to be, you gotta get this book and the EMAW material and do it with your buddies. You are gonna be surprised and your eyes and hearts opened up. It will blow you away. Your wife or girlfriend's heart strings and brain gears are going to turn asking themselves, Wow, what happened to my Man? Hey guys, come on, don't miss out in this life."
Good book for you and your spouse/partner to read. I definitely took away a few gems from reading this and I know my fiance did too. From learning his language (which I kinda already guessed as I read it lol) I am able to utilize the tools I learned to better love him the way he needs love. In return he is able to do the same for me. I look so much more forward to our life together!
"I bought this book years after the author spoke at my school just to see what the big deal was. It was a good read! I liked that the whole thing was learning your partner‚Äôs love language so that you can love them correctly. I‚Äôm not currently in a relationship, but I feel like because I‚Äôve read this book, I‚Äôve been able to help my friends that are in relationships communicate better with their partners"
"After having my last relationship go to dust, I wanted to get an understanding as to why, then purchased this book as the reviews were highly positive. I learned my love language order and did a deep dive into past relationships to see what their love language order was. The result was that I always got with a partner that was the reverse of mine (Me: Gift, Affirmation, Physical, Service & Time vs Time, Service, Physical, Affirmation, and Gift). Moving forward I now know how I can read the language that a future partner speaks and understand them. One thing I would like to point out though for those interested in the book is that yes, even though you can learn to spot the languages, you must have open communication as well as not be ignorant that there are more factors involved in relationships other than speaking/understanding the love language of another."
"This book has given me a new insight on things I wish I‚Äôd known many years ago. I recently had my fianc√© break off our engagement & I am really trying to see the reasons why things may have fallen apart so quickly. We had great communication, a great relationship I thought ... but we both got way too comfortable too soon ... I think since we had been friends for 17 years prior to dating. Relationships take work to keep the spark alive & it‚Äôs important to know how to show love in the right ways. I am hopeful moving forward that Gary Chapman‚Äôs books will help build a stronger more confident me & I will know next time how to properly be in a fulfilling relationship."
I thought this was a very USEFUL book. I wish I knew about the different languages years ago. Not everyone has the same love language. I sensed something was not aligning but didn't know why. This book explains why and helps you determine what your language is and those you love so you can both get the love you want and need.
"This book was recommended to me and my fiance by our premarital counselor. We have a great relationship, but this book has made us even stronger! I never knew about love languages, but as soon as we learned ours, so many things made sense! It is not easy to speak someone else's love language, but we are trying and we will get there :). I 100% recommend this book to anyone who is in a relationship!"
"Dr. Chapman tells of the five love languages. We need to find our love language and let our spouse know too. Then as they do acts related to our love language it will fill our love tank, make us happy and more interested in giving our spouse what they need to fill their love tank. The first step though is to identify what love language works for each spouse, and to recognize and brag on them when they fill our love tank. Usually if one spouse leads the way the other will follow."
"Even though Oprah likes this guy, I found his recommendations too predictable and simple. Reminds me of early touchy-feely therapy from the 70's. We're all past that by now."
Used as diy premarital counseling with my boyfriend. (Got him the ‚Äúmen‚Äôs‚Äù version). Was awesome for us! Could be used during a ‚Äúrough patch‚Äù but I think was even better during good times for long term understanding. Highly recommend...we‚Äôre a pretty chill couple and this was perfect. Very limited to none for religious references - which could be nice for people looking to focus on tangible ideas and not be clouded by overly religion based relationship advice.
"I bought the book brand new for $7.59. Great price I'd say. It came on time and in very good condition. The book is amazing for any and everyone wanting to dive deeper in their knowledge of love. The information in the book is easy to understand and implement in all sorts of relationships (friendships, romantic relationships, familyships, marriages, etc). I have enjoyed learning about the various ways love can be expressed and best expressed to those in their ""primary love language."" After finishing the book today, I am confident and more knowledgeable with information that will improve my relationships. I buy many things from Amazon and do not rate and review them, but for this particular buy, I HAD to share a bit of my experience and thoughts for anyone considering this buy! Price is great, condition is new, read is informational and practical...WIN, WIN, WIN! 15/10 !"
"This book was recommended to me and my boyfriend by a friend of ours. With the recommendation coming from a male friend, I figured my boyfriend would be a lot more open to reading it, rather than if I had just plopped it in his hands and asked him to give it a look. I wasn't really expecting much when I ordered it, but once I started reading, I couldn't put it down! I recommend purchasing a pack of highlighters with the book! There's a lot of information in each chapter, and a lot of quotes that are helpful to reference from time to time.The book is fairly short, but it contains a lot of information. The chapters are clear and concise, perfect for a spouse/partner that dislikes or has trouble reading. Since finishing it, I've been recommending it to all of my friends. Even if you don't have major problems in your relationship that need fixing, there's always room for growth and improvement!"
"I only wish I'd read this years ago. I heard about it from what I consider an odd place, a man I don't know well was talking about how he'd made so many mistakes in his first marriage, but that with the help of this book, he was ""getting it right"" in his second marriage. It took me awhile to get around to ordering it, and then after I got it, finding time to read it. I should have run, not walked, to get it and read it. I got the Kindle version, and have now also bought the paperback version and have asked my husband to read it. I had an inkling of what my husband's ""love language"" is, and that it was different than mine, but this book really crystallized what it is he needs to feel loved, and made it easier for me to think of ways to ""fill his tank"" with expressions of love for him. It has also given me the courage to ask him for what I need. Well worth the money and the time to read it. I am not through with it and it is already improving an already long and happy marriage."
"I'm a self help book junkie. I don't actually need self help (well we all do a little) but I'm one of those proactive people that never wants to need it, so I read these books to prevent it! I've been married for almost two years, and with him for 8ish. We have an awesome marriage, again I just like to read these books. And I guess I found out why, we have the same love language! Lol it's not common but we both heavily speak in ""acts of service"". Anywho this book is great, I laughed a couple times. This book has great content and even if you're happy in your marriage I would recommend it!"
"This info is great to know in general. Whether its your friend, family member or boss. Knowing someones love language can be very helpful in life.  If you are not religious you might be distracted/unintersted by the scripture references but just because you not into the Bible doesn't mean you cant get so much out of this book."
"This idea makes perfectly good sense. It isn‚Äôt totally intuitive, but when it‚Äôs presented, one says ‚Äúwow, that sounds like its true.  Dr. Chapman also gives many examples of how the technique was used successfully, even in some seemingly hopeless situations.  If you are thinking about throwing in the marriage towel or just want to improve your ability to love someone, this will probably help."
This book is wonderful for relationships. Men have love languages that women do not. You discover how to show love to your spouse in their language. This book is great to read and study as a couple. There are multiple choice questions to help you and your partner define your love languages. I was surprised what my love language is and what my spouse's love language was. I recommend this book to those who are struggling in their marriage and for happy couples who just want to connect more as a couple.  My daughter and her husband reread this book every year as a refresher.
"This book doesn't let you dwell on your relationship challenges, it offers a new way of understanding yourself and your partner. It is a very positive book with some great advice and insight to use to better understand what you want and what to give, your relationship. People generally need help with communicating what they want and this book offers a very compassionate lexicon for doing just that. It's a great read for any relationship, or even just to better understand yourself."
"This book is fairly short, concise, and easy to read and digest. The concepts are clear and simple. I found it enjoyable and very to the point, which I appreciated. Chapman lays out his 5 love languages in 5 separate chapters and then adds extra material along with a quiz to help you discover your own love language. I would recommend this book to a friend or give it as a gift. I think anyone can benefit from his concepts."
"This book is awesome.  I'm not all that crazy about the stories, but they make their point.  but I love the advice and I found this book useful.  I like it because although I could not for the life of me get my husband to read it -- it is still useful to me and to our relationship.  I practice the advice and it helps!  so I would recommend that everyone read this book.  it's been around awhile - and it has been recommended to me and to my friends over the years but strangers and people in passing."
"The CD is horrible, i‚Äôve tried to listen to this five times in several CD players, truck, computer and my car.  The information is so helpful but every time I stop pause take a phone call it starts over again.  It has taken me five hours to hear the introduction and the first chapter. Whoever was responsible for the different tracks on the CD should redo it and learn from their mistakes."
"LOVE LOVE LOVE! I think everyone should read this book. It doesn‚Äôt only help with your relationship with your spouse but it can also help you understand everyone you come in contact with, wether it be a co-worker, friend, neighbor, etc. I have read this once on my own and now currently listening to the audiobook with my boyfriend. It is his first time listening to it and he loves it so far and has learned a lot from it."
I am not much of a reader. I‚Äôve been recommended to read this book many times and always refused. I received this book and read the entire book within 2 days. I left little sticky notes on pages so that my significant other could read the book and also read my thoughts on it. We‚Äôre both military and distance is hard. This isn‚Äôt a book for just struggling couples. We are great and still benefited from this book.
"Gary Chapman‚Äôs 5 Love Languages contains some good advice. Even if much of it seems like common sense, these are helpful reminders of how to effectively communicate with loved ones in meaningful ways. On the downside, the writing is overly simple and the book is at times overly religious and hokey."
"I skimmed the first part where the author asks multiple questions to make his point.  But once I got to the descriptions and stories of the effect of marriages, I loved it.  At the end you can take the quiz to discover, or confirm what you think to be, your love language.  My husband actually took it and I was totally surprised at his #1 love language.  We are now utilizing that information in how we interact and so far, great!"
Recommend this book to any couple who need more in their relationship.
"Such a practical guide to marriage and loving your spouse! Took the assessment to determine my ‚Äúlove language‚Äù and scored a seven on four of the languages and a one on the fifth! Hum, how do I interpret that??? Definitely worth reading, in spite of not being able to identify my own dominate ‚Äúlove language.‚Äù"
"This book is very educational to even a bachelor, a man in a committed relationship, or has been married for an extended period of time. It will change your whole life. Give it a shot. It gave me a whole new aspect on my life and who I want to be. Even in your darkest times , if you truly love your SO. Don't give up keep trying. To all of you struggling out there. Don't give up. Have hope."
"I heard about this book on the radio as I was driving to the airport. The concept made sense to me. I downloaded the book, started reading it, and didn‚Äôt want to put it down. I read the entire book in 3 days, something I don‚Äôt often do. I couldn‚Äôt wait to get home and share this book with my husband. The 5 love languages are presented in a way that‚Äôs easy to understand and apply. I learned about myself, but more importantly, I understood what my husband needs and why. Thank you Dr. Chapman!!"
"I appreciated how he addressed the many questions that come up with the 5 love languages and the stories he shared. I also really liked the distinction he made between love as a feeling (noun) and love as an act (verb). We can act loving and do things that take effort for the sake of the other without feeling love. And, as you fill the emotional love tank of another person, that person is then more likely to be receptive to your needs too. What a great way to repair a relationship or stoke the fire of one that is working! Brilliant!"
"My husband and I read the book together and loved it.  We ordered  12 more books to give to family and friends as gifts.  The book helps you to understand what your love language is.  It may not be the same as your spouse.  When you understand each other's love language, it will really improve your marriage.  For some couples with unhappy marriages and who are planning to divorce, it will turn their marriage into a happy and lasting relationship!  It will even improve your relationship with your children.  This book is good for all and you will not be disappointed.  Theauthor, Gary Chapman, is a marriage counselor and has helped many couples to improve their marriage.  He is verycapable and interesting author."
"An interesting concept in communication between you & your spouse. It really put in perspective what my husband needs as well as myself, the differences in our communication, and how we can meet one another halfway by speaking one another's language. It has really allowed me to stop and think before I speak, being more mindful. I can honestly say our constant bickering has subsided quite a bit since we read this book!"
This is a great book for anyone to read. It helps you understand that everyone love is different. This is my second book. My first I loaned it out and forgot who I let borrow it. This book was quite a bit thinnner and the cover was just a tad from being paper thin but content is the same. I can just tell they cut corners in the mass making with the very thin paper.
"Advice is great. But only if you can get your spouse or significant other to read it. This of course didn‚Äôt happen. I already knew most of these things anyway. It also kind of repeated the same things over & over throughout the entire book. The whole thing could have been written on far fewer pages. Then maybe my significant other would be more interested? Or not. Also, should have been written in a better or more colorful way to keep the reader‚Äôs interest."
"I usually never finish a book - busy mom of four, marketer & coach etc but this book was easy to read and has helped with my understanding of the love languages, will help in my marriage and will help me to help others as well -it‚Äôs an 11/10 great job Dr. you are an amazing person and author as well. I commend you for writing this! And for the marriages you saved! Worth every Penny! I recommend you all buy this. (I usually never write reviews but had to for this one)"
"If you're interested in learning about how you communicate love, read this book. If your significant other is interested in learning how to read how you communicate love, and vice-versa, read this book. Reading AND applying are key for a better relationship. Simple yet practical steps to enrichen your relationship with one another!"
"My other half and I quite enjoyed this book. We began reading it in hopes of better identifying what was already evident to us as different communication styles, and now have a better understanding with good examples of how to ""read"" and ""reach"" each other in a way the other person will understand. The quiz at the end helped us rank/prioritize our individually-favored styles, and we appreciated the opportunity to share insight into why we chose what we chose. Definitely a great tool that put words to what we already knew were individual differences, and have seen improvement since. Would recommmend a look."
"I'm a huge fan of the user's Guide. Especially when that guide is to something normally impenetrable, such as the human heart. I read this book and, while I thought some of the verbiage was a bit simplistic, the message thus conveyed was powerful indeed.I took the quiz associated with the book to affirm what I'd cone to suspect about my own love language. As it turns out, I was only half right. I'm hoping this idea is as revolutionary as it seems. That is, when read by me, it seems great. The big question: will this provide needed insight for someone I hold dear?That, friends, is what will tell me if this book really is as well worth your time and money as it appears."
"I‚Äôve always been fascinated by the love languages but I didn‚Äôt realize how much this book would mention god and the church. That was a bit of a turn off, god isn‚Äôt part of my relationship and my faith or lack there of has no motivation towards my relationship. Learning about the 5 love languages was interesting going more in depth, but now there‚Äôs so much information online it could be worth it to just read up there. At least maybe there‚Äôs less god."
The book won't open in Kindle.  I'll change the rating once I receive assistance with opening the book in Kindle.
"Although this book is defiantly geared toward someone trying to enhance their relationship, I though it's points were great, and can be used in day-to-day relationship/friendship/co workers, etc... Any book that can help you be more mindful of people around you, and learn to notice another persons ""love language"" is a good book. This book, for me at least, helped me be more mindful of people around me, and helped me realized what kind of things i could do to make them happy. It all honestly comes down to one question. ""How does this person show me that they love me?"" Answer that, and you have what THEIR love language is. Play into that love language, and now only will have a friend for life, but I can guarantee you'll notice that person (whether consciously or subconsciously) doing things in an effort to make you happy."
This book made total sense to me. I'm feeling my husband doesn't really understand it so much. It was worth a shot. I keep showing my husband love in his language which is my weakest language and he's loving it. He seems to be speaking to me mostly in his own love language and I told him this. Now I'm not sure how to help him.
So many people have told me my husband and I need to read this book. We are great but lack in certain areas. My ‚Äúlove tank‚Äù doesn‚Äôt always feel full. This book covers every area and how to work on them with your significant other. I wish I‚Äôd read this book sooner! Highly recommend to anyone else who may feel they need a little work on their relationship.
This book helped me understand a lot about love languages and serving your person but I do agree with some of the other comments about how it‚Äôs kind of sexist and totally can tell a male wrote it .. especially in the physical touch love language chapter ‚Ä¶ other than that I think it was good for beginners. Definitely venture out and get books that speak about similar topics üëçüèª 4/5
"My husband took the online test with me, and when I discovered his love languages and he discovered mine, we do more little things for each other that ""fills that emotional tank."" It makes our relationship feel at ease. Not easy, by any stretch of the imagination, but at ease, like there's just a little more we know about each other that will make the long haul of our un-marriage more solid. Definitely recommend this book."
"Ever since I first learned of the 5 Love Languages nearly 10 years ago, I have used this book for relationship trainings and coaching. Once you learn the 5 Love Languages, you can use them to bring any relationship, such as friendship and intimate relationships, to the next level. I also have purchased these books for many friends. It truly teaches you how other people and yourself recognize love in their lives so you can speak their Love Language. A Must Buy."
"Overall, I think this was a very good book and I would recommend it.  As other reviewers have said, a lot of the information is common sense, but sometimes packaging things in a different way brings a different perspective to them.  That is what this book does.  However, I do agree with some of the other reviewers that it is much longer than it should have been - it could have been about half the length and still got the point across.  I also think that the marketing is a little thick and seems overdone, particularly with alternate editions that are basically identical.I also agree that some of the contents are quite obvious once they are pointed out to you.  As silly as it sounds, it is kind of like a magic trick.  You see the magic trick and have no idea how it is done.  Once you get to see the steps to perform it, it is painfully obvious.  You don't quite understand how you couldn't see it before.  With the ideas presented in this book, they are a little obvious too.  Of course my wife likes quality time.  Of course she likes being affirmed.  Of course she likes gifts.  But, why do we consistently struggle?  Why, no matter how hard I try, does she still complain that she is lonely or doesn't feel loved?  Why can't I figure out how to fix that?Well, if you listen to Chapman, it is because I am not focusing on the right thing.  I may be focusing on physical touch and not giving enough affirmation.  Or, maybe I tell her all the time how pretty she is or how I appreciate this or that, but she really wants me to spend more time sitting down and talking with her.The point of this book is not to explain complex psychological principles.  It is not to give deep insight into human behavior or scriptural concepts.  It is to make us stop and think about a relatively obvious concept that most of us miss or do not give enough attention to.  What would it do for your relationships if the people you care about focus on communicating with you in ways that make you feel loved?  What if you were able to do that with them?"
"Loved, loved, loved this book. It isn‚Äôt preachy nor written to make one side feel inadequate or bad. It shows you how to reach your spouse in a way they understand and see things.We get comfortable in our marriages or too busy with life, kids, bills, work, household duties etc that we neglect our spouses needs. Neglecting our spouses needs leads to anger and resentment. Sadly, we may not even know we are neglecting them and think everything is fine. Dr. Chapman teaches you how to reach your spouse by making them feel loved. We don‚Äôt make our spouses feel loved by doing what we think makes us feel loved, but by studying what makes them feel loved. Likewise, telling our spouses what makes us feel loved.I wish I read this book earlier in my marriage, it would have saved us from a lot of heartache and pain. I recommend this book for anyone at any stage in their relationship, even if you‚Äôre just dating."
This book is amazing for everyone. So helpful and insightful. I would give 5 starts but the seller I got it from was supposed to be no markings and I great condition but it was written it so I had to scribble out what the person wrote which is fine I just made a chose to chose a certain one with no markings for myself to mark in
"The unspoken assumptions in this book are that both partners are capable of rational decision making and are free of any emotional or mental health difficulties. I was disappointed that challenges such as depression or addiction weren't at least mentioned. Overall, it was a useful perspective but I can't help but feel the saccharine optimism ""learn your partner's love language and live happily ever after"" was a stretch without addressing more serious relationship challenges."
I recommend this book from the bottom of my heart. It has helped in so many ways my life and my relationship. If you are desperate of finding something different or a way to understand your significant other and you don‚Äôt know where to start... we‚Äôll start here! You won‚Äôt regret it!
I wish I would‚Äôve known about these things 10 years ago when I first got married would‚Äôve definitely helped a lot the concept of this book is so simple yet so effective I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever read a couples advice book that was as good as this for the price The information in here is invaluable it‚Äôs worth a read
"This book is amazing. It helped my husband and I so much that we've recommended it to our son and his girlfriend, my brother in law and many friends. I think that this book could save so many marriages. Often people don't feel that they're getting what they need from their partner/spouse but maybe they don't understand your love language..love is a verb and it takes work. I highly recommend this book"
"I really enjoyed this book and thought it made sense, but this book is really only for people who are married. I tried the quiz at the end and the methods with my boyfriend, and it seemed really cheesy and he was weirded out. If your relationship genuinely doesn't have problems at the moment, then don't go looking for answers to fix it. Just my opinion, but great read will keep in mind for the future."
This book gave me a lot of insight on the different kind of love languages that I didn‚Äôt even realize. I wasn‚Äôt having major problems in my marriage but I got the book to help improve parts of my marriage I thought needed improvement. It opened my eyes and helped me talk to my husband in ways I wouldn‚Äôt have thought of. Definitely recommend to everyone who wants to have a better understanding of SO‚Äôs love language.
"Still In the process of reading this book, but so far it is so amazing ! It is such an eye opener and really helpful with healing emotional distress from the past. This book brought me to tears in a certain chapter due to personal experience . Never realized things about myself until reading this book ! It is so good and already see some great changes coming my way ! definitely a must have book to read! Highly recommend !"
"How to pick up women and ditch them in under a week!Naw, just kidding. This book is pretty great. Not only will you learn about love, and what the different ways of communicating it are, but you will learn which love comes through to YOU! I am a single man, trying to find God's will for my life, and I know this book and the lessons within will come a long way when I finally settle down with a woman!No matter where you are at with your relationships, or in general, I believe this book is a mandatory read!"
"I love the book but I have an issue with the e-book:  I bought this not knowing my wife had the real book so we decided to read it together.  The ebook though 90% is just like the regular book, there are parts that are omitted and some names were changed.  The book itself gets a 10 but for those reasons the ebook gets a 4."
What an incredible book! I live by these principles now and constantly speak my spouse's love language! This book makes so much sense! The only frustrating thing is (which is not the author's fault) is that your partner may not be willing to speak yours! I think if both you and your partner are really willing to speak each other's love language than you need to get this book and it will strengthen your bond!
"I could easily relate to this information. All couples would do well to read this book! It‚Äôs true that loving someone in a mature way is a choice- and that choosing to show love to someone in the way that THEY need to feel loved makes all the difference in the world in a marriage!! Unquestionably, there is sound wisdom in these pages. Highly recommend."
"When I was in college, I took a class that touched on the subject of the 5 love languages, but I wanted to learn more. I bought this book and really enjoyed it. Gary Chapman is a brilliant writer who can relay so much knowledge in a clear and understandable form. I have encouraged my husband to read this book, and spoken about it to friends about it as well. Highly recommend this to anyone curious about a better understanding of their partner/significant other."
Bought this because I could use some soft skills and knowledge for my marriage and it's a huge eye opener. Commit to the techniques that you will learn and the cash you spend will love you for it. Try it now!
Absolutely love this book. I had heard so many good things come from Dr. Chapman's book and the 5 Love Languages. I have been recently struggling in my own relationship now and this book brought a whole new light to our problems. I related to so many of the couples stories in this book and found out my love language as well as my partners. This book was an easy read and I recommend it to any couple who want the secret to a lasting loving relationship!
"Thank you... Between taking the time out from the rage I felt inside and turning it into hate and resentment I was able to see my faults of being a pleaser in the way I thought she understood,  I didnt know she spoke Tantra.. Guys take the time to listen and let her words drive that rage into a burning fire of desire. She doesn't always hear what I say until I buck up and say it. Be a man with fire in your eyes built with desire to please your woman as she been telling you too all these years. Learn your Queens language she deserves that fire her King just built.  I love you Cody,  time to head to them hills and ignite the world. Thanks for being my wife. Mary Me Again? Your King."
This book helped me understand my partners need for a certain type of love that I thought I was giving him. Now I know that he is different from me & that loving him means loving in a different way than I'm used to. It doesn't mean that I'm changing myself only that I'm changing how I show him love.
"The best relationship advice EVER!I enjoyed this book thoroughly. The insights into human nature and the needs we ALL have to feel loved and valued is profound yet so simple!The information is applicable to ALL relationships in your home life, work life, and interactions with strangers on a daily basis.I use the information I learned from reading this book each and everyday to connect with new people and reconnect and heighten my current relationships with family, friends and my partner.I really enjoyed the easy self-test it gave me perfect insight into why I enjoy hearing wonderful, kind, and uplifting words and why I have a need for thoughtful gifts.Thank You so much Gary Chapman you are a superb being for sharing these simple and undeniable effective insights into ourselves and others!"
This book is amazing. If you are serious about your relationships this is the book to read.It's interesting and filled with storys.Learning these truths help me in all my close relationships. Finding what motivates you and your loved ones helps in so many ways.Easy and fast to read and. Inlightening.
"I was very skeptical of buying this book because some reviews mention religious undertones and 1950s ideals. I am not religious and quite liberal, but after reading the book I even thought that those reviewers were being overly sensitive. Yes, the gender roles and most of the examples are very traditional, but who cares, that‚Äôs not the point. The point is to learn about how different people feel love differently and in that it succeeds brilliantly.My one sentence summary of the book would read; don‚Äôt love people how you want to be loved, but rather love people how they want to be loved."
"This is a great book that everyone should read and talk about. The world would be a much better place if we all had a little more insight on the 5 love languages. It is a bit overwritten, but who cares. It is so short, there is no reason not to read it. This book provides wisdom for people who have trouble with relationships, and even for people who are happily married. I wish they made us read stuff like this in high school."
I‚Äôve been married a few times and wish I would have been able and to practice these sensible guidelines to see if they work. I have a feeling that they would have. Currently I am having some issues with my teenage son and that‚Äôs how I was introduced to this series (I read the teen book also).
"Love this book.  My husband and I base our marriage on the 5 love languages (and God).  This book is great if you're just datng, engaged, married and having a hard time in your marriage.  It really shows you what fills your love tank and your partners love tank.  A must read.  Even if you don't read it, buy it for the love language quiz in the back.  I guarantee it will open your eyes to a new kind of love.  They also wrote one for your kids. Good luck!!"
"The author helps the reader to better understand the need to understand how we love..giving you insight into our daily lives and how to renew lost loves..I think if I had read thus book years ago, I would still be married to my first husband..who knows..but thank you Dr Champan for opening my heart and mind to love."
"I could have sworn my ""love language"" was something completely different than what it is. I learned I show love in a different love language than my own.I also learned some insight into why my 1st marriage didn't work and how to make my current relationship better. I appreciate this book more than I can ever show. Thank you for sharing with us, the world, the value of Love Languages."
"I study communication, that's my gig.  And I thought I was pretty darn good at talking to people, particularly my fiance.  Matter of fact, I knew this theory existed and I knew the basics.  When I read this book, though, all the way through?  Turns out all I knew was the equivalent of how to count to ten in Spanish while living in Barcelona.  Oh, what an eye opener?  Sure, there are moments where it's a little cheesy, and a tiny bit dated, but the meat of the book is so well worth getting through those parts!  I give it my highest recommendation to anyone looking to carry on a Godly relationship--with anyone!  You can even extrapolate some of the theories and methods described in this book to other non-romantic relationships such as with parents, children, and friends.  I know there are books specifically for those categories but if you're a quick study and looking for one book to get the basics down?  Start here....and then go get the others anyway, because I have been humbled and educated about my knowledge of interpersonal communication once before, so it can and most definitely will happen again."
"There's something very specific that I like about the points Chapman makes in this book: they're actionable. You sit down, you read a chapter, you think for 10 minutes, and immediately you generate several reflections about past relationships as well as several ideas for improving current relationships. Chapman's thesis about the five love languages is, in a way, a language: it's a way of communicating with the people around you, and a way of interpreting other people's communications toward you. In that sense, reading this book is a learning experience. It sets many puzzle pieces in place that you saw all along, but perhaps never connected to one another. I'm glad that I own the book because this is a powerful framework for thinking about relationships, particularly close relationships such as intimate relationships in which communication is so vital."
"I just recently bought this book as  a gift but had read it years ago. During the first few years of or marriage, my husband and i were close to divorce. We were desperate for help and looked for different resources to help us. This was one resource that we read together. I highly recommend the book for both men and women. It is simple and easy-to-understand but extremely helpful and practical.From the book, I learned that I needed quality time and that knowledge helped to transform our relationship because my husband realized that I needed him to spend time with me.I highly recommend this book."
"I would recommend this to anyone willing to do their own thinking and filtering of information.I did not enjoy the religious overtone of this book, however, overlooking that part there is a lot of valuable information that can be applied to many kinds of relationships in life.I think the view of the author is a very simplistic one but at their core the presented concepts seem to be sane and may help many people having trouble maintaining relationships in life as long as you don't go overboard and obsess about them.I found the test at the end of the book not to be very relevant for me because I scored equal scores on 3 categories. However, even that gave me some insight into how I work because I noticed I tended to prefer one the answers having the words unexpected or surprise (or derivates) over the others so apparently I prefer being shown love/care when I don't expect it."
"I've been in so many unsatisfying relationships and I couldn't figure out why. Well, most of them were jerks but they definitely have a language of love. After reading this book, I understood a whole lot more about relationships, not just the romantic kind but also friendships and my relationship with family. Each person has a way of saying they love you and this book explains so much even though that concept seems so simple. I've heard that concept before but I brushed it off because ""if they love me, they should do the same things I do for them"". I was wrong. Luckily, I read this book just shortly after being engaged to the man I completely adore and love. Without this book, I would have interpreted our relationship so differently (and I was beginning to). But this book made so much sense that I couldn't put it down and read it very quickly. It shone a light on my relationship and I've since had a great appreciation of my loved one."
"This book should be in every adult‚Äôs hand, including younger and mature.  It‚Äôs a great read and will make total sense as you go through it.  It talks about the five love languages we ‚Äúspeak‚Äù and how to discern yours and/or your partner‚Äôs.  I bought one each for my son and his girlfriend who are in a serious relationship.  I can‚Äôt recommend it highly enough!"
"I found this book to be very helpful. I wouldn't say my relationship is at a crisis point but I'm trying to proactively address my feeling of distance with my partner after the birth of our first child. In reading this I gained important insights into my needs and our needs as a couple. I'm excited to have this new knowledge on my side and I've asked my partner to read the book too (which he highly dislikes reading so I appreciate the brevity of the book- I was able to comfortably read the whole thing in a few days). I definitely recommend this to my friends who mention relationship troubles and I can see its value in even non romantic relationship contexts (understanding hurt from childhood for example: my dad's love language is different from mine, go figure!) a good read and easy to follow advice."
"When going through some terribly rough times in my marriage last year, a good friend recommended this book.Communication breakdown is usually at the core of many relationship woes and I figured mine weren't any different.I found this book to be wonderfully comforting to read and offered me a great deal of personal insight into what the disconnect between me and my partner might have been.I found myself routinely suggesting the book to others, but kept hearing in return 'how religious' it was...I didn't see that.Sure there are some God references, particularly toward the end (though I only remember them vaguely), but I didn't feel like I was sitting in church.I don't think the messages of this book are limited or relegated to 'believers'. Humans are humans and whether one believes in God or not, there are bigger forces and trends at play in this world than what we think are unique to us.If nothing else, it's a comfort to read scenarios that ring familiar when one is in a time of confusion and pain.I highly recommend this book even if you want to learn how to talk to friends and family better."
I have been married before in the past and I wished I had read this book before marriage.  In my case I‚Äôm not sure it would‚Äôve made a difference.  What I am left with after reading is that if everyone‚Äôs love tank is full the enemy is unable to enter the bond between the two.  I am not suggesting that there won‚Äôt be problems or crisis but they can be weathered together by a strong force. Solution:  Think of every problem that could possibly happen and develop strategies before they happen. So when they begin the algorithm has already been written in the time of peace and can simply be followed through.  Sort of like a prenup... though I‚Äôm not sure what I think about thatü§£
Just got this book and already devoured it. This book is very informative and helps one understand how to give love someone like a partner that does not speak your love language. We are all different. we speak different love languages.  This helps one better understand each style
"A friend recommended this book. Look online for the quiz and explanation, free. And way better than this drawn out awful book."
"Its so simple once you understand the 5 love languages. Its an easy read, easy to understand and very effective because its based on his real world proven experience with couples.Its been 3 weeks now that we have been applying the principles in the book, I know what my wife's love language is now, and she knows mine. Our communication has greatly improved, and our frustrations have largely disappeared. We still have a ways to go, but I am encouraged and confident that we are on the right track due to this book. We know we loved each other, but we did not know how to show it in the language of the other person... now we do !We are currently applying the principles to our children so we can speak their language as well.You will not be disappointed in this book. In fact I have it as an E-Book and we are buying it for each member of our family. Also according to the author the principles can also work if only one person is applying the principles.. so don't be discouraged if the other person does not want to read the book."
"In the midst of my own marital struggles where there has seemed like no hope, but a mutual love between my spouse and I, this book has been remembered by a long forgotten suggestion. Where best friends can become the worst kind of enemy...this is a guide to finding peace again. I‚Äôve only just begun applying the practices found in these pages, but I can already feel a difference in at least myself. This book offers real life scenarios, and dialogue that has, word for word, came from my own mouth. I believe in the healing power of Jesus and I give him all the glory. Though it is scary, I‚Äôm entrusting my marriage to him by using his example of love, and replaying his teachings over and over.Gary Chapman has hit marriage right on the head, and I believe in the 5 love languages.‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Gary's book is useful for loving relationships, but is also effective for all relationships. For instance, I was able to identify my teenager right away as a person who requires physical touch to feel cared for. Whenever she gets too ""teen-agery"" I hug her until she calms down. It works every time. And she is 16, so getting a hug out of her normally is like pulling teeth.I also found my partner to be the same. Physical touch like back rubs, or playing with his hair while we watch tv, make him feel loved. And he understands that I do love him, since I am giving him what he needs from me. This is important, as I used to be so confused about why the things I did that I thought were loving, seemed to be falling on deaf ears.I am having trouble identifying my own love language, as it seems to be falling into two categories, but I have talked to two girlfriends about this book (they both read it) and they have the same problem, so I will work through the book again, requesting from my partner things from each of the languages until we both identify which language is mine.This book is very helpful."
Very enlightening book. Makes you think and understand the different styles of people and how not filling their love tank their marriage is in jeopardy. I'm experiencing the  realization that while I like affirmations it's the small acts of service that fill my tank.
"This book is integral for anyone in a relationship.. Coming from a relationship that ended horribly, I didn't want to make the same mistakes with my current relationship. My boyfriend recommended we read this book together and learn each other's love languages. Turns out that we have almost the same top two languages. This book also gave me insight for what went wrong in my previous relationship. I kept trying to fix things by trying harder...in my own language to show him how much I loved him, but he was speaking a completely different language from mine. I highly recommend this. And FYI, it was fun to go through with my partner. :)"
"HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDKnowing other people's love languages is important. As the author puts it (in paraphrase), ""feeling loved and giving love is like speaking a language. If you speak English but your partner speaks Chinese, you can't expect them to understand you when you speak English- you have to learn to speak in Chinese. Love is like this and you have to learn how to speak each other's love languages in order to help the other person feel loved."" It's hard and challenging, but my husband and I have benefited in loving each other according to each other's language rather than our own. It relieves the pressure of figuring the person out (to a degree) but allowing your love to fit to their needs rather than yours-it can be freeing."
My husband and I are reading through this book together. We‚Äôve been married for 12 years and both believe this book is such a great tool for marriage! This would have helped a lot in the early years. LolWe plan on giving this to our sons when they get serious and want to marry. (They are only 5 and 3 years old now. Lol)
"Luckily I have been fortunate to stumble upon this book as a 22 year old, but boy oh boy, even I wish I had read this sooner. It helped me to understand exactly why I haven't felt entirely loved and secure in my relationship with my kind, considerate, beautiful girlfriend‚Äîshe just doesn't speak my love language! I'm hoping I can get her to pick up this book so that we may strengthen our relationship. I've read a lot of books on dating and attraction, but never one so deep and heartfelt as this one. I even cried a few times reading it because of how deeply it resonated with me. If you can look over the religious mumbo jumbo in it, it can change you and your SO's life by drastically improving the passion and fulfillment you feel in your relationship."
"Founding your marriage on God is vital to a lifelong, happy, healthy marriage.My husband & I read this book shortly after we married & still talk about it.Recommend it for every married couple!"
This is some really great information. Perhaps if I knew this before I got divorced I could have done something more to try and prevent it.  It can only benefit my relationship now going forward to know the love language of my partner and speak it to keep his live tank full.
After learning about love languages I decided to go through my most meaningful relationships and tried to see what happened. It helped me understand the love language of my exes and find my own. We were just talking different languages!After an 18 years marriage that ended in a divorce I knew what went wrong but didn't know how to do it better. Now I know! Thank Dr. Chapman!
"Good book. I am waiting for my spouse to finish reading so that we can incorporate some of the advice given (waiting for test results) but I can guess what his love language might be.I am hoping to rejuvenate a stale marriage, and I think many of these ideas are going to help us out and greatly improve our communication."
Both partners will need to be emotionally intelligent to use this method.  This is probably above the heads of those tending to be abusive in any way.
"I believe this may be the best relationship book out there. It not only covers the 5 main ways people give and receive love, but it explains the ""In Love"" experience. The author points out that initial ""In Love"" feelings are on the lines of ""Obsession"" and are also temporary. It was very useful information I will put into practice for the rest of my marriage. I particularly like that there is a quiz you can take to find out what your primary love language(s) are in case you don't know, there is one for the Husband and one for the Wife so you can also have your spouse take the quiz and then discuss the results. It's a good learning experience and you may find out you have been loving your spouse in all the wrong ways because you may be speaking different languages, depending on your situation. I have learned so much from this book and think anyone who is in a relationship, about to be in a relationship or at any stage in life should read this book."
"I have purchased this book several times as gifts for loved ones in efforts to help them understand themselves and others. The 5 Love Languages introduces you to ways in which we give and receive love and appreciation. Having this knowledgeable better equips you for the various relationships throughout life, personal and professional. As humans we frequently misinterprete communication efforts which can lead to undesired feelings. This book helps us express ourselves in a manner to ensure appropriate communication."
"I didn't get this book because I had any issues in my marriage, communication is always key. But it doesn't ever hurt to learn more about being a better you for your spouse. This has helped me understand my husband and understanding his love language. I've implemented what I've learned and understanding him has overall put me in a better mood. Knowing what I need to do to maintain a healthy marriage has been great. He is going to read the book next and can update this with his own thoughts."
"I found this very quick to read.  The 5 minute analysis page at the end was very helpful.  Overall, this book just gets you and your significant other to understand their perspective, and therefore help you to express affection in a way they will understand. Small religious section of the book, but I don't get offended by other people's perspective, and this was NOT a religious book, only the author expressing his personal beliefs as related to the subject matter. Easy to ignore if you don't want to hear it.  Worth reading."
"If there were a 10 star option I'd give them all to this book! I don't really like to read much, nor usually have time to even read full articles, but once I started this book I read it in less than 72 hours. I've only begun to apply this to our relationship, but just reading this helped me to better understand why we have been having the difficulties we have lately, and just that has proved to make a difference in the locked horns we were in when the book arrived. If you are in ANY serious relationship you need to read this book. DO NOT WAIT UNTIL you and your partner are unhappy to know why! I couldn't more highly recommend this book for anyone interested in giving and receiving love effectively! THANK YOU Dr.. Chapman!!!"
"Not yet all the way through this, but what a fantastic book! I am a psychotherapist, and about 99% of the material in here is of immense value to any couple, or anyone in a relationship. If you are in a relationship--or even if you are single, but want/plan to be in one some day, please do yourself (and your partner) a favor and read this brilliant little book. This book is not written for the professional, and the ideas are non-technical, being presented in very approachable/understandable terms for the consumer--easily read and absorbed. Kindle ed. is a couple bucks cheaper than the paperback, but a matching set of paperbacks would be the perfect Valentine's day gift for any couple from themselves, to themselves. Go for it. You will be glad you did."
"An excellent book to help you understand and learn how to more effectively express love to those you care about but also to understand how you yourself like to be shown love and how you tend to express love. For example, though I'm not a person that needs to receive gifts in order to feel loved, I enjoy giving others gifts to show that I care about them. This may not necessarily be THEIR love language per se, but it's how I may show love. Once you know the love language of someone else however, you can tailor your actions/words etc to ensure that you are communicating to them that you care."
"I utilized the tools given with my relationships and gave the knowledge to my friends. It helped me in understanding myself to prepare myself for ""The One"". It worked. I met him and taught him the same. We are doing better because of this and other factors too of course."
"This book was recommended to me by a friend who really loved it, so my husband and I bought it to read through together. And now we love it too. This book is well written and easy to understand. It discusses 5 main love languages: words of affirmation, acts of service, affection, quality time, and gifts. The book also includes questions throughout it that you and your partner can use to facilitate discussion. It really did help us to better understand ourselves and the way that we feel loved, as well as to understand each other better. I think that this is one of those books that we will probably read multiple times. I would absolutely recommend this book to all couples."
"The concepts in this book could realistically take anyone an entire lifetime to have learned. You may never use any of it but this book will teach you some things about your loved one that in all probability you would have never figured out yourself.  If you are serious about your relationship, you aught to do yourself a favor and pick up this book.  It will teach you in a very practical way what actions will communicate, not  necessarily with words, the feeling of Love and  fulfillment to your partner."
I honestly enjoyed this book immensely. I wish I could have read it before my marriage failed and it would have helped so much. It‚Äôs crazy how what is in the book actually happened between us in some way. I recommend that this be a book that is read by younger adults so they know what to look for in a marriage in regards to what their love language is and their partners. Maybe will have a lower divorce rate??? Never know.

  ¬†This is a ‚Äúmust read‚Äù this whole time I‚Äôve been loving the way I want to be loved, but that‚Äôs not everyone‚Äôs love language ‚ù§Ô∏è Great even for parents to understand their children‚Äôs love language and how to communicate better with them. I bought 3 copies one for each of my sistersüìö"
It is what all marriage counselors and presidents marriage counseling should include. It explained perfectly what and where I have been missing for years. I have been married for 55 years how much better those years could have been. Never to late.
"This is a wonderful book about relationships and finding out all the things that make our loved ones happy. No matter how great your relationships are, there is ways room for improvement. Hubby and I both read the book, and I recommend it to everyone."
"My partner and I both dedicated time to  reading this together.It gives great insight on relationships from all perspectives.You do not have to be religious to practice the teachings of this book.I lent it to my friends who also loved it.I recommend it for those single, dating or married."
I read this book with my boyfriend because he‚Äôs more introverted and I wanted to find a way for him to be comfortably expressive. Instead I found the book to be most useful and informative for me. Just discovering what in my life and childhood molded me to use the live language that I‚Äôve found to be most comfortable was really valuable for me. It‚Äôs a really great book to read and discover yourself even if you‚Äôre unmarried. And I can definitely see how this book would have been helpful in my previous marriage.
This book is very helpful in understanding how to communicate with others and how to help them communicate with ourselves.
"This book self admittedly is not an arcademic treatise.  It is a simple method of condensing the dynamics of emotional fulfillment into a common language that couples can understand, use, and benefit from.If you struggle in your marriage, this is an excellent place to start."
"This is an excellent book that would have been very useful in saving our 40 year marriage, if only one of us would have found it 30-35 years ago. Divorced for six years I am sending a copy to my former wife so she will have this to use if she has any interest in another relationship. I will definitely use this in my next marriage'"
"Read this entire book in one day. Lots of examples that were familiar and relatable  to my situation.The book resonates with me.Only gave it three stars because the book uses marriage as a standard. These concepts apply to singles as much as married couples. Singles are believed that buying another book will read any different, people should understand that getting the second book is just a money grab.All in all this book is very helpful if both parties are willing to work."
"This book taught me so much about myself. Reading through it I related to the scenarios and felt the reactions clearly. It opened my eyes to the words I was missing to talk about what I wanted and had been feeling. My boyfriend suggested I read the book to help me vocalize what I didn't know how to express. We weren't struggling but ever since reading this and understanding myself better our relationship has been so much stronger and our communion is deeper, more impactful. I wish I had read this years ago. Understanding how I perceive love and how it differs from others would have (and significantly has) helped me in every relationship I have; my parents, my siblings and my friends."
This book will help you understand what you value in a relationship that makes you feel loved and will also help you express love in the ways your partner or children will feel loved and appreciated.  I have recommended this book to several people and they agreed it was worth the read.  Not a very long book so can be read pretty quickly.
"I recommend this book to everyone, whether in a relationship or not. It helps you better understand why you aren't feeling validated at work or why you can't connect with a difficult relative, or how to strengthen your relationship with your significant other.In a relationship, it's a great way to understand how the other person is thinking/feeling, and how you can help him/her to feel more loved...and vise versa. Most issues in a relationship can be broken down to the lowest common denominator, and that is miscommunication in the love languages. This book helps you maneuver these issues and strengthen your relationships."
I thought it was an okay read. it did help me and my partner understand each other. the quiz told me my love language was words of affirmation but from reading the book my love language is quality time. it has brought me and my partner closer together.
This book was delivered on time and the book was great. The book was new and not damaged neither.
The Love Languages changed my husband and I's marriage. Gary Chapman really helps to explain Love Languages and how understanding them helps your partner feel loved and heard. Good easy reads. Bought 3 of these books and they are all great. Unfortunately every book is almost the same and contains only a little bit of new content with every new topic. Other than that these are great books to add to any reading list or library!
"Very well written and enlightening book. It really helps you identify and understand the language of love that those around you need. Easy to read and understand.  Not everyone loves the same or needs the same type of love (or rather, way of showing it). It teaches you how to show them love in the way that helps that specific person, to where they feel fill fulfilled, instead of using your own love language that may be well received but not absorbed like it could be. Excellent for couples seeking to improve their relationships and those finding that they are trying hard but still butting heads (but don't know why)."
It was extremely helpful to me in learning how to better communicate what I was looking for and also communicating in a way that my girlfriend wanted to be loved. I highly recommend it to any couple looking to strengthen their relationship.
"This is the most amazing book, what insight Dr. Chapman has to the depth of the soul.  I have read this book and my husband is almost finished.  And I can say with 110% certainly that this book has changed our lives forever.  I have always felt guilty because I wanted to receive gifts (read book for definition) from my husband and craved more physical contact from him than he already gave (again see book for definition).  Little did I know that physical contact was my love language with my dialect split between gifts and words of affirmation.  I feel as though for the first time in my LIFE that my feeling are validated and NOT SELFISH. My husband now understands that when he doesn't speak my ""language"" and my love tank is empty, how it affects me and us.  I recommend that EVERY ONE (well adults) read this book, single or attached it will open your eyes not only to your language but to languages of others. I wish we would have read this book years ago, how much happier and easier my life and relationships would have been!!!  A must read, I give it 10 stars!!"
"If you have been putting all kinds of effort into a relationship and you feel like it's being wasted rather than appreciated this book will explain why that is and how to correct it. An extremely practical book to know yourself and to know those close to your heart; partner, kids, friends, etc."
1st i would like to say that Amazon is wonderful. My first order got lost in the mail (Or stolen by a neighbor and they were quick to replace my order with prompt delivery this time. They are the best and I will be doing more and more of my shopping here)Started reading this book the other night to try and find a better way to communicate. While you have to be ready to look inside your self and try to answer hard questions about who you are and how you communicate love this will really help you see the way your partner is trying to communicate to you. See the things that they have been doing to show you love that you might have not seen that way. It's a great tool that I think many couples should read and read together. Communication is always key!
"I was recommended this book when my husband left me.  I had no knowledge of what the reason was. After I read this book, it was amazing! The best book I had ever read. It helped me so much to understand what happened in my marriage. It also helped me find out about myself and how to see other people in my life. I have recommended this book to everyone I know. Everyone that I recommended it too, it has changed their lives as it has changed mine."
"This book has insights that I wish I had thirty years ago when my wife and I were first married. It would have saved us many years of trying to figure each other out.  You should not limit this in your mind to married couples, though.  It is useful in any personal relationship.  Dealing with other people we are close to, it helps to know how they react and what truly builds them up and encourages them.  The authors of this book give excellent background and ideas in this area.  I highly recommend it!"
"The concepts outlined in this book are master of the obvious.  I will give the author credit for helping verbalize the concepts of how others respond to different ways of showing love.  However, a good book on emotional intelligence would probably help people get to the same place and probably be more aware of how their behaviors are influencing those around them.  Definitely not my first choice."
Easy to understand principles to help any marriage especially one having communication issues. I wish I had read this book 20 years ago. I would highly recommend this to anyone. Also a heck of a lot cheaper than an hour of marriage counseling.
This book saved my marriage.  My husband and I actually separated.  We had started the process of divorce.  A friend recommended that I read this book.  I didn't see the need since divorce was eminent. But I had heard about this book before so I read it.  Wow.  It opened my eyes to what had been our entire problem with our marriage.  I have since recommended it to people whether or not they are having marital problems.  It was well worth the read.
I am a 67-year old widow who just read this book! I have learned so much about myself and how I need to be shown love as well as a better understanding WHY my first two marriages eventually ended in divorce! We were not speaking the same love language! My late husband and I spoke the SAME love language and were together for 20 happy years until his death a couple of years ago! I am dating again and want to develop another good relationship and I think what I have learned from this book will help ensure that! Thank you so much for such an easy to understand and learn concept as the love languages!
Very easy read. Should be required reading to attain a marriage license. Speaking the correct love language is the primer for all relationships.  Men don‚Äôt think that sex(touch) is your primary language. Dig deep and truly figure it out. Women don‚Äôt think that sex is all a guys wants. Of course we like sex but it‚Äôs not the primary for all of us. Women talk with your partner and guide them in a loving way that only a woman could do regarding your love language.  Best book I‚Äôve read on relationships so far.
"This book rocks. I read the whole thing and got my reluctant fianc√© on board with trying some of the techniques. To my delight, we have never been so happy. Our relationship feels stronger than ever now that we know how to better meet each other's needs, and we love playing the ""tank game"". If you're feeling unappreciated in your relationship, order this now! Read it alone or together and start practicing. I can't stop telling my friends about it. Best thing we've ever done for our love."
This book should be read by everyone. It gives you excellent perspective on all the love languages and how to love your partner and to communicate the love you need properly. Even if you aren‚Äôt hAving relationship issues this book can only help a relationship. I recommend this to Everyone! It was eye opening to learn about myself & my boyfriend and had definitely helped our relationship
"I enjoyed this book to the extent that I learned a lot and it‚Äôs made me rethink how to approach my own marriage and relationships. It‚Äôs such a simple, yet profound, concept. I am not a religious person and didn‚Äôt find the religious aspect helpful at all, I didn‚Äôt see how a discussion of faith added value here."
I have known about the love languages but that didn‚Äôt save my relationship. I believe had I read this book and gained the full understanding of the love languages my life would have been very different and full of love.Knowing isn‚Äôt enough. Understanding and applying is the key.
"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It shed a light on my own needs and behaviors as well as my partner's.  Easy to read with uncomplicated concepts, which I put to use immediately and already see a positive change in our relationship."
"Every married couple or anybody that plans on marrying or wants better relationships should read this book. Great Word of God based inspiration book about how to love your significant other. We are 2nd to God as Believers, thus we should be 2nd to our spouse in order to show the Love of Jesus that lives within us. We‚Äôre still human and broken, so we need to sometimes understand what matters most to our spouse that will help love go round and round in our daily lives. Get this book!"
Great book for couples must read learn all kinds of love languages especially your own. Has work sheets you and your partner can do
"Currently in a relationship for almost a year, at the beginning me and my boyfriend took the love language test and discovered we habe two different live languages. After many people have recommended this book to me, I finally read it and have also encouraged my boyfriend to read it also. Many of the topics discussed signing this book specific to out love languages are spot on and I have even put some of these into practice. I definitely recommend this book even if you are not married and just dating."
"Didn't want this item, clicked in it to read more and it purchased"
"This book i found is not an answer to resolve relationship issues, although it can help mend problems and bridge gaps in communication this book is best at uncovering what you need for youself and discovering what you look for in a person. it helps open the mind to be more self concious about what you deserve and want in a relationship."
"My partner and I are not married, but we do live together and have a newborn. Anyone who has a child knows the strain they can put on a partnership, but not entirely their fault. I'm not putting any blame on her, just trying to point out the struggle of being a parent. We started to be shaky when we moved in. In total we have been dating since sophomore year of high school, now completing our sophomore year of college. So personally, I would say that we have it harder than most couples, we wanted a child and we prepared for her, and even after having her, we both have continued school and work. Point be, this book has helped us discover the areas where we clash a lot and the reasons behind why, and not necessarily how to correct them, but how to avoid them completely. This book won't save your relationship, but it will show you how to improve it if both partners are willing, but most importantly, wanting to work at it."
"I'd heard about the love languages and knew that they were good, but I wasn't sure it was worth purchasing the book. After all, I already understood what the five were. But I wanted something about marriage to read, so I went ahead and got it. I have to say that I am not disappointed. This books contains insights deeper than simply what the languages are. It explains how to apply them, examples of what happens to a marriage without them, and how to pull a failing marriage out of the fire. In short, it was well worth getting this book, a must read for any couple, and you would be hard pressed to find a book that will heal a marriage more quickly or more thoroughly. Love really is the key, always has been."
"There's nothing in here that will shock your world about love and marriage. However, sometimes we need a couple reminders of how to act that can greatly improve our relationships. I think this book is wonderful. Despite the original shock about taking marriage advice from an individual who didn't appear to have been in a successful marriage, the author clear demonstrates how he has changed. this book does a great job of teaching how to think rather than what to think."
"This seems very practical to me. I am hoping I can focus on being a better wife, since he is unhappy. I'm unhappy too, but he has made efforts to the best of his ability for who he is. I've been holding a grudge for a long time thinking I'm hanging in there and that's enough. We still have love. There are a lot of disappointments. But if I try, it could get better. If I can apply the book's ideas, it could work."
Excellent Excellent!!! All married couples and the couples that are getting married soon!!! Please please read this book! It‚Äôs a must. You will truly understand ur spouse love language and they will understand you!! After reading this book it really gave me a huge eye opener on relationships and how to deal with my fianc√© on certain situations!! I also pay attention to his love language towards me as well as myself.. We always ask each other how‚Äôs your love üíï tank!!
"I met the author once in our church, he‚Äôs really knowledgeable and amiable. This book, has helped me go through many of the self doubting, misunderstanding moment whenever I have a problem with my partner. It helps me and my partner to understand our different needs and love expression in our relationship. I would say it definitely has brought me and my partner closer since we haven‚Äôt fought for a long time, and our affection deepens."
I had been looking all over for this book but had been unable to find it in my town. I got this book very quickly and it is in perfect shape. My finance and I were recommended to read this one and we have started it. It is full of great information that can help out individuals and couples when going through those tough times. An individual can learn more about themselves and may even discover they have different ways they like being showed appreciation than they originally thought. A couple can learn so much about each other and themselves. This is definitely something I would recommend to everyone I know whether they are single or in a relationship.
The books physical quality is itself average. But the words inside are LIFE CHANGING. I read this book with my fiance before getting married and we have now been married almost 3 years and I can honestly say this book is the secret to our easy success.
"This book gives me hope. As a 20-year-old, I still have my fair time before I settle down. I‚Äôve always felt emotionless and although girls catch feelings for me, I don‚Äôt. Even if I do, I‚Äôm the first one to fall out of love. I‚Äôve feared ending up like my father who left my mother early on, but because of this book, I learned love is a choice. It‚Äôs something both explainable and almost tangible. I‚Äôm hopeful that when I do find that perfect someone, I‚Äôll be able to love her from the honeymoon phase to forever.Highly recommend!!SIDE NOTE: This book is not at all overwhelmingly religious so if you‚Äôre an atheist, trust me it‚Äôs worth the read."
"I Loved this book and I am looking forward to reading it with my wife when I get back from my business trip. This isn‚Äôt a book just for people that may be struggling in their relationship, this is for people that want to have a healthy relationship no matter what."
"This book is amazing! It was recommended in our premarital counseling session and we have read it together! Of course he feels like he is physical touch but chapter 10 really breaks it down for everyone thinking they are only physical touch! I would recommend to anyone who is in a relationship, married, divorced (might make you reconcile) and desiring marriage! Women, read this along with the The Power Of a Praying Wife by Stormie Omartian! You‚Äôll get a new perspective on what a powerful ministry marriage is!"
"The message in this book is incredibly powerful. It's written for understanding and improving the relationship with those closest to you. It explains why you try and try to make your soulmate feel love but they just don't, and why they try and try to make you feel loved, and you just don't. The book provides insight as to what's happening, and how you can make it better. I recommend this for everyone who wants to make a committed relationship work, or take a working relationship to incredible new levels."
"After reading this book I started to notice the love languages of all of the people in my life. I can see how connecting with people on their level can only enhance my relationship with them. Wish I read this book years ago.It's a very easy read with many stories of unhappy marriages becoming loving again using the principles in the book. The book, itself, didn't seem to be particularly geared toward woman or men, but I did find certain chapters focussed on one or the other. That was slightly off putting to me. Also, the quiz at the end can be pretty sad for those who haven't had love in their relationship in a long time. The questions are phrased as if the spouse has been doing the loving things.If you're not feeling particularly loved in your relationship this book may give you some insight and may help turn your relationship around. Definitely worth a read."
"Book came as advertised. Brand new, and great quality. One of the most incredible books I have ever read. The 5 Love Languages, does not apply only to those in relationships, it truly speaks to each and every human being who feels that innate need for love which is in our very nature. This book will change the way you look at others and help you to understand both how to love, and how to feel loved. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. 5 stars all the way."
"Most excellent book provides wonderful insight into our individual ways of expressing love (and the way we want to experience being shown love from our partner).  Provides wonderful suggestions to improve your relationship with spouse, even if you already have a wonderful loving relationship.  This book describes the unselfishness of love and provides basic concepts which are also relevant to other relationship in our lives as well - with our children, siblings, parents, friends..."
"This book has been extremely helpful for our marriage and we have purchased at least 6 copies to give to other couples struggling with their marriage. The principles in this first version of the 5 Love Languages (there are now multiple versions tailored to specific situations, such as men, children, and singles) can easily be applied to any relationship or even regular interactions with people. We highly recommend this book (and series) to everyone wishing to improve their relationships."
"I was admittedly skeptical at first because the premise of this book is fairly simplistic. However the more I read, the more interested I became in my husband and I taking the love language test and applying what we learned about ourselves and each other to our marriage. Doing this has opened doors of understanding and greater depth of love in our relationship. This book will resonates with anyone who is in a relationship seeking a more meaningful connection with their loved one."
"I enjoyed reading this book. Has some great ideas to help marriages. But I feel like they could help any relationships such as work, friends and families. The approach might be different but the result would be good."
I have purchased this book on 5 different occasions. I speak so highly of it and end up giving it away. Like this one I purchased for a friend. This book breaks down everyone‚Äôs love language to better improve their relationship.
"Why did it take me so long to find this book!? This should be taught in High School Curriculum! Man.. a great little eye opener. Biased, in my opinion, about traditional heterosexual relationships, and religious values, but the BIG POINT is all that matters and I believe every human should know we all have love languages and the world will be a better place if our love tanks are full ü§ó Super easy, fast read."
"My husband & I have a great marriage, but we have went through a lot in 2020, like a lot of people. We both read the book, each wrote notes in it, and it has made a huge positive change in our marriage. We highly recommend it to anyone"
I am reading this with my husband one chapter a night. We are in our first year and very happy.  I want our relationship to continue growing and grow in Christ. I love our conversations at the end of each chapter. I'm so pleased we bought this book.
"I got this as a gift for my mom, after a recommendation from Christina Randall, one of my favorite YouTubers. I couldn't help but start reading it, and couldn't put it down! And actually have already ordered another edition. For about $6, the information in this is priceless! My mom loves this book, and it has reignited her love of reading!"
Just finished reading this amazing book ! I have absolutely no idea how anyone could say anything bad about it ! By chapter two I was hooked & feeling emotional! I truly feel like I needed to read this book years ago ! It could‚Äôve helped me in my relationship . I would definitely recommend this book ! It‚Äôs like a self help / relationship help book .
"Quick to read but keeps you thinking long and hard afterward. It helps to get to know your partner better, and even yourself! I thought I knew how I worked but this has convinced me that showing care by ‚Äúacts of service,‚Äù of taking a responsibility off my list and completing it for me, shows to me that I‚Äôm a priority. Understanding how my partner processes and perceives love/caring/commitment allows me to tailor my effort so that there‚Äôs no mixed messages or miscommunication."
"Learn how to show your partner love through how s/he perceives love, not just how you give it. Chapman helps you to determine what your 'love language' is- how you perceive love. This book will allow you to understand the possible other ways someone else can feel loved as well- quality time, receiving gifts, etc. There is no right or wrong; everyone is just different. It is easy to give someone what you would like from that person, but it's even more loving to understand what allows your partner to feel loved and doing the best you can to meet that need. This book will help you as long as you try and you know your partner well."
"I like the book very easy read.  Two pages Max of god religion stuff, thankfully towards the end I think.  The survey is in the back.  Situations will persuade your answers.  Don't take quiz if you have unresolved specific targeting stress source. I wrote in the book and  s.o. read it but ... IDK.  I recommend it to any couple ever. But it does no good without you putting forth the changes and effort.  Duh. K bye."
"This book is very concise and distilled information that is important for every Human to have. If I knew then what I know now and when I get to fully understand this information.... I can see myself finally being in a sustainable relationship. Having more knowledge as to why my previous relationships failed and how I can prevent that in the future is very important to me. Like Happiness, Love is a choice with its own voice."
"If you're not familiar with the 5 Love Languages, this book with change your life. The ideas in this book will help you understand and love the people around you. It's great both for personal relationships like for couples as well as for friendships. If you haven't read this book, please do."
"This book is filled with lots of valuable information for those who are struggling within their romantic relationships, or those who just seek to strengthen their bond with their partner. It helps immensely in both understanding your own self and in understanding your partner‚Äôs needs, and how to create and maintain a fulfilling relationship despite differing ways of expressing love. I would recommend it to anyone looking to better communication with their partner, or even just to have a better understanding of the love languages when looking ahead to how to handle future romantic relationships."
I highly recommend this book for struggling couples or anyone who wants to identify relationship issues and potential solutions. It uses short and easy-to-read scenarios and exercises to teach ways to improve a relationship.
"My mom gave me a copy of this book.  i have used it in past relationships.  the price you pay for this is total worth all the lessons and rewards you will receive from it.  Don't focus on one language.  The content may seem repetitive in some sections but, thats how you learn."
There is much to be learned about love. This book has definitely been an eye opener as to how to love your special someone the correct way. Learn your love language and learn how to love your special someone in theirs.
"My fianc√© and I have been arguing constantly over little things leading up to the wedding, almost to the point of calling it off. We decided to invest in some couples therapy books, and this one was top rated. We read some of it every night and it has really helped us to see each other in a different light. It‚Äôs like we understand how to approach each other now. Very grateful for this book."
"This is an amazing book!! This works with relationships, friendships, family etc! We all have different love languages and that‚Äôs where most misunderstandings come from!! Give this a read! It‚Äôs short and very insightful!"
Terrible.
"This book was super eye-opening and really helped my boyfriend and I see how we love each other, how we can start serving each other‚Äôs love languages, and understand that love is a choice. We are courting, and this book definitely will help us in our relationship abd future relationship!"
This book is a good one! I could not believe how the rules in this book stretch far beyond your significant other. You can apply these rules to basically every single relationship you have with just about anyone. It gets a little repetitive at times but I think the author is just trying to drive home the point. I read this book a few months back and I still think about it's meaning when I find I am not connecting with someone in my life.There are other additions including a singles addition but I honestly‚Äã think this is the only one you need to read.
"My husband and I both read this book while we were engaged, and it was so helpful in the transition into marriage. It really helped us learn to communicate and love each other in the best way that we can, and we reference this book all the time! This is always a must-have when I am purchasing a wedding gift for another couple, as I feel everyone should read this book if they are wanting ""The Secret to Love that Lasts."""
"I'm not one who would read these kind of books but after going through hell and high water with the man I love, I decided I wouldn't give up so easily. After reading this book, it made me realise that a man's way of communicating is so different from that of a woman's, as well as how one was brought up has an effect in it too. By reading, it has made me realise that what's said is not to hurt me but their way of pushing us to do better. It really does hurt sometimes. The book has brought a much deeper understanding in ways to communicate with ones spouse and not making them feel unappreciated. Some scenarios brought forward were like knocking on the doors to my arguments...heheAll in all, I think it is a good counselling and communication therapy read. It makes you look and try to do better and helps you to put your best forward."
"I am currently 2 months in a divorce process. While I don't think the marriage will be saved because she does not want to work on it, this book helped me tremendously. I will use this knowledge for my children and future relationships. I hope my wife will read it for her sake because I know it will help get as well."
"While I was reading the book, I was thinking how wonderful if I communicate my love language with the loved one from the beginning and have her do the same. It would be a fantastic way to enter the relationship and have a sense of trust that things can go well in life."
Hate self help books...read this on advice of a friend (I am 65 yrs old!)  Why didn't I read this 50 yrs ago??Very easy read-examples-case study couples. Made me think back to so many relationships from my own children to friends to my HusbandWOW!!! very thought provoking and explains why you Clash with 1 person and become instant Friends with someone else....Explains that to make love last you need to know more than just those 3 little words
This is a fantastic book if you are willing to put the time and effort in. Go in reading this with open mind. It will help you in any relationship (romantic or not)  or friendship and be a better communicator in general.  I have read this book  numerous times and learned new things each time. Let me make this clear that this will not fix relationships unless you are willing to put the work in. It is not a problem solver for deep rooted issues BUT it‚Äôs great to learn how to communicate to eventually fix those problems.
"This book has good context in the sense of self helping but it has a lot of underlying preachy Christian based things. If you‚Äôre able to read and just overlook the preaching parts it‚Äôs a helpful tool. It is a very male dominated text, but if you‚Äôre mentally able to just switch to fit your needs it‚Äôs not bad."
Timing is everything. Things happen for reason. Being in the right place at the right time. Just a couple of colloquial phrases that I often use. When I heard about this book it was at a time where I don‚Äôt believe things could have gotten any worse. I have great hopes for my relationship now and I haven‚Äôt even started the assessment. Highly recommend this to anybody in a serious relationship.
"I liked this idea of why ""no matter how hard I try I'm not appreciated"" is explained as the field we are trying in vs the way each person likes to be loved. A person who needs to be close and cuddled will not feel fulfilled when left alone but showered with gifts, etc. This helps is with ideas on how to hear what your spouse/partner may want"
"I gave this book five stars because it was thought provoking, meant a lot to me, opened my eyes and helped me understand what marriage is. I‚Äôm divorced and things might have been different if I‚Äôd known what marriage is and isn‚Äôt, what to expect, and that love is a choice. My parents said you had to work hard to keep a marriage going. I never knew what that meant. Honestly, I‚Äôd recommend this book to any individual who thinks they might want to date. Dr. Chapman is a blessing to humankind and I cannot thank him enough for this gem! But don‚Äôt take my word for it..."
"Product arrived on-time and in good condition. This book was recommended by a counselor as a way to help my wife and I learn more about each other and reinforce the strengths in our relationship. This is a excellent workbook, easy to work through and understand. It is a quality product, and a good value for the price.  I would recommend."
"Men are from Mars, we women just can't figure them out.....and vice versa. Perhaps the 5love language holds a key to understanding one another and demonstrates that we are more alike than different. It's not women vs. Men, but deciphering your partners love language to better fill their emotional love tank and increase positive feelings each day you are together."
"Dr. Chapman does a wonderful job of putting a complex common problem (poor communication) in easy to use solutions that everyone can understand. I love the concept not only of the love languages but also the dialects. Fascinating and very helpful. I'm blessed with a great husband and healthy marriage. I've already put what I've learned from Dr. Chapman to use in my marriage, and I've shared this book with my siblings. Great information for all, no matter what your marital circumstances."
I loved it so much that I purchased another book for my cousin. It's insightful and I now understand what it means when a partner voices their concerns. I also realized that it's ok to teach someone how to love you if they are willing to learn and take action because they love you
"I wish I had this book 25 years ago. Although me and my husband has been married that long, a marriage isn‚Äôt perfect. This book helped rekindle our love and we now have big plans just for him and I and we are acting now like smitten young dating kids. I am going to suggest to all my friends and family to read this book as I suggest highly to anyone reading this review. Blessings."
This book is a must read/ buy. I brought the paperback version as I like to have it physically in my hand. This book is very interesting and I‚Äôve  learned so much. It literally opened and changed my mindset and the way I see things. There was even parts that I‚Äôm like ok this definitely is me and I laughed till I cried but it was good to realize what needs to be worked on to have successful relationships
"Basically sound advice, but the recommendations became somewhat incredulous around Chapter 12 ""Loving the Unlovely"". It would surely take the inspiration o faith in the risen Christ to risk offering the best of yourself to a spouse who is that far gone.  I(a man) also sensed an unsuccessful effort on the part of the author to conceal an endorsement of wifely submission to her husband based on biblical principles.  Regardless, Ann's experiment recommended to readers requires requires a tremendous amount of hope and dedication to marriage.  It would also take a very self-aware person to negotiate successfully because it requires humility to risk your sense of pride and self worth in the service of an ideal, when it seems there is a risk that the effort could turn into an exercise in humiliation. Reviews by those less reserved could be more vitriolic."
"While reading all I could think is wow! They should teach this before people get involved with any person, it makes so much sense, I have been through enough relationships that I have always treated others how I wanted to be treated and rarely been treated in the correct manner, I am now in a wonderful relationship, and was so worried that something would eventually be wrong, but I believe that we have been greatly filling our love tanks. I believe that even great relationships could benefit from this great read, because people get complicated and well someone once told me when I asked what was the secret to her long marriage, she said I really believe we never fell out of love or tired of each other at the same time. Renewable love is the key, making time to love the one you love."
"Not a big reader, but worth the money if you use it for what works best for your relationship"
"I wish this book was required reading before getting married. Its extraordinary to find out how your partner feels love -- because quite likely it is different from  you. What's great is that it also applies to children, parents, and anyone in your life that you are close to. Once you can understand how they feel love most (my guy likes words of affirmation, I like physical touch) so many arguments are avoided. In my family, we often teased each other to show affection, which for him was really upsetting. I make sure I'm thoughtful about my teasing and give him positive feedback, and he has been much more physically affectionate with me since learning how much I need that touch. I have also used this with my kids, and am learning how they like to receive love (gifts, affirmation). I had a breakthrough in my relationship with my father when I realized that he shows me love with acts of service."
"I really enjoyed this book, this is definitely a book you keep to reread and reference. I love this book. I figured out my love language and my husband's as well. Our marriage has improved. It's really an easy read, you should buy it if you desire a change in your mindset. JUST GET IT."
"Wonder why your partner doesn't say ""I love you"" even though you are sure they do? Do you but gifts for your sweetie, but they rarely gift you? This book may help you understand why. I read it years ago and so much about relationships became clear. My mother's therapist suggested she read it (reason for this purchase) and it really opened her eyes as well. It will cause you to see your past and present relationships differently. It's a quick and easy read, that you'll immediately want to share with others."
"The overall concept is good, I've read about the love concept from other authors and counselors. I'm hoping my estranged husband reads the book when I give it to him as I have been following these suggestions for the past year but he does not reciprocate. He has not been able to open his heart for a long time to anyone, our kids, friends myself or his mother. Very sad to see, hopefully he connects with this book and he re discovers the meaning of love, the power receiving love and the power of giving love."
I read through the entire thing today. It is well written and easy to understand. There were also scenarios I could identify with in my own relationship and it helped to understand it more.  I am interested to see how having more insight into these languages can help.
"Great little book recommended by my therapist. Easily read, good concept and thoughts to practice for any relationships, parents, kids, partners, siblings, anyone you love...I am not religious so I just passed over that part. I reach for it over and over and highly recommend this read for anyone working on their skills."
Love this book!  It is so helpful for partners!
I found this book very helpful. The only problem I have is getting the husband to read it. It‚Äôs been 6 months and he still hasn‚Äôt made it past the introduction. But it definitely helped me!
"Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.  You have opened my eyes, heart and soul.  I didn't realize how empty my tank was. I cried my way through this book.  Now I have a guide path to walk and bridges to rebuild."
"For two people who have had difficulty communicating for many years, this provided an opportunity to get real insight into how poorly we can communicate love to each other through actions and words. What is important to each person in a fulfilling relationship can be vastly different than we think. We each read a chapter and then discussed.  Each of us speaks a different ""love language"" and this helped us to better understand each other and opened up the lines of communication we never had."
"We were recommended this book from our therapist. It‚Äôs very relatable, keeps you wanting to read more. We chose to read this together. I think it‚Äôs very important to know each other‚Äòs love languages."
"Simple concept but actually really helpful in a marriage. Both hubby and I read it and found it to be really useful with practical tasks we can do daily. I think it helped remind us that relationships are work and not designed to be easy every step of the way. A good read if you are struggling in your relationship, although I recommend both parties read it! If it's just one of you putting in the work, things wont improve."
I really enjoyed this book. It is a bit of an eye opener and helps you understand more about yourself and others. I only wish my husband was as motivated to read it as I was. He only wanted me to give him the highlights. But even just telling him the highlights has helped us grow closer in our marriage.
"My deepest regret: Not READING this a long time agoüò¢. This is rich information. It would have saved me a lot of time and frustration. I see why this book has such a following. I usually don't blindly follow a book because it popular, but now I know personally the value of it. I'll be looking to the other 5 love languages books in the future."
"I loved this book.  So many things in this book made a lot of sense to me.  The overall theme of speaking each other's ""love language"" is something every married (or soon to be married) couple should know about.  My wife and I never spoke each other's love language and this helped open my eyes to so many things we may have missed out on.  We both took the LL test and it turns out we both share the same (touch).  I would have never guessed that about her, even after 10 years together.  I'm hoping its not too late now that I know.  I recommend this to anyone in a relationship, it can't hurt, it can only help!"
"I have purchased this book multiple times now. I've found it helpful in my own life and have also gifted it to friends when they have questions in their relationship. I think it's great that they have different versions now, for men and for singles. The original is a classic and I always go back to it."
"I know this was a great seller and all but there is nothing inside the book that really tells me more than what you can find on the website.I do think the theory itself of 5 love languages is interesting and I do think it's true that not all of us understand love in the same way but the way the book is written just made me feel like I was reading some whatever cosmo article.As I said, reading will never be a waste because worst case scenario you just wont love what you read and you'll still have learnt something new or get familiar with a concept/theory that could be very interesting, which is my case with this book, I just dont love the writing style on it, but it sure will entertain you."
"So there is some quality material in here and good ideas, but overall much of the book just seems like space filler. Could have fit the quality information offered onto the jacket."
"Meh. No surprises. Husband says no. Straight to Goodwill.I didn't learn anything new.Go to dinner instead, don't waste your money."
"This book helps you better understand what your loved one needs from you to feel loved and appreciated.  I've been dating for a few years, and have either read it with several people I've been serious with, or have taken the survey's with them.  It is not a be all end all.  But, the additional insight you gain about your loved one is invaluable.  Get it!"
"LOVED this book. I just happened to order this during my last weeks of my last relationship.  The woman I was seeing unexpectedly ended the relationship and I started reading this the next day. 4 days later I finished this book and I can look back now and see the signs that we were missing to each other and why things ended up as they did. Whether or not you're having problems in your relationship, READ THIS! It will improve your money greatly."
"The only thing I did not like about this book was in certain general examples Chapman made them gender specific, ultimately associating a specific task with a specific gender. In these examples, I think they should have been written as gender neutral and they would have been better received. Other than that, I loved the book, it was an excellent read and strengthened my relationship by helping me communicate better on all levels with my partner. I recommend this book to couples in struggling relationship as well as couples in good relationships. There are suggestions in this book that can help make great relationships even better."
"Wonderful book! The concept that each person gives and receives love in different ways is enlightening, and this book provides details that make this concept very easy to understand, so that you can make changes in the way you observe and act in relationships."
"In a relatively short read, Chapman speaks in simple terms to communication channels in relationships. The ‚Äúhow‚Äù of interacting with a loved one is often missed or forgotten as we settle in during long relationships. This text is not only a reminder of ways we can show love, affection and care, but an explanation of why we can get so frustrated with certain aspects of our partners, etc."
One of the best relationship communication books you can purchase. Helps to see how your significant others communicates their affection.
"Where do I begin? This book is simply amazing, and straight to the point. Provided examples are so well done that it doesn't become daunting to read (no tangents or rambling).  I honestly thought I had it figured out for last 10 years with my husband on what I need to be doing, thinking, acting, speaking, and so on.  I went to counseling years ago (9yrs) when we hit a rough time, and the coaching I got was good but brief.  I feel like I gained the knowledge and insight I have been without just from this book.  I am not exaggerating, and I KNOW how that does sound or come off. The fact is, I learned more about myself than I have in a long time (what my love languages are), and how to recognize possibly my husband's.  He's in the process of reading this now, and will take the evaluation test at the end (which, by the way, is an amazing addition!), then we'll sit together and chat.  Even if you're NOT encountering issues in your marriage, or just are beginning to notice issues, this book is a must!!  I've read so many books, listened to CDs, turned to the internet, turned for advice by trusted individuals, and gained some here and there.  This book is well put together, it's actually funny at times - which really helps, and again I'll reiterate: I learned more about myself than I ever have.  So many tend to focus on the other person like, 'how do i fix them'.  This isn't a book about how to fix someone - and that also doesn't work. Focus on your growth, what you need to do, and go from there.  This book offers step-by-step ideas, assignments you can try, and other resources to turn to related to the author.  Amazing.  I'll probably be reading this a few more times, simply because it's well done/amazing.  It makes sense, and I think that speaks volumes!"
"I loved the real life examples of relationship problems. It was initially a hard read in the beginning of the book for me based on the writer's writing style.  I had to re-read a couple of times before I understood his rhythm. The meat of the book, the languages and the supporting aids are great."
"Very helpful. Even the best of marriages can benefit from this. It is simple, practical and realistic. A must read for those getting married as well as those long time marriages and all in between"
"This book really opened my eyes on how to love and be loved properlyerly. It has helped my relationship and I have been able to help my family members as well with what I have learned in this book. I highly suggest it. I thought I knew what the five love languages were because I've heard about them before but there are so many layers to each one, reading this book really gave me true understanding of each of them and in turn I learned my own (which surprised me) and I learned my spouses and people in my other relationships."
"BUY the book.  If you are dating and want to get married or are in a marriage that isabout to lead to divorce, ""BUY THE BOOK!"" Why don't all marriage counselors use this book.I went to marriage counseling and it was a horrible experience. This book has transformed our relationship.Who ever reads it will get it. Main theme: Does your mate understand what makes you happy in thisrelationship?"
"It didnt save my relationship but it has made me better prepared for my next one. I learned quickly why I felt so... empty when I thought about my partner. Although they claim they did everything to show me their love, they refused to do the one thing I asked - read this book so that we could communicate better. I will always wish them the best even though I know they'll never have it - coupled with this book I am The Best. :)"
"Easy to read and understand. Just disappointing that even after lots of practice, still not feeling the love. Maybe I still have the wrong love languages. Oh well, moving on."
This book redefined my views of love and appreciation for the relationships of my life not only for my now wife but others as well. if you feel you are not connecting with others very well read this book.
"I love this book!!! It‚Äôs such a simple concept! Once the lust stage fades, you have to learn how to communicate to one another in the love language that is most familiar & most comfortable for you.Every time I‚Äôm invited to a wedding or bridal shower, I purchase this book in hopes that the couple will take it seriously & work through the stages that follow lust."
Book is worth reading whether married or not; the lessen and ideas are true based on my experiences. I have read the book multiple times since married and will read in the future. Its always good to book to go back too.
"I've prob bought 10+ copies, my wife and I took turns reading the chapters to each other during premarital counseling the book was super useful and helped us to communicate a lot better.  The book is written by Pastor and does have those religious overtones, but my wife and I are Christian and we appreciated that very much."
"The author does a good job of explaining the love languages and giving examples of couples who represent them. He offers tips and suggestions on what to do and not to do. I had several ""ah ha"" moments. I can attest that all the info in the book is not ""well obviously we should do that"" type stuff. My only disappointment was that the husband and wife questionnaires were not specific enough. One of the choices, ""I like receiving gifts"" is essentially one of the languages. This example can be reworded to be a more real-life scenario. Nonetheless, I think my end result was accurate."
"My wife (girlfriend at the time) read this book together. Although the concept of it seem pretty straightforward, its not something you would think about when it comes to showing your spouse how you love them, and making sure they are recieving that message in the way you intend them to.It has helped immensely knowing what the other sees as acts of love and knowing how to properly show your love an appreciation, and how not to. If a lot more people read this, there would be a lot more happy, successful relationships."
Neat and fun little book to read. Me and my husband happen to have the same love languages! Which explains a lot about us. Neither one of us is perfect and there are things about us that annoy one another but deep down we get each other and get along great!! Maybe IT IS because we speak the same love languages!!! This book makes sense and explains how our love language affects one another.  Give it a try! It can't hurt ;)
"A must read page turner. This was really eye opening for me, not only for learning about my partner but myself as well. I had always heard of the Five Love Languages, I had assumed I knew mine. However, while reading this I quickly realized I had been wrong the whole time."
"This is a great read for couples who've found themselves well past the passion of a new relationship. It has religious references throughout, but is not overbearing.  It's such a good concept of identifying reasons you originally fell in love with, then cultivating that.  I have bought this more than once to give as a gift for friends struggling in their relationships."
We as a couple have a stable marriage relationship. We have struggled sometimes with communicating Love. What is really funny is that my wife and I both scored very close to what we thought we would going in. I have been on the right track to fill our love tanks just inconsistent now we have better understanding and tools going forward. Get your copy of this book quickly and discover how to truly love your spouse so they feel Loved and appreciated.
"Great read! Helpful insights to your relationship battles and ways to encourage your inner growth. Will make you think and grow within your relationships be it with your partner, spouse, or family members."
"This book is amazing for starters. It is very insightful and Gary Chapman really knows what he is talking about! This book has helped me and my fianc√© understand we each have different love languages and that we can both be happy while meeting each others needs through speaking each others love language. Awesome read! It's perfect for dating, engaged, and married couples in my opinion! We enjoyed reading this book together and you and your other half will too!"
Loved this book. Contains very straightforward yet interesting and heartfelt stories pertaining to the subjects of marriage and long term relationships and how to make them last. This is NOT an over religious book that contains morals and ideas about being open with one another and showing understanding and compassion. A MUST READ!
"Foundational book for everyone who wants to love better, regardless of whether they are in a relationship or not.  Just plain, good insights for everyday living and loving."
This is a great book that can help you understand yourself and those around you. Understanding your love language can not only help better yourself but it can also help better your relationship definitely a great read
"I'd recommend this book to everyone no matter your relationship status. It's like a guide to the land of love! When armed with the right information you can enter this territory ready to interpret all the love languages you'll encounter. I'm married with 2 kids and this book has helped with all those relationships. My husband's love language is words of affirmation, my daughter is quality time, and my son is physical touch. Mine is acts of service. We all have different love languages!! It's good information that will last a lifetime"
This book should be required reading for any couple contemplating marriage.  It's necessary information if you want your marriage to last.  It's an easy read with lots of relatable stories and examples.  Save money on counseling and read this book!!
I just finish reading this book. Hopefully I can get my life partner to read this book. It explains what I've been trying to tell him. However I have not been able to figure out my primary love language. I think depending on the moment I'm  one of three. This is a work in progress. A lot of good examples to fallow. Even if there is not big issues with your relationship this will give you both something to ponder and perhaps enhance  your relationship. There is always room for improvement. If your even thinking of it then it's  worth the small  price.
"anyone who is interested in this book and honestly takes the time to pay attention you will never find more valuable information... you will come away with so much, and not just with your love life but in general learning how to show people their value and how to treat them the best way suited to each person is valuable in leadership as well!! this sets the standard of how you treat others as they need to be treated individually with care for their own needs!!  definitely an amazing book!!"
"If you're struggling in any relationship, especially marriage, I recommend this book! If you're not struggling, I still recommend it. Easily understood and helped me so much to understand the difference in languages of myself and those around me."
Obviously it seems easier to grow out of marriage the way society is geared in my opinion after two failed marriages the institution seems shoddy life was always better before you get mailed down to playing gMes
We got so much out of this book! We enjoyed figuring out each other‚Äôs love language and figuring out our childrens‚Äô languages as well.Interestingingly we found that our primary and secondary languages trade places occasionally depending on what is going on in our lives. Suggestion: retake the test occasionally especially if you feel a bit disconnected. The older I get the more I realize nothing stays the same.
I'm not a big reader but I came across this book and heard it was great so I thought I'd give it a read. I felt my husband and I needed some relationship help/advice. I'd heard and briefly learned about the five love languages before but didn't look much into it. After reading this book it has opened my eyes to a lot of things in my relationship and after reading it and taking action just within the two days it took me to read this book and with the positive changes I've made so far with my husband has driven him to want to read this book as well. I would highly recommend this book to anyone in a relationship even if you don't think you have problems there is always things you can learn to make your partner feel more loved and overflow their love tank.
"I found Chapman's model highly useful for comprehending my and my partner's needs. His solutions for a mismatch in styles is a little simplistic, and will not work out for all of us, though they seem to in the book. He gives useful examples of how to meet your partner's needs, and how to meet your own. A worthwhile purchase and read."
"I'm having some personal difficulty with a family member and my psychiatrist suggested I read this book.  It was very helpful in showing me that we all have different needs as humans and we often lose in a relationship because we don't comprehend just exactly what the other person needs from us. It reiterated a basic fact that I already understand, which is we can only fix ourselves. But we can make it easier for someone else to love us when we understand their needs as well. I may never solve my problem, but I am much closer to understanding it and working around it to keep my sanity in my home life."
"I read this as I saw someone publicly suggest it. I love to read, any and all types of books, so I did some searching online to get some more insight and went ahead to order it! Everyone, read this book! It's very informative and definitely helps you explore things in a different perspective. It's also pretty short, but packed with good stuff. As for shipping and handling, everything came in perfectly! I don't regret this purchase one bit!"
This is a good book for young and old. Everyone should be prepared for relationships to change. This book explains how after marriage things are different. If you read this book you will have some help in understanding how things do change and you can work on those things to make a better marriage.
I heard about this book for the first time 10 years ago. And then i heard about it throughout the 10 years... until I finally bought it and read it. I cannot understand why it took me so long to read it.  It is so good to help me understand people/a partner better... understand our differences and accept that we function differently.  I hope to put this information to good use very soon!
This book is exactly what couples need! To know how to love each other. If I could have read this during my first marriage I may have had a better understanding at fixing it. Now that I am in a new relationship I am hoping to have a better outcome and be able to love my significant other in the way he will want to be loved! I think this book is key to any married couple who wants to strengthen their relationship!
"The most lifechanging dimension of love is when we go out of our comfort zones and give in the way our loved one NEEDS the love NOT in the way we are most comfortable giving. This explanation of people and to try to understand our spouse's needs is a whole lot simpler then a book like ""Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus"" . THough giving praise is not easy for me to do, it is what my husband needs, so now I keep that in mind. Life is so much better living in a peacefilled loving household. Mother Theresa of Calcutta said that sometimes love hurts- sometimes its a challenge to give the way the other person NEEDS the love rather then the way I am most comfortable giving- but the reward is higher and deeper."
...as a handy perspective on relationship. Make sense when you find yourself getting mad about xy or z it's easier to articulate why and make an adjustment...when the dust clears.
Although my girlfriend and I are still separated I decided to read this book to better myself n to understand where I might have gone wrong and to also learn about her so I can use these methods in my next relationship or in ours if she veers decides to come back.I've learned slot about myself that I didn't know or understand before. Now trying to remember it all and put it all to work will be the struggle. Very good read. Thank you
Great book!  Helps you understand not just your significant other but other loved ones and people in your life.  I have purchased many copies for couples and individuals.
"A lot of what‚Äôs in here is for sure thought provoking. It definitely first of all helps define the things about yourself that you view as essential to wanting out of a partner in a relationship.It also helps categorize what your partner is looking for,  putting that into perspective of why you may or may not be connecting as you envisioned you would as the initial ‚Äúfire‚Äù of your relationship fades.Definitely recommend reading if you feel as I described in the past sentence"
"Every couple should read this BEFORE they begin a relationship!  But, it is never too late to learn...after 40+ years, we have reread the book and know that once you are committed to the Lord and the person you have chosen, love prevails.  It is good for every relationship, marriage and those who are experiencing ""rocky"" times."
"My boyfriend had read this in a class that he'd taken, and suggested it to me. I am so very glad he did! I've learned so much about myself, and how to communicate better with all of the people that I love.  But, best of all, my boyfriend and I have been given the amazing opportunity to start our relationship off with this wonderful information, and it has already made this the greatest relationship I've ever had! Now, I'm just excited, looking forward to all of the years ahead that I will be able to love him better, while truly feeling loved in return. :-)"
"This book was a game changer in our marriage because it gave us a better understanding of how we were wired and what we need to feel loved and how to show love. This book needs to be read by all, not just couples. If you know how a person feels loved, valued, accepted, you can better show it to where they feel it."
"I try to order this item. I didn't know it was the kindle version i put on purchase but I just let it be. But until now, i cant use it in kindle. The book cover image was there but not working. Can somebody help me? I ordered it march 29, 2020."
"Although this is targeted to married couples, it is invaluable in relationships with all you have a relationship with. A spouse, boyfriend or girlfriend, a parent, a child.It helps you identify your loved one's love language so that you an better communicate your love to that person and understand how they communicate their love for you.I applied this to my mom and I and it was a real eye-opener for me. I totally recommend reading this if you are in a relationship."
"A friend of mine recommend this book to my when I was venting to her about how I was feeling down about marriage and questioning myself if the love is still there or not. We've been married for 8 years and have 2 beautiful children together. A lot does change when you have kids but I felt the spark between my husband and I was drifting apart. After reading this book, it opened up a whole new look at what love is. We both have different ways and expression of love for each other. This book truly breaks down how the difference but in a way that you can understand. I've tried a few of the techniques this author recommend and let me tell you what a difference it has made for me. I feel better on how I approach my husband and feeling that love knowing that it wasn't lost, that it is still there. This book opens up a lot on how express our love for each other. I love this book"
Anyone who has or wants a relationship with a significant other should read this book.  It identifies 5 basic needs or love languages and helps you figure out what your and your partner`s basic love language is.
"This book is helpful for learning about yourself, your partner, or anyone else in your life. It is easy to read, short, nut super informative and has a quick easy to take quiz in the back to determine your love languages and that of you partner. Highly recommend this if you are looking to improve communication of needs, and to build on healthy relationships where all needs are being met."
"I read this book a few years ago before my husband and I got married this last spring. Although my husband and I have basically grown up together because we have been together for 10 years, I found this book very helpful. I was assigned to write a paper and present what I had learned from reading this of what my fianc√©'s love language and what mine is in an upper level psychology class. At that time we were so stressed out about other things I don't think we got out of the reading what we needed to learn from it. It wasn't until recently, after we were married. One of my good friends recommended that I read this book due to our lack of communication lately. I informed him that I had read it before. He said ""well re-read it and find out what love language your husband is."" I have re-read this book. I have to say that most of the subtle changes reccomended have been implicated into my marriage and are very helpful. Of course marriage is not 50/50 it is 100/100. Therefore as long as you both are vested in strengthening your true love and making that last and both wanting to read this book. Then this book is the one for you!"
This was a fun quick read and could really benefit people‚Äôs relationships. I never knew my love language but I do now. I even know my husbands and he didn‚Äôt even need to read the book. I recommend this book because it can even help you understand friends and family better not just a boyfriend/ girlfriend or spouse.
"I am not a fan of books like this. It seems that there is always some part that just doesn't fit your circumstance or personality. Yeah, that might work for someone but it would be a square peg in a round hole for us.Dr. Chapman however spent years studying people, he's an anthropologist, and counseling them and has come up with five main aspects, he calls them languages, of how people interact with one another in our most intimate relationships, that crazy little thing called love.It's not clinical. It's not technical. It's not a system. In very clear simple language, he defines each love language: Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Recieving Gifts, Acts of Service,and Physical TouchThen gives abundant examples from his study and practice. Both successes and failures. He doesn't say do this and all your relationship problems will be solved, he shows what a good relationship looks like, how others have worked on theirs, and tells you: See, it can be done.I think it's the best book on how people interrelate with each other, it helps in all the relationships of life and really does help start healing marriages. It did mine."
"This book is a MUST for every couple! My husband and I were required to take this test before marriage. The funny thing is after 5 years, your love languages can possibly change which I would recommend retesting after 5-6 years. This entire book is filled with amazing advice/suggestions/discussions. This book will only inspire your love and relationship to grow depending on how much you care about improving your marriage. I could go on and on about this book so give your marriage a gift and buy the book!"
"Bought this as part of a wedding gift. Recommended read for ANYONE in a relationship. Great reminder of how to ‚Äúkeep loving‚Äù your partner, even when it‚Äôs good."
Husband and I both read this from the library first and then he insisted I get a copy for our house. Very insightful and makes you think and if you use the info provided it can make your relationship stronger.
I love all of these books. Seriously. If you are in a relationship and struggling you need to get this one for you and the one for men for your guy. There are some journals that go along with it too. Really use this tool together
"My boyfriend and I have read this book and we have learned so much about ourselves and each other. We learned how to better express how we love one another through our specific love languages. This was a easy read and it kept me wanting to read more. This is a great book to read no matter how in love you and your partner are, this opened my eyes to somethings I wasn't aware of."
"Quite insightful every time I read this book. I gain more self knowledge and more about my partner. If you desire to learn and willing to set aside your personal beliefs and ego, grab this book"
"I found this book to make me think.  We have grown apart, way apart.  Because of my belief that marriage is forever I won't leave.  So my hopes are that the suggestions here help us.Even the best married couple's could use suggestions in this book."
"This is supposed to be the re-write that updates the content for today's audiences, however all the scenarios in the book felt sexist.  Not in the overt 'women are inferior' way, but in the more subtle 'men have a higher sex drive' way, that somehow a woman who isn't attracted to her husband should pleasure him sexually for months to trigger something in him.  Seriously?For the non Christians thinking of reading this book: Chapman is a Baptist pastor and his religious views are pretty clear in the book.This book could be summed up on a postcard, and didn't need to be expanded into 20 or so related titles specific to all sorts of relationships (so long as they are straight)."
"This is my first time ever reviewing anything, so that must mean something about this book. My relationship was not bad at all, however, there were days that I did not feel loved by my spouse. I saw someone put on facebook about this book; I quickly decided to buy it--couldn't hurt anything trying it.. It made me and my spouse take this test. At first, I thought the test was stupid and I thought I knew what my spouses answers would be and love language.. Boy was I wrong... His love language was the COMPLETE opposite of what I thought it was and what I had been doing for him. No wonder I often thought that he didn't like me, I was doing things for him that he didn't care about.As you read this, you should read very closely on your spouse's chapter and on yours. It's amazing how you will go throughout the day after reading it saying to yourself, ""my spouses love tank is full and I know it is"".. No matter if your marriage is failing or if it's great, still read this. You will be glad you did later. <3"
"This was my first Kindle book I ever purchased and read, it was for the app on my cell. I learned so much from this book that I think everyone who wants to be or is in a relationship, or ever was MUST read this. I wish I would have read it years ago, because I would not have lost a fantastic woman like I did."
I learned so much from this book. Opened my eyes to alot of things I did in my last relationship things I do now and things I've done all throughout my life in any and all relationships I had/ have. It also showed me that I have loved and do love people the way they wanted that I'm capable of it. Great book for learning about yourself and others and how to love. Would recommend to everyone.
The 5 Love Languages is my go-too book for couples getting engaged or as part of their wedding gift.My husband had me read it when we got engaged and we still make sure each other is speaking the other's Love language. Best couple gift ever!
This book was recommended to me. Men and woman don't speak the same language. From reading this book there are five languages (approaches)  that couples should use in order to understand and commit to doing in order to keep their relationship (running smoothly and lasting). This book can be read over and over as a reminder of what your supposed to be doing to keep the relationship.
"Don't wait until marriage counseling to learn how to feed the needs of your spouse. I used this as a premarital study and it's already paying dividends. Learn what they need from you and what you need from them. Don't stumble around in the dark guessing. I guessed my #1 Love Language was Affirmation, but I was surprised to see Touch as a close #2. Learn more about them and you! Learn how to love them well."
"We have both been married before, and are talking about making that commitment in our relationship. We both want to make sure when we get married, we have the tools to ""beat the odds"" for 2nd marriages. So, we decided to read this book.Great info - we each read it and learned a lot of great and practical advice. Dr. Chapman wrote the book well - easy to follow along and his examples are great for everyday, normal issues that can come up in a marriage.We really liked the quiz at the end, too. We both recognized our primary love language as soon as we read that chapter, but the quiz helped us identify our secondary. Ironically, we both had ""ties"" for our 2nd and 3rd love language. So, we both have great options for showing our love to one another!"
If you give love the way you want to receive love... you might be surprised that it is t right... because everyone has their own love language. Once you understand how they feel loved you can easily give love the right way for them...
"If there's room for improvement in your marriage, this book can help.  The 5 Love Languages is an easy to read and understand book.  It will help you and your spouse identify which love languages you speak, and then help you speak each others love languages.  The implementation does take some work, and for me it didn't happen overnight.  My wife is a lot happier when I speak her love language, which makes it easier for her to speak mine.  I highly recommend this book for all looking to improve their relationship with their spouse."
I stuck up my nose at this book. It seemed so obvious after hearing what it was about that I didn't think reading the actual book would be worth my time. I'm eating my words. Its a really wonderful little book. It is simple. But that's a good thing. No complicated psychology you will find in these pages. I like it that way. Just simple human nature and how to deal if you want a lasting relationship. I really recommend this book and am looking forward to also reading the 5 Love Languages for kids.
"This is the 5th or so time I have bought this book. It first started out as someone telling me about it. I read it and loved it so much that now we use it as part of our gift at weddings.. The first few chapters are bla but then it gets good. It was very eye opening and I never even thought about ""different love languages"" When you read it its almost like an "" ah ha"" that makes total sense. Its an easy read and a good conversation piece."
"I am a marriage,business and life counselor. I often recommend books for my clients to read who are interested in educating themselves.  Great book for couples to read together or individually."
"I see emotional love in a new light after reading the book and hope my efforts will improve my marriage of 31 years now that I hold the key to true love. I hope I can encourage my husband to read it, but if not, the book provides me with many tools to use to help him understand my love language and me to understand his. I feel confident this will help reignite our love for one another."
"I was skeptical, but I figured I would trust the reviews and give it a chance.  I'm so glad I did.  This book makes so much sense!  It's an easy, fast, read and very insightful.  I've been with my partner nearly 17 years, and I wish I would have found this book in the early years of our relationship.  If you want to gain a better understanding of you and your partner's emotional needs, buy this book."
"This book was suggested to us when we were attending mandatory pre-martial counselling, and it is worth the read.  Knowing and understanding your own love language, and the language of those around you (not just your spouse, but your parents and kids) can really make a difference in your relationships.  For example, my mom-in-law definitely speaks the language of gifts, while my parents, myself, and my husband, don't.  So while it's not normal for me to send flowers to my own mother on mother's day (a phone call is all that is desired), I make sure that my MIL is recognized with a gift for all her occasions.  Knowing these things really does make your relationships with all the people around you better."
"Good things take time. Great things happen all at once.Don‚Äôt read another review. Read the book, start to finish.If you‚Äôre married, I have a tough time imagining there is any other more impactful piece of knowledge/guidance on the topic available."
"Great book. It makes some points and comparisons, and asks questions I hadn't thought of. Quick read, but definitely one you'll want to revisit.  I will say this, depending on your own situation, it won't hurt to try his suggestions."
"This book opens your eyes to a whole different outlook. I can tell after I read it, things started getting easier for me. I highly recommended anyone in a relationship reads this book. Whethere your relationship is already ‚Äúperfect‚Äù or not, it teaches you a lot. If only I could get my boy friend to read it. *eye roll*"
"My brother had actually reccommended this book to me, to which I responded ""I don't need to read that, my marriage is great"" because it is! But I decided to read it anyway, and see if it made a difference.IT DID!After reading this book, I became more aware of things about myself and my husband. I told my husband about the book, and we both found out our Love Languages. Now that we each know eachothers, it has made an improvement in our marriage and the way we communicate. I didn't think it could get any better, but it did.We are happier than ever, and I have reccommended this book to every couple I know!"
This book has an amazing way to look on how we love and be loved. It helps you understanding your partner and learn how they receive love so you can better love them. It has really helped me grow my relationship by learning on how to please my fianc√© not by doing things I see and a expression of love but learning do to things that makes him feel loves.
I‚Äôve been so interested in being a better wife my husband could be proud of.  Now I hope by doing his love language he will do more of mine.  I plan to give this book to my two grown sons.
"As someone who is not married, but is working through a relationship with a girlfriend and parents, this book has greatly impacted the way I think about love. Though written for married couples, it was amazingly understandable to someone like myself, and I would definitely recommend to anyone in any situation. I have to say, I came with reservations about it at first, my girlfriend asked if we could go though it together, but it changed my whole viewpoint on relationships and even love itself. Read it. It will be to you what you are willing to take out of it."
This book is so good for married couples no matter how long you've been married. I bought this book for a friend. I even recently let my mom borrow mine who's been married 50 years. One of the ways to have a great marriage is to work to have one just like anything else.
"Thank goodness for you, Gary Chapman.  My husband and I have learned so much about each other and we frequently use the terms in this book to communicate our needs. We have not had a single big fight since we read the book.  We are passionate people, so we still have fights, but not like we did.  I used to brush off his complaints as ridiculous (hey, I'm learning...) until I learned he had a different love language.  Goodness, this is a must read."
"Have bought it to give as a gift. Will change the way you understand people. I‚Äôm not big into self-help books & I wouldn‚Äôt consider this that - it‚Äôs more of a decoding of human behavior. I credit this book for saving my marriage 18 years ago. Once I understood both of our different love languages, I was able to clearly articulate what I needed from him & then give him what I knew he wanted."
"I bought this book for my grown children and their significant other because I found the book to present a simple, direct, and non-blaming method to deal with relationships. I hope it will give them guidance in the years ahead to keep their relationships alive."
The examples were great and this is very useful information if you are actually open to learning.  Please explain how to get your partner to actually follow the correct language in the sequel!  Thanks for the enlightening information.
"I had this book a few years ago until someone I know came and stole it from right under my nose.  Shaking my head and sighing.....  A word to the wise, never let sticky fingers people get close to your books!  They're priceless.  Anyhow, I bought it because my best friend suggested it years ago.  I started reading it and never really completed it because many of the things that were being said, I was familiar with (I'm in the medical field myself.)  Anyhow, I must say that the author opened my eyes to a whole new perspective.  Now I look at relationships from another vantage point.  The way Gary Chapman groups each persons needs is remarkable!  I love this and it surely helps you make better choices in your relationships.  I think this book is worthy for all to purchase and is a must have, especially if you're in a romantic relationship."
"Honestly, I‚Äôm not one for relationship books but was referred by a friend to read this. I‚Äôm currently in between relationships, but this book was so necessary. It provided such an easy reflection on past mistakes and things to do differently in the future. I can‚Äôt stress enough how worth it the read was. It really broke down the communication in a relationship to such a basic concept that makes complete logical sense."
I think all couples should read this book before they get married. It tells how different we could be and there are different love languages we need to learn.
"While the subject matter is important and helpful, the dialog the author says he has seems incredibly fake. To me it feels like its a lie to get the point across. Again, the ideas are great, but the overall writing feels disingenuous."
"I don‚Äôt doubt that all 5 languages exist, though mostly they are for conceptualizing how to meet your or your partner‚Äôs needs.  It‚Äôs the variation within these ‚Äúlanguages‚Äù where success might hinge. I would love to see some research on the ideas."
"Very eye-opening book. Helps me understand myself, and explains why my husband does what he does. After 35 years, I still hadn't figured it out on my own! Great for those dating or newly married. Shows why even the best intentioned couples may still get it wrong without this simple knowledge about how to meet each other's innate needs."
My partner and I have been in a rocky place during my first deployment (probably the next book I‚Äôll ask him to read with me). This book allowed us to create a sturdy foundation and help figure out what our love languages are. We‚Äôve both noticed a huge difference. Thank you Dr. Chapman!
I love this book so much. It has opened my eyes to a new perspective of love. I use this information throughout my daily life all the time now. Highly recommend.
"I learned so much from this book. It is an absolute must and I would encourage anyone and everyone to read it, in a relationship or not.I learned how to be a better spouse. How to listen, how to engage, and how to act.While it may take time to see a full difference, the wait will be so worth it.Excellent read!"
"This book must be good, my wife keeps quoting it all the time.  In all seriousness, it has helped her realize that my love language is different than hers.  Her level of frustration with me is much lower now that she was able to identify how I show my life and receive my love.  In addition, she taught me a few things about how to better love her.  If you are wanting to make your marriage better, buy this book!"
"A Good read, this book is a must have for any person, married, cohabitating, looking for love or just living period. I must say it helped me to understand my recent relationship, why it ended? and how to put it back together again,  It teaches you to not give up on Love so easy once that ""In Love"" feeling is gone. I look forward to reading the rest of the collection Gary Chapman, you are an amazing story teller, keep being great at what you do."
"The 5 love languages is a pleasant, informative book! It explores Love and the many different ways people choose to communicate and how it can be improved.For the most part I really enjoyed it!My only reservation lays on some of the sexists, 1900 ideas approach.Overall its an interesting reading piece! Read it with some reservation and critical thinking."
Heard so many people talk about this book. I don‚Äôt get it.. I couldn‚Äôt get through it. Kudos to those who found it helpful though
No
"The title sounded cheesy and clickbaity to me, and so I dismissed it when I first heard about it. It‚Äôs a good thing I have again heard about it from a trusted source, and that made me give it a try. Although I think I know enough-to-be-dangerous about human relationship, I still found new and useful insight in this book."
"Knowing the love language of a person gives you insight into their priorities.  It also helps when two of you that don't speak the same love language have a way to relate.  My daughters' language is gifts, her fathers' is service, this book was as helpful as a foreign language dictionary to them.  For years they had tried to show love and the other person had not comprehended it at all.  For families, managers, leaders, anyone dealing with others: it is essential to understand your own language as well as that of those you interact with, underlying their spoken words will be their basic languages.  These aren't only used for love, but for most of daily personal interactions,"
Theodore Roosevelt once said... I have never in my life envied a human being who led an easy life.  I have envied a great many people who led difficult lives and led them well.  Try speaking love.
"I have slowly been reading this book because I like to read sections and digest the information.  I can honestly say that while reading this book a light bulb came on for me!  We take our most improtant person for granted...why not put in the extra effort...which really is how you won that person in the first place.  Dr. Chapman makes this book easy to ready, he presents his theories in layman's terms so its easy to understand and put to use.  I love it and I know that I will reread this book many times.  If you are feeling distant, indifferent about your marriage...please pick this book up...one can only improve."
"Great book! Great messages! Has helped me and my husband connect to each other better. It is very informative, and eye opening about what love language you have, as well as what your partners is. Even if you don't have a partner, it's still a great read/listen just to discover more about yourself."
This book would be so useful to not only married folks working thru issues but to young folks .. either recently married or single .. to clearly understand the forces at work in relationships so that a lot of the usual pitfalls could be navigated in a positive way... excellent read .. well written .. easily understood writing style.
"I was reluctant at first to purchase this. For some reason, I kept coming back to it on Amazon and wasn't sure that it would help me at all. I decided one day to buy the Kindle eBook and used the Kindle app on my iPad to read it. I also loaded it to my Galaxy Tablet by Samsung (which is smaller and I take to my gym to read while walking on the treadmill). I must say that if you are like me and keep coming back to try to decide whether to buy this or not, let me tell you from my experience... just buy it now! I wish I bought it much sooner! It is an absolutely life changing book!"
I found this book to be an excellent read if you are truly interested in learning about your own love language or your significant other!
This book was truely eye opening! My wife and I have been having intense arguments about how we don't support each other's needs. She always complained to me that I didn't help enough around the house. I just thought she was nagging and trying to be controlling. After reading this book I now understand that her primary love language is acts of service. This book has improved my understanding of what makes my wife feel loved. I recommend this book to EVERYONE in a relationship.
"Finally taking the time to read this fresh into a new relationship and talk about it with my mate has been such an incredible way to bind and ensure we're doing everything we can to embark on a healthy relationship together.This has been so eye-opening for me to fully understand what love languages truly speak most to me and how I can best communicate my love to my partner.Not a huge fan of the minor ""religious"" points made as I think love knows no bounds and isn't restricted to hetero couples, but all in all, this is a great read for anyone in a relationship, married or not."
"I really loved this book. It has helped me understand both myself and partner better. I would highly recommend. Some of the other reviews didn't enjoy some of the Christian tones, but I think that this is a read that can be helpful to anyone."
This Book was a great read for those who wants to be enlighten more about love and romance.
"I've had this for years.  I learned about it when in a relationship many years ago and apply the principles in the work setting and friendship settings, in addition to intimate relationships.  Very useful, practical, easy to read."
Our couples counsel recommended us both to read this book on our first visit. After the first chapter I already knew I was speaking the wrong language of my spouse. I learned more about myself too upon completing the book. I have already recommended this book to my girlfriend but I honestly believe that this book is great for every one to read and learn from
"I think men and women will both find this book enlightening.Because of this book, I realized that my wife and I both differ in every way possible in terms of how we show and receive love, which is very good to know as we try to continue growing as a couple."
"I had always heard of this book but had never read it or done the profile test.  This book was amazing!  It is certainly thought provoking and the examples given lead me to believe that there is hope in every relationship as long as an honest and genuine effort is made.  At the end of the day, if I have done all I can do, I can't fault myself for not trying.  Strongly recommend this to anyone and everyone."
"I am not religious, but I really liked this book.  I believe it too....each of us perceives love in different ways.  Once you know yours and your partner's, not only is it easier to make them feel loved, you notice that they do things for you because they love you even if you don't feel it as love.  It helps keep resentment at bay and helps you notice and appreciate the love your partner does have for you.  Absolutely worth a read."
"This book has been around for a long time.  We finally got one for ourselves.  Pleasant reading, necessary subjects well-considered, an asset to this family.  We bought some more for other people as gifts.  They liked it too.  Good book. Highly recommended."
I love this book! It is helping me understand the love languages of those in my inner circle. It‚Äôs also helping me to understand my love languages! I have been sharing information from the book since I started reading. It is a must have if you plan to make relationships better!
This book instantly changed my relationship. It wasn't bad but we were having major communication issues and this book helped my relationship within 2 days of me starting to read it. Even my husband said the book is working and he's even eager to read it himself so that he can study my love language. This book is worth every penny.
"Fantastic, short read - so helpful in impacting the everyday interactions in a relationship. Learning yours and your partner's love languages helps you make small adjustments for large gains in happiness and communication! I get a copy for all my newly engaged friends! Pairs well with The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work (slightly longer) by John Gottman. I get a copy for all my newly engaged friends!"
"This is a replacement book. I've owned this book for many years but loaned it out & it was never returned, so I had to replace it!! It's full of great relationship information & bedflipping you fill up the love tank of the people most important in your life! A MUST read in my opinion!!"
"It seems like common sense but obviously it isn't. I had a girlfriend recommend this book to me when me and my boyfriend were having some trouble and surprisingly enough his friend gave him the same book recommendation. It may not completely solve all of our problems, but it's definitely got us headed in the right direction."
"Absolutely amazing book! Can apply it to all relationships. It has made me a better at loving-both giving and recieving love not only to my spouse but also my children, parents, and friends. It is also an easy read. Its one of those books everyone needs to read. Find out what your love language is!"
"This book improved my relationship TREMENDOUSLY. As a guy I‚Äôm not into reading these books but I knew I needed something to help improve my relationship with my gf. I ran into this book and after reading it, it all clicked!! Not only will this help build a great relationship with your partner but also other people that are close to you. Truly amazing book."
"Very well written book by Dr David Jeremiah! The Prophecy and the Scriptures used are spot on. The ‚ÄúWhere do we go from here is very insightful and gives us a grounded plan for the days ahead, to stay the course with glorious anticipation! Come Jesus Come!"
I really enjoyed reading this book. If you are interested in learning how events happening in the world today relate to future Biblical prophecies this is the book to read. Dr. David Jeremiah does an excellent job of looking at our distressing times and showing how they relate to future Biblical prophecies.
I have several of  his books. David Jeremiah is a really good teacher when it comes to Gods Word and not mans.
I enjoyed this book very much. It is very helpful in my daily bible studies. I love reading all of Dr Jeramiah's books.
"Very well researched and straight ahead accounting of where we are, where we‚Äôre going, and how Christians are to present ourselves to this broken and hurting world."
I have hope from reading this book.  We are not defeated people.  We win in the end!  An outstanding book for everyone.
"I was very excited about the promise of Untamed.  Which was touted as telling the Love Story of Glennon and Abby.  First, I am more than half way through this book, and their love story has only been touched upon, very briefly.  So that is disappointing.  But what really irks me is Glennon's changing narrative.  And I understand that Glennon herself has changed a lot in the last decade.  That she is evolving.  But there were many people who Loved her previous books, who bought in to the message she was selling then.  Who felt that those books and words spoke to them on a personal level.  And now Glennon totally dismisses those works.  At the beginning of one of the chapters in Untamed, she literally pulls a quote from Love Warrior, about how she was born broken and sensitive, and then says ""Some Crap I wrote about myself in my previous book"".  GAH.  So for all the people swooning over Untamed, for all you know, in ten years she could be saying this was all crap and some phase she was going through.  I just don't trust her as an authentic voice anymore."
"To give a light synopsis of my last week:  I am a traveling nurse practitioner.  I work in urgent care in WV while my home, spouse and family are in Kansas.  I stay in a hotel.  I battle loneliness, fatigue and homesickness.  My anxiety is high due to the current coronavirus.Enter Untamed: the one thing keeping me going during this whole thing.  Glennon's words and stories have been a balm for my soul. A battle cry. Permission to feel all my feelings about my current situation and about my life in general. Inspiration to keep going even when I am tired and anxious because nursing is what I'm here for.  As G says, ""find what your makes your heart ache and follow it"".This book made me feel more seen than anything that I have ever heard or read (typing that just gave me shivery dots).  To know that there are other canaries out there like Glennon and Tish comforted me so much.  The reassurance that there is nothing wrong with me for being an empath and feeling life so deeply was a turning point for me.  As the spawn of two English Lit teachers, I am an underliner by nature.  I should've just stopped because nearly the entire book is underlined :).  I love that it is a collection of essays.  Made it so easy to read one or two during a break or before bed at night.Glennon, you are a breath of fresh air in a very scary time.  I feel like you have taken the yoke off my shoulders hundreds of times over the course of reading this.  Your consistent presence for your people is unmatched. You and Abby and your family are a testament to 'doing hard things', a phrase my best friend and I exchange a lot to keep each other going (I sent her a copy).I will end with this: as G wrote about getting out of the cages that society has put us in, I thought of one of my favorite song lyrics many times.  In 'Brave' Sara Bareilles sings ""Maybe there's a way out of the cage where you live, maybe one of these days you can let the light in, show me how big your brave is"".  I feel like these two creative contemporaries are lights in the darkness for us right now.  Thank you, G, for this gem.Bottom line: READ IT.  Should be required reading for every female in my opinion."
I stopped reading. I respect some people may like it but I don‚Äôt find it really insightful or novel. It doesn‚Äôt help me make any new connections.  If you‚Äôre looking for something with more depth try ‚ÄúWomen Who Run With the Wolves‚Äù
"I updated this review as I read...By page 16, I‚Äôd already sobbed, laughed, sobbed, reconsidered who I am, how I live my life, and what I‚Äôm doing next, and cried again. So much fire lit. This is a masterpiece. Thank the universe (and Glennon) it published now. Lord knows we need this now. It is already one of my top favorite books ever, and I read a lot. Like, a LOT.She talks about learning to access her own inner Knowing, which I had experienced as a miracle a few times in my life before I learned about this from the Guides in one of my other top books, I Am the Word by Paul Selig (and his other books). But this time I got a deeper, more practical grasp and inspiration around how and why to access that deeper knowing every day. She‚Äôs right that it only ever tells you just the next step... Kyle Cease talks about that exactly the same way, too.I‚Äôm also feeling a revolution inside that I was already opening up to take full force... including the revolutionary wild act of feeling it all. Everything. FEELING pain, letting it burn, guide. She says, ‚ÄúI will continue to become only if I resist extinguishing myself a million times a day. If I can sit in the fire of my own feelings, I will keep becoming.‚ÄúBy page 89, it is 3:41 am, and with my two small children asleep near my bed, I quietly sobbed and sobbed and sobbed, as my heart broke open. As I FELT. I‚Äôve barely cried in years. In decades. I‚Äôm usually just trying to disconnect and numb feelings enough to keep going, to fit in, to stay the course, everything is fine. I‚Äôm fine.I‚Äôm not fine. Our world is no longer fine.p115: my husband called me on video chat (we‚Äôre thousands of miles apart right now) and he said, ‚ÄúWhoa, you look different. You‚Äôre glowing.‚ÄùFire. Burning. Feeling.p133:  Turns out cracking open and feeling all the feelings isn‚Äôt just pain. Deep, body shaking joy came to our house today. Car, actually. After a difficult to describe very intense session of 5 people all air-planing our take-out lasagna bites to each other in our parked car and absolutely laughing out assess off this afternoon, my six year old says to me tonight right before bed, ‚ÄúIt was so, so nice to hear Mama laughing. I‚Äôd say it is better than getting a toy.‚ÄùP... somewhere after p 200 some major personal shifts and awakenings occurred... too personal to convey at this time.P324  I‚Äôve been running from my mother since I left for college. Really since I got a car in high school, and before that when I fell in love with my high school freshman boyfriend, who was also my best friend. I escaped into the safe shelter of his love and caring, laughter and companionship.And now, at 37 years old, it‚Äôs time to stop. Because of this book. I can stop, be with it, with her. To let it burn. To face the pain, the triggers, and let the fire engulf me and burn away what was never real. To tell the truth, and face my mother with an open heart.I just moved in with my mom last night. I‚Äôm literally quarantined in small house with just the two of us and my two small boys (6 and 3). For the first time in my whole life, I am not afraid.Thank you Glennon.  My God... thank you.I‚Äôm now going to click the ‚Äúbeginning‚Äù button in my kindle and read it all again.I‚Äôm a little nervous and excited... the wild way my life is cracking open... I have no idea how, maybe I was really ready... this book has immediately and shockingly changed everything, and given me the map for change with truth, freedom and grace. With love.Yes to the heartbreak. Yes to the pain. Yes to love. Yes to myself and my life untamed, in truth.I am free.*Update 6/30/20I was just reflecting on the lasting ways I have changed since I read this book, and a huge one is being now pretty deeply comfortable being with the full range of my feelings, and also my children‚Äôs feelings. From that place, I‚Äôm able to help my children feel safe being with and feeling all their very strong emotions and experiences. I can help them let it burn. I can‚Äôt protect them from uncomfortable feelings, thank god I don‚Äôt need to. I can be present with them as they feel, next to them. I‚Äôm here. Feelings are for feeling. We can be curious. We can lean in.*7/17/21 Update, Note to the publisher on the paperback version:After 10 minutes of trying to figure out if Glennon just published a new book, I realized the paperback version of Untamed has a new title: ‚Äústop pleasing, start living.‚Äù  I was really taken aback, and honestly, I got a stomach ache. I assume this is something the publisher insisted on, someone‚Äôs idea to market this book. Except it was stunningly perfect before. That addition to the title, to me, makes it suddenly sound like a cheap self-help book, not a masterpiece of world-shattering insight, passion, inspiration, raw honesty and beauty that can stand on its own. It‚Äôs a work of art that needs to be free for people to interpret and have whatever breakthrough or opening they personally get from it. Does the Mona Lisa need a tag line to tell you to see her so you‚Äôll stop frowning? This book is a huge, god damned cheetah, and to me that short phase ‚Äústop pleasing, start living‚Äù shoves it in a small box. Leashes it like a golden retriever, to look like just another lame fix-yourself book on the shelf. Dictates what people should do. Uh‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt that kind of the opposite of Glennon‚Äôs actual message? Stopping pleasing is NOT what I got from my beloved time with this masterpiece. If some people got that from reading the book, that‚Äôs great. But I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs only a fraction of the life-altering magic experienced by many readers. Please, publisher, go back to the original cover for the paperback. It was perfect."
"As a Christian I feel this book goes against my Christian morals and values.  I purchased this book based on Reese's book club recommendation.  It is by far the worst pick she has made in my opinion.  Glennon not once mentions that the Christian faith is based on the Bible-the Word of God. She blames the church leaders for following it.  We can't add or take away from the Bible to conform to her lifestyle choice.  I see a woman who still deals with inner turmoil even though she listens to her ""knowledge"" and ""imagination"" and claims that this is her way to get out of her cages and live a more fulfilling life.  She's clearly a mess still.  She's all over the place.  It seems that her ""meds"" aren't helping her as she's clearly still unstable.  I think the real issue is that she's missing God in her life.  Instead she thinks she is free by making her own rules not following His.  Clearly she's not.  She's still in her own cage dealing with her own inner demons and is confused as ever."
"Nope. Nope. Nope. I was so excited for this book. Having never encountered author Glennon Doyle, I was hooked by the sample available via amazon. It hooked me right away...fun short anecdotes that resonated. But then I got the book and it seems the sample was the only worthwhile portion of the book. Her sanctimonious, self-centered ‚Äúkeys‚Äù are the stuff of formula self-help books. It‚Äôs all at once cheesy, annoying, and repetitive. I wanted to love this book but I couldn‚Äôt even make it through the first third before deciding that it needs to be returned. (I did jump forward to see if there was any redeeming quality but alas I did not find one). I wanted a memoir and got a not so catchy and mind-numbingly winding series of crappy blog posts. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs Glennon‚Äôs or her editor‚Äôs fault but it doesn‚Äôt really matter as it‚Äôs just not worth your time!"
If there were ten stars I‚Äôd give it eleven.I got a hotel room all to myself. Left my husband with our nine children and read cover to cover. It‚Äôs been on preorder and each day I would look to see how soon March 10 was. Worth every. single. Second. of waiting.What a gem. What a gift. Pure magic.I called my husband from the hotel and read aloud.I‚Äôm already rereading and it‚Äôs March 11. I‚Äôll buy all the copies.
"I don‚Äôt understand the hype or appeal of this book at all. I got about 30% through and had to toss it aside. She essentially says that you should live by whatever you feel or believe at the moment, which by her own admission, changes all the time. Any decent therapist will tell you that this is really terrible advice. So I‚Äôm not going to listen to whatever else this woman has to say and you probably shouldn‚Äôt either."
"Wow. I found it really hard to get through this book.  I was troubled by its biblical distortions, toxic world views, and degree of self-aggrandizement.Given her previous two books and the way she discounts her former views, I had to cringe at times - and think about just how mixed up Glennon continues to be. I hope she can ultimately find her way.Moral relativism is not a healthy worldview. It‚Äôs a slippery slope that threatens the foundation of our society. And it certainly can‚Äôt be contorted into the Christian faith. I was especially troubled by her interpretation of Genesis. The Adam and Eve story isn‚Äôt about a woman stepping out of her bounds. It‚Äôs about the danger of pride and ‚Äúthinking we know better than God‚Äù in causing sin - which distances us from God. The rest of the Bible can be thought of the story of God‚Äôs work to bring us back to Him.I also saw a repetitive theme in the ‚Äúoppressive patriarchy‚Äù idea. All while proclaiming as a best selling author (and very successful woman) how she left her husband for another woman. This is not logically consistent and came off as superficial. I think she‚Äôd benefit from learning about an alternative narrative, based on a comprehensive knowledge of our past: that men and women have worked TOGETHER to survive insufferable conditions throughout history, and until recently have had the hierarchy of needs to be able to explore new roles in society - and have actually done so. The victimization narrative is a sad and narrow lens to view things with.I also felt like she projected very exaggerated views onto the world. For example: ‚Äúbeing an American boy is a setup. We train boys to believe the way to become a man is to objectify and conquer women, value wealth and power above all, and suppress any emotions other than competitiveness and rage.‚Äù I‚Äôm not sure who she thinks is teaching this, but I certainly don‚Äôt know anyone who is.Read this book with a knowledge of history and an objective understanding of current events. Question the reality of the claims she makes, and don‚Äôt let her convince you of a false narrative.It troubles me that other reviews have stated that this should be ‚Äúrequired reading‚Äù for teenagers."
"Although Glennon's approach has been inspirational in the past, this book comes across as a bit desperate. Many of the things she touts are examples of mental illness that she's trying to sell as ""healthy"" or ""normal."" It's not. Also, she disregards the things she said in her previous books and basically says, ""Listen to this advice, not my old advice."" It's as if she ran out of things to say and has to resort to contradicting her previous messages in an attempt to get sales. It's cringe-worthy at best."
"I take partial responsibility that I didn‚Äôt read the reviews or do a little research about this book, I suppose since it was suggested by a chiropractor & listed as a Christian Self-Help book, I felt safe to crack it open & dive in. I was SO EXCITED to receive this book, but after I was 5 pages in‚Äî I quickly realized that the author‚Äôs message was not liberating nor representative of Christian faith, especially for our current season.We are all so incredibly vulnerable right now with Covid-19, our economy, social tensions, and trying to navigate unprecedented circumstances while engaging in so many important conversations AND We‚Äôre doing this all from HOME & not within COMMUNITY‚Äî to read this book right now feels very UNSAFE. Her ideologies are so dangerous & conclude a freedom philosophy that comes from YOU & within yourself. How convenient, in a time when so many are isolated & feel alone.This literally makes me cry.Please take the Christian descriptor off.This is not the way we who proclaim Christian faith live. We seek to be led by Christ, to know the will of the Father, be transformed by the Spirit, & be unified in the Church. This is TRUE FREEDOM that leads us to be unashamed & to completely be ourselves; because we know we are not defined by our sin & the stumbling we make along the way, but we are seen, accepted, & fiercely loved as we are marked by the righteousness of Jesus NOT our own. What better self-help foundation is there to build on?If you‚Äôre reading this, know that this book in its entirety is a lie. There may be some cute truths sprinkled in here & there, but unless you want to be on your guard & in major Holy Spirit-radar-mode for 328 pages‚Äî don‚Äôt buy this book.Thank you for coming to my Amazon review Ted-Talk üòò"
"I would give this book 0 stars if I could. I have been following Glennon for years and years. Im very confused by this being marketed as her love story with Abby. It seems that the more famous / popular someone gets, the quality of their work nosedives but people line up to applaud it anyway. The privilege Glennon is afforded and uses to solve her life‚Äôs problems is not the problem, but that she is encouraging women to do the same as if she is unaware of that privilege is. The examples in the book just did not resonate with me... you told your son you were taking his cell phone and he thanked you? Your daughter made the soccer team and you don‚Äôt think her new stepmom had anything to do with it? Privileged white women at it again & this book will largely be welcomed and celebrated by that exact same demographic."
"Read it in one sitting. Every time Glennon writes a book, I have an necessary epiphany about my next precise move. I had a 4 month meltdown after Love Warrior so I was actually a little nervous to read this book and see what it would do to me.  Somehow, her words magically create motion in the people who read them. Her persistent self-reflection makes every reader turn our own lives inside-out. Once again, her fierce bravery pushes me closer to my own. We are all cheetahs. Also, G., I need you to write a book about every two years so I never get too far from myself. Thank you."
"4 pages in, and I have goosebumps on my goosebumps. I'm holding back a thousand tears from a thousand places. I have a cup of coffee and am buckling down for what feels like is going to change some things. Truth pours out of Glennon's writing unapologetically. Wish me luck ladies of the world!Post-read follow up:My 2 favorite things about the book are that I was reminded that life is just inherently messy and difficult. I seem to be always fighting this truth. The second is that I laughed out loud like 50 times. Oh Glennon, you are so deep down true funny, which makes swallowing the first fact so much easier. Thank you for your enormous effort, vulnerability, and endless willingness to show us how to show up for life. I'll be digesting and applying the wisdom for the rest of my life."
Drama queens will love this one. Couldn‚Äôt stomach it!
I wish they would send me a refund.  This book is not enlightening or entertaining.  Total waste of money.
"Ugh. I got this book for a book club... everyone else in the book club is so in awe of Glennon and I cannot stand her.  Now I‚Äôm seriously reconsidering this bookclub.I honestly enjoyed this book for the first half and then something switched... it went from being a story about finding unexpected love and fiercely grabbing on to it, whatever the cost... to a collage of cliches and honestly, mom shaming.  At one point she says ‚Äúour kids suck‚Äù, basically because moms over patent and over protect their children keeping them from ‚Äúbecoming‚Äù (astonishing generalization)... she then proceeds to spend the next ‚Äúx‚Äù number of pages sharing quaint examples of opportunities she seized she nurtured her children into the most perfect, astonishing, mature, smart and bold children on earth.  It‚Äôs actually eye rolling... The son who voluntarily gives up his cell phone because he agreed it squashing his creative side, the daughter who petitioned humanity to stop sexualizing the female body... I‚Äôm not in any way saying her children didn‚Äôt do these things or that they aren‚Äôt extraordinary people... I‚Äôm just saying, kiss off lady!  You clearly don‚Äôt think YOUR kids suck- you think everyone else‚Äôs kids suck.  I do not believe that she had the beautiful opportunities to share deep, mature insight with each of her children which immediately resulted in their perfectly ‚Äúwoke‚Äù compliance. That‚Äôs just one part of it though, the second part of this book is just one female self empowerment cliche after another- like it was written to be shared as quotes rather than an actual story.This is the least authentic book I‚Äôve ever read.  Not to mention that she literally calls excerpts from previous memoirs ‚Äúcrap‚Äù... wth?"
"Firstly, the format of the book feels a bit disjointed, as if I was simply reading a bound collection of blog posts rather than a cohesive book.  After reading Love Warrior, I was interested in her story of what took place afterwards, how she was able to reconcile her faith and move forward with her life.  Readers looking for this will be left wanting and personally, I felt as though instead of reconciling her faith, she has traded it for a brand of moralistic therapeutic deism.Much like Love Warrior, there are clips and phrases resonate deeply within me in terms of life experience as a wife and a mother, but there are many more parts that make me feel like I am teetering on the edge of a dangerous theology of which the basis is that life is ultimately intended to be lived for oneself; that self-truth is the only thing that matters and that we must sacrifice everything and everyone for whatever we deem to be our truth at any given moment in our lives.Her work should challenge each of us to examine what we truly believe about this life, our marriages, our faith, our relationships and our parenting.  After all, that is what good art is intended to do; however, I worry for the scores of women who will simply accept her truth as their own, and proclaim as their anthem that they will, ""do whatever the f*ck they want to do"" because that is simply what Glennon says is brave and right and true.If anything is to be gleaned from Glennon's writings, it is not that we must choose to abide by her truth, which but that we each must choose which truth we are going to abide."
Have you ever received a text  that went on and on and on and on and on about the exact same thing yet it said nothing. This book feels like every single chapter (which happens to be an average of 2 pages) goes on about the exact same thing.
"According to my kindle, I made it 71% of the way through this book before I called the time of death. The themes of honoring yourself, busting societal boundaries, and fighting inequality were appealing and honorable. But they didn‚Äôt feel honest. Glennon uses direct quotes to express exchanges that happened years prior. The quotes are too perfect. It‚Äôs the phrasing we‚Äôd use if we had years to reframe conversations and an editor to clean up the narrative. She‚Äôs lead a remarkable life. I‚Äôm sure the polishing was intended for the ease of the reader, but it created a disconnect I couldn‚Äôt see past."
"In my life, I have had ONE favorite author. As an English major who became an English teacher, I have maintained ONE favorite author. I have not budged. I have not wavered. I have a great appreciation for and admiration of many great writers. However,  my favorite was my own and I held pride in my own internal ability to hold Harper Lee in a category that was all her own...the category of being MY favorite. At 35 years old, I have revised MY narrative. I now have TWO favorite authors. Ironically, I somehow feel like both of them would appreciate being in this prestigious category of my mind together. Each of Glennon Doyle‚Äôs books hit me in different ways. I flew through Love Warrior with a vigor I had not had awakened within me in years. I sauntered through Carry On: Warrior with more of an appreciation for the greatness I was about to experience. I wanted it to last. Untamed had me reading sections...rereading those sections...and sitting with them for days before my Knowing let me know that I was ready to continue on Glennon‚Äôs journey AND my own. I received Untamed via preorder. I have read it everyday. I just finished the final acknowledgements...which, even on their own, convey beautiful stories. As an English teacher, I know that not all authors speak to individuals in the same way. Some people are not ready to hear them. Some people are not ready to hear themselves. Some people just don‚Äôt like each other...and that is okay (as Glennon conveys time and time again). In saying that, I am so grateful that a friend of mine gifted me Love Warrior. I am so grateful that I have read these works have truly become more like friends of mine than stories. I find myself becoming defensive of these works as if they were my friends...because to me...they are. I then recognize the irony of it all. I cannot defend something that is wild, Untamed, and does not fit into anyone‚Äôs one category of judgement. These stories are not meant to be softened. These stories are not meant to fit into everyone‚Äôs element of comfort. These stories are not for the people who will shun them, attempt to quiet them, judge them. These stories ‚Äúcarry on‚Äù supporting EVERYONE through encouraging readers in stating: ‚ÄúRead us...Take what you wish...as we all have...and ‚Äòlet the rest burn.‚Äô‚Äù  May we all maintain the element of fire Glennon Doyle ignites in us all. I personally loved every...single...word. I could tell there was not a single word without intent. Thank you for writing to and FOR all of us. Thank you for gifting us such beloved, cherished ‚Äúfriends‚Äù in your works!"
"This book grabs your attention from page one and keeps it. With her incredibly told love story at its core, Glennon weaves together stories from her family, her childhood, her first marriage, and her writing career returning again and again to the theme of finding freedom from societal demands and dictums. She digs deep inside herself to find that freedom and share it with the world. As a woman I know that this is not an easy task, and it takes every ounce of wisdom and ferocity we can find, within ourselves and without. This book offers one woman‚Äôs wisdom and ferocity, both completely unique to Glennon yet also available to everyone willing to lose everything in order to gain ourselves."
"I hated this book from the first page, however, I forced myself to read the whole thing and develop my own opinion instead of dropping it right away without knowing how it develops/ends. This book is supposed to be ""liberating, inspirational and a love story."" Really? the entire novel is one long inspirational quote with no beginning middle or end. The author hardly touches upon experiences and then delves into this 'hear me roar' speech with no substance. My biggest issue with this book is the not so subliminal political views that are forced upon a reader. I have no problem hearing other people's opinion, it's our right to have our own thoughts even if they don't align with others (which is why I continued to read it until the end). HOWEVER, when you preach to readers and take on a morally superior and elitist attitude because you believe your opinion is FACT, there's an issue. The author has beautiful experiences which she could have developed, incorporated inspirational factors and conveyed to the audience in a resonating factor. This is not the case."
I decided to read this book after Reese Witherspoon picked it for her bookclub and saw how much hype it was getting. The book starts out strong with the cheetah analogy but from then on out it's filled with quotes that are too perfect for anyone to have acutally said in real life. It comes off cheesy and fake and feels like the author is over doing it. There were only about three pretty good chapters in the book. Will not be recommending this book to anyone. I'll also be more hesitant the next time Reese makes a recommendation about a book.
"I read about 3 to 4 books a month, and I never give reviews unless they are 5 stars. I figure that if I don‚Äôt like a book, for whatever reason, I‚Äôm not going to hurt the author who took time to write it.  This is different, this Glennon lady is all over the place. She puts down her previous books, because she is still evolving. She appears to be an over the top radical loon, who can‚Äôt seem to come to terms with anyone‚Äôs else‚Äôs way of thinking or doing. She says she‚Äôs all right if no one likes her, but goes to extremes to show everyone or anyone who will listen, just how very important and wise thinking she is. This Glennon chick would be a great cult leader, she appears, to me, to be extremely narcissistic and manipulative. I gave her book one star because there was not an option of a lower rating. Save your money and skip this nonsense she is peddling. This lady needs to chill, maybe sit in her closet a bit more and talk to the ‚Äúknowing‚Äù. Ridiculous book."
"I am about halfway through this book and I can't read any more. This woman is so messed-up, yet she is doling out advice to people about how to live.  There is nothing deep or profound here. The author THINKS she is deep and profound, but she isn't.  She goes from bulimia, to substance abuse, to writing a best selling book on how to save your marriage, to falling in love with another woman.  Unfortunately, she thinks all of this gives her some authority to tell us how to live. The attempt is to explain the profound ""beingness"" (or whatever the beaten to death cheetah metaphor it is) she is now experiences and it is a complete and epic fail.  Never had an inkling before falling in love at first sight with another woman that she might be a lesbian.  She's a grown woman, for goodness sake!  How she could be this utterly confused about who she really is is unbelievable. The presumption she makes that ALL women are this clueless and stuffing their authentic selves into a box, and they need her advice to free them fairly insulting. The spiritual ""woo-woo"" is really, really deep in this one. Her advice is horrible. I bought it as a book club recommendation thinking it was fiction. Nope. It's some sort of memoir dispensing  quasi-life advice nonsense from a completely clueless woman."
"I got about a third of the way through this book before I had to stop reading. How do you write 3 memoirs in under ten years? You try to extrapolate half baked ideas with random anecdotes in your own life into something profound. I was reading it for a book club, and went into with an open mind, but it became apparently clear by page 3, that I never had fallen trap to any of the ideas that Glennon held so dear and then subsequently tries to re-rewrite in the chapters ahead. I also did not read the first two books, so maybe this is why I found the entirety of what I did read overwrought.I have never thought of my marriage, or any marriage as redeeming nor did I ever place that burden on any of my relationships. I never thought of motherhood as my everything, but I recognize that being a parent and doing it well is a privilege, not a choice. I don't think of sexuality and attraction in a geometrical distribution, because  I wasn't raised in a vacuum where I never encountered other people unlike myself (or choose to be blind to them, maybe). I don't think sobriety or lack thereof are like these defining elements of people. Life is long, birth is suffering, people change. Maybe in her fourth memoir (which will cover a two week trip to the Bahamas or doing nothing in the pandemic), Glennon will come to terms with the fact that you can have it all, just not at once, and not forever. Maybe she should also stop trying to put life into paradigms with catchphrases like ""Build and Burn.""I am not going to even go into the writing, structure, or general rhythm of the books because I imagine for a certain person this is great. (Obviously not for me, most of the chapters just come off as rambling word-vomit). I paid for it though and she got my money, so I guess she is doing something right."
The best thing about this book is the cover.The rest of it was about how great the author's life is now that she has everything figured out.
"It‚Äôs never a good sign when you feel great relief upon finishing a book.This was not for me.I didn‚Äôt believe all these insignificant moments she talks about lead Glennon to an epiphany about life every five minutes.I didn‚Äôt relate to any of her experiences, which would be fine, but I felt she assumed all women have been raised the same way and have the same insecurities - this simplified notion of women really irritated me.Mostly, I just found the book extremely boring: none of her revelations seem particularly new to me, none of her life experiences seem particularly different or interesting to me, and none of her notions about religion matter to me.I‚Äôm glad other people get something from this; I shan‚Äôt be reading anything else from Doyle!"
"I started the book and loved it. The dirty pink bunnies was awesome and there were some very funny stories but then, about half way through she lost me. I‚Äôm conservative and I have a hard time with liberals pushing their views and making it seem like anyone who does not agree is wrong.  Comparing the last presidential race to the apocalypse is an exaggeration.  I enjoyed the humor and I really like the style with short chapters and stories but just couldn‚Äôt relate to some of the content. I did appreciate her honesty about her relationship and her kids but there was one chapter, Boulders, that spoke about love and how someone who couldn‚Äôt love you, couldn‚Äôt because their love was impeded was utter crap. People make choices.  At any rate, I stopped about 2/3 through the book and just couldn‚Äôt finish it."
"This book is trash. It‚Äôs all over the place, makes no sense, goes in circles and on long nonsensical tangents of ‚Äúsuper deep intellectual spiritual‚Äù bs. Thank you to yet another ‚Äúenlightened‚Äù idiot for taking up space in the world of writing with a book that truly should never have been written, just like the other books by this horrible author. I should‚Äôve known to stay away when I saw the ‚Äúbook club‚Äù sticker. Returning it after barely being able to force myself through the first 50 pages."
Trite. Cheesy.  Repetitive. Pretends to be revolutionary but actually pushes pretty traditional views of love.
"She spoke to my interior as if she read the diary of my heart and mind that I dare not speak out loud. No more cages now. UNTAMED. This is a book for our times, especially for women who are coming alive. If Truth will set you free then this book will set fire to an evolution revolution. Get ready for it has arrived. No more two steps forward and one step back into old paradigms....this burns down the whole house because we can no longer live in those cages and once you have stepped outside you remember and are UNTAMED."
"I will start by saying that for the last 3 years, Glennon has been my church and my synagogue. That her work held me and freed me during a painfully difficult time. In one particularly dark time, I would say her work has saved my life. For that, I am forever grateful and deeply inspired, forever and ever.I thought reading this book would be as sacred and holy an experience as her previous works have been for me. But the truth is: I have changed, Glennon has changed, and this book was a complicated experience.For me, this book was like eating a meal with an old family member who is a masterful storyteller. The food was ultimately very satisfying and nutritious, and I'll be thinking about the conversation for a long time. There were many uncomfortable moments along the way. Feeling like an old friend, I do feel a little frustrated with Glennon's changing narrative and flagrant fluidity of ideas. Like, her old thing was ""first the pain, then the rising."" Now it's...something else. Something more nuanced that I can't quite put my finger on. Something even more honest, though leaving me shaken because I relied upon her old ideas in times of difficulty.It's hard when any leader speaks with great confidence and then when they shift perception, switches with equally strong confidence. I think the word for this is: misleading. And yes, I do feel a bit misled by all versions of past and present and future Glennon after reading this book.And still - that IS a part of the wisdom of this book. And the challenge. This book, I believe, is meant to direct us into our own inner knowing, instead of latching onto Glennon's.Which is a little confusing, because so much advice is espoused along the way. Entire letters and monologues of Glennon quoting her own wisdom. Along with the directive to follow our own. Glennon says she has no friends, followed by chapters quoting her friends. In previous books, Glennon used far more heartfelt story, self-deprecating humor and charm to soften this mania. Now that Glennon's voice is so very sure of itself, it makes the inconsistencies in her preaching far harder to swallow. Glennon says in the book with absolute assurance that if we like her less now, it is likely because we don't like strong, joyful, brave women (another one of her theories I've seen her say on NBC). And perhaps that is so. Perhaps it is also so that I want to feel that I can rely on the narrator I am reading.For those of us who have read all of Glennon's books and watched her online interviews, or turned to her for wisdom over the years as I have - many of these chapters are recycled repeats of her pet theories and ideas. That doesn't make them bad. It just means I felt a little irked, because the book was promised to be some kind of unprecedented new declaration, and I felt myself skimming through a handful of chapters of familiar ideas. For me, it felt like there was a lot of repetition of what I have already heard Glennon say...many, many times.The last third of the book resonated more deeply for me - especially the final poem, which integrates it all. Glennon's self-proclamation that she is all of the things she has ever said herself to be, undefinable, untamable. Yes and yes and yes. A beautiful and necessary message that left me in tears.Despite my criticisms, I could not put it down. My book is dog-eared, and there are many pages underlined. Many tears shed. And a new self-recognition emerging. I could not ask for more than that deep and irreplaceable gift.I absolutely recommend the read, especially if you are new to Glennon's work. For those of us oldies, I want to share that the experience of reading this book showed me how much I have grown, that I am now able to see flaws in a leader I once really looked to for guidance. I feel more ready to be my own Cheetah than before. I feel more ready to look within. I believe that is what Glennon wants, too. So: thank you Glennon for your work in setting us all free."
"Amazon inexplicably denied my first attempt at writing a review which makes me very suspicious of all these 5 star reviews - I‚Äôm trying again because I was duped by the multitude of praise and I regret spending money on this book.  While her underlying message and cause are worthy, this author seemed to simply mash-up a bunch of ‚Äúinspirational‚Äù instagram captions and called them chapters.  I appreciated reading that women should be more fearless and go for the lives they truly want...the first or second chapter I read it, not the 20th.  She just repeats herself over and over again.  If you loved Eat Pray Love this book is for you.  If you also found that obnoxiously self-absorbed and self-righteous ...steer clear of this one."
"I couldn't put Untamed down the first several chapters and felt really empowered by her words. I really wanted to hear more about her story with Abby and she touched briefly on it but the second part of the book was dismissing her previous writings (which I had loved) while becoming really, really preachy and forced. I don't think I'm going to even finish the book now which is such a juxtaposition for how the book started out for me."
"Audiobook... read by Glennon DoyleMy thoughts and feelings changed ‚Äòseveral‚Äô times - from positive to negative - back to positive- back to negative!!!By the end.... I was just glad to be DONE!If this book was ‚Äòclearly‚Äô a memoir... I wouldn‚Äôt have felt annoyed.I often didn‚Äôt buy her strategies in achieving emotional balance‚Äî-because ‚Äòshe‚Äô lacked balance in important areas of life: true empathy for others.Glennon will ALWAYS put her needs and desires ‚Äòbefore‚Äô  others. She demonstrated several times how she swung that pendulum from being a person who didn‚Äôt know how to please herself to no longer pleasing anyone.Glennon‚Äôs selfish tone towards others was brutal - rather than unflinching honest.  She was down right mean, righteous at times.I began to wonder if Glennon has respect for ‚Äòanyone‚Äô other than herself. Does she realize that many women know who they are? We don‚Äôt all judge our value by the size of thighs?‚ÄòPart‚Äô of being a whole contributing human being putting other people‚Äôs needs first ( at cause), before our own.Glennon is not there yet....she still needs to ‚Äòprove‚Äô that she‚Äôs her own woman.This review would make ZERO DIFFERENCE to Glennon.She said herself, she doesn‚Äôt give a rats ass about my opinion - or what I think of her, anyway.So how do people contribute ‚Äòback‚Äô to her? Where is her opening to ‚Äòhearing‚Äô that there might be a reason some of us readers ‚Äòmight‚Äô ( the Glennon sin?), feel she has a few things to still learn about the balance between being who you are - without verbally purging her righteous onto others:Others who are vulnerable, to boot!Glennon clearly‚Äô states she only cares about herself - over and over and over again.Yes... this is a happy world with Glennon‚Äôs savvy wisdom.She transferred one disorder‚Ä¶ (over-eating, purging, over drinking, trouble with the law,), to a self serving shaming-others for not being like ‚Äòher‚Äô.PARTS WERE GOOD - in the beginning - until she chewed the human race to threads!Her self righteous me me me - ME FIRST - no-pleasing others rule became annoying. I lost total respect!!!I appreciated a few chapters in this book...I liked her ‚Äòown‚Äô discovery about parenting - and where she went south in giving her son the message that his life ( studying for school, tests the next day, etc.), were more important than his responsibility as a contributing member to the family.After Glendon‚Äôs realization- that she was raising a self- centered - self serving kid- she made corrections.She began to demand his respect and contributions to the family.Now her kid did the dishes after dinner -( she made the meal after all).Glennon‚Äôs ‚Äòa-ha‚Äô moments of parenting ‚Äòdiscoveries‚Äô ....that raising a privileged son wasn‚Äôt doing him any long term service, was admirable.I had much respect for Glennon‚Äôs ‚Äòmoral‚Äô discovery‚ÄîI wished I had made that discovery myself when I was raising our daughters, myself.I ‚Äòallowed‚Äô our daughters to do their homework ( skip dishes) because why? because their life wellness out in ‚Äòtheir‚Äô world was more important than them ‚Äòcontributing‚Äô to ‚Äòour‚Äô family.I did the fricken dishes -I made the meals -I did the cleaning -Paul supported our family financially.Hell - I made their lunches - drove them to their many activities every single day - ( private independent schools, music lessons, sports, dance, theater, Hebrew school, etc) I was their slave and I was wrong!!! I never taught them to sincerely value and respect Paul and I.Guess what? Both daughters are successful in the world and independent - but only one of them respects Paul and I fully and expresses it.So... I felt that Glendon did have some very valuable insight into the role of parenting.But...I never got the impression that she respected her own.She patted her self on the back about how great she was.So... I thought Glennon shared some useful tips about parenting from morality rather than kids accomplishments in the outside world.However, every time Glennon moved away from ‚Äòsharing‚Äô her experiences -and started preaching her views -I lost total respect for her.Glennon is ‚Äònot‚Äô a talented compassionate INSPIRATIONAL or SPIRITUAL leader...Her lack of empathy and appropriate speaking skills fell apart.I spent a couple of days trying to figure out what it was that she did that DROVE ME NUTS....She was self serving and annoying in her ME FIRST Philosophy.Too much swinging-the/pendulum with her good girl/ bad girl themes....Glennon is a recovered alcoholic-...A recovered bulimic-...A girl who had destroyed all her relationships at one time as well.I‚Äôm happy Glennon found her own voice - learned to look inward at her own needs and desires - rather than self harm herself.BUT...I was incredibly embarrassed by many things she said - and the tone in which she said them. Even her words about being a feminist were cringe-shaking off the wall.It was her ASSUMPTION that most woman were just likeher -Only focusing on makeup-clothes- getting others to love ‚Äòus‚Äô...Glennon Doyle crossed the line into PUSHING HER RIGHTEOUSNESS on others.One minute she talked about nurturing relationships and the next minute she slammed any person who called her on the telephone or sent her a text message for the gall of interrupting her life.My God then she compared the last presidential race to the apocalypse.  What the hell?I think this is the last book I ever plan to read by Glennon Doyle.She‚Äôs not Eckhart Tolle, Bren√© Brown, Lama Surya Das, or Don Miguel Ruiz....This is a MEMOIR ‚Äî that bordered closely to PREACHING!Glennon Doyle is a woman who took many years to find her own voice.... years of healing from self harm - harming others as well.She still has a few loose marbles about the totality of humanity.....I don‚Äôt want to live inside her ‚ÄòME FIRST‚Äô bubble.There are many shades of gray.  Life is not all black or white - as Glennon would have us to believe.She was down right mean to people who asked her questions.Glennon Doyle is not a person I trust to teach me HOW TO BE A POWERFUL WOMEN!2.5 star rating - rating down to 2 stars"
"I found this book to be completely self serving to the author, full of contradictions, and a really irresponsible message. Oh, and there are some stories she tells two or three times within the book. And the celebrity name dropping ... eye roll.There are more respectable and responsible ways to encourage people to be brave and authentic.There was a real bitterness in the tone of her writing and the just wasn‚Äôt enjoyable or inspiring. Frankly, it just was bratty."
"I believe in what Glennon stands for and I think many of her lessons are important. However, I think this book is chapter after chapter of her tooting her own horn. It‚Äôs almost as if she‚Äôs entered herself into a personal ‚Äúam I woke enough‚Äù contest.Not only that, but there is no clear storyline in this book. The formatting is all over the place. I genuinely believe a 9 year old could organize a story better. The hype around this book is absurd."
Disappointed. Her other 2 books were amazing. I had high expectations. It was a disappointment.
This book was awful.
"I really wanted to like this book - but it left me feeling like the author is lost, empty, sad, a bit angry even,  and still searching for something. I'll keep it to that in lieu of coming across incredibly harsh. Would not recommend."
"I was so excited to receive this book. However, I ended up terribly disappointed. It was very choppy and scattered, not at all what I was expecting."
"I was excited for this book, touted by Brene Brown (one of my all-time favs), and once I started I couldn't put it down....until about 1/4 way in. Seriously I marked/highlighted so much of the first quarter. It lit my heart up!! I felt affirmed in my beliefs about being a women. Being untamed. I am so thankful for the words I read and reread. However, the last 3/4 was just different. It felt ALL OVER THE PLACE. While I understand that's life (living it daily), it fell flat for me. Not to mention the differences in life perspective. I work in emergency medicine and see homeless, broken, dying people everyday and while I know how to sit with my pain and emotions, I have a limit. I cannot be emotionally all over the place and do my patient's and their families justice. Anyway, again, so thankful for the words I read. I will definitely take away a few LIFE CHANGING parts."
"While reading this book in several big gulps, I was bothered by an underlying feeling that the whole story was not being told. This memoir-self help hybrid seemed a bit too serendipitous when touching on her ditching her husband for her wife, and I was curious about what she seemed reluctant to reveal. I went back through the book and realized that in her narcissistic zeal she completely ignored the collateral damage her ""knowing"" behavior had caused. She seemed to jettison so much without a care in the world,  spreading her arms wide and screaming ""I gotta be ME!"" So I trusted  my OWN ""knowing"" and did a bit of research: her new love was already married. That, and her own divorce, explains quite clearly why it took some time before they settled into their second marriages. So take it all with a shaker full of salt. Oh, and that nonsense at the end where she claims that great art can only come from great suffering, ergo SHE is a great artist... absolutely laughable."
"I was SO looking forward to reading this book, but I was beyond disappointed. I wanted to read the story of Abby and Glennon...instead we got Glennon talking about how ‚Äúpopular‚Äù she is because of her other books. She mentions many times about ‚Äúspeaking to sold out crowds‚Äù and being a ‚Äúbest selling author‚Äù. I wanted to read a memoir... I found myself skipping pages and breezing the pages... I will look elsewhere for a memoir to read!"
"The most over-used and useless word for women: empowered. Empower is defined as give (someone) the authority or power to do something. So we are waiting for someone to allow us power? I don't think so. Man, we need to be much more honest and fierce if we want to change the dynamic. There is no one size fits all to our personal struggles, no how to book. Untamed, meh."
"Oof. Hard pass for me. I like glennon and love Abby, but this woman is about as self absorbed as they come in this memoir. Good grief.She throws down some truth bombs sporadically throughout the book, but contorts things to fit her narrative, and frankly mixes truth and narcissism so skillfully I can see the both the appeal, and the danger in what she‚Äôs espousing. The most powerful lie is one based in truth.But again there is great wisdom to be found here. You just have to dig through a bit of poo droppings to find the golden nuggets.Be careful and thoughtful if you decide to give this one a go. I watched my mom destroy my family under similar circumstances and now I have alcoholic brothers, one of whom died, and another  whose been brought back from the dead several times. I‚Äôm just saying, I‚Äôve heard this before and it sure didn‚Äôt end well for our tribe. Good luck."
"I know that for many folks this book is an amazing read, but for me, it fell quite flat. Doyle made a reputation writing about how her life was really, really great. Suddenly she's saying, it wasn't really, really great, that was all just a bunch of BS, but now it really is really, really great. There was no catharsis. It came across very hollow and narcissistic. I loved the opening story about the cheetah, but that was about the only thing I liked about the book. I got 2/3 of the way through and just couldn't take any more.I find stories of transformation quite inspirational but this seemed to be a leap from the author's idea of one ""awesome"" life to another ""awesome"" life without much about the reality of the journey."
"I was disappointed ! Maybe because I loved Loved loved Love Warrior so much but this book just didn‚Äôt do it for me . I get it , release your untamed self but it‚Äôs the same message hitting you over the head over and over again it felt so redundant  . Sorry Glennon , I‚Äôm bummed to say it didn‚Äôt hold my interest ."
"This book was recommended by 2, strong minded,admirable female friends of mine- I will take future recommendations with a grain of salt. Affirmations galore, kitchy nicknames for every single little thing-You can not make every feeling, every way we process an emotion into a ""brand"". Every single page there is a new slang term shes created for how to deal with something. Its repetitive, boring , obvious ,and leaves me thinking, "" are so many women this indecisive?! or flaky?!"" The chapters , are all over the place- beginning which were interesting and I was intrigued by her journey- and then it drops into feeling very trendy, shallow with no real sense of substance. As a 38 yr old woman, growing up in NYC in the 80s- I seen some things-- and perhaps that is why I can not relate whatsoever to what seems like suburban nonsense ,or  a teenager rant on her soap box. I know that these Female empowerment books are addictive, igniting the voice we all have- and sometimes we need a good slew of pages to wake it up and light that fire!!! ........ this left me very disappointed and I truly hope this cheap fast form of writing phases out soon."
"I've never been a book worm. I listen to audiobooks and podcasts when I travel or train for races. I chose to listen to Glennon's previous books via audiobook whilst in the midst of my training last year. Mile after mile, I'd forget about the elapsed time and focus on Glennon's story, and it was riveting. It felt like I was training with a friend, and I didn't have to do any of the talking. This time I opted for a tangible copy of UNTAMED and I LOVE turning every page. As I read, the words register as if Glennon is speaking them and like last year, I find myself totally consumed. These are the times I feel like a book worm.It is comforting and compelling, beautiful and colorful. It is truly a treasure. So if you're an audiobook listener, get this book. If you're a page-turner, get this book. If you've read her other books, get this book. If this would be your first, GET THIS BOOK. No matter which way you make it through to the end, you won't be sorry that you got this book. #getthisbook"
"I really tried to enjoy this book, but lost total respect for the author shortly into reading the first several short chapters, but tried to remain open.  I finally closed the book on the chapter where she talks about having to bring bagels and cream cheese for her young daughter and friends after they have soccer (or some athletic practice) and the kids were upset because they didn't have 5 flavors of cream cheese. Then there is her crazy explanation about falling in madly in love with a woman she met for 5 minutes and she then obsesses over leaving her husband.  She decides she has to leave her marriage and divorce her husband over a woman she literally met one evening at an event where they exchanged a minimal conversation.  The whole thing just sounds like a person with mental illness tryng to write some fluffy garbage about how life is going to be okay if you just say yes to who you are.  As I was reading the book it felt a lot like Melissa Gilbert's book Eat, Pray, Love and then discover that one of her best frienda is Melissa Gilbert when she writes a chapter including how she is obsessing over her new love and Melissa tells her to go for it.  I am really sorry I bought this book.  I plan on giving it away or throwing it away because I don't want it in my house.  I hate that I would have this laying around my house and believing I was stupid enough to pay for this garbage.  I don't write that many reviews, but this is a complete waste of your money.  I suspect a person who wants or needs validation or a reason to have sex with another woman might find support in reading this book, but it is not my thing.  Don't waste your money on this book."
"I wanted to read all of this book before I wrote a review. After mopping up my tears for the millionth time, I hopped on to write this review. I was startled by the first review I read because it essentially stated that Glennon was inauthentic because she changed. Pardon mwha? I'm sorry, but when I was 10, I wanted to be an archaeologist. When I was 20, I wanted to be a naval officer. When I was 30, I wanted to be a therapist. Does that make me inauthentic? No. It makes me a human who grows and changes. The fact that Glennon has the bravery to admit that she has changed over the years on such a public platform is a testament to her authenticity and is a beacon for the rest of us. Ok, now that I'm done with that little rant...I have recommended this book to every woman I know. I was either crying, or yelling, laughing, highlighting, saying ""yes"", or staring pensively into space the entire time I was reading it. I am seriously wondering if it was some magic on the part of God that I'm stuck at home because I need some time to integrate this without societal influence.Glennon I hope you do read this. Because you changed my life. I have spent my entire existence wondering what the actual f*** is this life. I have never felt so seen by any author and lord knows I've read a lot of books. I too was incredibly shocked when I was told to not ask questions in church because I couldn't wrap my head around being told people born before Christ went to hell. I too have googled and polled everyone around me for answers to all my questions (should I get married? should I get divorced?). I too have spent every day for years being ""just a bit"" hungry so that I can stay the right size. I know all the words to all of society's songs and I considered that a success. And worst of all, I too have been ENRAGED that knowing the words never allowed me to be included in the dance. I tried everything. I'm crying while writing this. I was DESPERATE to fit. DESPERATE to love my life-to love myself and I never ONCE considered trusting my inner knowing. I was told my inner knowing couldn't be trusted. I was told I was too much and too sensitive and was being too reactive and for once in my entire life, someone said that's ok. If you knew how much of my life I have sat there thinking that is all such utter b*ll***-you would understand why I just don't have the right words to thank you.So for everyone else, considering this book-buy it now. I wanted to say it's become my new Bible...but that's not true. I've become my new Bible. But this was definitely the key to unlocking a cage that I've been despondently sitting in most of my life."
"I love Glennon Doyle and so I was very excited for this book. I got it around 5pm today and am already finished with it. It is life changing. It is a gift, truly. Please do yourself a favor and invest in this book. Today. Right now. It‚Äôs one I will be reading and referencing and studying over and over again."
Glendon needs to keep evolving.
"1 Glennon‚Äôs first 2 books really resonated with me on a primal level. Her honesty hit where nothing else felt authentic.2. There are moments of untamed where this is also true3. Glennon‚Äôs story is her own, which is what we all love. That said, she‚Äôs clearly caught up in her own story to a point where it‚Äôs become less relevant to most of our lives. I think it‚Äôs amazing and teachable that she is standing in her own truth. Yet, much of the book feels as though she is really excited about having ‚Äúa wife‚Äù. She uses this term often.  Most of us could care less. Really. I didn‚Äôt care about your husband and I don‚Äôt care about your wife. It‚Äôs not what your story is about. I guess she was/is a Christian, maybe this is a big deal? But to most people in 2020, not so much.4. What we know about Glennon is that she is constantly evolving. I love this so I am not so upset that she dismisses her previous written work as ‚Äúcrap‚Äù. She is not gospel and I don‚Äôt hold her to her word - I appreciate that she changes and acceptsher changes.5. That said, she is still in an infantile black/white phase and has yet to lift the veil on many social issues. She blames guns for deaths but not vehicles or alcohol. She blames Big Pharma for opioid deaths but then proceeds to write a rule that those with mental Issues should never go off their Big Pharma meds. I find this all very immature and irresponsible. I imagine she will evolve and change her stance in future books but in the meantime.... how much harm might be done to those who blindly follow her?6. I‚Äôd read Glennon again because I love her perspective and honesty and I‚Äôm also curious to see where she grows from here."
Loved loved loved Love Warrior.  That was such a powerful book I lept at the chance to buy Untamed.  Do not love this book.  It‚Äôs disjointed lacks flow.  I have decided to set it down and stop on page 255 because it‚Äôs becoming preachy and a smidge condescending.  Bummer because I really wanted to love it.  I‚Äôll say the book started off really strong. After the midpoint it has just fissured into tangents that aren‚Äôt connected.
"I thought this book was going to be inspirational. The excerpts really honed in on age ten girls and how they are and think and I have a ten year old.SPOILER....No. It‚Äôs about a lot of things but it‚Äôs too all over the place for me. She‚Äôs married. She is an author. She is popular. I had never heard of her? She likes girls.  She is a lesbian. Husband is okay with it. Lesbian. Husband. Daughters adjust to it. Such a popular author. Tooting her own horn quite a bit. Annoying.First book I have bought in awhile and I didn‚Äôt even finish it.She can write. I cannot deny that but to me, this was a mish mash of things she touched upon. She didn‚Äôt delve into anything. It wasn‚Äôt deep. It wasn‚Äôt soul searching. It was disappointing."
"I just didn't know this book was about a married woman with 3 children that finds herself and marries a woman. She makes the case for living for yourself and what is best for yourself, not others. If this is what you want in life, this book is full of helpful ways to rationalize this new life. I felt misled by the publisher's description, and returned the book. I did not want to read about woman with woman sex, and unhappy children handed off between mom and dad. P.S. I totally support anyone living with anyone... this book just seemed to be a big rationalization for someone who was trying to prove to herself it is ok."
"Boy was I disappointed. This book came highly recommended.  I found the writing to be manic. Way too hyper. The supposed conversations she had with people, that were in quotes, seemed completely unreal.  It was irritating and I really don't get the popularity."
"I put this book down 1/3 of the way through. It felt like I was reading a spoiled 15 year old girl's diary. This woman is so self absorbed I couldn't read another word. As a member of the LGBT community, I am sad that this book was recommended to me for that reason. Next time I will more carefully scroll through other reviews before purchasing a book."
I wanted to love this book because I loved Glennon Doyle's first 2 but there wasn't much happening here. It is Hodge podge of one time I said this interesting thing and maybe you should think this way instead which I found some good nuggets in but it wasn't terribly enjoyable to read. Untamed feels forced but I kept reading out of respect to the author!
"Like several of the other reviewers, I too almost gave up on this book at the early chapter of ‚ÄúKeys.‚Äù Instead, I did speed reading to see how a straight religious woman gets out of her heterosexual marriage & later marries a woman. This is the first & last book that I will read by this author. Just another ‚ÄúSelf-Help ‚Äú book packaged another way."
"I‚Äôve never read anything by Glennon Doyle before, so I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. I hoped that this would be an inspirational, eye-opening book. While some parts were inspirational and helpful, most of the book felt contrived and hokey. The dialogue didn‚Äôt ring true, as people don‚Äôt speak in long, well thought-out monologues. The long, repetitive inspirational metaphors felt unnatural to me.I gave this book three stars because as a woman in my 40s, I could relate to some of it, and I did take some nuggets of inspiration from it. Overall, though, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to most readers.It‚Äôs heavy on religious aspects and politics, especially toward the end. Doyle is brave for tackling controversial topics, but she comes across as preachy."
"Honestly, I really wanted to like this book. Everyone‚Äôs raving about it. I, too, loved Love Warrior. It was moving. It made me preorder this book. Unfortunately, Untamed falls flat. Sure, the love story of Abby and Glennon is a feel good love story. The thing is Glennon spends the majority of this book in a self-indulgent narrative stitching together stories across her life, layering all sorts of meaning on these experiences. She did this in her prior books but maybe this time it‚Äôs just more pronounced and ornate. She reflects on missteps on trying to speak about race issues. I eventually stopped reading.Glennon, girlfriend. Please. Do all of us white women a favor and just stop talking. Stop writing these self-indulgent ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been in a bad place before but now I see the light‚Äù narratives. It‚Äôs an exhausted point of view.The people who love this book are a bunch of whites women who want to feel good about themselves. Plain and simple. Read something else. This is a waste of your brain space."
"I really wanted to like this book. I enjoyed it as a memoir about one woman‚Äôs life experiences and her internal dialogue. I appreciate her journey, her rationale, and her choices... but my guess is that that her story will continue to have twists and turns. I was hoping to find some moments that I could relate to, and feel connected to the author, but instead, I found myself rejecting the messages over and over again. Glennon‚Äôs approach to the world is very entitled and selfish in my opinion.  She has many lives intertwined with hers but for some reason, her voice is the only one that counts. If I did everything my heart told me to do, I wouldn‚Äôt be in a good place, and neither would my children. Instead, my rationale reminds me that I have important responsibilities as a parent, that I am not entitled to everything I want, and that my voice isn‚Äôt always right. My heart may tell me to follow a touching connection with a stranger, but that is not a rabbit hole I ever care to go down.  Research shows us that divorce IS hard on kids and that it changes their perspective of the world and THEIR sense of ‚Äúknowing.‚Äù I could never contribute to that. What she‚Äôs teaching her daughters is to only have an internal compass and discount all of the beautiful things we can learn from one another. Glennon made a comparison to Buddha letting go of the world he knew to find enlightenment but Buddha teaches that attachments (such as her attachment to Abby) causes suffering. Buddha did not run from one relationship to another, Buddha let go of the ‚Äúwanting more‚Äù altogether. He didn‚Äôt feel like he was entitled to more, or to a better life, he didn‚Äôt feel entitled to anything. There‚Äôs no comparison here. Her story is interesting but that is about it, unfortunately. It did help me clarify my thoughts as I disagreed with hers.  I wish her and her family a ton of happiness though..."
"I can't believe how disappointed I was in this book.  After all the glorious reviews I was excited to read it.  About the 3rd chapter in....I realized this was a memoir and not a fiction book.  OK - so I started over with that in mind, also realizing this was the love story between soccer player Abby Wambach and the author.  That part was good and heart warming so for that I'll give it a star.  But the preachy - self righteous - politicizing - I know better than you - was nauseating.  I found myself spead reading and eyerolling through the book.  Seriously, the worst book I've read in years.  Don's waste your time or money."
"I have been holding my phone for several moments, trying to think of how to start this review in a way that does it justice. I can only tell you what it has meant to me. Having struggled through early life that included the death of a parent, severe abuse, sexual assault and moving every year to a different state, my family then moved to PA and joined a really strict sect of the Mennonite cult. All of our clothes were taken away and we were given drab, ugly dresses and aprons to wear, along with a bonnet and black socks. No more make-up, jewelry, radio, television or Christmas decorations. The group was particularly vicious to girls and women, who were taught that submission to a man was the highest honor, and what God expected. So to say that my taming was severe, is an understatement. Extricating myself from that was an ordeal, but the worst wounds were that I had learned, like Pavlov‚Äôs dogs, to never, ever trust or listen to myself. They actually taught us that our feelings were the surest indicator of what NOT to do, since our ways were not God‚Äôs ways, so that meant we should almost always do the opposite of what we felt.All of that to say, I am finally, brutifully, (Glennon‚Äôs portmanteau of brutal and beautiful!) becoming Untamed and actually FEELING love for myself!! So, if I, with that amount of ‚ÄúTaming‚Äù can be helped by this book, I feel there is hope for us all. There is honesty in her words. There is resonance. And deliciousness. And wit. And wisdom. And brilliance. And the ever-shining beacon of a courageous woman, who shows us how to be ok with being vulnerable, and how to be both held and free at the same time. And for me, there were many, many moments I literally roar-sobbed, as I felt the prongs of my choke-collar starting to unclench, one by one, from my lovely cheetah fur. This will sound weird, I know, if you haven‚Äôt read the book. And if any part of this resonates with your soul, or if you are, even as I am right now, starting to cry just thinking about how deeply and profoundly this work of art has touch my heart, get it now. You cannot get it into your hands quickly enough. Follow Glennon on IG and her wife, Abby. It will make your heart sing. Every day I check their feeds, like a little girl with my nose pressed up against the shop window, drooling over the chocolates in the case. And I have hope. Even for me, that one day I will have become Untamed enough to really feel truly free. I can feel it happening. It‚Äôs hard. And it‚Äôs wonderful. And as Glennon says, ‚Äúwe can do hard things.‚Äù I predict reading this book will be one of the kindest things you can do for yourself this year. Much love, Michelle Ashley"
"‚ÄúHere‚Äôs to the Untamed:May we know them.May we raise them.May we love them.May we read them.May we elect them.May we be them.‚ÄùYes. Yes! YESSSSS!All day. Every day!Untamed is incredible! I ordered both print and audio versions because I wanted to listen to Glennon speak her words and then go back to read again, where I could dog-ear, highlight, and make notes all over it.Now I want to write a brilliant review of Untamed but I can‚Äôt ... word! All of the words are stuck in my throat and won‚Äôt spill out my fingers yet. My eyes keep leaking, too. What IS that? Getting ready to start again from the beginning because all the feels and all the words need to wash over me again.I imagined spending this social distancing time reading wonderful books, but I started with the BEST, so now what do I do when I finish it again? This is one that I know I will find new thing in every time I read it. Untamed is an ongoing conversation. A work of heArt. It is brutiful and exactly what our world needs to help us heal ourselves and to heal it.Must buy many more copies to gift to others ASAP.Thank you, Glennon, for sharing your life and your love with all of us."
"You know that friend you have who spends 90% of her life in some sort of drama...enduring a bad relationship, clinging to a crumbling one, bereft at its demise...but KNOWS (errr...sits in her ""knowing"" in the parlance of this book) that she's got it all worked out during the 10% of the time that she's turned on to someone or something new?  That's seems to be the phase of Glennon Doyle's life from which she shares with us the ""Keys"" to becoming untamed.The format of the book first explains how we're caged, then shares ""the keys"" free ourselves, and finally shifts to a bunch of random memoir essays/bloggish posts.  Especially given her messy backstory, I'd like to see how this particular knowing works out for her over at least another publishing cycle before adopting her life choices as life lessons for myself."
"So happy I am able to return this book. I got to the 3rd ‚Äúkey‚Äù and couldn‚Äôt go any further. Everything about this book is self serving, elitist, and preachy. This author seems so self absorbed it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if she turned her life upside down, married a woman, and left her husband, just as material for this book. Maybe her previous books would be more my speed, but I have no desire to find out."
"I read the first 5 chapters and finally tossed the book aside. I'm happy to read a feminist inspirational book, but I didn't find any inspiration in this book. The author relates the way girls are raised to wild animals in cages. We are raised to please everyone else.  We just need to get out of our cages and enjoy life. Sorry. What I took away was that she was a closeted lesbian and finally found happiness and fulfillment when she came out.  Her life wasn't complete until she met her wife. So, all women must be unhappy and need a push to go out and live daringly?  I'm not buying it. It just seems to paint all women with a broad brush.  So, we are basically living lives that were forced on us?  Take some responsibility for your life. Not everything wrong in your life requires blame.  As a woman who was married for 24 years to a gay man who finally came out, this book just hit a nerve -- it's like the author is saying, ""I would've been happier if I had been more selfish."""
"I was expecting this book to be more of a memoir and story telling, but it came off as more of a self help kind of thing. I mostly hate self help books. I find them preachy, self-important, and filled with trite anecdotes on life. Anyway, I'm very happy this author figured her shit out and is in a great place in her life. I just cannot relate to her journey- although I do agree with her stances on many things. I wish she would have spent more time talking about her philanthropic organization, it sounds like they do amazing things. At some point in her youth she had the idea that life was supposed to be easy and if it wasn't something was wrong. I never had the luxury of the belief that life is or is supposed to be easy. It just does not resonate with me. She is a poet and a self described empath. That's just not me either. This book obviously spoke to a lot of people, but it's not my jam."
"Unpopular opinion: I was definitely not a fan of this book..Review of Untamed by Glennon Doyle:‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.A memoir chronicling Glennon Doyle's life once she chose to stop living her life the way society conditioned her to, to now living it with no expectations or approvals other than from¬†herself..While I found it to be a quick read with the short chapters, I also realized that I couldn‚Äôt relate to much of the book. I couldn‚Äôt discern what genre this book was because while it‚Äôs marketed as a memoir it‚Äôs far from it. It‚Äôs more of a self-help book for those who didn‚Äôt ask or seek the help. Doyle spoke in such a self-aggradizing manner that instead of coming off as insightful and inspirational, she came off as smug and sanctimonious.  It was hard to feel inspired when her tone was arrogant and belittling. Her recollections of past memories seemed too perfect and polished for me to even relate to. There‚Äôs a lack of fluidity to her writing. It‚Äôs disjointed, chaotic and essentially a stream of consciousness for 300+ pages. Her frequent use of metaphors quickly got old. Bottom line is, I couldn‚Äôt connect to this book at all..There certainly were some elements of her vignettes that I enjoyed, made me think hard and put things in perspective. The overall messages and themes of her book including self-actualization, empowerment, honesty and bravery are certainly inspiring but I quickly found myself getting lost in the chaos of the writing. The cover is stunning so I applaud whoever created it. I also admire her bravery to speak out and live her life without caring about societal expectations or worrying about the judgement of others. All that said, this book just wasn‚Äôt for me. If you‚Äôre looking to be preached to about ways that you should live your life as a woman then this book is for you. I am curious to know if my perception of the book would change if I were to read it 5 or 10-years from now."
"Oh boy. This book is a work of art. I loved Glennon‚Äôs other books but this one she leveled up x10 for. It‚Äôs crisp and tightly written and every essay packs a punch. I read it in less than 24 hours and cried about 20 times, including ugly sobs during one chapter I felt so incredibly validated and SEEN by. That‚Äôs the thing about her writing, it seems she can see inside the collective female (human) mind and take all the murky thoughts and feelings rolling around and put it all down so poetically on the page that it makes the reader go, YES THAT‚ÄôS EXACTLY IT!This book is moving, transformative, and life affirming and I am so grateful it exists.The only thing that sucks about it is that after you read it you might feel like Glennon is actually your best friend... but in reality you don‚Äôt even know each other (and even if you did she wouldn‚Äôt answer your texts). üòÇThank you, Glennon, for this beautiful book that feels like a gift."
"I've greatly enjoyed the other books by this author. This didn't feel remotely like a memoir and more like antidotes of her life. Very little about finding Abby. Was she shocked she fell for a woman? Were the kids connfused? Abby is pretty fantastic and she puts up with a very needy Glennon. This books is just bits and pieces and didn't align with any brand she was creating. Maybe she wasn't. Because she tells these stories or makes mention of them so often, you really don't need the book. It's more about her being a feminist and activist with little stories popped in. It didn't flow so it wasn't captivating like her last book. It felt so over the place. Reading this and watching her on Social media makes me think Abby is just a great human as I can't tolerate that kind of personality or neediness in my relationships. So many middle she women are going through divorce and life changes. Her honest account which would have been a memoir, would have been worth the $14.99 I'll never get back."
"I just devoured this book. . It was like going to coffee with an old friend.....catching up, seeing growth, seeing wisdom....Seeing wholeness and just listening to her speak her truth for 5+ hours.It was magic and an honor to read ."
"This book spoke to me on a deep, deep level. I found myself wanting to call my friends and family and just read paragraphs to them. There is so much truth in Glennon‚Äôs writing. My husband asked me what was it about, and I just said, ‚Äúhow to live‚Äù. I‚Äôm in my 50‚Äôs and just starting to come to terms with who I really am. The last few years I‚Äôve felt something welling up, from deep within, about the world we live in, my faith, being a mom, being myself, love, racial inequality, justice...just about everything. This book touched on so many of the same thoughts and ideas I‚Äôve been thinking about. I so want my three kids to grow and be totally themselves, without the world telling them they‚Äôre not enough.The second I finished the book, I wanted to go back and start over and I think I‚Äôll be returning to it again and again. So, Glennon, THANK YOU for writing this book. It is precisely what my soul needed at this exact moment."
"I like Glennon, and LOVED her first two books.  I struggled with this one for many reasons.  I‚Äôm not sure where or when, but at some point she said something about how a lady stood up during one of her speaking tours and said that Glennon just doesn‚Äôt resonate with her anymore (something like that), Glennon apparently believes that‚Äôs because she‚Äôs just so happy now, and because her life is so great and perfect, and her kids are just so woke, and her love so true‚Ä¶.  The real heart of it, in my opinion, is actually because she‚Äôs just not that funny anymore.  Well, she likely is, but it‚Äôs not found here.I appreciate her heart to help humanity and her fierce dedication to her family.  And I love that she and her wife found each other (wish I could hear so much more about that!).  I also fully understand her deep love for Abby ‚Äì Abby seems like someone I could sit and talk to for days on end and never get bored ‚Äì she seems interesting, caring, strong, determined, funny, and just‚Ä¶ cool.  If you don't like Abby, I'm certain it's actually you that's flawed! :)Here‚Äôs where Glennon lost me ‚Äì for good, probably.  Yes, Glennon has an absolute commitment to her wife and children first ‚Äì no doubt.  And yes, they were navigating some very uncharted waters while blending their family, and she no doubt needed to protect her children‚Äôs hearts during this time.  But, the part of the book where Grandma (Glennon‚Äôs mom) wanted to come visit her grandchildren, but Glennon went on for pages about (something like this.....) not allowing her because of some self-perceived, minor, deep down, old tradition, unexpressed, nonacceptance of gay marriage, and where this deep down, maybe not even fully conscious nonacceptance may change her kid‚Äôs and their family forever because they could ‚Äúsense‚Äù this, etc etc‚Ä¶. WHAT!  Not only did I find it emotionally painful that Glennon would hurt her own mother that way, but all the rest of the inner monologue was just utter non-sense.  Overkill times like.. 99.9%.  Maybe, perhaps, possibly, Glennon‚Äôs mom really still did have some (like one percent) residual fear of gay marriage, which she hadn‚Äôt 100% lost at the very second that her daughter announced she was marrying a woman.  Even so, there were literally a zillion other approaches to the situation ‚Äì all better than hurting your own mother and banning her from seeing her Grandchildren until her ‚Äúsoul‚Äù changed or whatever.  Glennon is so very lucky to have parent‚Äôs like she does.  Her treatment of that privilege, and her mother‚Äôs heart, really make me so mad.  Bleh.  P.S. Give your children more credit than to be so influenced by some ""deep down look in Grandma's eyes"" and and be changed for it or... whatever.  Give.Me.A.Break.I still thank Glennon for being so raw and true during her first two books (and in maybe a few pages of Untamed).  She gave a lot of courage to so many women to do the same, and that's not to be forgotten.  Finally, I‚Äôll always be rooting for the love between Abby and Glennon‚Ä¶ You both have my best wishes."
"This is by far... the worst book I‚Äôve ever read. How it has 30,000+ ratings, blows my mind. I was recommended this book since I loved Maybe You Should Talk to Someone. And I read the reviews but thought I could still love it. NO! It reads like someone with ADHD writing Instagram captions. Like the horrible blog posts you have to read before getting to the recipe you googled. I have no idea what her intention was with this writing but, just no. Couldn‚Äôt get through a quarter. I‚Äôve never returned a book before this one. Maybe you‚Äôll like it, but personally, I truly disliked this book and will never read another one of her books."
"I didn't even read it. Sending it back. Followed her and her wife on Instagram but no longer. In these times, people with such ""influence"" should be helping others less fortunate vs, talking about their designer dog ""Honey"" and their entitled white lives.. BOOOOOOOO!"
"Overrated and poorly written.  Anyone who‚Äôs read profound, wise work will find this book underwhelming. It‚Äôs clear the author set out to write about overcoming adversity and then made her book fit that narrative. I couldn‚Äôt even finish it."
"This is my favorite Glennon book so far, HANDS DOWN.Here's what I loved:1) The voice: She's talking right to the reader, just like she would if you were chatting over coffee (which she would never meet you for, of course, because she doesn't do that LOL). There's no pretense, there's no fancying up to make her point sound more important, she's just telling you what she thinks and why. It's easy to read, it's funny and smart, it flows, and then BAM...it hits you with something super deep and meaningful that you have to go back and read again. And underline. And put a star next to. No? Just me?2) The honesty: Glennon tells some stories here that reveal her fears, her weaknesses, and her mistakes. She talks about times when she was wrong and what she learned. To me, this makes it that much easier to listen to her and take her points to heart because hey, she's not perfect. She's not up on a pedestal telling everyone how to be better, she's right down in the stress of being a human with the rest of us. She screws up, she tries again. This kind of honesty is BRAVE, and so freakin' important because she's saying things that a lot of us really need to hear.3) The lessons/stories/truths: There are anecdotes about Alicia Keys, the Mona Lisa, and from the sidelines of soccer games. Glennon speaks to moms, daughters, sisters, friends, and wives. There are sections on parenting, on marriage, on love, on friendship, on being a woman, on being a human. I found so much of what she said to feel true to me. I had so many ""YES! THIS! SO MUCH THIS!"" moments while reading. And I feel like every woman alive should read this because you will come away feeling seen and heard and known.I loved it. Please share more truths soon, Glennon, ASAP. üêÜüêÜüêÜ"
"I love her writing style and topics covered, it is a true page turnerHowever, it seems that not many of these situations actually happened. Each little chapter seems to be Glannon's way to ""cast her wisdom"" and her way of being more write than others in her life so she comes up with situation to do so. Even in stories where she gets schooled (not many of those ) she somehow managed to be the star of the story. Her self deprecated humor seems so narcissistic.Lexapro propaganda is straight annoying and irresponsible!and it leaves me wondering - what is the point of her books anyway ? Isn't it that she left addiction behind and is facing life as it is and feeling all the emotions now because ""We can do hard things""? But it cannot be that and being hard core on Lexapro.  Simply cannot be both! Being unable to function in real life without Lexapro IS an addiction!  and NO you cannot feel all the feelings on that drug! that is just simple scientific factalso it is MUCH easier to ""Do hard things "" when you are on LexaproSo ... is Glannon just a fraud who is super ambitious and  writes well and has Oprah as a friend?All in all even though book is well written with many great points, it left me disliking the main character  - Glannon herself.She seems egoistic, extremely self involved, everything she writes justifies her ways and puts everyone else in second plan or even in question ... also  her high ""look at me people I dont know "" ambition is off putting.I mean that is the woman who like to be left alone, is  in her own words horrible friend and does not text back BUT has time to be on instagram all the time and respond to the masses she does not know !There is more than one contradiction when it comes to Glannon DoyleI cannot help but thinking  what if she diled down on her off the charts ambition and need to be ""out there "" for the masses to love her  - maybe she could actually do hard things in real private life without being addicted to Lexapro.Just an idea"
"This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. It was the selection for a book club so I tried to give it a chance and get into it, but I found it so hard keep reading. The anecdotes are so obviously romanticized and inflated, possibly just fake. She makes no effort to acknowledge her privilege and how it plays such an important role in her ability to ‚Äúbuild and burn‚Äù her life to fit her changing world views. Right out the gate her cheetah metaphor come off as ignorant, and reductive. As others have said, this reads like a chopped up stream of influencer quotes and attention seeking self affirmation. The writing style is elementary and lacking in substance. It truly saddens me that this book is so popular. I‚Äôm sure Doyle is a lovely woman, and I agree with the bones of many of their arguments, but this book is the literary equivalent to those Instagram pictures of milkshakes with 15 desserts skewered on top- impractical, made for likes, sickly sweet, and unpalatable."
I never write reviews but I want to save my friends from this awful book. I liked the story of meeting Abby but that is a small part of this book.  The rest is the author telling us how she has it all figured out for us.  I‚Äôm glad others found her advice helpful but I found it annoying and narcissistic.  I also agree with the comments that the dialogue is simply not to be believed.
"After all the raves, I was excited to read this. I needed a pick me up and some common sense restored. I read chapter, after chapter, to wonder who is this women? What do we have in common? Nothing. Sorry, I was born into a world where there was no coddling no golden children.. just surviving. This is like a memoir of a regular persons life.. I read on as I want something to grab me and make my head understand.. a women who couldn‚Äôt be herself in a world that tells her to be all other things.. guess what? We live in a world that allows you to be whatever you want and you don‚Äôt need the pleasing or approval of others. Just be you..your shampoo doesn‚Äôt make you special.. you loving yourself and that light showing up makes your special.. gay, fat, pretty, thin, depressed, pink hair etc.."
"I enjoyed the authors previous books, however I personally didn‚Äôt care for the (writing) style of this book and found it hard to get through. I wish the author would have shared the content in a different format. To each their own."
"It‚Äôs a fine book... read it because my daughter raves about it.  I found that Glennon wrote in a circle... first, talking only about being true to self no matter the cost.  She says Family and kids will adapt as long as your happy... then she almost contradicts herself as she circles back to doing what it takes for your family to thrive.And a few other times I felt she wrote about incidents that she might have described as condescending if the same words were spoken to her from a man (like reality TV isn‚Äôt really real... as smart as Glennon must be, I found it absurd that her partner had to point that out to her to get her to crawl out from under the covers of despair.)It‚Äôs an interesting read and I do like some thoughts in the book, but overall I think it sort of panders to some who are looking for permission to be more selfish."
"When I started out reading this book, I sent a text to my friend and said, OMG, you have got to read this.  Once, I  got into it, I didn't know what to think or where to go with what I was reading.  I love the story of the two women falling in love and what they had to go through to get where they are now.  However, there were so many avenues in this book that I couldn't keep up.  There was the ""knowing"" which reminded me of The Shack and 50 shades as it was said over and over that I was over it.  There was the ex husband, there was her past, her future, Abby, the kids, religion, job and homes.  I just wanted to hear the story of who, what, where and how.  I didn't know if I was reading a religious book, a motivational book, a romance novel  or what.  I appreciate her story but it took me a long time to finish.  I kept picking it back up thinking that that big Oh Wow, would come.  It wasn't one of my favorite books.  Read Where the Crawdads Sing, Killers of the Flower Moon or the Nightingale and so many more."
"I was surprised to see the recommendations and good reviews on this book. It was not well written and lacked draw. I am similar to author in certain challenges and thought I‚Äôd really love this book. But it is frankly my least favorite book that I have read in a very long time.  I agree with one review that it is as if it was a personal journal without much depth, vivid character development or even empathetic draw. Just meh!"
"I went into this book excited because it was recommended to our book club. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype. The book read all over the place. I was expecting kind of a love story and pieces of Glennon's life since her relationship with Abby. Instead, I got bits and pieces of her life scattered all over as anecdotes in which she apparently always came out having the most perfect answers. Nobody in life is this perfect with their thought process and no one could remember verbatim such inspirational monologues that they apparently came off the cuff with years ago. nobody in the book club has finished the book, including myself although I have gotten the furthest. I forced myself to continue through it but have finally hit my wall with it."
"The physical book itself shipped fine and was in great condition ‚Äî no fault on the seller‚Äôs part. The words within the book, on the other hand, read like a rambling series of blog posts. Disjointed, full of self-praise, and no remarkable new ideas. A ‚Äúwoke‚Äù 40 year old feminist marveling at her newfound sense of meaning that most millennials probably figured out at age 16. Glad the author is happy with her life, but not glad I read this book."
Mmm. I wish I could say I loved it like her other 2 books. I think Love Warrior helped change my sister‚Äôs life. I am so so happy that she‚Äôs happy. (Truly) her and Abby seem like absolutely wonderful human beings. It‚Äôs not that. The writing just seems in-genuine. Maybe it‚Äôs me.
"First of all, to these haters saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt trust her authentic voice‚Äù because of Glennon‚Äôs WILLINGNESS to evolve and change her life in the last decade ‚Äî you need to sit down, drink some tea, and look at yourself.Untamed discusses how we, as women, are forced to be in a cage. It‚Äôs such an interesting time for this book to come out as we are all trapped in our homes ‚Äî and I think of we are willing, we can use this silence (or selah) in the pause of our lives to really let our choices sink in.I love the way Glennon‚Äôs voice has evolved. With every book she writes, her voice becomes more aligned to her core and you can FEEL this. I think anyone who has a problem with that is likely avoiding their own inner work and things they want to change about their lives.This book has made me laugh, weep, and breathe deeply ‚Äî it‚Äôs a friend.It‚Äôs definitely worth the read.If it‚Äôs challenging you, that‚Äôs a good thing ‚Äî it means it‚Äôs knocking on the cellar door of things you‚Äôd rather ignore or shove so deeply inside of yourself and pretend that they don‚Äôt exist ‚Äî and that‚Äôs kinda the point of this book. It‚Äôs a proclamation to stop living within expectations or a cage or a way of being we have been forced to. It‚Äôs being willing to make mistakes and disappoint others to be true to ourselves.You should read it, honestly."
"Glennon- I saw your wife Abby‚Äôs post to rally around you, as you have had a couple of disappointing, hard days.Therefore I am writing my first amazon review ever, because I felt inspired by her to flood your world with some good...and I do hope your are reading this.I love you both! Everything you both do for this world and all you stand for. And most of all I LOVE THIS BOOK. I started my love affair with love warrior.. and that book really made me look in the mirror on how I wanted to deal with my struggles in life, work through them, and nurture my faith.. With untamed I was scared to buy it because I knew your book would challenge me to dig deeper ask more of myself, and most scarily trust myself..which often comes with change and unlearning to care so much of what others think of you or how you should do things. When all the chaos leaves your life you are left to tap into the really good stuff which is both scary and good all at once. Your book is not only relatable but life changing, and challenging. Thank you for pushing us to be better versions of ourselves and putting all the thoughts in my head on a page. Keep them coming. I am here for it ! And my husband is too because I‚Äôm leaving this review under his amazon account :) - Leslie"
"After hearing all the fuss about this book, I had high expectations. But wow what a disappointment! Don‚Äôt get me wrong, some sentences were very moving, but most felt like she was trying WAY to hard to be poetic and inspirational by (over)using words to describe herself or other women like ‚Äúwild‚Äù ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù and ‚Äútruest‚Äù. As hard as she tried to be vulnerable and open, I can‚Äôt help but feel like she‚Äôs put herself on a pedestal (one made of BS)"
I‚Äôm confused. The first 40 or so pages had me interested and now I‚Äôm about 100 pages in and I‚Äôm wondering what am I reading? I got a bunch of different books from my hubs as a birthday gift and if my toddler didn‚Äôt Scribble all over the inside of this book already I most likely would‚Äôve quit reading it and returned it. I‚Äôm not sure what kind of inspiration she‚Äôs trying to inspire... I feel very uninspired. It seems to be just a book about how confused she was about her own self because that‚Äôs how she was raised by society and the social norms that she essentially she wants you to be you.... but in combination with meditations in which she calls ‚Äúthe knowing‚Äù. I‚Äôm going to keep reading a little longer but so far it‚Äôs a thumbs down.
"I‚Äôm halfway through Untamed, I‚Äôm pausing to write this review to slow down my consumption. I want to hand pick every wise word inked to plant into memory. I wish to rebuild my eyes with her vision. I have read everything Glennon has written, this is to-date her masterpiece. It‚Äôs witty, and enlightening; boldly brilliant and delightfully charming in the ways she is transparent and sage-like. Glennon is a bridge between the known and unknown, truth and mistruths, ownership and self denial. She has cracked open the rock we collectively live under. She walks us through the rubble of our programmed shrunken existence to the edge of a new becoming. Glennon opens with an analogy that breathes fire into the lies sewn into our skin since our first dawn. Cheetahs trained against their nature, losing the self is rewarded as we retreat to imposed limitations we consider good and necessary. Begging the questions, who am I and what have I forsaken? Each chapter feels like a clearing, an unraveling making room for universal truth. I see myself in nearly every story‚Äîthere‚Äôs a little grief that comes with knowing I have betrayed myself for a ‚Äúgreater good.‚Äù I will use my new eyes to end the cycle of betrayal the world trades for belonging. Glennon uses relatable, everyday stories on motherhood and relationships to press into the facade we float on in the shallow end of euphemisms that keep life comfortable. Her voice grants permission to find and trust your own."
"Read the chapter ""Islands.""  Then read it again, over and over, until it sinks in and you internalize how to protect your home from critical invaders.  From the onset regarding the metaphor about the cheetah, Glennon Doyle recognizes the internal struggle we all face in light of ""knowing thyself.""  This is a book for all people.  It's how to harness the best of what we possess while allowing others to find their best as well.  It's a book about becoming one's whole self, and it's a stop and reflect book about where she came from and where she is now.  I've highlighted many things on my Kindle, but none more important to me than, ""Being human is not hard because you're doing it wrong; it's hard because your doing it right.""  And until the rest of the world understands this, this too, is essential:  ""When women lose themselves, the world loses its way.  We do not need more selfless women.  What we need right now is more women who have detoxed themselves so completely from the world's expectations that they are full of nothing but themselves.""  Also, ""You're never going lose you.""  Breathtaking words on parenting we all need to help our children find.  The sentence that finishes with ""Only love in.  Only love out."" is so definitive that it tempers all of the noise others want to shout at and rattle you.  These phrases play over and also echo in my mind, but more so it gives me the language to use when trying to help others find themselves.  I wish my mother had lived her life instead of trying to give us what she thought should be ours, but only if using her rules to live by.  Took me 38 years to to declare my life; that's too long for anyone.  I totally relate to the struggles in the book.  That's why it's successful; it reaches and meets me where I am now.  Thanks for sharing."
"""When a woman finally learns that pleasing the world is impossible, she becomes free to learn how to please herself.""</i></b>This is a memoir by Glennon Doyle that talks about how she became liberated. She became less worried with pleasing the world and the expectations it had set for her and more concerned with pleasing herself. In this she became someone different. Someone who no longer spent time in relationships that did not fit her, or situations that did not enhance who she was. She talks about how she met her wife, Abby and how everything changed for her after that. We see the her process of ""becoming"". Becoming more of herself, becoming who she is meant to be, becoming a freer and happier version of herself.I think this memoir had a lot of really important messages and some of the things that were discussed in here were very profound. I felt, overall, very liberated reading this book. This book not only focused on her becoming a untamed women, but also in how her becoming more liberated and woke allowed her to become a stronger parent. She showed how the two roles flowed into each other and how she was able to give life lessons that helped in all areas of her life and had a positive affect on her loved ones.I think the thing I struggled with most in this is that I felt after the first 200 pages it got a bit repetitive. I felt we were reevaluating things that had already been discussed early on. While these messages are very important and valid, this book felt like it was longer than it should be. I found myself rushing through the last 130 pages because I didn't want to DNF it, I had hoped there was more to learn. And I did get a bit more out of it during those 130 pages. The book had a very strong start and I throughly enjoyed the messages that were depicted in this. Much of it was very eye opening and spiritually enlightening."
"I had two problems with this book. (1) Unlike the prior books, this one lacks a cohesive structure or the development of the theme she sets forth so brilliantly in the beginning of the book, so it all just kind of falls apart. Although the author says in interviews that this nontraditional structure is tied to the theme of the book, it doesn't work for me ... and I don't think it's because I'm not ready to be ""Untamed."" There are moving parts of the story -- the description of the love story with Abby especially. (2) I find Glennon thematically contradictory. On the one hand, people should not be put in ""glasses"" (categories) like homosexuality vs. heterosexuality, etc., because people are complicated and fluid. Yet a few pages later it is announced that there are 3 kinds of white supremacists (I guess complexity and defying categorization is reserved for ""good"" things like sexuality, or for ""good"" people who are already in a developed place, but that kind of oversimplification smacks of cancel culture and just unnerves me about Glennon's writing. It would be more helpful, and far harder, to write a book intended for dealing with everyone. The chapter on racism to me manages to say almost nothing useful because the author lacks confidence in her own understanding of this area and even remarks on her terror of being called a racist, but as I read her work she is prepared to categorize and condemn other people for their racism even if she admits to being racist due to systemic exposures. She says that family should enable us to speak our truths -- but the challenge these days is dealing with it when people say a truth that is not in line with our own political beliefs, and the message I get from Glennon seems to be that those people are to be held in contempt and not allowed on the ""island."" I find Glennon intolerant of those who are not as far along the path of tolerance and wisdom as she is -- it is always easier to shut folks out, but the challenge of our times is to find unity. In that respect I think this book is more about advocating a particular brand of socially compelled conformity rather than respecting people's limitations and realizing that not everyone may have the same life experiences or are not as far along the enlightened path. Loving and dealing with people is the challenge, and being ""untamed"" just isn't the answer to this problem."
"I am truly baffled that I saw so many people recommending this book on social media. Many claiming it was ‚Äúlife changing.‚Äù This felt very surface level. No depth. Nothing intrigued me or made me want to keep reading. Nothing that made me view things differently or make me feel more secure about who I am and what I offer the world. And isn‚Äôt that the point of this book? Sure, there‚Äôs a powerful quote here and there. But I could not finish this. Once it got political I gave up completely. It seemed to be a book written to capitalize on what is happening in the world, instead of offering insight to readers on how to live a better and more fulfilling life. Pass on this one. Or at least don‚Äôt buy it full price."
"I'm 1/3 of the way through, and I don't get the hype. Her rejection of parents teaching their children how to live in their society, to become reasonable and responsible adults, smacks of the failed ""permissive parenting"" of the 1950s (and no, Dr. Spock didn't promote permissiveism). Teaching our children with an attitude of love and compassion prepares them for adulthood. In addition, I find Untamed boring. Instead, I highly recommend Tara Brach's work, especially Radical Acceptance and True Refuge. Another excellent work that helps women understand themselves is Women Who Run with the Wolves."
"I was born and raised in the Mormon/LDS religion. In my late 20‚Äôs after serving a mission, marrying, having children and raising them in the church I realized I don‚Äôt  believe the church is true. I had some very dark and hard days/years. Even though you know you‚Äôre making the right choice your whole foundation, everything (and everyone) you know is ripped out from under you. I felt lost and still caught myself letting that church indoctrinated guilt and doubt creep in. This book brought the peace and healing I‚Äôd been seeking in this uncharted territory. It gave me the confidence I‚Äôd been seeking.  This book empowered me, spiritually grounded me, and got me focused and enabled me to truly start charting my new spiritual path. This book is beautiful and so very powerful."
"I highly recommend this book to all women and bought copies for my sisters. Yes, this is a book about one woman's experiences, but so much of what she wrote will ring true to many women. I personally found myself crying in the very first chapter as I felt my own upbringing and struggles with body image mirrored in what Glennon writes about herself. It is very raw.In this book, Glennon revises a lot of her previous stances on things -- she takes a hard look at herself, her upbringing and the women in her life, and has the bravery to admit she was wrong (about herself, about some of her beliefs) and that she's still learning. Though I haven't seen it described this way elsewhere, I would say this book is a memoir about one woman's feminist awakening. She is looking back and assessing her life--picking up the many threads of trauma and shame and tracing them back to their common origin--internalized misogyny.Yes, it's sometimes a love story about meeting Abby and realizing that her marriage to a man was never really the life-affirming, joyous love she was meant for, but it's also about her struggles in rearing young girls and her son in this complex world where men and women are forced to play gender roles that keep them locked in cages. It's about her own suffering with eating disorders and her struggles with faith traditions that are too small for the bigness of God. The chapter that really punched me right in the gut (as a white woman of privilege), was the one about racism. Glennon does not hold back--she forces us to think about the many, many ways we have put ourselves and other women in cages of expectation. I found myself inspired to think harder about enacting personal change and using my voice to ask harder questions and hold other struggling women up in sisterhood. Of course, because privileged women are often key-holders in the cage-system of misogyny, it also means standing up to other women who revel in keeping us all small. A wonderful companion piece to this is Abby Wambach's own book on strengthening women in leadership: ""Wolfpack.""Glennon, in case you're reading this -- thank you for your honesty. I felt often as I was reading that you had opened up a vein on the page. At times I was anxious for you (like the way I feel for actors or dancers who are about to perform and put their whole self on the stage for us to see and criticize). The rage and pain and anger and disappointment in yourself forced me to consider these feelings in my own soul.  I will reread this and be in thoughtful contemplation for many weeks. With thanks -- Laura"
"I'm inhaling this book. I was so disappointed that Glennon's book tour was cancelled (thankfully to be rescheduled). I knew it was coming, but still a bummer. So, I decided to buy another copy of the book on Amazon. And, it's the perfect read for right now.Since I'll get another copy at the event, I'm dog-earing pages like crazy for everything that resonates. And, I'm SO excited because these words are so relevant for the group of 9th-grade Girl Scouts who I've been leading for the last 10 years. Current and past scouts are all experiencing varying levels of anxiety, uncertainty, insecurity, and I have been feeling so helpless to show them how amazing they are... How to help them... What to say... But Glennon's words are showing me the way. As soon as I'm done reading Untamed, I'm going to read it out loud with my daughter. Then, I'm going to figure out how to get it to my other 9 scouts, because they all need to soak in this story.Buy this book. Read this book. Then share the wisdom with every single female in your life!"
"The author has no talent. Furthermore, she‚Äôs a victim. But that‚Äôs what bad writers do. It‚Äôs the only way they can garner attention. Written on a sixth grade level. Probably just to make money. It‚Äôs really just an expanded magazine article. One of those light silly stories that you read in an hour and forget. Don‚Äôt waste your time or money."
"Why is it not possible to give zero stars or minus stars?  I suffered thru this brick only because it was a book club selection. Not the fault of the host - I see somehow this has made it onto the best seller list.  We fairly unanimously felt we had wasted whatever time we put into this unfortunate saga.  This is some sad version of ‚Äúeat pray, love‚Äù or that one about some women walking the Pacific Crest trail, but without the benefit of travelogue interest. This is a rant of a totally self absorbed bore.  Don‚Äôt waste your time"
"In the first chapters of the book the author mentions that she wasn‚Äôt happy with her previous book, Love Warrior, from the moment she handed the manuscript. It makes me doubt tremendously about this new book too. We have every right to change our minds and evolved, but I just can‚Äôt feel connected anymore. Didn‚Äôt enjoy it."
"I don't get what all the hype is about. I was so excited to get a book that might help me ""fix"" my messed up 65 year old life. That I could learn to live it the way I want before it's over. I read it and feel like I am going around in circles. It jumps from one thing to another. It talks about motherhood so much and I am not a mother. My baby was stillborn 45 years ago, so I never knew him or what it's like to be a mother. I thought it would be more about her relationship with Amy. Nothing except she fell in love with her the minute she saw her. I keep reading and I have to go back and read thing over and still don't get it. I can relate to not being the real me after going to school and having to follow all of the rules and not being able to be myself. I have felt like I can't be myself  for years and I thought this book would help me with this. I just don't get it and I am not stupid! Maybe I should get the Audio book and listen to it. I don't know if I want to waste my time! I think I will start reading from the beginning again after I let it go for a while. If I don't get in to it then, I will just give up. I payed full price for the damn thing and I usually never pay full price for books and I am on a fixed income now. That's that!"
"Glennon, thank you üß° thank you for acknowledging that beliefs - like people - change. And that something you wrote previously may no longer be relevant for you life, belief system NOW but it was true for you THEN. I hope people understand that what this book represents is that we are evolving humans and change is certain. Whether or not we admit that, and make ourselves vulnerable to the critics, or not, is what‚Äôs not certain. I am so thankful for your honesty and that you choose to do the HARD thing of sharing your struggles and your evolution with all of us.You have been given the spiritual gifts of Teaching and Giving and you USE them! That is a life well lived! I read your book in 2 days- while adapting to our new normal of homeschooling a 2.5 and 5 year old while now working from home and it brought me such JOY and encouragement and the reminder that YES can do hard things.And my hard things right now are so not hard compared to those I work for, families with medically fragile kids who are scared to literal death of what the pandemic means for their babies. You give perspective and you bring levity and you are so awesome! I‚Äôm obsessed (and rambling).Abby- thank you for loving Glennon so well. And Glennon, thank you for loving Abby so well. I love your love and all thankful you shared it with all of us."
"I didn't start to love this book until I got to the last few chapters which give us some anecdotes about Glennon Doyle's and Abby Wambach's marriage and the three children they are raising together. This is where I felt truly at home. I'm very interested in family interactions. Most of the stories are positive and give the impression of a healthy and happy family. I found myself amazed that Glennon and Abby and her ex-husband and his new girlfriend and the children seemed to blend together well.Almost all of the first half of the book was boring for me, and I had to force my way through it. I found it too pie in the sky. Glennon Doyle longs for everything to be beautiful--herself, her family, and the entire world. She has a very idealistic view of life. I wondered if I should compare what she wrote in these chapters to an episode on the TV program Frasier. I was thinking that this would be mean. But I have to be honest. Frasier falls for a beautiful, sweet, shapely woman who writes inspirational best sellers. But he finds her books to be filled with platitudes. His short-lived romance doesn't end well. I felt as though I were reading one greeting card after another in a way. So much information about becoming one's authentic, true self. Too much for me! ""Will we be brave enough to unlock ourselves?"" ""Will we be brave enough to set ourselves free?""I'm a 74-year-old widow with an empty nest. I'm free. But I'm wondering what all this liberation talk does for women who may not be abused or cheated on, but may not always feel completely happy with marriage and family life. Are we all really supposed to leave a situation simply because it's not always completely fulfilling? This book is a combination memoir/advice manual. It's as though she's saying, ""I divorced my husband and am now married to a woman, the love of my life--maybe you can do it too!"" Okay, maybe not quite. I have to admit that a letter she received puzzled me a bit. A woman wrote that she loved Glennon's advice to be true to yourself (I'm paraphrasing) and that she was glad to report that she had the courage to leave her husband. She was now living with her two children in her mother's home. Now if this woman was being abused or cheated on, this would be a good thing. But there were no details.Even if authors have revealed things about their lives in previous memoirs, they often have to do this again in a new memoir for the sake of the people who haven't read the previous ones. I remember reading about Glennon's bulimia and alcoholism in one of her other books. This could be tedious for some people who have read her other books. Actually it was fairly interesting for me since her stories provided some much needed drama when there are so many pages where absolutely nothing is happening--when she's writing about the importance of getting the true self to emerge. I hadn't remembered that her bulimia began at age 10 so this was both shocking and interesting to me.The second portion of the book was also tedious for me. This section is on global responsibility. She writes about the charitable organization she heads up--Together Rising, what she is doing to combat racism, and her beliefs about the ways we fail to raise both boys and girls properly. I've been around for a while. I grew up in the fifties and sixties when the civil rights and women's rights groups were just beginning. I've heard it all. There was one part of the book that made me angry. I was yelling at the book. She'd been accused on social media of being phony--that she hadn't really admitted that she had vestiges of racism in her due to growing up in a racist society. She should be admitting this and actively purging herself of every trace of racism. I thought--here is a person who is trying her best to understand, and she's vilified. I don't think I would have gone back to the group of activists who criticized her, but she is more determined than ever to measure up to the ideals.Now one of the reasons this strikes me as particularly ironic is that she is sick to death of evangelical Christianity and their rules, rules, rules. She still clings to Christianity because she loves the fact that Jesus defended the disadvantaged and downtrodden. But the Bible and preachers who are obsessed with the letter of the law make her sick. I understand (I'm no longer a Christian). But it seems that she has replaced this with a letter of the law attitude in regard to racism. She's determined to do better. Determined to examine herself and find those vestiges of racism which exist and purge them. Where is the fairness here? Did she ask the Black people if they had any vestiges of racism in regard to the White community? She can be so intense!I found myself feeling almost sorry for her--she's so busy writing her books, working for justice, dealing with a new marriage, and raising three children. Some of the things she has done are truly inspiring--the rescue efforts she has been involved in with the illegal immigrants' children who were separated from their parents is amazing, and I'll admit that I wasn't even aware that there was a grass roots organization doing such work. Good for them!As I said, I love the last few chapters of the book where we can read more about her family life, and her wife Abby finally comes alive in these chapters. Up until this part, the reader is left to wonder what Abby is like other than very tall! There aren't that many family stories, and some of them revolve around sports. I found myself cherishing the few personal things she wrote. There's a nice paragraph about sex beginning with ""I love sex with Abby."" Nothing explicit which is understandable. Discretion is a good thing. But I could feel the joy when I read that paragraph.Some of the reviewers have said that her children are almost too good, and I agree. But it wouldn't be right to air dirty laundry, either.This book started out one star in my opinion and worked its way up to three and a half stars maybe. There were both nuggets and platitudes and quite a bit of repetition."
Please be aware...this book is not at all what I thought it was going to be. I hoped it was a book to empower and encourage women but it was mostly just about her trying to push her political views and agendas. I didn‚Äôt even finish it. Super disappointed!
The point is to trust your own inner voice/gut. No need to read hers.
"So apparently I have been living under a rock, because until I saw a pic of this book on Reese‚Äôs Book Club Instagram I had never heard of Glennon Doyle. Within a day or so of me seeing this book and being slightly intrigued, a friend of mine mentioned that she had been listening to it on Audible and that I HAD to get going on reading it. I took her advice and purchased the book (like all of my Non-Fiction reads I get an actual book so I can highlight and mark it up). In all honesty, it took me a bit to get into this book. It‚Äôs actually a collection of essays and it bounces back and forth in time. It was quickly clear to me that not having any idea who Glennon Doyle was or her New York Times bestselling book ‚ÄúLove Warrior‚Äùmade me the odd one out. Thankfully Doyle was prepared for this and went over her backstory early enough in the book that I could approach the rest of it with a TRUE understanding of what a warrior she is. This book is all about learning to turn inward to learn who you ARE and who you want to become. Doyle emphasizes over and over that we must relearn all the things we have been taught by others about who we are and who we must become. The message I took away from this was that we need to be willing to fight for ourselves and our vision of the future, and not listen to what we have been told we SHOULD be."
"Sooo many people recommended this book to me, and I'm sad to say that it was entirely underwhelming. I was expecting a memoir and instead recieved a book full of preachy, wanna-be-prophetic, live-laugh-love nonsense.This book tries to be both, a memoir and a self-help title, and it fails miserably at both."
"You might not agree with her politics, or the ways in which she chooses to live her life...and that is okay. You need to read this book anyway. I have not been slapped upside the face by a book like this since I read ""Simple Abundance"" by Sarah Ban Breathnach in high school. I am dating myself. But I revisit that book yearly. I never thought I would find another book like that...until I read ""Untamed.""Regardless of the very strong connections I felt with Glennon's past, as it reflected my own past, I know that every woman can find something in this book- which reads like a series of essays- that they will sit with and just...be gobsmacked. She really does have this incredible way of expressing womanhood...in all it's beauty and pain. This is one of those books that you just wanna hug to your chest, and thank whatever God you choose to believe in that they create people to have these kind of connections to one another. I just...felt grateful, after finishing it. Less alone, if that makes sense. In these crazy times- it's an amazing, grounding feeling to feel less alone.And for those of you that are already fans- which I honestly had never heard of her until I read this book, so my view on her life changes could be different from yours- you might be feeling a little bit betrayed by this latest work. Definitely seeing some salty comments here. All I can say is- ok. You're feeling some kind of way right now?  Put it back on the shelf and walk away. Let the things she's written about sink in for a while. Don't give up on this book. Give yourself some time to reflect on your feelings of betrayal and hurt. She said it best- that judgmental feeling you're feeling isn't there to tell her shit. She's good. It's there to tell YOU something. Take a deeper look.AMAZING. Going to end up buying copies for pretty much every woman I know."
"This book is extraordinary - so real, raw, brave, vulnerable, inspiring, and important.  Glennon Doyle is such an incredible writer and she's one of the most important voices of our time.  I hope EVERYONE on the planet reads this book.  Thank you Glennon!"
"This book wasn‚Äôt the mind blowing, life changing read that many celebrities (friends of the author?) said it was. Glennon‚Äôs stories were all over the place, and I found her more annoying than inspiring. There were a few moments where I smiled, and one moment in particular that made me tear up briefly but mostly due to relating one woman‚Äôs attitude towards herself to something I‚Äôve experienced personally. I finished the book, but just felt underwhelmed and not inspired after it was over. I felt her ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a GD cheetah!!!‚Äù mantra was forced and corny, created for middle aged women to post on their Instagram or put on a tshirt. It‚Äôs doubtful that I will read another one of her books."
"Divorce messes up kids.  Running immediately into another relationship really messes up kids.  No wonder Tish was afraid she would lose her mother.You can‚Äôt go and do as you please.  As a mother, consider the kids!"
I was really excited to read this book but I just couldn‚Äôt get into it. I couldn‚Äôt even finish it. Glennon shares her story of leaving her husband and falling in love with a women. Seemed to push that as a view of being untamed. I loved ‚ÄúLove Warrior‚Äù and would highly recommend that.
"I like reading, but this is one of the first books I ever started reading and couldn't bring myself to finish. It's overly preachy - as in the author talking about ""god"" throughout. It's disjointed, jumping all over the place. And the author has inundated this book with arrogant edicts about how to live a fulfilling life and ""really get yourself"", and blah blah blah. I just thought the whole thing was absolute garbage."
"I read a lot of self development/self help and spiritual books and typically love mostly all of the books I read, but this book was straight up awful. Plan and simple. I usually always find myself wanting to continually read a book when it is really good and I have THE hardest time convincing myself to pick this book up and read it. I prolong it as long as possible. I'm currently doing the 75hard challenge and HAVE to finish this book. But let me tell you, these workouts and everything I have to do for 75 hard doesn't even compare to how awful pushing through this book is. If I wasn't already on day 45 of 75 I would've failed and started over on purpose so I didn't have to finish this book. That's how bad it is. She started out so strong too, then.. the leftist brainwashing begun being shoved down my throat and I can't take it anymore. This book is absolutely a left leaning indoctrination hidden behind ""spirituality."" There is not one truly spiritual thing in this book besides she mentioned meditating in her closet for 10 minutes a day. Please. The second she said there is no such thing as ""femininity"" and ""masculinity"" was enough for me. If you're truly spiritual you know that duality is the basis of all things. Yin and yang. Light and dark. Feminine and masculine. Spring and fall. The sun and moon. Everything is made up of duality or we would not be here. I have absolutely no idea why this is even in the category of Amazon's spiritual books, let alone why it's in their top right now. I'd give it a -1/10 if I could. Respectfully, do not waste your money."
"What started out as a fabulous read quickly (after about 40ish pages) turned into a huge disappointment.There's one part where she blames not getting the memo so her children ""suck"". Her words. She actually says her children suck!! Ummm what??!! Yet somehow it isn't her fault because she didn't get the memo on how to raise them??!!I can't STAND ish like this. She even says she shoved an iPad at the last one and let that raise her and it somehow made her daughter a better and stronger person...but says her kids suck??!!I raised 4 children ON MY OWN. No father. No family. No friends. I had absolutely NO CLUE what I was doing most of the time but my children are wonderful, beautiful people. I made mistakes, plenty of them, but I spent time with my kids, quality time, and showered them with all the love and discipline they needed.I don't discount what she says she went through. I was just utterly confused as to what she was trying to get across through all the lecturing of how she apparently has life figured out and knows much better than we do. Hmmmm...ok then."
"There‚Äôs some magic at the beginning, and I felt inspired to recommend this book to my friends early on. Then it took a turn. A big turn, becoming largely a parenting book. Or else a book for a much older generation than mine (gen x) or for women who seriously have never done anything independent ever. I‚Äôm not quite sure who it‚Äôs for, really. But don‚Äôt think the author had as much to say about becoming untamed as she thought. A shame. I regret recommending this. I fell for the hype around this book for sure. But I will say, good for the author for finding her true love. Yay!"
Some pages feel like they were written from on top of her soap box and some pages feel like I am reading genuine emotion and thoughts not just pandering. There was not enough genuine chapters. Too many sentences that I could guess how they end.  I would recommend you borrow this book from your friend or buying it used.
This book is amazing!!!
"On a scale of cotton candy to Brussels sprouts, Untamed by Glennon Doyle is cookie dough truffle. Crunch through the exterior layer of chocolate to an ooey-gooey center of a chocolate chip cookie dough. Whether you savor or rush through, each bite is eye-popping deliciousness, made with love.With every page, Untamed asks the question: what would it be like to trust yourself? Glennon Doyle unfurls her life lessons across the pages of this book with honesty and feeling, both encouraging and challenging readers to explore the discomfort, triggers, and addictions in their own lives. Her book back cover copy says it so well, ""Glennon decided to quit abandoning herself and to instead abandon the world‚Äôs expectations of her. She quit being good so she could be free. She quit pleasing and started living.""Untamed feels like a book for these times, at least to me. A friend sent me a quote from the pages of the book, and it resonated so deeply that I found myself doing something I rarely do -- immediately purchasing the book for Kindle because I had to read it NOW. Friends, I have more highlights in this book than all my books collected together. Glennon Doyle asks what would happen if we allowed ourselves to feel the pain in the world, and she asks what would happen if we stopped living our lives by other's expectations. It's both painful and freeing. As I neared the end, I found myself dragging my feet, not wanting to be done. I read one chapter at a time, savoring the new perspectives, the honesty, the call to live my life my way unapologetically. And for the first time, in a long time, I felt hope.If you're asking for more, if you're questioning the world around you, if you're deconstructing your religious views, Untamed is for you."
I bought this book because I loved Glennon's other two books! This book was one of the worst I had read in forever! I was extremely sad and disheartened by reading this book.  She wrote about her husbands affair but glosses over the fact that she had an affair with Abby Wambach.  She wrote that basically it was ok that she did this because she fell in love.
"I wanted to hate this book. I wanted to reject these ideas so broadly accepted because obviously I‚Äôm a special snowflake and I‚Äôm introspective and aware. All that thinking made sure I could find solutions and understand what happens to me even if I didn‚Äôt know how to solve it. I wanted to be above this book.It was recommended to me, which both reinforced my desire to hate it and doubled down on my commitment to read it. I hate being told what to do, but I hate being disappointed more.And as I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve already surmised, I did not hate this book. I think maybe it hated me a few chapters in.I learned lessons. Ones I‚Äôve avoided even though I saw them. I read thoughts and lines that made me bristle because I couldn‚Äôt believe she was bold enough to write the thinks I think and protect fiercely. She taught me I wasn‚Äôt bristling from something healthy, I was bristling from envy.There are more passages highlighted in this book than any other. It‚Äôs the shortest word count novel I‚Äôve read in the last 5 months, yet it took me the full five months to read it because I couldn‚Äôt handle more than a couple brief chapters before I would need a few days (or weeks, or once, over a month) to process what I‚Äôd read.I didn‚Äôt hate this book.I needed this book.I need to learn to know and stop assuming I know for others when I can‚Äôt even know for me.This book is an ordinary kind of magic. Stripped and raw and already there. But it doesn‚Äôt let you look away.Be brave and wild and afraid, it tells me, and that‚Äôs how you‚Äôll get free.I want to be free. And I‚Äôm already afraid. So why not now?"
"If I was younger I might have found this book inspirational‚Äîlife changing even.  However, being older and having been through good times and bad, it more or less confirms what I‚Äôve already figured out about myself and about life. However, if you‚Äôre struggling or not quite sure then this book could give you some clues about how to move forward and move on to become your best, or a better self."
"I bought this book because my sister looks up to the author and I wanted to find out what her appeal is. I was hoping to read a book written by an intelligent, strong-minded and principled woman with ideas that would challenge me and make me think... but instead all I discovered was a rambling, incoherent diatribe of boring and totally predictable half-arguments loosely smashed together with the finesse of an angry toddler.Glennon reveals herself in this book to be a deranged, attention-seeking narcissistic psychopath who is so bereft of self-awareness and humility that she isn't even able to see the glaring contradictions and hypocrisies in her own half-baked non-arguments. She seems to believe that her vapid and self-obsessed pseudo-philosophy makes her ""free"", ""wild"" and ""interesting""..... No, it just makes you look like a moron... and a psychopath.Rather than being a book with a coherent story and narrative, Untamed reads like a collection of rejected articles written by an intern at Teen Vogue. It's extremely concerning that this woman is considered in any way some kind of 'role model' for young women, especially when there are so many strong-minded and intelligent women in the culture that actually do have something inspiring and coherent to say."
"I bought this after listening to Brene Brown's podcast featuring Glennon. It came highly recommended from her, and I've read and loved all of her stuff, so I gave it a shot. I sold it before I finished it. I made it about 1/3 of the way through.I was really hoping for more of the story about her relationships, but it was cluttered with cliches and was just disorganized. There were a few insightful parts, but they were the segments that Brene Brown had already read on the podcast episode, so I was disappointed when the rest fell short.I decided to stop reading when I saw another review that mentioned how she completely took back what she wrote in Love Warrior. I didn't read that one, but I can definitely see how she could recant all of this book in the next few years as well.If you've already read Brene Brown, this book will feel like cheap cliches."
"This book came highly recommended and it just wasn't for me. The repressed Catholic girl who grows up to fight tradition is a dusty and tired storyline. For those who might relate, the writing is decent. Just wasn't my cup of tea."
I wanted to love it. I got some great quotes out of this book but I just found myself eye-rolling so much when she would go on her band wagon about this poetic and deep discussions she would have with her children. This book is not for everyone but I do know a good many people who loved it.
"I was going to give 5 stars. But I loved her book so much and I read her early book ‚Äúlove warrior‚Äù. In it, she said one of her writer friends was doing ‚Äúfine‚Äù but no divorce, not crisis, so she had nothing to write about.That made me suddenly realize how cruel she was at trashing her husband. It doesn‚Äôt make me feel that she was hurt by her husband‚Äôs sexual affair, which may be because he didn‚Äôt know how to deal with her homosexuality (which I have no problem), but she was excited about writing it in more than one books.Good writing, but for some reason, I sensed a low level of character that is hard to describe. Very disappointed."
"Glennon came across as down to earth, which I liked.  She made some great points about women needing to stop always apologizing and learn to be more assertive, which made a lot of sense.  On the negative side, she had a tendency to come across as preachy and self-righteous at times and too political.  Chapters also started to sound repetitive after a while and some of her writing was difficult to understand."
"I‚Äôm happy to see as many 5 Star reviews as there are here (as I came to leave one myself). Untamed is an absolute masterpiece, giving voice to so many of us who have lived and breathed on this earth as complicated, brave, loving women. As a mother, a daughter, and a human... I feel better for having read these words.Any criticism of her authorial voice or her perspectives changing from her previous books is fine.. I get it. It‚Äôs not comfortable to have things change when you want them to be familiar and static forever. But this is a human being living her life and growing and constantly LEARNING (which is such an important thread of Untamed). It‚Äôs completely unreasonable to expect her to crank out the same content years and years later. I think she addressed her growth beautifully in the book and more power to her for coming out stronger and more authentically than ever.This book will move you. It will make you want to do and be better.Glennon, thank you for that. üíõ"
"This book makes you consider and think. So much is in the and as it is a memoir or autobiography or what have you there are is or personal beliefs and values within this book. This beliefs may not be mine and they may not be yours but it sales you to consider this other thoughts. I like three chapters or this book enough that they left an interesting impression in me.Memos, Poems, and Boys are chapters that really made me think and consider. They have me still thinking and wondering more I can work in me and my Knowing of this chapters. How can I help myself and the world. I'm not a patent but I an an aunt. I an going to keep working in myself.The three stars are because of language, lots of strong politics that while she is passionate about it didn't hit a cord with me, and just overall not may the of book. Would not discourage others from reading, but but may recommendation. I read it for a book club."
"Vulgar, and really inappropriate. The author has no boundaries. Its nice to live by ones own standards and not the worlds expectations, but it doesnt seem she has any sense of right and wrong."
"During the past several months, four of my female clients read ""Untamed"" and highly recommended it to me. As their therapist, It is important to me to connect with books which not only resonate with my clients but which also advance their wellbeing. After reading ""Untamed,"" my clients shared their feelings with me: ""I'm not alone. I always felt that something was wrong with me...I felt I didn't fit into what was expected of me... and I felt  it was my fault. It feels so good to know that Glennon felt that way too...and she changed herself and her life.""Because I had  time this last weekend, I ordered the book and couldn't put it down. As I work to help my clients step out of their ""cages"" - whether they find themselves in abusive relationships, or believing their self-shaming life messages, or contorting themselves to fit into what our culture, society, and social norms tell them to be- I found Glennon's messages to be a powerful force of encouragement, validation, and affirmation.  Women need to know they are not alone - that others suffer too and that others ""do hard things"" to change their lives.Thank you, Glennon, for this beautiful, inspirational, and deeply needed book.Holli Kenley, MA, LMFT and author ""Daughters Betrayed By Their Mothers: Moving From Brokenness To Wholeness"" and ""Breaking Through Betrayal: And Recovering The Peace Within"""
"The positive reviews on this book are surprising.  I purchased it on a grand recommendation. I read through the first 29 pages and that was all I could take. Ugh! I cannot relate to this person at all.  The book is boring, the author is boring, and it was a total waste of money.  I'd like to return it but I don't think I can since it's been partially read so I dropped it in the recycle bin.  It's not even worth donating, seriously."
"Listen, I like Glennon Doyle. I found her first memoir to be incredibly inspiring and motivating. However, this one reads like any other ""my life was a wreck; I tapped into my inner Knowing; now I am writing about it"" book. If you haven't previously read many of these (like I have), then you'll likely get something fantastic and magical out of it. But if you're like me and have previously consumed many-a self-empowerment books, then it's (to me) nothing new. But that's only MY perspective, so take it as you will."
"I don‚Äôt think I could dislike this book any more than I do. It‚Äôs disjointed, preachy and totally unrelatable. Why am I supposed to care about this author? I took away nothing that could help me achieve my best self. The only thing I took away was that she thinks she‚Äôs awfully important."
"I was disappointed with this book. Filled with white entitlement and preachiness. I‚Äôm all about finding true happiness, but to me it includes  compromise and gratitude. Her advice is egocentric. As an Asian-American who grew up with humility and self-sacrifice, her writing didn‚Äôt resonate with me."
This book is not at all what I expected. It feels like a recap of her midlife crisis or rebellion more than any other life experience that would be interesting or helpful to anyone else.
"With all the reviews, I really wanted to like it! Wanted it to be life changing! It was boring and repeating. I was waiting for it to get better and now on page 77...I‚Äôm not going to finish! Sorry to my bookclub gals but I will not be tamed! I choose to not continue something that is not giving me purpose!"
"Even though I knew better,I believed all the hype and the celebrity endorsements....waste of time and money...guess I'm not enlightened enough."
"I had this book on my desk in our home office (doubles as a workout room!) since it was delivered on March 10th and walked by it daily, waiting for the opportunity to set aside time to start it. Each day since the 10th I‚Äôd walk by and think to myself, ‚ÄúNope no time today.‚Äù Last Saturday morning, my sister called me (we live 1,000 miles apart) and I answered in my usual happy ‚ÄúGood morning!!‚Äù, in which she replied with a loud sob stating her marriage was ending. She had found (let‚Äôs just keep it PG) extremely inappropriate messages, pictures and videos between her husband and another woman. In my life, I‚Äôve never heard a wail/sob come out of my sister like that morning. After attempting to talk her thru it, I asked her to call our mother who lives near her to go over to help with the kids so when he got home she could calmly ask him to leave. I hung up the phone, looked at my wife and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to go‚Äù, took a shower, packed a backpack and flew 1,000 miles to be by my sisters side as she herself changed forever. I‚Äôm not writing this review to talk about what an amazing sister I am. I‚Äôm writing this review to say that in that backpack, along with one change of clothes and a few toiletries, I had stuffed Untamed. I opened that book on the plane to my sisters side and instantly knew I had waited to open it until the exact right moment in my life. I cried on the plane. I cried with her when I first walked thru the door and hugged my sister. After helping with the kids and having many late night conversations, I had bought her a copy of the book and wrote inside, ‚ÄúYou are never alone. WE can do hard things. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äú and left it on her nightstand as I walked out the door to fly back home. I only wish I‚Äôd added, ‚ÄúBe the cheetah‚Äù to what i‚Äôd written.This book came into me and my sisters life at thee most perfect moment. Thank you G. Thank you."
"Glennon, your words reach spots that you couldn‚Äôt have imagined. See. I‚Äôm reading Untamed, although ‚Äúreading‚Äù seems an insufficient term. Consuming, inhaling....and tonight I read this paragraph. I know you meant it for the mothers who bend over backwards for their own children, forgetting to look at the other children they aren‚Äôt responsible for. Here‚Äôs the thing. Tonight is 4 years since I woke up, at 32, on a hospital bed and a nurse said to me...‚Äùthey had to take it all.‚Äù An emergency hysterectomy. I would never birth my own children. But I have spent every possible moment since I my first babysitting job at 13, trying to make all of the kids warm. As a teacher, a street outreach worker with homeless youth, and now a trauma therapist working with adolescents. These words. On this day. Make it just a little bit warmer for me as well. Thank you. So much."
"Hmmm, how do I feel about this book? I would say the answer to that question is torn. I enjoyed the first 100 pages or so. There were lots of thought provoking stories that felt very empowering. But then a little over halfway through it takes a sharp turn. From that point on the chapters are very short and choppy, more like underdeveloped thoughts about every controversial social issue you can imagine. At times I was forced to skim it and move on due to the cringeworthy content. That said, there is some really good content in this book but overall I would say it‚Äôs kind of like going to a thrift store...you have to sort through a lot of junk to get to the good stuffü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"This is new age garbage. My therapist recommended this to me. New faith huh glennon? If you‚Äôre going to have faith there is one faith, and that is through Jesus in the heavens. We are not God. We are made in the image of God but we humble ourselves before Him. You are in danger and endangering. THE SECOND COMING OF THE NEW AGE. THE INNER GOD DECEPTION IS REAL. THE CABALL AND GLENNON GOT YOU."
"Ok, so you know how Kindle allows you to highlight passages?  I am a very avid reader and never actually had the urge or felt the need to highlight before.  Thus far, I‚Äôve felt the need to ESSENTIALLY HIGHLIGHT EVERYTHING I‚ÄôVE READ.  What the heck, Glennon.  I feel like you WROTE THIS BOOK FOR ME except I know you didn‚Äôt.  I pretty much started crying in chapter 1 and have kept crying as I read because I‚Äôm so moved and I am NOT a crier.  I was almost afraid to read this book because I felt like it was going to motivate me to make uncomfortable changes; I was right.  I‚Äôve given to Together Rising and follow Glennon on social media but this is the first of her books I‚Äôve read.  I was previously put off a little by the ‚ÄúChristian mommy‚Äù thing; please don‚Äôt let that stop anyone.  She is warm and smart and tough and not smug, not doing the #BLESSED thing.  She is relatable and lovely and loving.  You should buy this book and read it twice."
"I really wanted to love this book. I checked out ratings and I‚Äôve heard other women raving about it. I found it a little political for my liking. I understand it‚Äôs HER book about HER life but I felt like she was guilting the reader to agree with her beliefs. Just my personal feeling. I couldn‚Äôt even finish it.But there are quite a few inspirational parts in the first 2/3 that I made it through. So for those who share her beliefs this would be a really good read. For those who don‚Äôt or aren‚Äôt as strongly opinionated as her, you might feel uncomfortable as I did."
"This book had me feeling so much. Fury. Righteous indignation. Peace. Love. Forgiveness. Joy. So many feelings. An unapologetic and fiercely vulnerable account of the recreation and reclamation of the author's life, Untamed invites us all to ask... what do we really, really want and what the heck is stopping us from claiming it? I was inspired and fired by the time I finished this book. Most of all, I am in awe of Glennon's honesty, all the while knowing she'll change, evolve or see things differently by the time she writes her next book, but never shying away from saying what's true now.¬†So, so brave."
"This book is one that every human needs to read. I cried the whole way through. I felt my heart swell, and break, and grow over and again. It was as though almost every word she wrote was pulled directly from the deepest part of me, and likely the deepest part of all women. Glennon creates space for ALL women to be seen in this magnificent creation she has given us.To those giving this book a 1 star review saying that it pushes her agenda or that she has changed so we shouldn‚Äôt believe what she says: it‚Äôs these hearts that need this book more than anyone. Open these pages with an open mind and stay there throughout. The beauty of life is that we are always changing (and we should be as our needs and expectations change) and Glennon is sure to remind you of this at every turn. We are allowed to change our minds at a moment‚Äôs notice! We are allowed to change EVERYTHING because it‚Äôs our one life.This book has provided a new perspective in my life, for which I am so grateful. I will continue to sing it‚Äôs praises and I urge you to read it."
"As a gay kid growing up in the south, raised in a southern baptist church, this book shook me to the core. I never have considered how these things have shaped me, shamed me, made me a lot of things I swear I‚Äôm not. The introspection this book requires is transformational in a way that connects you, makes you feel it, and gives you the way to apply it. Reading what Glennon wrote about Abby‚Äôs connection to religion hit me like a punch to the gut because it‚Äôs how I feel, something I could never explain, and it made me feel less alone. My sister is an addict. I have bipolar disorder. This book touches on all of that and more. It‚Äôs brilliant and honest and hard to read sometimes because it calls you out for things you refuse to acknowledge. In this book, every single woman can find something brilliant and transformational. Glennon wrote this about herself, but it‚Äôs for the women, all women. I‚Äôll read it again and again."
"This is, hands down, the best book I have ever read. Every woman should read it, memorize it, and live by it. It's *truly* that amazing. I just finished it and I am going to start over. Glennon Doyle's writing style is so poetic and beautiful. I read on someone's review that it's ""made to be turned into Instagram quotes, but doesn't make sense"" .... That's 1000% false. If you have the patience, literacy, and willingness to understand the messages she is trying to convey, the words will hit you to the core and you will be better for it. This is the first book I have read for pleasure AND finished in over a decade. I wish I could give it 100 golden stars."
"This book is a big fat bore. The writing is lazy, sort of stream of consciousness, and gives you no direction, elicits no anticipation. If I could ask for a refund I would. I can‚Äôt believe it gets recommended by so many people. The author is not insightful, not entertaining, not funny, insincere, and seems to have no real reason to be writing this book and has no credibility whatsoever. ‚ÄòWhy am I reading this?‚Äô That‚Äôs all I could think the entire time. Also, ‚Äòtell me something I don‚Äôt know. Something!‚Äô I hate to bash things, but this was awful!"
"I have read both of Glennon's other books and was really looking forward to this one. I pre-ordered it, counted down the days, prepared for staying up too late reading it, and then when I realized I'd be driving on release day, I downloaded the audiobook as well. This didn't track for me the same way that her other two books did, but I find that irrelevant because of the fire she brought in this one. Glennon has fought to build an integrated life -- with her family, her faith, her mental illness and addiction issues, and the world, -- and I think the acceptance of all that brings with it shows so much more than what I anticipated. It grabs you, makes you read it again, think about it a little, go back to read it again, sit with it a while, and then incorporate it with an ""oh."" So many of us, believing we were what was broken, have found that the only wholeness comes in fully integrating ourselves into life at work, in our families, and in the world -- and Glennon's words have given me vignette's that will enable me to help speak to my daughter's growth and development with others."
"I don't even know how to review this book, because I can't say how much it spoke to me without sounding like a crazy person. I think I underlined so much of the book that it's a pound heavier than when I started, just on ballpoint ink.It was exactly what I needed to hear, exactly now, on so many different topics that I, for the very first time, began to understand what a religious convert must feel when they find just the right holy text. Like THIS ANSWERS EVERYTHING. But without bullcrap or platitudes or easy answer. Glennon Doyle, unlike the entire rest of our country, is comfortable with nuance and contradiction, and she finds meaning and answers WITHIN that complexity instead of being reductive or simplistic.I want to buy copies of this book for every woman in my life and half the men. With Covid, with all the social problems our world has right now, with all the things going on...this is the book we need RIGHT NOW. Oh, and also amidst all its brilliance, social commentary, and empowerment, it's funny as h*ll. Because who doesn't need a laugh?"
"Part way though I contemplated just not finishing this book, but pushed on.  Having never read any of her books before I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect.  The continual jumping around and chapters that were the same idea repeated over and over with a different mixture of words, became uninteresting and slightly exhausting.  The metaphors for... literally everything, ugh.  Sure, there were little bits and pieces of good take away from this book but not worth the long and rather boring read.  An easy book to put down and not think about it."
"So, obviously, Glennon could not have knows as she wrote this book that it would be released in the midst of a major world crisis, but it is EXACTLY what the world needs right now. She is almost prophetic, the timing prophetic, the message prophetic, and many lives will be saved because of her writing.Glennon is at her absolute best here. She has had a major life and self-transformation. She has walked through fire and is yelling from the other side 'It is ok, it will be really hot and uncomfortable in there but you can join me. You, also, will be ok.' This is a message critical beyond words at any time- but MOST ESPECIALLY this time.In short, this book was meant for a time like now, and Glennon was meant to write in this day and age, and all of her experiences have added up in a total and complete honesty that rubs you raw and takes your breathe away at times (it is that intense)!!Some of my favorite and life changing lines from this book:""I've got these conditions-anxiety, depression, addiction- and they almost killed me. But they are also my superpowers."" (Pg 281)On medicine shaming for anxiety and depression: ""If there are people in your life.....who judge you for taking perscribed medicine, please ask to see their medical liscense. If they can show it to you and they happen to be your doctor consider listening. If not, tell them sweetly to f*ck all the way off. They are two-legged people who are calling prosthetics a crutch."" (pg 276)""We can do hard things""- message throughout book, if not needed now then when?""Here's where I landed. Here's the promise and hope I have for Tish, for myself, for all of us: 'Goodnight baby, you're never gonna lose you."" (pg 142)And my favorite- most life transfroming line to me in this book (pg 261)- ""It turned out that what I needed most was inside the one place I'd been running from my entire life: pain.  Everything I needed to know next was in the discomfort of now.""As someone who has also dealt with serious anxiety, and depression and addiction, who has spent a lifetime running from pain........this was revolutionary- soul changing.Last night, I finished this book and tried to go to sleep, but I was enveloped by panic.....My fear said to me ""You are going to bed tonight not knowing at all what is going to happen tomorrow."" And, then, a voice from deep inside but not my own....(well maybe my own....maybe a mix of me, God, Glennon even?) said...""You are going to bed tonight not knowing at all what is going to happen tomorrow. JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER NIGHT YOU HAVE EVER GONE TO BED IN THIS HUMAN LIFE.""  And that was it.  That was the start of my healing, and not surprisingly, it was found right in the middle of my pain.Definitely, just get this book......Just......Please. Get it."

"#GetUntamedI devoured ‚ÄúUntamed,‚Äù by Glennon Doyle like I was on a binge. I am now reading it for the second time in a lower gear. The preordered Kindle version was most definitely worth the wait, but I feel I MUST have a hard copy for all of the bookmarks and underlining I need to do. This is important and honest work from one of our bravest female humans. If not now, when? Extraordinary reading for EVERYONE, not just women. For those who feel that this is a 180 from her other books, I urge you to be open minded and bear witness to how people can change and grow. The writing, the ideas, make so much sense. I‚Äôm so grateful to Glennon for writing this book for ALL of us. Open yourself up to the writing...you may be surprised ‚ô•Ô∏èüôè"
"I'd like to preface this review with a fun fact. Early January the mini versions of Brene Brown, Glennon Doyle and the beautiful Rachel Held Evans that stand on my shoulders and remind me of brave, true, vulnerable, holy things throughout the day stirred a conjuring in my soul that it was time to leave my dead end job in pursuit of something more fulfilling, challenging. Mini Brene whispered: everything beautiful lies on the other side of that vulnerable, courageous decision. Mini Glennon said: staying put and martyring yourself to a position that isn't feeding your soul, your purpose and your potential ain't it. Rachel said: there's Someone who is all knowing, and holds you safe no matter what.So I did it! I accepted the new position, I swallowed the paycut, I made confetti out of the pro/con lists and I bought a bottle of champagne. AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT? My first day at this new job was the exact same day my Untamed book was to arrive at my house. It was the universe confirming I had made the right decision. Not the safe decision, not the tamed decision but certainly the brave one. And. Then. The. Virus. The same day my book arrived was the same day the Governor ordered all public schools closed for the remainder of March and April. Did I mention my new job was at an Elementary School?? The book that was supposed to celebrate me into this new chapter instead met me on my metaphorical bathroom floor and held me while I mourned. Here we are, Week 3 of quarantine and I have long since finished the book. I laughed, I cried, I threw it across the room and I picked it up again. I read it alongside my fiance, my very own Abby. There were times when I looked at her and said ""did you hear that? She's talking to you"" and there were times she looked at me and said the same thing. It was both beautiful and annoying that the same text could challenge me in one paragraph, and pages later, challenge her. This is the text that our world needed in this season. It also served as wonderful counsel for us as we prepare to be married (LORD WILLING) this July. How do we honor each other and ourselves as we transition into being wives? It's all in there. I have to be honest though, I was left with one burning question....What is Sister's real name?!"
Do not waste your time reading this book!! It is full of confusion and mixed messages!! I am so sad this woman has any influence in anyone‚Äôs life including her own children!!!
"I give this book all the stars in the Universe.  Lame that Amazon only has 5.  Glennon, this review is for you.  Abby wrote an IG post the other day about how painful it has been for you to cancel your tour.  I can't imagine.  But I can.  All that blood and sweat.  I've never read a more honest and raw account.  This book is a work of art.  Truly.  And I imagine it is only the very tip of your iceberg, the rest of which you most likely share in your intimate conversations with women like us on your tour.  So to say canceling it is painful for you must be an incredible understatement.  My dream is to see you speak one day.  I'm sure I share that dream with many!  Anyway, Abby told us that you read everyone of these reviews.  I hope you see this one.  Your book has articulated much of what I've needed to say and hear in my adult life.  The parallels we've had are uncanny.  I, too, am a writer.  I am a 38 year old mother of 3 daughters ages 10 and under.  I have been bulimic since I was 11.  I stopped when I first got pregnant at 27.  It was fine.  I relapsed a couple years ago.  It was not fine.  I went to treatment and left my babies at home.  I've been in recovery every since.  I am married, but have been separated for the past 2.5 years.  Your insights on marraige have helped me tremendously in navigating what I want, need, and deserve from my relationships.  I am finally unapologetic for all of that. I am an addict and have been a 'friend of Bill's' for nearly 8 years.  You words and insights are fire in a world of ice.  I often feel like I'm doing it wrong, the life thing.  Who knew that humaning actually IS hard and it is SUPPOSED to be hard?  Thank you for reminding me of that.  And thank you for using the word human as a verb.  I've done that in my writing and it feels so much better that way.  The style in which you write, the way you describe things, it is clear that there is a pallet of paints on your insides that you turn into words and use to paint the picture for the world who does not understand how to look at paintings.  You have articulated what so many of us cannot.  I just can't believe how damn smart you are.  And yet I can.  You are a woman, after all.  Thank you for showing yourself to us.  Keep doing it.  We need the noise.  Women need to be heard.  Be well.  Stay grateful.  And carry on.  :)"
"This book!! These words! These truths! This love! I devoured this book and wanted it to have double the amount of pages. The raw honesty of Glennon Doyle is so refreshing and real. She doesn‚Äôt sugarcoat or try and make herself look good. She shows up for herself, her family and her readers. I thank God she found Abby. One of the mist profound things that I‚Äôve heard was Glennon speaking on a podcast, referring to the first time they met. A version of it is in the book as well, but on the podcast she said words to the effect - my soul saw its mate from across the room and said ‚ÄúThere she is‚Äù. I‚Äôve told the story to everyone ever since. How incredible for your soul to meet its mate and just know. I saw someone comment on a FB post where another author‚Äôs divorce was discussed and she mentioned that the cause was probably the fact that she was reading this ‚Äòdangerous‚Äô book. If it helped her find her knowing and choose herself, I‚Äôd say NOT reading this book would be dangerous! I loved everything about this!!"
"I have been following Glennon since she began writing her blog in 2012, drawn to her clear, honest, wry and often very funny observations about parenting and womanhood in our culture. That said, I would like to separate my appreciation for her as a person and writer, and focus this review on the ideas and subjects she presents in this book.The book reads like a blog, with 65 brief chapters taking us through the new life, love, and uncovered wisdom of her journey.What this book does very well is define, in modern terms, the inner life -- the life of the mind and spirit -- and how an engaged inner world is often in great conflict with our outer realities, ie, our cultural norms as women. There are many beautifully mined observations in the book about honoring one's feelings, one's deeper ""Knowing"" self.  She even provides a tool to get there, to ""get lower,"" to enter into a meditative state so elusive in our distracted culture, where one can go to quietly decipher complex emotions.  Through numerous anecdotes about her family and its metamorphoses, Doyle explains the value and method of questioning that which does not align with one's Knowing self. This is important guidance, and, like many of esteemed writers who have exalted the inner life before her (Thoreau, Friedan), she writes accessibly, with the language and current political circumstances of the times.  That her book is feminist-leaning is a product of such accessibility -- it is a gift to her already-honed audience. But the messaging of brave self-exploration transcends gender.There are many idea gems in the book, such as ""I was feeling the rage of a writer with a broken plot,"" as she describes her journey through emotions around her husband's infidelity, in contrast to the storybook life she had imagined for herself. This idea continues to be central in the brief, blog-like chapters-- that as a writer, imagination itself can manifest a story and therefore a circumstance, so consequently it is vital to ensure that one's outward stories are in alignment with the ""Knowing"" inside.Perhaps many will read this book solely because they are curious about her falling in love and marrying soccer star Abby Wambach. But Doyle's life's adventure leading her to that story involved a deep and brave inventory of herself as she began to honor the honest emotions, grief, and pain inside.Untamed will resonate with women who are curious enough to observe their inner worlds, to dive into their dissatisfaction with the limiting roles and definitions of motherhood, marriage, and female stereotypes in our culture. Untamed is, hopefully, accessible enough for those who already adored Glennon Doyle before, to walk alongside her in this new adventure of her life. Though it is her story, and can be startling in its honesty, it does what all great art can do: it gives us permission to change."
"And this book does a good job of making that point. As a strong woman myself, I feel, like the author, that many of us give so much to so many and put ourselves behind others needs. I admire how Glennon found her own truth and place. For her, that was crucial to her survival. I often, however, felt that balance in needs wasn‚Äôt there. I feel that there is often some gray places in life where at times, there needs to be a compromise of differing needs at differing times. And I felt  that sometimes she didn‚Äôt exhibit that. No matter, it was her truth and it saved her life and made her whole. We each need to find that balance."
"Earlier this year I found myself in a confusing headspace. The world was changing for all of us with Covid just around the corner. I had just read Untamed. I have a signed copy of her second book, Love Warrior. Normally I relate so heavily to the things that she has to say but after finishing the book I felt odd. A shift occurred and I wasn‚Äôt aware, but I was about to become aware. I have been in therapy, weekly and bi-weekly for over a year now consistently with my psychiatrist. I am always questioning feelings that pop up or the state of my moods, something I have had to learn to do this past year very relentlessly, no breaks. At this point, its a few weeks after the book release and me finishing it, that reviews started to come in for the book and it was crazy! Everyone was going nuts for the book, it was not just a coming out story it was a story of womanhood and how the world defines that for us! But why then was my initial reaction, ‚Äúoh this wasn‚Äôt such a good book, not relatable, probably because I‚Äôm not gay, definitely my least favorite.‚Äù What was I missing? That question changed my life. What I was missing was a part of myself. A beautiful part of myself, an important part of me, once hidden away so tightly even I didn‚Äôt know it existed. Anxiously, I decided to read the book again a month later. This time, with my heart open and questioning, anxious for the knowing I was missing, I read the book and it washed over me so clearly. I am gay. Its been a process ever since that realization. My husband and the kids know and our family has adjusted and continues to adjust as we need, to navigate this. There is nothing but love between my kids dad and I and we will not entertain the idea that it has to be anything other than that. We can do hard things ü•∞ I am no longer hidden away and I wont live hidden anymore.ü¶ã I am eternally grateful for my wings! üôèüò≠‚ù§üåà"
"Was so excited to read this book based on all of the accolades it was receiving but am terribly disappointed. I don‚Äôt even want to waste the time to finish it. Not only is it incredibly repetitive and poorly written, but it‚Äôs hard to find credibility in Glennon. Honestly feel like it is just trying to appeal to uber liberal feminists."
"Couldn‚Äôt wait to get this book, but haven‚Äôt been able to finish it. I think it‚Äôs more geared for mom‚Äôs and maybe females that have a lot of really girly friends with 100% feminine energy. I had a hard time relating to most of what I read and the author is too dramatic over the top for me. Not to say this isn‚Äôt a great book for someone out there, just not for me."
"Untamed was my first book by Glennon. It was are recommend by a friend of mine. The first couple chapters I struggled but once I got into it.  WOW. Just WOW. What an incredible mind and gifted writer she is. I could only dream of expressing my thoughts into text the way she does. I‚Äôm happy I read this book first. It‚Äôs the last book so I started backwards. I purchased this book. The next book  Love Warrior I got from my local library. I dove into it knowing I had two weeks with this Gem. I‚Äôm half way though and all I can say is Wow. It‚Äôs opened my eyes. The way her soup feels in untamed completely explains how and why she feltthe way she did in Untamed.  I have questions..: I wonder if she always knew deepInside or Abby awakened something inside of her she never knew existed but once she did it all made sense? I‚Äôll continue to read this book and the next. I can‚Äôt get enough of her mind and it‚Äôs opening my mind and belong me to understand others that are outside the box. Tank you glennon for being brave and sharing this powerful well written,  work of art."
"This book is so deep! People have always called me selfless, and I've considered myself selfless as well. This book made me realize for the first time ever that in the process of me being so selfless I have betrayed myself, by not taking care of me, but rather everyone else first, then I take care of myself with the scraps left over. Leaving almost an identity crisis. When you are constantly giving of your time, and yourself it is important to make time for you, that way you can stay in touch with yourself. This book made me realize so much that would have otherwise never even crossed my mind. If you are a woman... who has been groomed, and trained your whole life to be a wife, a mom, a homemaker, a polite young lady, a worker.... this book is a must. You might come across some self realization that could be ground breaking to your growth on this journey through life. Any bad reviews on this book really make me wonder if the reader ever really needed it in their hands to begin with. Buy the book read it slowly and enjoy it. This book might have been a life changer for me!"
"Maybe this is less of a review, and more of a soul reflection on what this book is stirring inside me.  Untamed landed on my doorstep in the midst of this strange season of pandemic, and it could not have come at a more perfect time.Regardless...here goes.When I pick my daughter, Lydia, up out of her crib in the morning, I‚Äôll often say something along the lines of, ‚ÄúGood morning, my love!‚Äù And more often than not, her just-woken-up face will contort into a look of severe displeasure.  Furrowed brow.  Pouty lip.  Narrowed eyes.  She will adopt her best civil disobedience tone of voice and state confidently: ‚ÄúNO.  I‚ÄôM NOT YOUR LOVE.  I‚ÄôM JUST A LYDIA.‚ÄùThis hurt my feelings initially.And then I watched her have the same response when her brother called her a less-than-complimentary name. ‚ÄúNO.  I‚ÄôM NOT A POO-POO BUTT.  I‚ÄôM JUST A LYDIA.‚ÄùAha.  There it is.I do love this wild little being with my whole soul, and I will never stop telling her so.  But she is NOT defined by my love.  It was a lightbulb moment for me to realize that she inherently knows as a 2.5-year-old what I am desperately trying to learn as an almost 40-year-old grown ass woman.  She is her whole self.  Not a label or a relationship or a set of expectations or an object of affection and certainly not a poo-poo butt.  She is beautifully, magically, mysteriously Lydia.If I have one prayer for this whole parenting journey, I think it would be that I somehow lead these little human beings toward remaining UNTAMED.Please keep being you, baby girl.  Please keep exasperating me and hurting my feelings sometimes and pushing back against my expectations.  Please keep knowing who you are and who you are not.And for any other grown-ass women (or men) out there who feel me on this, GET YOURSELF A COPY OF THIS BOOK, because it is the loveliest companion along the journey."
"I read ""Love Warrior"" back in 2017.  I reread the review I left after picking it up to read a second time and was kind of shocked at what I had written.  Then, however,  I was deep in my active addiction so I was probably drunk when I wrote it.  Today, sober, I read ""Untamed"" because I was very surprised when I heard about Abby and had to know more.  Like I mentioned above, you pretty much have to admire G given her past as outlined in ""Love Warrior"".  She is a beautiful soul making real change in the world through her writing and generous philanthropy.  This book is not about addiction, or a painful marriage, bulimia, abortion, or AA.  It's more about living out loud for lack of a better phrase and trying to conduct your life with integrity and compassion while maintaining your peace and boundaries.  I guess read this if your feeling like reading some fairly light inspirational narratives."
Sucks! If we had wanted to read about the challenges of coming out of the closet we might have enjoyed it but this book sucked and I would not recommend it unless you need strength to come out if the closet. This is not a book for straight people!
"The new bible hath arrived!!! God has spoken through Glennon Doyle and I‚Äôm HERE FOR IT!!! I read this book faster than any book before. I had to slow myself down a bit because I would read so fast just to turn to the next delectable page. As a woman, a mother, a human, and a recovering perfectionist this book has brought me super powers. The unlearning of all the past conditioning that fit in tiny controlled boxes is a priceless gift Glennon hilariously, authentically, and gut wrenchingly wrapped in the book, UNTAMED! The world should own this book. I feel like a better human already. She doesn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù program in this book. She has her truth, which is Love. Love is all of ours and somewhere we forgot. Thank you, Glennon, for helping us remember."
"This may be the most amazing book I have ever read.  If EVERYONE read this book, the world would be different.  Glennon's thoughts are so well-thought, her feelings are so genuine, and the way she puts words into sentences is like the best meal you ever had.  You leave the table so satisfied, but light as air because you KNOW something NEW.  A new way to think or to be.  And it isn't HER way because she isn't trying to force her life on anyone.  It seems to me that she just wants people to really THINK about things and make their own choices for their truest and most beautiful lives.  I feel like we have always been friends and she needed to tell me something.  I bought the audio book and after listening to it twice, had to buy the hard-cover because I couldn't just listen.  I had to highlight and underline and circle and write notes in the margins.  Get. This. Book."
"This book was....exceptional. I thoroughly enjoyed the format. I love people but I'm also a hermit who wants to stay at home, sit in my closet and go Into the Unknown. There were so many parts of this book that talked me into accepting this about myself instead of fighting it. I have spent a lot of time Knowing and then burying that voice. Thank you Glennon .....for words. I have such a difficult time using words to explain things to people. I work with kids and they seem to know what I'm trying to say without me speaking too much. Adults...not so much. I overexplain (like now)üòÇ I feel like I can carry this book with me and point to a passage and just say I'm trying to explain this to you. Thank you Thank you for words and stories and delivering so many beautiful messages."
"<strong>Thought provoking </strong>3.5 starsThe very first thing I want to say is that Abby Wambach is freaking Gorgeous! Ok, I got that out of my system.I enjoyed this book but I also had some issues with it. I did find her to be somewhat pretentious, clueless and  privileged white girl especially in the beginning of the book. I enjoyed reading about Glendon‚Äôs thought process and growth. I think she touched on a lot of topics which can open up some wonderful, enlightening discussions.Some things were right on and others were quite off the mark.I don‚Äôt agree with everything she said, but that‚Äôs ok. I think more growing will happen and needs to happen but that‚Äôs ok life is about evolving.I think this review will evolve after I read over my notes and discuss it with my strong, highly-evolved friends."
"This book found a way to say so many things I believe we all think about and fear saying and sharing with others. I‚Äôm thrilled to have read this book and I highly recommend that you read it if you‚Äôre reading this review. When I picked this book up I had no idea what it was about. I just read the beginning and the perspective shared there about the animal and knew I wanted to read more and then I couldn‚Äôt stop reading, highlighting, saving quotes, sharing them. I read a lot of books. This one will help you live a more satisfying, more enjoyable life, because I believe we do all have our own internal knowing. This will help you to listen to it‚Äîin ALL aspects of life."
"Amazon rejected my first lengthy review because I shared one of my favorite parts of the book and it contains a semi-naughty word. To my great frustration, I did not save a copy of that review to easily edit to a G-rated version so the fact that I am here spending free time writing a completely new review (my short-term memory is going) speaks to my gratitude for this wonderful book.I read Glennon's last best-seller but put off reading this one since I didn't think I'd personally relate to it much given the changes in her life. I was also a little bit sad that things didn't work out with Craig. Of course that's none of my business but Glennon's books have a magical way of making you feel like she's a good friend and somehow you find yourself caring, not only about her and her family, but a multitude of other things in the world that you hadn't fully considered before. This book reveals much about the reasons for the end of one aspect of her relationship with Craig and in the process truly helped me more fully understand her choices and thus, the choices of so many.  The bravery she shows in revealing painful, private aspects of her life is astounding and absolutely gripping and the wisdom and humor with which she becomes a force for good in the world via her moving stories is profound. I read the book in 2 days and within those 2 days had deeper conversations with my husband of 25 years than we've had in months. This book is about so much more than her relationships. There is something here for everyone.  She offers a blueprint through her willingness to be vulnerable to the masses to help each of us forge better connections and have a more meaningful life. I seldom read a book more than once but this is one I took notes on and will surely turn to again and again. It certainly made day 30 gazillion of the pandemic go down easier with a dose of humor, wit, and insight. And BTW if, like me, you're not a big fan of foul language don't let my initial paragraph scare you off.  It only comes in rare sprinkles in the book and only when it's absolutely necessary.Bravo Glennon! This book is a masterpiece!"
"I like the book. It is full of profound, inspirational encouragement to be who we are born to be. Knowing ourselves and embracing ourselves for who we are is a running theme. However, throughout the book, I kept finding myself thinking about the author‚Äôs qualifications to make recommendations about how we should live. I think I liked the book but I have also been thinking a lot about what Brene‚Äô Brown said in her ‚ÄúUnlocking Us‚Äù podcast with Glennon that if you were raised in a patriarchal society/culture, this book would shake you to your core. That is true and I am glad I read it. I like being pushed out of my comfort zone."
"A client of mine recommended this book and told me that it changed her life. When I came on here to check it out I noticed the wildly ranging reviews and thought, ‚ÄúWhat the hell, I‚Äôll give it a shot.‚Äù This ended up being a waste of time and money. This is the 1st book I could not stand to continue. I almost made it half way through and it is so bad that I just had to stop. It is an incredibly depressing memoir of a woman that acts like she didn‚Äôt have choices through her life to be herself and generalizes that all women are doing what they are told they are supposed to do and be. I did not resonate with any ounce of what she was trying to say. Not all women are sheep and some of us are openly and unapologetically ourselves."
"This is the book I‚Äôve been needing to read for my entire life.  I found myself both not wanting to put this book down, and wishing it would never end.  I have spent the past 2 years on a journey back to myself, and this book somehow put to words the recently uncovered truths of my own beautiful (becoming untamed) soul.  I am learning to dance and sing because of the joy they bring me, not because of the audience I may feel compelled to entertain or impress.  I am finding ‚Äúparenting‚Äù to be far less of a verb to be perfected and more of an adventure unfolding.  Glennon‚Äôs beautiful perspective on the lessons and gifts our incredible children bring to our lives restores my hope that I might not ‚Äúmess them up‚Äù too badly after all.  Her thoughts on religion and God resonated so deeply with me‚Äîideas that I could never quite communicate or understand are on the pages of Glennon‚Äôs book...and help me to feel less alone in that particular leg of my journey.I could go on for hours.  As someone who has been growing and learning right along with Glennon for years, this book is right on time and absolute gold.  It is the message of healing and wholeness we all need to be reminded of.Thank you, Glennon...for sharing your life and your heart through your gift with words...so that we all may become untamed."
"About a third of the way though ""Untamed"", I sent this text to a close friend - ""You must listen to or read Glennon Doyle's ""Untamed"".  It is full of hard truths, raw emotions, love, pain, and understanding. I did not expect to love this book but I will read it more than once.  It will unleash something that is still tying you down - just know it in my soul.""  While that text was meant directly for her, it conveys the way I feel about this book even more now that I have finished it.  Untamed is not a comfortable, feel good read.  Some chapters feel like a challenge, a dare, to disagree or to judge the words and the feelings on the page.  But if you will sit with yourself and your thoughts, if you will allow yourself to truly think about the anchors that are holding you down and the bars that surround us, you will be steps closing to living the life God created you for and allowing others to do the same.  Thank you Glennon, for this book - I know it wasn't easy to write and I am grateful that you were willing to put yourself out there, scars and all."
"This book is everything I've ever needed to read. If you're reading this review to determine if you should buy this book - buy it now.I say this from experience. I just went through my Amazon order history, and to date, I have bought FOURTEEN copies of this book since May - one for myself and the rest for the women in my life. I'll be continuing to buy them as birthday, Christmas, wedding and baby shower gifts. I consider every penny among the best money I've ever spent. Every woman should read this book. I feel compelled to add that I am a sane, professional woman that doesn't normally buy dozens of copies of the same book. This is not normal behavior for me, but this is not a normal book.I'd never heard of Glennon Doyle before I read ""Untamed"" and I wasn't even sure what kind of book it was. Technically, it's a memoir - but for me, it was everything. Everything I felt but had never heard said. Everything I needed to hear. Every crippling personal doubt and insecurity alchemically transformed into golden threads of sisterhood.This book will save lives, and it has transformed mine. Thank you, Glennon!!! May I find my purpose as you have yours. May we all contribute to the world as you have."
"This book is not a self-help book. And certainly not a ""Christian Self Help"" book. Really Amazon??? Even Glennon doesn't call it that. She calls it a return to self; no need to improve. I agree. It is an unraveling of what is no longer working to get to our truth and inner knowing. Some parts of this book may feel uncomfortable. I recommend that you keep reading because some insights are harder to receive than others. Lumpy crossings are a good indicator of some inner work to be done for personal evolution.  And read to the END. I know we tend to trail off in the middle because we think we've gotten the gist of the message. This book doesn't work like that. The chapters are like a tiny cluster of islands. They are connected but have unique microenvironments. This book is as powerful and dangerous as the people it's inspiring. More of that, please!"
I tried. I really did. I wanted to like this book. But it just comes off as someone bragging. It‚Äôs annoying. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúlife changing.‚Äù It‚Äôs like everyone all got together and all agreed to be politically correct and not criticize this person because they made edgy life choices. Like good for you but it doesn‚Äôt make a good book.
"There are so many chores begging for my attention; and I just finished reading Untamed by Glennon Doyle so I have to strike when the iron is hot. The book is transformational, inspiring, hilarious, self-effacing and brilliant. Maybe it just hit MY tuning fork, but I doubt it. Buy two copies so you will have one to give away. I‚Äôve already bought two and given one away. On my way to the post office to mail my current copy to a friend to whom I have promised it. Will buy more. We are moving into new ways of seeing religion, public service, philanthropy, sexual orientation, gender identity, the works, absolutely everything. Glennon is one of the best guides I have found for this new exploration, this new way of looking at a hurting world that is full of beauty and promise."
"I was very disappointed in Untamed. After hearing so much about it, I was expecting something very different. Doyle is open about her issues, family, etc., and shares the few lessons she's learned over and over and over and over. Not worth my time or my money."
"This was the first book I read during quarantine.  I used to be an avid reader.  Then I got married, had a child, you kind of lose yourself.  So I ordered 3 books.  It was an easy read.  Very inspiring.I‚Äôve followed G for years . But I didn‚Äôt read any of her books, I just wasn‚Äôt making time for myself.Glad I did this . This is one I told myself I‚Äôd reread when I‚Äôm feeling depressed.  I‚Äôm prone toAnxiety and depression.Anyways this was a super easy read until I hit the racism chapter.  I got to that chapter the day George Floyd was murdered.  It took me about a week to get to it and it was at times hard to swallow.  But the communication part is always painful.  But so important."
"My hats off to Glennon Doyle, not only is she vulnerable and honest in sharing her journey of societal/cultural conditioning that most if not all women are subjected to, but sheds this old conditioning and each chapter has ""Dalai Lama"" sayings that I've been highlighting as I read for my own personal mantras!! Empowerment, honoring your true self as a woman in a patriarchal society, and creating ones OWN life, hopes & dreams is just some of what can be found in this gem...and to add, side note, what I LOVE is she does all of this without male-bashing or judging...so both genders could very well incorporate this book into their own journey of self-truths, self-discovery, healing and growth. Thank you Glennon Doyle for proudly & unashamedly proclaiming your truths!! Has a very special place in my üíìüíñ"
Honestly I bought it because I saw it in the news so much. Thought I'd give it a shot. I found it hard to put down and most of the concepts really resonated as true to me. I didn't expect words/phrases to stick with me for so long. I come back to them again and again. I re-read passages and I NEVER do that. Everyone is different but this book came to me at the perfect time and really did help me. While some of the parent-child exchanges between the author and her kids hit me as aspirational (my teenager would never react rationally and 'thoughtfully' to having his phone taken away!) the overall benefit outweighed that disbelief. Buy it because you can't borrow mine. I highlighted a bunch of stuff and I refer to it often!
"It is difficult to review a book that has moved me as much as Untamed. As a woman who has done her fair share of senselessly apologizing, beating herself up over every little mistake, and falling victim to the typical self-loathing that many women experience, Untamed had me examining my life and my way of thinking from start to finish. Every time I closed the book after reading a few chapters I needed to take a deep breath and just sit and reflect on what I had read. It is not often that a writer is able to put so clearly into words your thoughts and fears, but Glennon Doyle does it perfectly with Untamed.Written with such honesty, and occasionally with a refreshing dose of humor, I found myself wanting to read this entire book in one sitting. I made the conscious decision to not do this though. I wanted to be able to read this book and really digest all the messages that Glennon so beautifully packed into her memoir. Even now, I know I will likely reread this book a second or third time just to ensure I did not miss anything. That is how powerful and wonderful this book truly is.I would recommend everyone read this book. I would especially recommend that readers who found this book as powerful as I did to pass it along to another woman in your life. Send it to your mom, your aunt, your best friend. Chances are that many of the women in your life will relate to at least part of Glennon‚Äôs story and find comfort that everything they feel day in and day out, but keep to themselves, is likely something all of us are struggling with. This book is like a breath of fresh air and we all need to breath it in."
"She changes her mind every book with a different theme/life message.  She is not a Christian.  Mom's aren't supposed to put their kids or husbands first.  She is #1.  She blasphemes about God.  She pushes a hard feminist, gay agenda.  Do not read this trash.  She needs to go figure her life out for real.  Be good for more than a minute.  THEN write a book.  Or not."
"I want for everyone I love to read this book and thrill in some newfound awareness; to bask in the incredible sigh of deep knowing.In so many ways I can relate to the unfolding of her person, her family, her love. I, too, have always attempted control when what I actually wanted was wild. I love wild. I love spontaneity. Conditioning is what I was taught early on. It has merit. It needs to give way to the unpredictable. Thank you, Glennon!"
"I have read Glennon's  memoirs ( Love Warrior and Carry On, Warrior) and have been fascinated by her gutsy honesty and pursuit of her own story. Her wrestling with God and with her personal addictions, traumas, and relationships were arresting. Now, she has become a new woman. She is now married to a woman who she recognized at first sight as, ""She's the one. "" She lives with her three children and her wife Abby and shares parenting with her ex-husband and his girlfriend.  Magically, they have resolved their painful relationship which was the central conflict of her first two books. This is not the Christian bestseller you might have expected to follow the Warrior books, but it's a frank, surprising update."
"I have so much to share and yet I feel kind of speechless... Her words feel like my words, coming from deep within me. I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs possible but I hadn‚Äôt heard of Glennon until about a week ago and I am in love with this soul! I immediately ordered this book after hearing her talk about it in a YouTube video and I devoured it like a god damn cheetah. Her untamedness ;) is like a permission slip, an invitation, a key that unlocks the cage to my true authentic self. Her unapologetic authenticity is so inspiring and liberating. I feel like the last few days since reading this I‚Äôve seen aspects of myself that I haven‚Äôt seen or felt in a really long time. Who I was before the taming and conditioning is feeling nudged and invited by this book and by Glennon‚Äôs example of an untamed human. Thank you Glennon, I am grateful and inspired beyond words. Every human should read this. I‚Äôm sorry your book tour was cancelled I hope this touches your heart like you have touched mine."
"Thank you Glennon. I‚Äôve been a cheetah my whole life. Always on the cusp of golden, but too different to fully fit in. Tolerated in a world when I was destined to run wild. I resonated with so many of your stories. Just this week I already said no to something I was ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to want to do because I felt my knowing hesitate and this time I trusted her enough. If I died today the one and only regret I would have is that I didn‚Äôt get the words sitting inside of me out. I know I‚Äôm meant to write, authentically. Which means my stories will hurt some people‚Äôs feelings. Make others feel threatened or offended. Thank you for giving me the courage to know that none of that matters. I just need to follow the voice. Maybe one day our paths will cross and I will be able to hug you and tell you thank you. But until then, keep following your knowing. The rest of us will be blessed because you do. Much love, Sophia Hyde. IG @thesophiahyde"
"I can see how it would have touched a lot of people, and I love reading about her stories of over coming and her meeting Abby. Glennon is a fantastic story teller, and I kept wishing that she would do more of that. But the self-help, pump-you-up sections just fell flat for me."
"I've read all of Glennon's books and each have resonated with me at different phases in my life. As we all are, Glennon is evolving and becoming someone authentic in this phase of life. I am so glad she and Abby found each other and that her unique family dynamics include her former husband. That's growth! I love that she is finally allowed to be herself unapologetically and that she is supported and held and free.  Thank you for sharing this momentous event in your life with your readers, followers who have been with you all the way from day 1. And may your love, your life continue to sweeten with time. We only live once. Live it authentically,  with passion, humor and love. And no regrets! Bravo!"
"Untamed is not only timely and true, but also raw and unapologetic. I was changed by this book. Does it contradict a few of her previous statements in other books? Yep. Do you still believe the exact thing that you believed last week, last month, last year, 5 years ago? If the answer is yes, then you DEFINITELY need to read Untamed. This book is the context behind evolution toward oneself and away from what is been pressed upon us and young people, as women, as sensitives. I appreciated her brief divulgence about her relationship with Abby throughout this book, it highlights the most beautiful parts about them and also keeps their love private and sacred. I cried, I laughed, I became angry. This book isn't just a must read, its a must reread. There is no way that anyone can capture all of its magic the first time through.Thank you Glennon, for writing the words of our broken hearts. Thank you for being brave and angry and unapologetic. Thank you for becoming a leader while remaining sensitive and true to your knowing. I used to think that my sensitivity was something to be ashamed of, something to hide, something to fear. Recently, and emphasized by your work of art, I know that it is the feelers that are world changers. Broken hearts save lives. Thank you."
"Glennon Doyle is a mastermind!  I loved the book!  I bought it for my sister, my niece, a couple of friends!  And I‚Äôve recommended it to lots more!  It‚Äôs great!  If I were to write a book, many of her thoughts and discoveries sound like my thoughts and discoveries.  On parenting, racism, sexism, loving people-kind, on being a Cheetah! I didn‚Äôt want the book to end...so I slowed down my reading to savor every word. I think I‚Äôll read it again! üíôüíôüíô"
"Dear Glennon Doyle:I know this has been said over and over in these reviews, but this book saved my life. There's not much more to it than that. I thought I understood the social conditioning of women in modern America...until I read this book. There was so much that seems so obvious now, and yet I had never considered things in quite the way you had. Your heart, soul, mind, and body are in these pages and I thank you so much for sharing them with us, your humble readers. Anyone who is debating reading this book should DROP EVERYTHING AND DO IT RIGHT NOW. And don't stop there -- send a copy to your mother, your sister, your girlfriends, your grandmother...and, honestly, to the men in your life. This book's honesty and vulnerability have turned my 3-month solo quarantine from depressing and lonely to full and inspiring. In some ways, the timing of this book's release was impeccable - nothing will force women to examine themselves from the inside out like a 3-month mandatory stay-at-home order. This book opened my eyes to my own possibility and made me feel more like myself than I have since I was 10-years-old. I could go on and on, but for now, suffice it to say that I could not possibly recommend this book any more than I am. I want to frame my copy and be buried with it. It's that powerful. Thank you, Glennon Doyle. Thank you."
"It's one thing to open this book and be open to the words and ideas that you are bringing into your heart.  But be prepared to realize, with the turn of every page, that Glennon's gifts will take you places you didn't know to be closed.  Reading this book, I immediately had to go get a pencil and begin tearing up the margins with hastily scribbled notes and annotations.  Entire passages are now underlined and starred.  I want to buy this book for every woman I've ever known and respected, for every man who needs to understand where the women in his life are coming from.  It's a book of parables and rolling hills of emotion.You will be changed if you allow yourself time to sit with her words and grow your mind and your heart."
"I can't say enough about how much I love this book. I became Untamed and followed my heart almost 10 years ago - This book helped me reconcile the guilt I have had choosing my own happiness over making everyone else happy. It's also made me realize that if I hadn't made those choices my children would have suffered with a half-way mom in an unhappy relationship. It's a constant work in progress, but this book will be read over and over. I highlighted (in my kindle) as I read it and realized that I was highlighting something on almost every single page! Glennon's experiences are soooo relatable -- we've been there, we felt it. Thank you for writing Glennon -- you have a follower for life!"
"This is by far one of the best, most thought-provoking, empowering books I have ever read. It should be required reading for all women!Glennon Doyle is such an authentic and uniquely brave human being. Her writing and willingness to put herself out there on the world's stage with vulnerabilities and all so that we can all learn from her mistakes right along with her is such a tremendous gift to society and anyone lucky enough to stumble across her and her work.If you have not read this already, do yourself a favor and add it to your library immediately. Then buy a copy for your mother, your sister, your daughter and your favorite friends. This book is truly a game changer and sharing is caring!"
"This was a wonderful book and opened up my eyes to how truly broken we are due to the way society has judged, blamed, and seen women as weak human beings.  I have went more against what I was raised to believe, not necessarily by my parents, but the Church and even Employers since reading this book.  I have actually realized, we as Women have a voice and it's time to stop apologizing for everything we do or say that may upset someone else.  I realized, I have to stand for what makes me feel right and raise question to why we have and still follow this decrepit belief system that kills our souls.  This is one of the best reads that I have had in years.  I reference this book often and reread to heal my soul."
"There are very few women who will truly relate to all of Glennon Doyle's life journey, but nearly all women will relate to various parts of it, and likely with stunning resonance. I was impressed with the book all around--writing, content, pacing, sequence, etc.-- though the audio version (read by the author) can come off with a bit too much emphasis sometimes, sounding either forced or didactic. But her journey, her insights, and her wit and wisdom far, far outweigh little nits about the narration.  I was so impressed that after listening to the audio book via my library app, I went and bought 3 copies. One for my adult daughter, one for a friend turning 50, and one for me to read again in hard copy. I highly recommend this book."
"If you‚Äôre anything like me, you love that other people rate and review books and purchases because you read what they write and it gives you some sense of control over your purchase. However, the act of writing your own review to the things that you like takes effort and time and seems like a pain. So in reality that leads to me being a completely rare reviewer. Something has to raise it self up above the threshold of being worth it. It has to make itself worthy of my energy to come up with a title and enough words to allow me on my Kindle app to actually submit the rating.This book was worth 20+ words to give it 5 stars.  Bravo Glennon!!  This book would have possibly been something my WILD and Untamed Philosophy instructor/spirit mother would have respected and enjoyed!"
"i have read glennon doyle's other memoirs, and eagerly anticipated the arrival of this one.  her writing style and depth of insights are a breath of fresh air in a world that thrives on impression management.  i will be reading doyle's work until the day she stops writing.  and my adult daughter has already purchased a copy for her adult daughter.  two thumbs up from three generations of bailey women."
Not a good fit. Feels like an angry book.
"Rounding up to three stars.Had more hope for this book. Beginning seemed better, then she just kind of lost me. It was frustrating... all the stories... views... whining... choices... projection on others... the world... Christianity... racism... sexuality... utter disregard... blame...it was hard not to judge...I believe this book was written to be more of a self help and I think that part sucked and did not do its job... I feel nothing but some frustration afterwards... I may not be in right frame of mind... I might give it another go... but I doubt it. Least not for a while... quite a while."
"If I could give this book 10 stars I would, right now the world is going to have to change and things will look different as we figure out what that will be.  Inspirational and powerful, not a self-help book yet this book will help you.  It will if you are at all not sure, it will help you become sure, and strong and ready by giving you ideas and tools to use.  Each person will find what they need from the various chapters, it is a quick ""read"" but it is more of a keep this book around like a guide for life and inspiration for when you need it type of book.  Excellent, just an excellent book, like none other I have read."
"There were parts of this book that I did thoroughly enjoy but I gave three stars because there were so many parts where it felt like she just drones on and on. Also, because it just seemed like she went from one topic to another back to the first and around and around."
This book is a waste of money. She is hypocritical and has a selfish view on life.
"I am not a glennon doyle follower, but I read this book as it was recommended to me. Glennon Doyle is an acquired taste. There is a lot of food for thought in this book. If you can get passed the overtly-concocted-to-perfection editing of conversation, you‚Äôll find that she makes some really solid points and her intent is good. If you can‚Äôt get below the surface, you‚Äôll find this book irritating and hypocritical. At times, it feels a little too unassuming yet judgmental, and at others raw and unabashedly honest. Overall, I think most anyone could find something to learn here, even just about themselves, and that‚Äôs what I like about this one. Though, if you don‚Äôt take this book and think on a deeper level about yourself, your time will be wasted."
"I always liked Glennon Doyle‚Äôs books, but never truly connected with them the way others seemed to... It felt as if she wasn‚Äôt truly being vulnerable, but was a super skilled writer who could craft a story with just enough authenticity to strike a chord with other women I admired. This book changed that for me. I‚Äôm a forty something television writer and divorced mother ‚Äî so we have a fair amount in common, but beyond those particulars that moved me specifically, this book makes it clear that Doyle is both a force of nature and a force for good in the world.  The book itself is both timely and so very long overdue ‚Äî as a life approach. If you don‚Äôt cry about a billion times reading it... well, you‚Äôve either been untamed for some time, or you don‚Äôt have a soul. I‚Äôve been trying to embrace this approach to life for a while ‚Äî with much less success ‚Äî and I am so so grateful for this book."
"Thought provoking book that will stay with me for a long time. A few concepts that stood out to me:Doing hard things-there is growth to be found there.Boundaries to shield me from fear-it is okay to decline getting together until it I am approached from a place of love.Humility-sharing my growth can empower others (Glennon empowered me).Brave, untamed women-we need them!It is impossible to pull out all the nuggets of this book in a summary because each reader will find gems based on where they are in their own life. I highly recommend the book to my friends and I am giving the book to my daughters to read next."
"I loved the short, relatable stories. Loved the metaphors. Loved the parenting guidance. I‚Äôve been reading a lot of marriage/relationship books and a lot of parenting books and reading this summed up a lot of the essence of the other books I have been reading which was very cool, but then with her spin on it which made it entertaining and enjoyable. The author‚Äôs way with words was very poetic and getting to know her and her family through the stories she shared was fun. I am looking forward to reading her other novels. Happy that my sister recc this to me, it was recc in her woman‚Äôs group she was apart of last weekend. Cheers, happy reading!"
"Had high hopes for this book, didn‚Äôt live up to them. I did get some useful advice from it and thought she made some good points throughout. Then there is the rest, that annoyed me as defensive, self righteous in a way, and eye roll worthy. I thought it was just me but my entire book club has worse to say. I can‚Äôt fully explain the tone but there are some very hard to get through chapters mixed with some great ones almost like the bad content was a filler. Overall fell short for me."
"You will ever completely relate or you won‚Äôt. Mixed reviews that I read didn‚Äôt deter me from finding it out for myself. And I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased. I imagine that there are millions of us, that will understand this book and if you do, it will be eye opening. For the others, maybe you aren‚Äôt ready for the message she‚Äôs trying to convey. I personally relate to everything in this book, even down to the same word usage and mentalities. I‚Äôm so very grateful that I treated myself to this because it couldn‚Äôt have come at a better time in my life. I‚Äôve already finished is and highlighted so many areas but I‚Äôm jumping right back in for the second read because I know I missed out the first go round. Thank you for this book. I needed it."
"Madly, deeply in love with this book. It feels like Glennon has reached down deep into my soul and organized all of my core beliefs (my ‚Äúknowing‚Äù) into this beautiful literary package. I can‚Äôt stop sharing excerpts of this book on my Instagram story. Glennon is so insightful...so funny...so real. I am a school counselor at an alternative high school. This means my students did not fit the traditional expectations of high school. They have all fallen behind in credits and have been ‚Äúinvited to leave‚Äù their traditional high schools. I wish I could find a way to make this required reading for all of my students during time that we are out of school. ‚ÄúWe can do hard things‚Äù is a core message of this book and we all need this message now more than ever. Please do yourself a favor and read this book. Use this time of ‚Äústanding still‚Äù to heal our collective conscious. Look for things, like this book, to help heal yourself and through that process, heal the world."
"This books confirms some of my most inner ""knowings"" I've had since I was a little girl. Raised in what I now call a ""modern day cult"" I was confused, judged, and told what to believe. When she talks about ""don't think, don't feel, don't know"" and definitely don't challenge, it hit home! There are so many parts of this book where I became teary-eyed and had beautiful AHA moments. When she says ""All the devil has to do to win is convince you he's God,"" FIREWORKS went off. I'm pretty sure I screamed, YES, YES, YES!!!!!! It's a book full of confirmations if you're already on the path of knowing your truth and living it, but it's challenging for those who still seek to be caged and trapped rather than free. t's not only a spiritual awakening but an inner awakening."
"I think it's pretty diverse in topics and will have something for everyone. Some parts are a challenge because as a minority some things are experienced waaaaaay different of course. But her passion for self improvement, self awareness and bringing up uncomfortable topics are good to read. It's a good book to read right now with all the things that are coming up to the surface."
"I really thought I would like this book, but it is a repeat of most self help books.  Really focuses on er sexuaity, not what I was looking for at all. Very disappointing."
"I bought this book because my therapist recommended it. I definitely see some parallels between Glennon's story and my own, but I didn't really like her storytelling style (the parallels between the tiger in the zoo- ugh) + things her daughter never said inserted throughout. I also feel that she didn't go in depth enough to really offer any insight, inspiration, or action for me. I did read Glennon's blog back in the 'Love Warrior' days, and found her somewhat inspirational but also somewhat phony. I figured that -now- after divorcing, coming out, and aging a bit that she would feel less so. Still feeling it. We probably just don't operate on the same wavelength."
Most disappointing Reese‚Äôs Book Club yet.  It‚Äôs not a novel but a memoir of a unremarkable person. Some interesting points/observations but not worth the time and money spent on book.  Someone in a different point of life might appreciate more
"I love all of Glennon Doyle's work so I was pretty excited to read her newest book, Untamed. The book club I belong to chose this book for our January pick. It did not disappoint! This is a powerful read for any woman. Her real life stories were entertaining, but they also touch a part of you can makes you feel less alone and more connected to humanity. Understood. This memoir was filled with tragedy, love and triumph. Everything you could want in a story, but it was real and beautiful.The discussion we had for book club following this book was probably the best one we've ever had. There was so much deep insight packed into this book. I'd recommend for anyone to read this book. Especially women!"
"IF you feel you absolutely must read this book, save your time and money and borrow it from the library. If not, know you're not missing much."
"I have not read any other books about the author so I am not as invested in her journey as she alludes her fans are. I did not find the book insightful, mostly chapters of good or common sense ideas a d opinions. If you are an extremely insecure person then you might relate to the book but a therapy session will be more worth your time."
"My 18 year old daughter and I read this book together.  I was reading it, and she was attracted by the cover design and picked it up... then loved the content.  I had to keep stealing it back from her in order to finish.  So instead of me having to remember to share all these ideas with her, she was reading them of her own accord.  We then bought a copy for a friend as a graduation present.  A lot to chew on, some might say it's obvious follow your heart stuff. But Glennon makes it so relatable and uses memorable analogies.  I have a lot of respect for her ability to unapologetically change and grow and face hard truths.  Sometimes when I feel uncertain of my ability to do something I quietly think... ""I'm a gd cheetah"" and then I do it.  (Read the first bit of the book to understand that reference.)"
"I cannot express how much this book hit me, I don't have the words, like Glennon.  I truly wish I did so I could perfectly execute what was moved through me as I read this book.  I felt the pain she's felt when she couldn't be herself.  I laughed out loud with the shared stories of ""someone ringing the doorbell"" or texts.  I liked that it wasn't just a story about her relationship with Abby, although that was expertly woven into the fabric of a woman who is evolving and rewriting the female paradigm.  For women, all women to decide if they don't want to be bound by the shackles of what life would ""have"" them do because of archaic and old stories of our worth and value.  I read this book at the beginning of the global pandemic.  (I bought both the Kindle and Hardbook version).  I read this book in 1 1/2 days with my niece and daughter next to me and they would look at me wondering why I was laughing out loud or what was making me cry.  I told them both that when they are ready, they will need to read this book.  To teach them that they can evolve and grow and change and even change partners midway thru their long life, god willing.  It's well written short stories, like pockets or windows, of moments that seem to define and create the journey of Glennon's being woman.  Each story weaving a pivot or an insight or a lesson or a memory all to sculpture her into the person you see today, in this now present moment.  Not yesterday or in the future, but who she is right now.  I can't sum this book up in nutshell, but as I go through my hardbound copy with highlighter and pen for the second read, I can assure you that you will be moved to question your own journey of womanhood.  You will take a second peek into why you chose that career or mate.  You may even strongly resonate with her stories in contrast and that's good too.  Just as long as you read this book.  You will not be disappointed.  Read the book!"
Barely able to finish. Redundant stream of consciousness. I don‚Äôt get the hype. Save yourself the time and do something useful like going for a nature walk or taking a yoga class.
"Today I finished ‚ÄúUntamed‚Äù by Glennon Doyle. And I wish I hadn‚Äôt finished. Meaning I wish it would go on for quite a few more glasses of Rose‚Äô. I feel like I didn‚Äôt know parts of myself until reading Glennon‚Äôs words. For real, ladies, read this book! Thank you, Glennon, for helping me understand my Knowing. And that I am. And I can do hard things. You‚Äôre a treasure!"
"I enjoyed listening to the elements of her female, mother, divorced, gay, ex-communicated Christian, being a Feminists, social rights and justice...then towards the end about 70% thru, she totally scooped up the guys and un-cage our hearts too. I loved her unapologetic fierceness and the empowerment to speak up, be YOU/ME, speak your truth and un-program ourselves from beliefs that aren‚Äôt even our own - I‚Äôm doing deep work in this area, so it was especially sweet for me. (Ya, I cried!) haha.  Definitely a great read for men and women alike to bridge the gaps and distances of so many."
"I loved this book!It is so well-written & there are so many insightful observations that will make you (literally) take pause & think about your own life.Some of it is a bit new-agey, which isn‚Äôt really my thing, but there were enough other ‚Äúgems,‚Äù that it didn‚Äôt really matter to me.This book was more like a buffet. Pick and choose which words/thoughts matter to you.For some reason, this book, written in short chapters on varying topics, in seemingly no specific order, just caught my heart. I think it might catch yours too.I would recommend this book!"
What a disappointment. Not worth the money or time. Just a memoir from a woman who has had some challenges. Writing is like high school girls gossiping.
"I actually thought I was getting a fictional book to listen to through my library.  What I had instead was an amazing journey and healing from all the conditioning I got about how to be a ""woman"".  I laughed and cried a lot.  I saw my daughter in a new light.  I immediately ordered the hard copy because I knew to would reread it and sit with passages that went by too quickly in the audio version.  Men, you will understand women so much better if you read this."
"Glennon, you hit it out of the park on this one, sister. I‚Äôve always considered myself a strong person (enneagram 8), but in a lot of ways I was not being true to myself. This book shook loose unmatched relationships, and put words to deep concern and confusion I‚Äôve had for years with my spirituality vs. religion. As I turned each chapter it was like pulling bricks out of a backpack I‚Äôve been carrying around for too long.I‚Äôm a forever fan (and I had some serious eye rolls while reading the 1 star reviews)."
"This book made my insides ache with desire for a bigger, more truer and beautiful life and is a siren call to sink down and get still enough to remember how to come home to oneself. This book has made me feel all the feels. From laughing out loud, to weeping tears of sadness, shame, guilt and envy to exhilaration at the possibility of my own salvation, bubbling rapture witnessing the deep and raw soul love between Abby and G, anger at my own inaction, incarceration and denial on many fronts...it's a wild brutiful edumacational ride in all directions.I am reading much of this to my daughter, who is 11, and the messaging in this book is everything any parent needs to raise wholehearted untamed children (including our own inner child) who know that who they are, exactly as they are is enough, who understand that the bravest thing they can do is listen to and speak what is true inside of them, who realize that no one is free until they belong to themselves and in that freedom they find the courage to fight for those who are not yet free. Although, the downside is that she now wants Glennon and Abby to adopt her ...which may work out great for her (;Glennon is the fiercest, most dangerous bad ass gladiator I know...because she is TRULY free. This book is an instruction manual for self and world liberation and revolution.I feel indebted, grateful, and moved by how raw and honest G shares about her humanity...it makes the ""Yeah but she's rich, famous and beautiful"" sabbotagey excuses harder to swallow. G helps me remember to put one friggin foot in front of the other... it's all here for the taking...for those willing to brave their own wilderness. Bonus...her writing is like liquid honey truth serum.Untamed will make your skin feel too tight and demands an unflinching an honest look at our selves in the most liberating and loving way THANK YOU. I freakin love you and your family."
I hesitated buying this book thinking the hype was overblown and questioned some of these poor reviews.  Finally I just bought it and read it.  I LOVE this book!  I want to buy this book for every woman I know.  I have I bought the Kindle version and now I kinda wish I bought a hard copy too.  So much of what she said in this book spoke to me and resonated with my soul.  I will refer back to this book in the future because this book has so much depth and I will want to revisit things as I go through life.  Do yourself a favor and buy yourself a copy and a copy for a friend!
"I already loved Glennon and follow her on Instagram (and now I am excited everyday about ""Morning Meetings)"". I flew through the book during quarantine and it was such a great place to put my mind to escape the feelings/stress I have had during this time. Many pages I found myself nodding my head and found so many things relatable, but even better than that is finding things to help me be a better ""me"". That is why I am giving it 5 stars, because who doesn't love that feeling!!! I saw a post from Abby that said Glennon reads every comment.....so Hi Glennon!!!"
"Untamed will crack your heart and mind open about what it means to be a woman. What you are taught to think. How you are taught to feel. How you SHOULD be. How you ought to mother. How to work. How to be. How to breathe.Why do women have to get cancer, reach the edge of death, drink themselves into oblivion, suffer in silence, to finally break down the walls and run for the hills?I consider myself a VERY strong and independent woman. I am a feminist and I have worked in a male dominated industry since my early 20s. I have not only passed other men but I have run circles around them. Yet I still found some of my deep-rooted beliefs about myself in this book. I was BLOWN AWAY by every single chapter.  Many chapters left me in tears.To the women writing about how they ""don't trust Glennon"" since her positions and thoughts about her life have changed, I challenge you to ask yourself if we are supposed to be the exact same version of ourself throughout our life. What if our process is evolution into the best version of ourselves?Who cares if she changes her opinion about things after learning more about herself? Why are you shaming her for that? Does women shaming each other contribute in any way to the greater good? Nope, it just decreases our collective power.What if as a woman you have been conditioned to think that you can't change your mind and develop, and that's why all the men in your life seem happier than you do?MUST BE NICE. Think about how often you hear that phrase in your brain. What does it mean to you? Why are you jealous of what other people can and will do?Well, time to start making things nice for you. And you can go ahead and start by buying this book."
"When people think about integrity, they usually think of being honest when they've done something wrong. But integrity is so much more than that, it's also about living a life where your insides match your outsides, where you consciously share your desires and your personal identity with the world.In different ways, women and men alike are CONSTANTLY being told to deny themselves and their true being. For women, it's about being selfless. This book will motivate you to be self-ful in a way that will liberate you, and ALSO the people around you (including your kids if you have any.)The more of us that have the courage to show up as ourselves each and every day, the better this world will get. I truly believe it. Glennon has blazed a path to personal integrity that I hope we all can learn from and emulate in the ways truest to ourselves."
"Why can't I give this 9,000,000 stars?I purchased the audiobook version, which is read by the author. I am so glad I did!  Glennon is relatable, artistic with words, and honors so much that is typically ignored in our cultural conditioning. Each chapter is a short story with a digestable takeaway. I sent a copy to my 60-something mother, and she loved it as well. We agree that this is something we can and will read again, and the content won't be stale. Not simply because it's empowering and funny, but because truth NEEDS repeating. I'm already on my third round. :)I don't regret the audiobook purchase one bit. Wish I could give a copy to every adult human!"
"In this book, Glennon shares her own story of middle-life-awakening in digestible nuggets that are equal parts profound, humorous, relatable, and inspiring.  She vulnerably and poignantly shares her story of reconciliation with herself - and how that has transformed how she shows up in her relationships and in her work. The truth bombs and permission slips that Glennon offers readers through this book transcend specific life circumstances for important personal takeaways.  BUY THIS BOOK - and read it with a highlighter in hand, because there are so many ""think-ons"" to revisit for application in your own life.  As someone who has also navigated significant life change in choosing the truest but harder path, I greatly appreciated Glennon's insights about navigating family relationships with both love and boundaries - and approaching parenting with a commitment to helping our children navigate life rather than shielding them from the messy-necessary layers of being human.  Side note: This is my first ever book review and I'm an avid reader... so, being compelled to share my thoughts on this one is the highest recommendation I can give."
"I've been a fan of Glennon's work since her first book was published. I pre-ordered this book before COVID-19 was even on my radar and anxiously awaited its arrival. It arrived on day 4 of my COVID-19 quarantine.  My heart aches for Glennon not being able to get out and share her masterpiece (book) with her masterpiece (community). That said, I think this is exactly how it was supposed to be. People all over the world are inside their homes walking through the hardest thing they've been through in their lifetimes with this book on their nightstands. It's getting us mothers through full-time work while home-schooling, fears about our finances and health of our families and hurting for the world, but reminding us that we can do hard things! We have to set ourselves free from our cages.  I get goosebumps with each word I read for how right the words are for my heart right now. Thank you, Glennon, for giving the world this gift. You are selah."
You guys...this book. Over the past year I have personally had to face a lot of my demons from childhood and I have changed in so many ways. Focusing on Alchemy...changing my energy to become what I truly am and not what I have always felt the need to be. This book helped me in that and gave me the courage when I started to feel weak. It‚Äôs like she was in my head seeing my thoughts and putting them into words!! Now I teach my 3 girls and myself...we are God Damn Cheetahs! But it...read it...let it sink in. And prepare yourself.
"This book has a fierce vulnerability that every woman should appreciate. Doyle takes us on her journey of discovering herself, embracing all that encompasses, and coming out on the other side profound, brave, and enlightened about the person she was meant to be. She shows us that we must be willing to embrace all the feelings we feel to help us become better mothers, better daughters, sisters, and wives, but most of all better fighters. I urge you to read this book, unleash your inner cheetah, and find out what it truly means to be untamed."
"I had to sit with this one. Read and reread it. Really absorb it. I mean REALLY absorb it.As a trauma psychologist I SEE these words every day. The ability to articulate the impact of being seen is beyond comparison.One of the most life changing books I‚Äôve ever found, on MY journey, is Don Miguel Ruiz‚Äôs The Mastery of Love. Changed my life. This rivals it. If you are a human in the world you need this book. As someone who didn‚Äôt follow Glennon and her story and her work I stumbled on this. I think it was an amazon suggested reading because I liken reading books to my need to eat. Well actually I would probably starve to eat books and have missed many breakfasts and lunches engulfing myself in someone else‚Äôs words. Because words are healing. These words are healing.Thank you Glennon for your healing words."
"I got this book the day it was released. After having read her two previous books, I knew I needed to be in the right head space to absorb this one. That time was now.I'm glad I waited because I was able to really focus on what was written. There were times when reading where she expresses an idea that feels like it came out of my own head but I never had the right words to express it. A light bulb will go off like 'YES! That's it!!!' It's exhilarating to find that in an author.I've added this to my list of favorites.Love this book!"
"This book is everything. As Glennon herself says, life is brutal and beautiful and this book delivers all of that and everything in between. If you haven‚Äôt already read Love Warrior, I recommend you read that first and then Untamed. Glennon‚Äôs writing is absorbing and addicting and watching her grow, intimately, through both books is a precious experience. The format of Untamed is less of the memoir that Love Warrior was and more of a collection of shorter stories and reflections on everything from substance abuse to love to parenting to racism. As I said, everything. With every chapter you fall more in love with Glennon and Abby and learn yourself from their incredible outlooks and perspectives on life.  5 stars for sure, would give it more if I could. Congratulations Glennon!P.S.  The DOORBELL. Oh my gosh I laughed out loud a full on belly laugh. I totally relate!"
"Wherever you are on your journey, Glennon Doyle calls you to feel it. To be fully present with it. To listen to the inner voice you've trained yourself to ignore. You don't have to feel or believe as she does, but its impossible to not feel heard by her within the pages of this book. Its a collection of thoughts and short essays, but it doesn't slow down your progress. its like grazing at a charcuterie display-- delicious little bites that fill you up and you can't stop taking in. I've already recommended it to several friends in the last few days."
"I started this book with zero expectations, as it was recommended to me, and I was unaware of who Glennon was. The structure of the book threw me off, but I think that is just preference. But halfway through the book, and it became increasingly repetitive. I get it, be your wild self, there are no rules to parenting, and feel your ‚Äúknowing‚Äù. She‚Äôd throw in an obvious metaphor before repeating the same lesson she mentioned 40 pages earlier. I also believe this book is catered to women who are either parents, or in their 40‚Äôs wanting to restart. As a 27 year old I wasn‚Äôt particularly inspired, again that was probably my fault for not knowing beforehand."
"I love her story and how honest she is about her struggles. It‚Äôs a great read. The only constructive criticism I have is that I wish she‚Äôd write her stories in order. Her timeline is all over the place, and that makes it a bit confusing.  She‚Äôll go from talking about her previous marriage to her eating disorder to her current marriage and then back to her first pregnancy and then again to her former marriage. It was hard to get a clear picture of what she went through with all of the back and forth. Sweet, inspirational woman, though!"
"After I read Carry On, Warrior, I didn't think it was possible to love Glennon's work any more than I did. And then I read Love Warrior and fell deeper.After I read Love, Warrior, I didn't think it was possible to love Glennon's work any more than I did. And then I read Untamed and I stopped trying to put my feelings in a box because, DAMN, this woman will always exceed my expectations.And I think that is one of the main lessons of her book... when we try to box ourselves, whether it's our emotions, our bodies, our dreams, our love... we're only holding ourselves back.This book is empowering, comforting, and feels as cozy as a night on your couch with your best girlfriends. 10 stars for Glennon"
"I really enjoyed the book. I like that I felt she was very honest, first with herself and the with us the readers, in a very non apologetical way that was fun, refreshing and encouraging.I like her invitation for us to find out true selves, with some pointers about how she did it, but at the same time she leaves enough space for everyone to find their own rythm and time.I think I might need to read it again to let all the wisdom sink in as deep as it needs, but I just couldn't let it down because it was also a very fun read, a window to anecdotes and insights that was very enjoyable while leaving me quite shaken (in very nurturing ways)."
"This book is going to change lives.  This book is a wake up call for those women who have been saying no to themselves over and over, and encouraging them to say YES instead to what their truest selves really desire.  YES, go after that job.  YES, go after that love.  YES, cut off your hair, wear poofy dresses, pierce your nose, get out of that toxic relationship.  YES to LIFE!  You have nothing to lose, especially if you already lost yourself by making yourself small, quiet, and lonely.  Take a chance, take back your life."
"From the beginning, where a Labrador retriever (isn‚Äôt it supposed to be a Greyhound?) and a cheetah (who looks neither right nor left, but this is how they hunt in the wild) chase bait behind a pickup truck, this self-righteous, defensive memoir let me down. Yes, there were snippets of wisdom, but they were overpowered by a kind of preachiness that was cloying and repetitive. Instead of feeling free, I was embarrassed for the author and her family, who at one point were afraid to open the door."
"I couldn‚Äôt wait to get this book after hearing how life changing it had been to others. Plus, I had seen the author on Super Soul Sunday and was impressed by her words. Started the book, and at first,  it was empowering and I couldn‚Äôt put it down, but then something shifted. It seemed to become a little too preachy and focus on the greatness of her new marriage. I‚Äôm very happy for her and that she found her soulmate but I started finding the book redundant and lost a connection with the it.  Finally, I put it down without finishing."
"This book was okay for the most part. There were a lot of parts that were very inspiring but equal parts that quite honestly bored me. I can usually read a book in 1-3 days and this took me a few weeks. It could be because the writing style too you every which way and my mind couldn‚Äôt keep up. I wasn‚Äôt expecting short essay kind of chapters from all different time periods of her life. I could  relate to a lot things though, and some of them I straight up put the book down and lives my life because of it.Honestly, was it the book I was expecting from the rave reviews? No. But was it awful? No. Would I also read it again? Probably not."
"I've read some incredibly profound books, but nothing compares to Glennon Doyle's Untamed.¬† Glennon's every word spoke to my soul.¬† I constantly thought, ""I am this woman.¬† This woman is me.""¬† Although I truly believe Glennon Doyle and I were cut from the same cloth, she is also the voice for all women seeking to live their truest, most beautiful lives.¬† Untamed should be standard reading for all women everywhere, and perhaps for all men seeking to gain a better understanding of the way women think, live, and love.¬†¬†Untamed lit a fire in me.¬† I'm now making it my personal mission to trust in my ""Knowing"" in order to live my truest and most beautiful life always and forever. üíó"
"I didn‚Äôt make it out of my coat or away from the shipping box before I started into this! Been a Glennon fan for a long time now, and each new book she writes reminds me why. She always says The Thing...whatever women are feeling, she knows how to isolate it, name it, and speak truth to it. She gives shape and definition to the abstract funk we all feel swirling around in us. She doesn‚Äôt leave life unexamined, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôll never stop reading her. Elbow bump, G! You made art."
"This is the best book I have ever read in my life. I recommend every mother/woman read this book. Glennon is a national treasure. Raw, real, funny, heartbreaking this book is one where you close the book and then open it back up to page one and read it again...it‚Äôs THAT life affirming. I would give it 10000 stars if I could."
"Feminist. Wise. Genuine and relatable. Spiritual. Progressive. Inspiring. I laughed, I cried, and I had a lot of ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù moments. I have slowly been buying copies for people in my life - 3 so far. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this book. Extremely on point from so many life perspectives/compartments."
"Could not put it down. Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes! Wonderful book that has me rereading chapters slower now, after my first read, to really let it sink in. Read this book and love it because it is SO true, unique, and wonderful. After only a few chapters, I could see myself modifying my behaviors! I‚Äôve been telling my daughter to be herself no matter what. Talking about the definition of being brave with her.  She‚Äôs incredible! I‚Äôve noticed not caring as much about what people think when I‚Äôm just being me. I even started writing down what I HATE and what makes me passionate, so I can go out and change it any way I can. Where there is passion, there is change. Thank you, G, you might have changed my life."
"Glennon Doyle is brilliant in her use of metaphor and her depth of observation and thought. There is not a page that the reader will turn without the discovery of profound insights and life changing ideas. I often found myself within her pages and felt not that I was receiving permission for who or where I was, but that I was receiving confirmation by a woman who had traveled a similar path. I treasured every moment of this reading experience, and then promptly purchased the book for my friends and daughters."
"There really aren't words to describe what this book means to me but I will try. Much of Glennon's journey mirrors my own except she woke up and saw things deeper than I have until reading this book. I've never read words that so embodied what I've felt. Thank you for giving me the words Glennon. I feel like getting to know you better helped me to know me better. What a gift. From one bucket of water to another, until we meet again in the sea, may yours always overflow with love and peace."
"Even though Glennon Doyle is younger than me, LOL, she writes like an older wiser big sister, who happens to be brilliant, fabulous, funny and famous. In no way am I exactly like her, or as cool as her, but she sure gets me.Untamed, to me, is literally like, someone peered into my heart, soul and mind, was able to see me exactly as I am, validate me, understand me, take all my thoughts and iron them out with gentleness, hot truth and wisdom, wrap me in a blanket of healing and protection, pick me up off the floor, dust me off, send me out the door of life with Hope. It empowers me with a sense of purpose and meaning, steadies me with deep roots of understanding and strength beneath my feet, strengthenes me with a solid core and base, and lifts me like light beaming out through my limbs. It feels that good to me. Lol. It is üíØ my jam.  Of course the author Glennon Doyle and I have different particular histories and circumstances, but her writing rings so true to me with such universal wisdom and truth, I feel like everyone could get something out of it. Although I feel it is particularly geared toward freeing women, I love her parenting advice for raising both girls and boys.I believe she considers herself Christian, but the spiritual practice/personal healing techniques/tips/ are so universal.Anyway, this book may not be for everyone, but it is everything to me. if I could honestly, simply, humorously, humbly, and beautifully write my philosophy for universal love and healing, with the wisdom of a million lifetimes, this book would be as close to perfect as I could ever wish for.Suffice it to say, (long story longüòÇüòÇ) I love this book. I have it on audible and solid paper. I will listen to and read the book over and over."
"Easy to read, deceptively challenging, Glennon Doyle‚Äôs latest book not only tells her own story but almost demands that her readers be true to themselves.  Do I agree with everything she believes?  No.  But there is so much truth in what she has written.  I am inspired to be more honest with myself about who I am."
"Dear Glennon, I don't usually write or message, but since we're all home, I thought you might actually read this. Thank you for Untamed. Thank you for sharing how to meditate.  Thank you for teaching me how to look for answers inside myself- I've been getting this message from the universe a lot, b/ c I was looking in all the wrong places. I also learned that just b/c my friends don't return my texts doesn't mean they're dead- more so, that it's selfish of me to expect an immediate response. ;) I see that control= fear; this is me, and now I know what to observe in myself. And change- we all change and/ or become untamed, AND THAT IS OK. Many more lessons learned, I will go back and listen to/reread it. // I bought the hard copy of Untamed about 2.2 seconds into watching your interview with Marie Forleo. But, I wanted to hear YOU, your voice, so I bought the audiobook and downloaded it immediately on Friday. Listening to it over the weekend was a glorious break from Covid, and I found it so calming to listen to your voice... and stories. I'm sorry about your book launch, but what a superb time to have access to all this. Thank you for sharing yourself with the rest of us, and hearing about your love story with Abby is one of my favorites.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Sincerely, Christine P.S. oh my gosh and I forgot about the Chase & cell phones part- YES to all of this.  I had my husband listen to that story b/c we have to have this conversation with my step-daughter.  Just now he said- you didn't tell me this Glennon Doyle was married to Abby Wombach. Now he knows who you are... hahahahaha. ;)"
"It has been a long time since I read a book that hit me so deeply. Glennon's writing is exquisite. I bought not only the audiobook but a hard copy just so I could underline and mark it up. I was not a Glennon devotee like many others. In fact, her earlier work just wasn't my cup of tea.  She hits it, dead on, when she indicated that her prior way of being was still in reaction to a way of being. I think that summed it up for me. I would highly recommend this to anyone seeking their way back home to themselves. Glennon's journey is not warm and fuzzy but it gives off so much light."
"What you must know if this, I only BUY books, once I've read them and determined them to be resources and something I will have for EVER!  The library is my favorite place!  Well, due to COVID-19 the library is closed. So, thanks to Glennon's Instagram and my library's LIbby app, I listened to the first few chapters of Glennon Doyle's Untamed and knew this was going to be something special.  Once Reese Witherspoon announced it for her book club, I ordered the book with a 3 week shipping date. To my pleasant surprise, I received in 1 week.The book jacket is gorgeous and feels like a delicious gel dip manicure! The pages inside are pure magic! Liquid gold. Wisdom only second to Jesus and Oprah.  This book is one for the ages!  Thank you GLENNON!"
"This morning, I finished Untamed  and I sat with it awhile. And then I grabbed a new colored marker, and I opened to page 1 all over again. By page 5 or 6 I was already marking passages again. I have laughed and cried and yelled...I've written in the margins and circled phrases until they are hardly legible. When I feel amiss with the world, and untethered -- I remember I haven't read today and I pick up her book. It brings me back to my heart place, it connects my feet to the ground, it affirms my soul. I am a self-proclaimed self-help/novel devourer, and no book has affected me as much as this has. Thank you for being you, for helping people feel seen in their skin; however it may be."
"Glennon has always been a transformative person and author for me, but this book is her truest, most honest work yet.  I had chills as I read her words.  This may look like a book, but it is an invitation - an invitation to pay attention to the nagging feelings we suppress as women.  It is an invitation back to our truest selves.  With bravery, courage and the kind of fire that is inescapable when we feel ourselves awakening to our own identity, Glennon walks us through her story of becoming, embracing and living fully.Not long ago I read the following review of one of Father Richard Rohr's book from a reader, and I feel like her words apply here exactly:""My soul seemed to recognize (or somehow remember?) the words on these pages. Like I had known it all long ago but have somehow forgotten and was now being pointed back to what I always knew-what I always was.""You can't read this kind of book and walk away from it without some degree of inner change.  It took courage for her to write it (and live it!), and it will take courage for us as readers to pay attention to the things inside of us that this book is bound to stir up.  This book is a gift to women and for the wild times we find ourselves in. Glennon, I didn't think it was possible to love and respect you more, and yet I find that I do after drinking in these words...words that will set freaking women free if we let them. Thank you for putting yourself and your work out into the world for us to inhale and be changed by. For such a time as this, sister.  For such a times as this."
"Whew. My name is Patricia, but my friends call me Patty. I am named after my mom's mom and I feel that this is important to reveal because, throughout the entire book, I've had a connection to Tish, Glennon's daughter.  I know, I know, this book is about Glennon and her life and her and Abby's adorable AF love story (which I loved and still love that), but there's something about the fierce and mighty Tish that I just loved. So the Elmer's chapter. I was doing fine and well and hadn't sobbed while reading the book. Sure I had gotten misty-eyed and lol-ed at other parts, but nothing tug on my heartstrings like this one. Growing up I was my mama's 'little C swimmer'. I'm fairly certain that no one thought I would become a division one collegiate swimmer, but I did. I did because I like to do hard things.  That moment when Glennon looked at Tish said, ""I believe in you, Tish. This is a hard thing to do. We can do hard things."" (291). Just like Glennon, just like Tish, and Abby, and the students I teach, and the friends I have. We like to do hard things. We can do hard things. We can do hard things like get through these moments. The ones we are in right now. I believe in the divine timing of this book. More now than ever. I also believe that the ending of the Elmer's chapter should be reflected about even more. Tish is the kind of girl that holds her team together. That reaches out and texts her teammates after games to uplift them. Her coach commented that she wanted to call her Elmer's because the ball sticks to her, but I think she is Elmer's because she holds people together.Thank you for your work, Glennon. I am a middle school teacher who has struggled with body dysmorphia and eating disorders for a portion of my life. While I read your book I thought of several tweens and teens who would benefit from your work. Your book reminded me that I'm not too crazy. And to embrace the parts of me that are.  I don't need to be tamed. I don't need to be a filtered version of myself. I can be Patty. I can do hard things. Blessings to you and your family during this time."
"I have recommended this book to everyone I know. I've bought copies as gifts for friends and family and even my mother.  It has shaken me to my core, and from that I have emerged less tamed than ever before... in a good way. From the first chapter, I understood the universal feeling that lives under the surface of us all. The yearning for a ""life more beautiful than this."" And yet, with each line, it becomes more and more clear that we all have the power within us to change our thought pattern, even the trajectory of our lives, when we stop living by anything other than what we KNOW in our hearts to be true. Every woman on earth has something to learn, if not everything to learn, from these eloquent, magical, gently inspiringly BADASS words. Glennon, you are truly the epitome of a woman to admire. I love you. Thank you for changing me."
"I absolutely loved this book.  I usually try to read fiction books to you know escape my life but on occasion, I read a biography, and I was super impressed with Glennon.  Her upbeat personality shines through on each page.  She teaches you many lessons and really helps you see yourself in such a better light.  She inspires me to lose myself - or the person I am trying so hard to be - and just let me be as I am.  There is nothing wrong with me.  Definitely recommend reading this book!"
"It took me months to read this book. My soul wanted to devour it in one sitting, but there was so much truth, so much honesty that I had to put it down and let parts marinade for days and days to really get them. Glennon sings songs that you can either repeat the lyrics because they are sewn together so well, or you can deconstruct the lyrics and really objectively evaluate and they will dismantle what you know and challenge your thought processes. Everything I want to grow into is bookended between the covers of this book."
"I didn‚Äôt finish this book. I really liked it at first and then halfway through became too pushy and and religious for me. I liked the first half though, but then was too pushy for me."
"There were a few gems by this author but the rest felt narcissistic and dramatic to me. I can appreciate the struggle with addiction as well as some mental illness issues but it felt like a broken record ‚Ä¶ and believe me, we understand living through the broken record life. Maybe since we are living out ground hog day over here I wasn‚Äôt especially drawn into her drama.  I struggled to finish the book and only went the distance since it was a pick for our book club."
"Hands down the best book I‚Äôve written! I recently wanted to get back into reading and noticed Reese Witherspoon has a book club! This one was in it, and it had great reviews! This book was a read! The author talks about her life and tells story‚Äôs that have happened and how she basically looked to herself and was true to her. Every moment was a turning point of reflection for her. The book was inspiring. I feel it is really powerful and can really speak to the younger crowd like older teens-25 but honestly it is a must read and deserves to be sitting on every girl or woman‚Äôs book shelf. I already know I‚Äôll be reading this book more than once."
"Over the years I've paid close attention to how Glennon has made good on her truth telling. Like the fall before an event I saw her & Abby at where she said on a podcast‚Ä¶‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs most important to me right now‚Ä¶is getting my butt home so I can figure out what love is (insert the BEST giggle EVER). That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so happy right now. Yeah‚Ä¶Yeah...I feel really FREE and LOVED and EXCITED. Like I‚Äôm twelve years old. And it feels like a really really hard fought for gift. Ya know. I‚Äôm more excited about THAT part‚Ä¶of figuring out that part of my personal life than I‚Äôve ever been about anything.‚Äù Well, she has made good on that very truth telling. This book wasn‚Äôt just inspiring and motivating- it was Tangible. Relatable. Relevant. It activated real-life hope within me. That the take-aways can easily be applied. Her story here made me FEEL seen, heard, and UNDERSTOOD. And it helped me peel back layers I didn‚Äôt even know existed. For 14 years I have had the same favorite book until today. This is now my favorite book I‚Äôve read as an adult. I‚Äôve had this book in my hand for four days. I have read this book in the passenger seat so that I could read more pages riding down there road. I read it aloud on the floor of my gym to women in my circle. At the bookstore. Late at night where I insisted on waking my sister up at almost 1am demanding she read all.the.words. as soon as possible. My best friend has watched allllll the interviews with Glennon that I‚Äôve been obsessed with the book made its way into the world. I could go on & on. As for the title...I think I was born #untamed so I didn‚Äôt think I needed much help in that department. Well let me just say this: all these years later, I still have a lot more #untaming to do. And this book will be one of my many guides. I can‚Äôt recommend it enough. I cried over and over and over again. Thank God."
"Likes: It‚Äôs a quick read. I made it through 250 pages in a matter of hours. She starts out with some genuinely unique ideas about being authentic to yourself.Dislikes: There‚Äôs no real cohesion between any of the chapters, and after about 100 pages, I just started to feel annoyed by her constant use of metaphor. Who sees a cheetah at the zoo and immediately thinks about how, like the cheetah, they‚Äôre trapped in their own life? And maybe let the reader discover some of those themes for themselves - giving us the metaphor, then spelling out the meaning behind the metaphor is redundant."
"Glennon's writing and way of connecting is so wholehearted; I feel like every word of this book is meant for and speaking directly to me. I fell in love with her from ""Love Warrior"" - re-reading and underlining so many passages - and even though the conclusion of that book was upended and lead beautifully to ""Untamed"", the lessons remain the same and are more relevant now than ever: Feel all your feelings, even the hard ones, you will survive the pain and enter a more beautiful and truer life. It is incredible that our society, and the structures in it, teach us that life should be easy, that success looks like x,y,z, that we should all be happy - I am so grateful to Glennon for countering these norms, giving space to a different way of thinking and FEELING, and letting those of us who do face challenges know that we are not alone. She does write a bit about God / religion and parenting, and even as someone without children and non-religious, I still find her ideas profound, thought-provoking, and relevant in other areas of life. I cannot wait for the day that a generation is raised with the emotional tools to weather hardship, in a society more accepting of humans and their feelings, and see what magic arises. In the meantime, Glennon Doyle inspires us to keep going and is infinitely wise. Recommend to everyone, no matter what stage of life or your circumstances, you will learn - OR FEEL - something."
"This book was a big let down. The fist 1/3 of the book was great and I was all in, then I started to see Glennon Doyle as more of a woman willing to do anything for fame and something to write about. Her writing does not seem sincere, more to me like she is living her life the way she lives it just so she can write about it. She seems to strive for attention and thrive off of the glorification she gets from the charities she is involved with. I don‚Äôt with any of my being believe she is who she claims to be and I do not feel she has any genuine advice to offer me for my life."
"If you're unsure, I recommend reading a sample first (which I hadn't done - nor had I heard of Glennon before or read anything of hers prior).  I'm just not a fan of the writing style.  I had heard a lot of rave reviews for this and the summary sounded like it would be an engaging and helpful, but I'm afraid it's just not for me."
"Coming clean with yourself - step one!Sharing your discoveries - step 2!FREEDOMHonesty and transparency is really important now!Saw Glennon in an interview about her book. She seems to hit the bullseye about shaking off life's inner critic ""shoulds"", and rediscover yourself from the Soul out... UNTAMED! When I gift it to my 20s daughter and to have her tell me with some excitement that it was on her short list of books to read... ? Priceless. :)"
"Ok, so I‚Äôm a huge fan of Glennon and have been waiting for this book to come out ever since she first teased it on her instagram. Once I got it,I felt afraid to open it- not knowing what truths she would show me that would probably make me question decisions I‚Äôve made/am making. But Glennon would say to face that fear so one night I decided to open it after putting my baby down for bed and I‚Äôm so glad I did. I finished within 24 hours, and highlighted the parts that spoke to me along the way. I ended up with a book that is now mostly highlighter. Her candor about anxiety and her ‚Äòknowing‚Äô I found incredibly insightful. Funny, heartbreaking, and soul nourishing- those are the words I would use to describe this book. Buy it, read it, tell all your friends to do the same!"
"This book is widely acclaimed and I am not sure I could add anything original to the millions of reviews.  That said, Glennon's honesty, humility , humor and storytelling finesse make this an enjoyable read.  It made me think about the fluidity of life and how changing, growing, adapting with love and tolerance is the most admirable quality in a person.  She is using her voice to make the world a more kind and tolerant place - so for that, Thanks, Glennon!"
"Five months ago, I became a first-time mom to a little girl.  Before she was born, my husband and I took all the childbirth and newborn classes (etc), and they helped us tremendously. However, I still feel anxious when I think about raising my girl, both because of the world's issues and my own. This book really helped me understand why and how to prioritize myself better so that she learns how to do the same. Thank you for this honest and captivating and no-bullshit book, Glennon!"
"I was sorely disappointed at the end...because it ended. I laughed almost cried, shocked, upset, uncomfortable and elevated. It's a book about a woman but more than that it's really a book about the human soul. Uncomfortable truths, insights, epiphanies, angry, resentment, jealously, joy, love, sex. She opened her heart to the world and said 'Whatever, be mad or happy about me, I don't care' Please get the audio. I can't even fathom reading this. You have to hear the author herself."
"I found the book to be the exact story I needed as I embark on the next 40 years of my life post-divorce and small children (teenagers now). It is filled with not only truth, but courage and strength. Courage to look deeply into what we as women have been told to embrace about our place in society, famly life, and relationships. Strength to determine what needs to change in order for oneself to be the person they know they are not only capable of being, but doing so in order to become free and generously feeling person with a plan to care for the big feelings many of us have. This book gives us not having only permission, but  the knowledge to do what is best for oneself and the basis for why that is better for everyone we hold dear. Removing the idea that martyrdom or selflessness for women means love and provides a re-energizing gentle push toward what many of us know but often push away from....that choosing our happiness and freedom in living as women,  moms, daughters, sisters, friends, employees, romantic partners, etc. not only makes oneself a better human but a powerful force and example to others (for me the most important example I set is for my children which Glennon provides significant information on as well) of how demonstrating our powerful gifts and abilities can change not only oneself but those around us. That those choices that seem difficult to make can not only make us more free, they are actually a roadmap for teaching our sons and daughters to live as adults. Our children and those significant to us begin to understand that by choosing yourself means allowing your passions, your work, your leisure activities, your formal and non-formal education, etc. to allow you the freedom and knowledge to be the impactful person you are in a extremely positive manner. Giving them all the example and permission many seem to need in order to do so because of the many messages we learn from our families and society and how we process them. This is all done without blaming our society or our parents/families and rather by owning how we interpreted those messages and how they impacted us as individuals. If you are struggling, have struggled, or might struggle with a relationship, a career choice, a parenting issue, anxiety/worry, liking control too much, or feeling guilty for wanting more beauty from your life...Untamed by Glennon Doyle will fill you up with the goodness of wanting more knowing, more freedom, less martyrdom, less control, and the ability to know we can all do hard things!"
"One of the worst books I‚Äôve ever read - self-aggrandizing, preachy, and judgey as hell. Can‚Äôt even finish and now have to resell. Liz Gilbert has said it all before & far better - without the pompous ‚ÄúI have all the answers‚Äù sales game. Someone owes me $20 and my Sunday back."
"Oh the hype!  Sorry folks, I just couldn't figure this out. Sometimes I jump on the bandwagon and feel like I've wasted 20$, and with these short rambling chapters, I was left shrugging to myself 'oh well'.  I think I wanted to know more about Abby since I've watched her for years, maybe that's why I was disappointed?  Save your money!"
"I was compelled to write this review after finding out that the author reads ALL of them.I just wanted her to know (and you dear future reader) that this is the best book that I have read in YEARS! Quite literally, the second after I turned the last page, I handed it to my sister to read. (She has since reported back to me to say that she can not put it down)I loved the raw intimacy that Glennon had created through her carefully woven text. You feel like you are truly a fly on the wall of the anecdotes that are her life- and the true wisdom and insight that he has gained from them. I have learned, and have come to more healthy realizations about my own life through her writing.Please, please, PLEASE read this. You won‚Äôt regret it!"
"I was completely taken at first. I loved her stories, her wisdom, her insights. Then, in the middle-ish part I feel I was being lectured to, told how to think, feel, be. I know how to be. She knows how to be and says so but it's her being, not mine. So I quickly flipped through the lectures until it felt like she settled down and began again to talk about ""her"" story instead of telling. So it ended like it started, interesting, insightful, wise. The middle was meh."
"As a therapist I've recommended this to any client who'd listen!  Same to friends and family, bought a copy for my college aged niece--anyone can benefit and/or get a good self-accepting laugh. So easy to read, intelligent, funny, engaging.  Great messages without any preaching."
"Like many of the other reviewers, I didn't bother finishing the book. There is nothing about the writing that draws you in. Most of it comes across as fiction being passed off as personal experience. Really disappointing."
"If I‚Äôm honest, I was so excited to receive this book the day it came out. But then I immediately became scared.When I ordered it six months ago, the blurb told me it was going to answer some hard questions I was asking. I was asking these questions of myself, of everyone around me. I was googling and talking to friends and scheduling meetings with people to discuss this decision.A small voice inside me keeps telling me the answer, but it‚Äôs scary. It‚Äôs the unknown, it‚Äôs fear, it‚Äôs financial insecurity, it‚Äôs what if this is the wrong decision and I can‚Äôt ever go back.The prologue of Untamed brought me to tears. By ‚Äúalgorithms‚Äù, I was nodding and crying.Reese Witherspoon said she read this book like she was eating a decadent dessert - I could not agree more. I savored each short chapter as it had so much to tell me and so much to consider. I will be picking it up and reading it again and again.Glennon has once again spoken deeply into my soul. Now I just need the courage to take the leap for myself. I have all of the answers, they have always been inside of me. And I have one wild and precious life to live those answers out.Thank you thank you thank you, Glennon, for once again providing me with the gift of your life story and a deeper understanding of myself through this."
"I went to Forestry school I the early 70's , married had children,..thought I was going to be an earth mother forest ranger...I was naive, I guess too early in a man's world.The hardest criticism when I tried to keep working in my field came not from men, but from the world of women. This book Untamed would have been a comfort , a great comfort. I am almost 70, three incredible daughters, I  have not been successful at marriage. But am beginning to realize my life has been extremely challenging but one of integrity. I have lived by my guts.  In my 40's and 50's I was passionately married to a man who shared my life completely. When that ended I had to learn to love and hold myself. To stay true to one's wildness you must be able to stand alone yet still continue to let love flow in and out. That gets tough when there is no one there to reflect your love, ( never ask your kids to be this kind of love replacement), butthe ""knowing"" is inside each of us. Thank you for UNTAMED, you have made a toughold lady feel hopeful"
"Amazing job Glennon!! As a lesbian who began her life dating men as well reading your story of your trials and tribulations coming out, having a broken marriage with a husband and learning to let go, being a mom who just wants to do right by her kids this book was unbelievably empowering and heart felt. Very thought provoking with her views on parenting and learning to be a better person not just for yourself but for your kids. Absolutely LOVED this novel so glad I took the time to read this!!"
"Some of the sentiments in the book were great and caused me to pause and think. But the book itself is written in some kind of strange squirrel like manner. Trying to follow all the pieces was annoying. I get the push for feminism and being oneself, believing in oneself, pursing dreams, goals, etc. I‚Äôm just not understanding why this book is considered such a great book and on notable Best Seller and Book Club lists. I think it was ok, at best."
"Here‚Äôs my thought, this book is the story a woman is bravely sharing about her life. She knows her path is not universally accepted. In her first books, she was living for acceptance of her audiences. This book is different. Sure, sometimes pendulums swing too far. And sometimes obedience to God looks a hell of a lot like sin to those who are living outside of that relationship. Are there points she makes I don‚Äôt agree with? Sure. Is it a vulnerable and beautiful sharing of her life? Absolutely. Glennon‚Äôs writing is ripe with connection to her readers. It always has been. That doesn‚Äôt mean readers need to accept her narrative as the absolute way or truth. Her writing says to do the opposite. Her narrative is to go deep and connect directly with the Holy Spirit and to let the spirit guide your life. And that is something a lot of women who have been conditioned to ignore their ‚Äúgut‚Äù ie: the spirits promptings, can relate to. This book is about her self discovery. It‚Äôs also about shedding all the layers and pressures of societal conditioning and seeking a very real and personal relationship with the creator of the universe. I stand with Glennon in this. She loves Jesus. And she‚Äôs learned that loving Jesus and loving herself don‚Äôt need to be outside of each other. That‚Äôs a beautiful message."
"Profound. The writing, intimacy, insight into her life is phenomenal. This book, although written from Glennon Doyle‚Äôs perspectives on her life, love, being and change is written in such a way as to invite the reader to examine his/her/they own live, love and being in order to make life the absolute best it can be and what you want it to be. I am grateful for the presence of this book in my life - as with most everything - perfect timing."
"Glennon does it again.Untamed is a beautifully written book.It‚Äôs been a comfort and joy to read while in quarantine.First the pain, then the waiting, then the rising. So helpful to remember whether going through a divorce or the Coronavirus.Glennon gets us through it all!I liked the essay format of this book. Different from what I‚Äôm used to, but it worked well!I will be purchasing more copies for friends and family."
"So many good reviews but I took nothing from this book. Found it rather depressing, one can have a sad story and share their story to inspire others but I felt this book keeps you in a dark space the entire time. Eat,pray, love had me feeling every emotion possible, empathy, sadness, laughter and hope. This book however did not. Knowing though how we are all uniquely different others have enjoyed it so to each it‚Äôs own."
The book is an easy read and lots of great short stories. Sometimes felt a bit all over the place with no real rhyme or reason but appreciated it nonetheless. I think it could have been edited to be shorter but overall the many great takeaways were worth the read.
The fact that the main character was willing to change from being controlling out of insecurity to being open minded is very Unusual.  I would think that letting those around her be themselves without giving direction is one of the most difficult personality changes to make.  She finally learned that giving each person the ability to find and be themselves.both she and they had friendlier relationships.
"Ok. Phew! Figured out how to find ""leave a review"" on this thing. Jesus take the wheel.Glennon, I was gonna write you a letter but I just read Abby's message on IG and she said put it on here and here I am!Thank you for all of your books. All of your words. All of your guts spilled out for us to see. You haven't stopped spilling your guts and you haven't stopped growing. Hello, your books are going to ""read"" different over the years. You're doing life right.  Each of your books have spoke to my soul in different ways as I am in different walks of life. I have a butt load of books on and in my nightstand that I just read and re read and flip to certain sections when I need to. Each of those books looks like they have been on a crazy ass adventure and back at least a few times. And now! Now my copy of Untamed is getting rugged. She is part of my field guide - pages folded, corners tucked and pen marks throughout!I mean. Seriously. Each section turned a light bulb on in my head! Seeing past situations clearly for the first time. Truly understanding myself more. This book is a sigh of relief.  I am so mother freaking thankful for this book.  Thank you"
"I‚Äôve read and enjoyed every book Glennon has written but this one is, by far, my favorite. Part memoir, part poetry, 100% all the things I needed hear at this point in my life. This book has changed the way I perceive the world, the messages I receive from society,  and their impact on what I believe about the world and myself. There are some things that you don‚Äôt know you need to know until you know them, and this book was littered with things like that for me. I can not recommend this one enough! Buy a copy for yourself, your mom, and your daughters!"
"This book is unlike any book I have read in my life yet. First in format, I loved how the short chapters felt like walking through someone‚Äôs vivid memories. It didn‚Äôt read like a regular book and I think that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not a book, in the traditional sense. Untamed is a collection of evolutionary growth in; mind, body, and spirit.In content, Glennon told my story. I could never read more than a chapter or two at a time because of the emotional triggers I felt from reading her words. I had to let them sink in and digest.Now, I have read other reviews on here which give one star for many different reasons including; format, content, and the fact that this new book doesn‚Äôt align with her previous. I truly believe this book is written for those people. We are humans, and we have lost our humanity. We do not hold the same beliefs from year to year, let alone from decade to decade. Unless of course we have been tamed to believe that this is as good as it gets. Nothing changes if nothing changes.This book shows me that the beauty in life is within us. When we commit to showing up authentically, we change our reality.Thank you Glennon."
"I could have high!lighted every word written in this book. Glennon Doyle is an inspiration to all humankind. And reading this book for me with all the turmoil and injustices occurring in our nation has been a revelation to me. I detest racism and unequal treatment of all creatures. I am not a racist, but after reading this book, how much more cleansing of inbred racism I need personally to achieve. I shall strive everyday for the rest of my life to truly be an equalizer for all God's creation!!!"
"I bought this book last year and finally got around to starting it and I am disappointed already.First of all, I believe it was way over hyped.Second of all, I had no idea how the set up of the book was. It‚Äôs in very shorts 1-3 page ‚Äústories‚Äù or basically just ‚Äúthoughts‚Äù. Although that makes for a fast and easy read, the ‚Äúchapters‚Äù don‚Äôt intertwine as fluent and aren‚Äôt very cohesive in any way. I will admit some sections I loved and were empowering. However others just came off unfinished, vague, or trying too hard to be deep without any real substance.  Someone else mentioned the structure made it feel like just her diary and now I get what they meant.Lastly I hadn‚Äôt realized she had such worldly views and we just don‚Äôt have the same beliefs on certain subjects. Lesson learned though. Next time I‚Äôll research the author and the book more before just following what‚Äôs trending. I am only around page 60 and probably won‚Äôt finish it.Wish I could return it but I purchased it so long ago. Darn. I would still recommend people read it for themselves because everyone‚Äôs preference is different. It just was not for me."
"I pre-bought this book but couldn‚Äôt wait so I also bought the audible version. I have listened to it THREE times (is that wrong??). I have loved G‚Äôs other books but this one, THIS one speaks to my soul. I started crying 5 minutes in, and continued to throughout, mixed in with fits of laughter and aha moments. She is so authentic, speaks from her heart and tells it like it is. So many nuggets of truth and her stories are priceless!I‚Äôve already bought three more copies for friends; it‚Äôs required reading as far as I‚Äôm concerned. I myself am still healing from living a small life, and this book woke something up. Bless you and thank you Lady G. Everyone else, go get this book!!!"
"I was drawn to the book because of its summary. I expected a new take on the old theme of ""be yourself""; I'm disappointed and skimmed the second half of the book. I can see that this book can inspire younger women who are just figuring themselves out. I've lived a life (I'm 73) and don't find Doyle's concept revolutionary.  She repeats herself and sadly doesn't delve into relationship building with her new partner. I gave it a 3-star, because the book may be of value to others. Doyle's writing style is easy, geared to average readers but not thought stopping."
"This should be required reading for all women.  The first time I read it, I read a copy I borrowed from a friend, then decided I needed to buy a copy for myself just to HAVE. I've since read it two more times and gifted it to 7 people. While reading it, I found myself every couple of pages needing to close the book and just pause because something I had just read was so real and profound that it overwhelmed me with the sense that I had to take a break and process before moving on. As someone who is not very religious, this is as close to a religious text as I have. There are so many beautiful lessons and messages that apply to so many different problems women face. Glennon gives words to my heart and hurt that I couldn't string together myself, and in doing so validates the pain, loneliness, yearning, and feeling of unworthiness that we all often feel- then she SHATTERS all of it. Glennon unlocks all the cages we are trapped in (whether we realize it or not), OR RATHER she gives us the courage and the bravery to kick that s*** open ourselves. Buy it, read it, pass it on. We can do hard things."
"I read it two days after quarantine started. March 15 2020 and I couldn‚Äôt put it down. I craved it. I sobbed. I scribbled. I yelled. I clawed at the cage. I called my girlfriends and let them know I had ordered them all a copy and then each of my sisters as well. I would have let my daughters read my copy but I had written so many notes that would become even more relevant months later. You see your book, SAVED ME. I didn‚Äôt know to ever trust my knowing. I asked my therapist to read it as we discussed it over telaheath and I couldn‚Äôt shake that something wasn‚Äôt right in my life. I learned yoga and read books. Someone else didn‚Äôt.July 5 my whole world fell apart. My knowing knew all along.So now I gather my five babies and we remember who we are: I look at the oldest two and say ‚Äúyou are God damn cheetahs ‚Äú and we will survive this.Thank you Glennon.As we are now probably going to enter into another quarantine and it‚Äôs now September. It‚Äôs time to read it again. Because it‚Äôs time to remember who I am too."
"Wow. I laughed, I cried, I shouted ‚ÄúHELL F-ING YES‚Äù and when it was over I was devastated. I‚Äôve sent this book to over 10 women in my life, urging them to just pick.it.up. I‚Äôve received text messages, phone calls and emails thanking me for ‚Äúchanging their lives‚Äù. But all the THANKS goes straight to Glennon Doyle. Her writing style is deeply psychological... a stream-of-consciousnesses journey that makes you feel as if you‚Äôre living inside her head watching her thoughts rattle inside a pinball machine. It‚Äôs exhilarating and exhausting and sometimes you‚Äôre forced to put it down because you have some serious reflecting to do.And yes, your husband SHOULD be scared. And Glennon, if and when you read this (I saw your IG post this morning), please know that your words have legit changed my life. And the people around me can feel it and see it and their scared. You know why? Because I‚Äôm a GD cheetah and they f-ing should be.All the praise!"
"I didn‚Äôt know what I was getting into when I read this book. I just knew it was a Glennon Doyle book and I needed something to read that wasn‚Äôt heavy nonfiction. Turns out, this wasn‚Äôt an easy read...well, it was easy *to* read, but much more challenging to process. However, as always with Glennon Doyle‚Äôs work, I was able to reflect inwardly abd challenge myself to recognize my own greatness and how I can live fuller and truer to myself...which was exactly what I needed."
"This was recommended by my therapist a few weeks ago who believes I‚Äôve been Mis-diagnosed my entire life, and that I might just be different the same way that Glennon Doyle is. I‚Äôm glad I read this, I literally fee stronger and after recently conquering my own addiction and becoming more used to being sober, this book makes me want to start taking responsibility and affective action in my own life. Good book for people (30s and LOST) trying to figure out who you are supposed to be now that your kids don‚Äôt need you as much. <3"
"Your wife Abby (who is also an amazing writer--- GOOOO WOLFPACK!) said that you read every review. I actually have never read any of your books Glennon. I knew your story and respected you but haven't held your book in my hands. I am SO HAPPY that untamed was my first one. I am SO HAPPY that you are brave enough to be real. We have such few examples of authentic, courageous untamed women who are willing to lay it all out unapologetically for the world to see. These women exist mind you but they don't usually have the resources to be heard or by the time they are heard the system crushes out their ability to be real. As an empath myself I feel so sad that you are not able to do your book tour and see in the many faces of the women you would have met that would have thanked you in person. For that reason I am telling everyone I know, male and female to read this. I am posting about it on social and sharing your posts. Thank you Glennon. Thank you Abby. Thank you for showing women how to CHOOSE THEMSELVSE FIRST. I already told my 13 year old the words I have never once heard or read: You should sooner disappoint the whole world than disappoint yourself."
"Glennon's story of her lifelong evolution into who she is becoming is authentic and honest. It is inspiring when she brings her story into the broader culture and gives us a lens through which to view our culture's misogyny, racism, homophobia, etc., etc., and how that has shaped each of us through our accidental but unpreventable consumption of these systems of oppression. Parting the veil to help us understand the power structures that benefit from these systems, she empowers each of us to begin to untangle our own complicity and our own suffering.Equally important to me were the sections where she discusses mothering, both her particularly children and relationships with them and evolution, and the idea and cost of motherhood as martyrdom. I have much to think about, both in terms how I mother and the fear that surrounds me when I think about making a change.There is so much more I could say, but I will simply say this is a brilliant, beautiful, meaningful book. I will return to it again and again. And I will share it with my daughters as they grow into women shackled by our cultural sicknesses in the hope that they will know themselves and break the systems."
this book was good and interesting but a read that jumped around to so many different timelines it was a bit frustrating.  I felt a couple of times as the story needed to just keep going and moving forward.  It repeated a lot of the story throughout...  I am thinking it was an import life moment that it was restated several times.
"This book... I read it, then listened on audible... now I will read again and mark it, highlight it, dog ear pages, and take notes and write thoughts in the margins... so many truths in here! Some simple, but so valuable... some truths call for deep reflection and change. Thank you Glennon for being open and sharing your truth and your art with those of us that are hungry. Thank you for the bread crumbs along life‚Äôs path. We are in this together and I thank you for your part!If you‚Äôre still reading this just buy the damn book already!"
"I loved how incredibly brave and open Glennon is.  Reading this book was painful, personally, made me angry, I set it down and walked away and said she is crazy! I'm sorry Glennon.  For the next few days all I could think about was...  Everything I had read!!!!  Having to use my God given brain and listen to my knowing!!!!I have realized at 62 I'm last on the totem pole!!!  Why? For what? No longer!I'm just rambling on.  But man, one of, if not the best book I have ever read.  I'm starting to read it for the second time except I'm using a hi lighter this time. I'll be journaling as well!  I give this book 10 stars!"
"Glennon is an absolutely phenomenal writer. There are times in this book that the pain she poured on the page was too great for me to keep reading and I had to put it down for a bit. After talking to my own sponsor,  I realized it was because I wasn't to the recovery part yet.  Glennon's story of pain, struggle and then redemption helped me see that I too can feel the pain and be okay.  This pain is what creates the beautiful things about who I am and what I am capable of.  She helped me see a new identity for myself. It wasn't even new it was already there the whole time. After years of receiving messages that I'm not enough, or I'm too much I've discovered it was all a lie. Thank you Glennon."
"FANTASTIC. But please revise the synopsis. This is not a book for women. This is a book for EVERYONE. This is just such an inspiring, motivating, worldview-shaking text. Men deserve this as much as women and we should live in a world where men want it as much as women and we laid that for them. Self discovery and improvement  is not a solely feminine option. Goodness knows We want a world full of happy actualized men, as well. We can all be happy and grow and this book is a brilliant instruction manual for how to relish growth."
"I loved this book.  I loved how it made you stop and think and question the way in which you believe and all aspects of that.  There were parts that I felt got to be very over the top and as she wants to you think on your own, it seemed as she wanted you to think and align yourself with her.  This book made me ok and at peace with certain decisions I had made as she made some very good points.  Easy, great read."
"I love this author's insight. She acknowledges her growth, her strengths, her faults, and relates well with her audience. This book wasn't life changing so much as life affirming. It felt like talking to a friend who reaches out to you, takes your hand, and says you know you. As weird as that sounds that's assuring, vindicating 5 stars for Glennon Doyle on being a cheetah and encouraging others to be CHEETAHS as well. Beautiful book!"
"Glennon, you did it again!!!Untamed was an amazing experience! As I read this book I felt connected to her and all the woman who were becoming untamed cheetahs. It was as if Glennon came into my house. She told me her stories and sat with me. While I thought about how my life ran parallel to everything I was reading!I realized my life was experience after experience of dirty pink bunnies. I felt my heart break open. I swear Glennon was cheering me on ""but then the rising!!""I am learning to sink into myself because it is only inside of me that I can tell the difference between what I want and what I have been taught to want. This is probably the greatest gift I have ever been given! This book is a permission slip to stop needing anymore permission from anyone! I get to be me! I believe therapists everywhere will be handing this book out as a Ptsd handbook. I really believe this is the key to connecting the mind back to the body! At least that's what it is doing for me!I will be giving this book to every woman in my life! I have read it twice!"
"I found this book to be part memoir, part self help, part life coaching and pretty damn inspiring and beautiful. I love the authors perspective on the world, her life and feelings. At some points it was a little heavy on the spirituality for me but wasn‚Äôt unbearable and was easy to get through. I just thought it was a cool story with grounded wisdom from a woman who has lived through some shit and learned a lot doing so."
"This book changed my life. I have now given copies to at least 10 other women in my life and I'm reading it to my 12yo daughter at night.This book stirred something deep within me. Not only does Glennon write well, but it's like she is telling directly to my soul!She has given words to thoughts and ideas I never was able to articulate before.If you are 'stuck' and ready to find yourself for the first time or again, you NEED this book!"
"I am half way through- almost every other page is dog-eared. The nuggets of wisdom, vulnerability and beauty are EVERYWHERE. Please get this book !!! Thank you, Glennon, for sharing such a moving testimony and call to arms for us to become who we were meant to be. After only reading a few chapters, I ordered copies for my mother and my sister so that we can read together. The transformation that ‚ÄòUntamed‚Äô persuades us to undergo is huge for individuals and even more impactful when we do it with the ones around us. My heart hurts that her book tour was cancelled, but i trust Untamed will be a huge success regardless. Thank you Glennon! I‚Äôm so happy I found your voice and will never stop supporting you, cheering you on, or being grateful for you sharing your life with us. I saw via Instagram that you read these- and i hope my review brings you a little hug. Abby spoke at my graduation in 2018 and that is how I found you. The wolf pack is thriving, watching out for each other, and getting untamed ASAP. You both are massive inspirations and i am so so lucky and thankful i got to see you two at 92Y! blessings, Love and trust. -Alexa"
I was excited to start this book as it gripped me right away. Then I realized it was getting repetitive and down right boring.  I felt I was forcing myself to pick it up as I just wanted it finished.  I personally did not enjoy this book as it did not keep me engaged.
"This book made me feel less alone. About half way through my first reading I got out the highlighter, then I read it again to make sure I didn‚Äôt miss anything I wanted to highlight in the first half but mostly just to read it again, then I lent it out, then gifted 2 copies to friends, then purchased the audiobook because I needed to hear it again before the lent out copy made it back to me. Every time I want to hang out with someone who JUST GETS ME, I‚Äôll return to this book. Thank you, Glennon."
To watch Glennon evolve over the years has been a gift to me.  I read another review that was frustrated because Glennon seemed to be dismissing what she wrote in previous books.  I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs dismissing anything‚ÄîI think she had layer by layer grown outward from what was inside. That was always speaking in her other books.  It‚Äôs just clearer now for her. And I get that so much.  So much of this book is a clearing away of all the external crap that defines me which I have been doing resolutely for two years now.  Glennon speaks with Gold guts. Thank you as always. Keep writing. Keep growing. We all benefit for the hard work you do each day.
"There is so much here I can not possibly write a review that will do it justice. This is a love story, and a wisdom book, it is inspiring and courageous. Above all it is the truth even if you find things to disagree with. I urge you to read it. I'm glad I did."
"It‚Äôs a call to courage and face feelings instead of trying to parachute over them. As a woman in recovery so much of this speaks to me. It reminds me of when I first got sober and how everything was new and scary and how when I did it  whatever it was, I felt empowered and safe. This book does that!! It‚Äôs a safe place to find yourself and say ‚Äú yeah me too!‚ÄùI‚Äôm just getting started and so many lines I‚Äôm like yup that‚Äôs me oh wait that‚Äôs me again! If you know , you KNOW! Thank you! It‚Äôs comfort in a cascading world of fear right now and you have reminded me of courage. And to feeel my feelings!!!! And to NOT dumb myself down during this time when others want to talk about Botox parties I can silence the alerts and get back to my book.... my safe space ‚ù§Ô∏è"
This book can‚Äôt keep my attention at all. Not particularly deep and it doesn‚Äôt read honest. It reads though it were written for sales.It waste a lot of paper. There is a blank page for every two written pages. I didn‚Äôt spend all that money for the text to be woven with blank pages.
"I read this book in 4 days! So many great things to say about this book.  I could not put it down and everything Glennon was saying was speaking to my soul. From battling her inner thoughts about being a bad parent, to the way she felt about God and her spirituality. Everything this book offers has made me feel like Glennon and I should be besties. I don't even know her, but her honesty is so inspirational and I really hope that more writers out there can be inspired by her because I truly loved reading this. Thank you."
I want to memorize this book. I want every word tattooed on my heart. Every page framed and hung on walls in my house. This book is beautiful. Thought provoking. Life changing. Honest. Worth every second I spent poring over it. I‚Äôm going to need to buy a second copy to loan out to everyone because I need to have a copy all for myself. This book now holds a special place in my heart. I‚Äôm listening to Glennon‚Äôs podcast now and have pre-ordered her journal. I love this book with every fiber of my being.
Haven't read it yet but it was delivered covered in dirt
"This book spoke to me on many levels, in many languages.  I read parts out loud to my husband which lead to some amazing conversations!  I think I will send many copies to important people in my life.  We can do hard things, indeed.  (So says the new sign in my office - I work in healthcare and have lost a coworker to COVID - it‚Äôs rough.  I am doing hard things, every day). Thank you Glennon!Also - follow our IG @he_read_she_read üòä"
"I've read her first two books, Untamed was the same message, completely redundant. Didn't live up to the hype."
"Have read all her other books and could not wait to get this one and devour it. Sadly, this one is not up to her usual standards. I felt more like I was being bounced around by so many crazy thoughts (of hers) rather than the usual invitation into her life and her way of managing, directing, and pushing through things. It was like a book of ""random thoughts"" and I was quite disappointed???"
"THIS.  This book is where your weary head needs to rest right now.  Loved ones, please read Untamed by Glennon Doyle.  Even in absence of the global health crisis, this book would have changed you.  In the midst of all this fear and uncertainty, as things come into sharper focus for all of us, these words of truth and soul and love will resonate even more.  @glennondoyle, THANK YOU for cracking my heart wide open with your beautiful words and story.  Thank you for helping me to stop planning and judging and trying to become a vision of someone that I‚Äôll chase forever, unless I just stop.  It‚Äôs time to sit down with my actual me, and feel through all of this.  ‚ÄúI did not know that I was supposed to feel everything.  I thought I was supposed to feel happy.  I thought happy was for feeling and that pain was for fixing and numbing and deflecting and hiding and ignoring.‚Äù  (I won‚Äôt ruin the ending by telling you it is not).  With so much gratitude to the author üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I‚Äôm normally not a bad review writer, but I‚Äôm honestly just bummed and a little annoyed. When you buy a book ‚ÄúBrand New‚Äù and pay the extra money but receive an OBVIOUSLY nastily used copy, that‚Äôs disappointing. I just now opened my shipment, haven‚Äôt even read a single page yet, and noticed the book is bent and beat up, has sticky and crusty spots all over the front and has oil from someone‚Äôs gross fingers all over the front and back. The spots 100% aren‚Äôt part of the colorful, fun printed background because it actually feels rough and crusty when you run your finger over it. ü§Æ When you live in an actual pandemic and receive a book with bent pages and gross, sticky, crusty and oily finger prints all over it... that obviously shows a lack of concern. I was, and still am, very excited to read this, but just have disinfectant ready, even if you pay for and expect a brand new, unused copy. My personal opinion is to still buy this book, but buy it somewhere other than Amazon!"
"There are a lot of negative reviews on here which I am SHOOK by. But Glennon has changed a lot over the years (as we ALL should), and her previous fans definitely may not vibe with the Glennon who is no longer more conservative/Christian. I'm actually the reverse; I found her previous book Love Warrior felt forced and not authentic. This book reads as it claims: that Glennon has learned to be free and fully herself. It's written choppy and ""blog"" like for a reason‚Äîthe title is called UNTAMED so it's meant to be a disjointed read. It's beautifully written with fantastic insights on how to listen to your intuition. Your inner knowing always knows what's best. You have to be open and ready to learn from this book, and if you are, it's a gem."
"A must read for anyone that needs the motivation to free yourself from the cages of life. Glennon provides the tools and enlightenment on finding yourself. ‚ÄúYou are here to decide if your life, relationships, and world are true and beautiful enough for you. And if they are not, you must decide if you have the guts, the right-perhaps even the duty-to burn to the ground that which is not true and beautiful enough and get started building what is.‚Äù  - Glennon Doyle. ‚ÄúUntamed‚Äù Hell, freaking Yeah!‚Äù"
"Glennon's Untamed has been my personal nod from the universe this week. It's like a warm hug and an ice bath at the same time, in the best way. It shocked my system in a way I don't remember a book doing for a long time. Glennon is a poet, a genius; I'm home alone this week and there were many moments I literally screamed ""Oh my f-in god!"" because what she wrote so resonated with me and because I don‚Äôt remember any other writer so simply and beautifully putting into words such complex ideas. I'm a 32-year old woman and finalizing my divorce in a few weeks.... I knew I had to get out of the marriage but have been in a bit of a wilderness since, trying to make sense of why I got into a marriage that was so wrong for me. Glennon put into words the importance of sitting with feelings and embracing our one and only Knowing so that we don't make decisions that betray ourselves. After reading her book, I feel empowered to go live the next part of my life... I'm ready to leave the woods with her wisdom in my ears and heart."
A book full of quotes to live your life by. Don‚Äôt settle. Speak up. At points a little too much fantasy land ideas. Certainly a book to evaluate your life and decide if changes are made. Don‚Äôt live a boring life. Listen to the inner talk. Choose you.
"As a mom of two school-aged children, this has been a week of transition and resilience.  Social distancing means home schooling, new schedules, new demands, no more contact with outside people...my yoga people, my dance students, my friends.  Test after test in transition and resilience, and I'm afraid to fail because the stakes seem too high.  And then my husband offered to take my kids outside, and I found myself curled up on my bed finally able to dig into this book.  This book that I pre-ordered last October!  This book who's arrival actually made my jump up and down in my kitchen when I opened the box last week! This book that basically reads itself, because I can hear it in my head straight from G's voice!  I'm only through page 73 and I've cried once and stopped reading to ""be still"" twice.  The first time led to me doing 10 push ups before picking up the book again.  The second time made me pick up the phone to call my cousin.  Thank you for continuing to share your truth and beauty, G!"
"This is the book for any and all life transitions. I think it should be handed to every teenage girl to read.It‚Äôs all about being true to yourself and what you want and letting go of the pleaser and complacent mentality that women have been shaped to have or as Glennon references as ‚Äúcaged‚Äù to have. A big part of it is how to embrace yourself and put yourself first. Not in a selfish way but the true definition of self care/self love way. How to quit fearing disappointing others and fear disappointing yourself. For those who are always just trying to please and be complacent when they know they want something else wake up one day and they are more likely to be broken, resentful, or lost. And that‚Äôs a damn shame."
"I had no expectations for this book, and what I mean by that is I didn't choose this book to read, my book club chose this book for me and wow, am I so glad she did!What a pleasantly awesome and surprising read. Truly a page turner and what I really loved is how digestible and relatable the book was. The sections are broken up nicely so, if you only have a couple mins to read, you're still making progress through her story, loved that!I would highly encourage you to pick this one up! Enjoy!!!"
I‚Äôm so into this book! I‚Äôll be passing it on for my sisters to read. Definitely recommend for a gift. I appreciate that it consists of lots of small stories because it‚Äôs difficult for me to read long periods of time with small children. Each one brings up such strong emotions and feels familiar in some way. She‚Äôs so relatable and I love how she breaks it down. Fills me with courage and certainty.
"I do love Glennon. Really, I do. But this book is just not her best, in my opinion.  I‚Äôm glad she made a memoir, and has found her truth, whether I agree with her choices or not.  That is not mine to judge. However, I did not find this book uplifting or helpful in any way in my own personal life, which it why I bought it in the first place.  I‚Äôm returning it for that reason."
I must have missed something in the first reading of this.  But I'm not going to read it again to find out what may have been missed.
"This book really has opened my eyes to a lot of things when it comes to my own life as the author, Glennon, shares how her life has transformed for finally living for her truth and for HER. I‚Äôve always felt as I‚Äôve lived my life for others and I‚Äôm finally learning that it‚Äôs OK to live my life for me.This book is so, SO good and one that I know I‚Äôll revisit again and again and again."
"I've read all Glennon's books, and Untamed was as well-written and moving as I've come to expect from an author like her. You won't regret spending time reading about her battle with expectations and honesty...it resonated with this people-pleaser quite strongly. I especially loved her line, ""because I am a mother, and I have responsibilities."" We owe it to our children to live honestly, is her message."
"This is Jonathan Livingston Seagull with lesbians. And as a lesbian, that should have been a good thing.Spend your money on something interesting."
One of the top 10 books I‚Äôve ever read & I read aLot! This book should be required reading for every woman. Small tidbit chapters of wisdom that illuminate the journey of every woman‚Äôs domestication.  Read it and it will change your life.
"I thought this book was extremely readable and has so many key points for navigating this world without letting it navigate YOU. I loved the beginning and the end 1/3's, but the middle 1/3 sagged a bit for me, personally. But, these types of books will hit each person differently, so what I loved might not resonate with you, and what didn't resonate with me, might have the biggest impact on you! Do recommend!"
"I read this book in 2 sittings. It is courageous yet relatable and very easy to digest despite the nuggets of wisdom that hit you out of nowhere. I found myself taking pictures of pages and sending them to my boyfriend with texts like, ""We can learn from this,"" and ""Let's live life with imagination."" It's just one of those books that you want to share with friends - like a good story you heard or a great article you read that helped you see things more clearly. While the world navigates uncertain times, it is important to cling to hope, to remember we are flawed but fabulous, and Glennon's writing helps to guide the way."
I honestly can‚Äôt imagine a worse written book... blah blah.  Please save your money
"Just wow... the most beautiful and heartbreaking book I‚Äôve read all year. Thought provoking and offering some serious perspective of things I most often bury (the Ache). Reading this at the end of 2020, well, the timing couldn‚Äôt be more perfect, will take this with me into 2021, letting it set the standard for a life I want to live differently. Will buy this for my daughter and recommend it to every woman I know."
"I have three tiny humans and have not been able to read or get through a book in a long while. I started reading this book and could not stop. It is beautiful, funny, real, raw, heartbreaking and challenging. You will grow, you will have your eyes opened. It is a gorgeous piece of self reflection and I am over the moon thankful that Glennon has once again opened up her gorgeous and real world for us. I met Glennon at an event two weeks after I found out my former husband had been unfaithful for many years. I read Love Warrior in the middle of a separation and eventual divorce, the parallels were crushing and beautiful. This book felt like coming home. Thank you, Glennon for the gift and guide you have been in my life. There are no words for how thankful I am to read about your journey and celebrate in your joy."
"I was so excited to get this book. But in the days leading up to the release, I read the reviews from all her celebrity friends that said they were laughing and CRYING within the first few pages.‚ÄúPsssshhh,‚Äù I thought. Glennon‚Äôs not gonna get me.The first few chapters went by without a hitch. I wondered, ‚ÄúWHO is crying at this point?‚ÄùAnd then I read ‚ÄúAches.‚Äù By the end of the chapter, the book was thrown to the side of my bed and my hand was covering my face the way you do when you‚Äôre trying to hide your ugly cry and I knew I was a part of EVERYTHING-every person to ever feel ache before, including those people that had shed tears after just a few chapters of Untamed. ;) With her words, Glennon brought me to an understanding, and it was raw and honest and beautiful.In the end, she got me. And I‚Äôm happy she did! This book is engrossing and relatable. It‚Äôs art, and you will be happy you gave it your time. It earns it. Thank you Glennon!"
"Glennon Doyle is a voice we need in the world. I laughed, cried, and learned new things. I am recommending this book to anyone who will listen, and my book club is reading it next month (voted in unanimously!). It's a book you will want to give away, but you'll probably end up keeping it (and buying more to give) because you'll want to go back to it again and again."
"I had no idea what this book was about when I decided to read it. I'm so glad that I did. Very thought provoking. I have already recommended this book to my immediate family (only to find out one of my daughters was also reading it).I never thought I was a book club person, but this book makes me want to talk about what Glennon  has to say.An added bonus is the sub theme of soccer I was not expecting .Read this book and learn something about yourself."
"I cried twice in the first fifteen pages, so it‚Äôs safe to say I wasn‚Äôt emotionally prepared. Glennon is passionate, fiery, and honest. She makes us question what it means to be ourselves and to be human, and does it in a way not meant to scorn us for what we don‚Äôt do but to encourage us to do our best. When this book arrived, an homage to her famous line popped into my head: ‚ÄúThere. It. Is.‚Äù And I‚Äôve been in love ever since."
Glennon can be a hot mess but I love her. Reading this is effortless and challenging and rewarding.  I wish the chapter titles made more sense....when I want to reference something she said I can't find it or remember what chapter/story it was in. Now I am going to to back and re-read it and take good notes on the tops of the pages so I can more easily find what I am looking for.
"This book is a must read! I just realized that I'm nearly where I need to be in my life. Sad, that it took 62 years and 3 marriages to find happiness.  Although, I'm not gay, I still found myself and learned so much from this writer. I have a gay daughter and I have learned to except her for who she is. No more doubt and worries here. Thank you Glennon for being you!"
"Glennon,I felt everything so deeply while reading this book. I read it rapidly, just devouring the thing. I shared it with the closest women in my life and they all read it just as voraciously. I cried, I reflected, I honored myself and my feelings. I am so thankful for this work and it will be a regular re-read for me. I have never read anything quite like it. You delivered to me ideas about women in this world that I have never heard spoken before, and that shook me. Shook something awake in me, really. What a huge impact to make in someones life. Thank you deeply. This book showed me how graceful and strong I am in my grief."
"What to even say about this book. I LOVE IT SO VERY MUCH! It gave me the words for the hidden things that I‚Äôve felt in my soul forever. I‚Äôve recommended or bought this for three good friends and we‚Äôve had such good conversations from it!!It covers mental illness, finding and unleashing yourself, society, motherhood, feminism, religion and other BIG questions that not many like to think about. Thanks Glennon for helping me feel not as alone with my thoughts in this world. We can do hard things."
"Wow!!! This book is truly amazing and I look forward to reading it every night.It arrived late last week and I am almost done with it. Love Glennon‚Äôs integrity, perspective and ability to share with compassion and package her lessons in such a way where she is directly calling me the reader to action through inspiration. Thank you - Your book has truly supported me!"
"I‚Äôve never written a review because I never feel compelled, however this book *spoke* to me. I cannot put it down.  Glennon bares it all.  And it‚Äôs AMAZING.  I love love stories but more importantly, I LOVE bravery in overcoming different societies‚Äô norms.  Sadly, I was subjected to the same background of the ‚Äúgrooming‚Äù for the ‚Äúperfect life‚Äùand it‚Äôs made me miserable.  I‚Äôm so, so, so thankful for Glennon & Abby‚Äôs story and the courage it took to put it all on paper.  Keep on keepin‚Äô on, G & A. Y‚Äôall are Untamed Warriors. üíõü§òüèª"
"Never before have I encountered something that opened such a window to my soul. Each sentence was like a shiny mirror reflecting my truest nature right back at me. I laughed, I cried, I empathized, and I experienced the knowing on such a deep and profound level that I never would have thought possible. I am about to turn forty. As I read this book, I felt that I, myself, had written it. Every word was plucked directly from my story, every experience, a shared one. Thank you, Glennon Doyle, for your genuine, raw, and powerful testimony and for your talent in penning truth to paper. Your gift to the world is offering a veracious account of worldly suffering and a solution that many have searched for and few have found."
"I'll admit, I bought this book 100% due to the hype it was getting from celebs and tv shows and how it was life-changing and so brave.  Complete BS.  I'm no guru, but I didn't get it.....I stopped reading it close to the end because I was over it. Not the book for me. Live your truth-there, I summed up the book in three words."
"I have lived every word of this book; every page of this journey. But somehow, instead of feeling like oh I already know this stuff, I found myself savoring every word of Untamed. Doyle‚Äôs articulation of the process of shedding expectations is sheer joy. Her ability to centrifuge truth down to its essence and to turn a mind-bending phrase is so satisfying‚Äìit‚Äôs like getting the water temperature and pressure exactly right at the same time. Scoured, clean, and with only slight abrasions.From page 122: Maybe Eve was never meant to be our warning. Maybe she was meant to be our model. Own your wanting. Eat the apple. Let it burn.Amen, sister. Amen."
"This book is thought-provoking, promotes self-reflection, and has some great commentary on trusting oneself, human connection, and the role of the modern woman as dictated by societal structures. There are also parts that I had trouble with because they seemed cynical and came off as being a privileged perspective. Having said that, I still think it is worth the read and enjoyed the book. I am ok with questioning some of the author‚Äôs stances. I read this for a book club and look forward to a discussion that will surely be engaging and energizing."
"This is out of my range, as I don't typically read much. A friend recommended this to me because I have been so interested in ""self improvement"" and more ""fru fru"" stuff. I LOVED this book. I read it in a month, reading a couple chapters a couple nights a week before bed. It is such a good realization to get you thinking differently. I recommend to anyone who feels they are in a rut in life and want some growth out of a read. Even if you aren't a reader (like me)."
"I didn't know when I cracked the cover, but this book was just waiting for me to read it.  I suddenly lost my husband, my soul mate, my other half in December of this year.  Of all the books on grief I've consumed none helped me like this book, that isn't even geared for widow-hood.  This is the reset I needed to start to consider healing my heart.  Thank you Glennon."
"I had my reservations about reading this book as I initially didn‚Äôt think I would be able to relate to it, and therefore felt as though I wouldn't be able to take away from it. Fast forward to being near done with reading the book and I have to say that this has been the most enlightening, honest, and most naked truth about what it is to be a woman- and that‚Äôs saying a lot, as there are so many different types of us. It‚Äôs loud, it‚Äôs sad, it‚Äôs frustrating but above all it‚Äôs just so unapologetically TRUE. Buy the book, sit back and dive in and I can guarantee that you‚Äôll find yourself relating to a lot of the things Glennon points out about what it is to be alive as a woman and why exactly it is so important to be true to oneself."
"It's so refreshing to hear someone be real! Glennon talks about so many issues that a lot of us are afraid to acknowledge - racism, sexuality, gender identity, religion, relationships, etc. It's amazing to see the growth of a human being just through a couple of books, but it gives me hope that other people will realize their truths and make the hard decisions to be able to live those truths. Many of us in the LGBTQ+ community can relate to conforming to society and hiding until we feel safe to come out. It's always nice to hear I'm not alone :) Glennon, thank you for being vulnerable and sharing your life details with us!"
"I had high hopes for this book, as I loved all the authors previous ones. However this book completely disappointed me in every way. Instead of telling her readers the story of how she goes from being a married woman with three kids, to finding herself divorced and married to a woman, she rarely touches that subject  That‚Äôs the story I would loved to read, instead we get a book on constant, repetitive, at times preaching dialogue about how we all should be living our lives in the ‚Äútruest ‚Äú way. Then she‚Äôll switch narratives to expose her insecurities as she leans on her wife for emotional support. Frankly I got very tired of this book quickly. Is it a memoir, a self help book, inspirational ? Not sure, but it certainly lacks authenticity."
It was ok. Not feeling the hype around this book
"I love Glennon's writing.  This has been such a fantastic read, especially during quarantine.  I am so grateful for her lessons and words, they speak to my soul.  It is the type of book you want to race through because it is so good, yet need to stop and reread and savor every word as well.  So happy to have this book.  Have recommended it to several people at this point."
"Untamed is a series of essays that elegantly balances the author‚Äôs life stories with a call to action. Doyle‚Äôs life stories are the narrative for living an authentic life, whether it is through a personal, political, or philanthropic lens. Her vulnerability and openness about the challenge of our many life transitions is told with clarity and a good dose of humor. Her writing style is fresh and intellectually invigorating, and her stories pierced my heart with their truths."
"I've read all of Glennon's books, and they all have touched my heart in different ways.She speaks her truth like nobody's business.In this one, I have flagged 5 pages and underlined some passages in pencil - this is a sign of a great book. I've kept all of her books, cannot bear to part with them. I've bought more copies to give as gifts - bought another copy of Untamed for a college graduation gift for our cousin.Get hold of a copy, and read the prologue - if you love it, keep reading.You're welcome."
"This book was everything I want and hope to be. I read it and wondered if black women are allowed to be untamed and what that might look like for me in my life.  It was affirming my areas of inconsistencies, giving me permission to stop carrying everyone else‚Äôs stuff and validating my deepest thoughts that I can‚Äôt always articulate well. I gave my husband a copy and said, ‚Äú If you want to know me more deeply and where I‚Äôm headed, this a good starting point. ‚Äú He‚Äôs currently reading it. I did hope to hear a little more of your love story but I‚Äôll wait for the next memoir. This book could have had volumes if you included all I wished for you to share. Seriously, if I die before we can read and discuss together, I want my daughter to have a copy.Do you feel like you gave birth, Glennon?Brutiful baby.  Good work, Glennon. So proud of you."
I haven‚Äôt begun to process it all and i was just trying to notice what was showing up as I went. It‚Äôs been some big stuff this KNOWING; feelings both physical and emotional I haven‚Äôt been able to see when they‚Äôve showed up before.  I‚Äôm starting to understand the connections.
This was a very well written book. It touched on many social dilemmas that we are facing today. More importantly it highlighted the right mentality you need to have to push through and even fight for whats right and what we deserve as human beings.My book is full of pencil marks that I made reading through and underlining so many inspiring quotes and good points. I highly recommend this book. It's really a spiritual boost.
"I was pretty excited listen to this book. By the second disc I was bored and felt every story and message was the same. I found her tone arrogant and dismissive. I'm glad she found her true self, and clearly she's happy too, but every chapter seemed a long drawn out explanation of the same scenario."
"Glennon tells the history of her great life change from trying to hide from herself to knowing herself. It's a very easy read with short snippets of each phase of self discovery that keep the book interesting. Any woman struggling with wanting to control her world or feeling like she doesn't fit will likely be able to relate to Glennon's insight. It is a one-sided, personal journey, so this is not a self help book with multiple methods for becoming your true self, but rather it offers a friendly perspective of how she was able to adjust her path to continually work on becoming more Glennon."
"Glennon is raw, open and honest about life's hard questions. She isn't afraid to share her flawed and beautiful life struggles. While reading this book I had several aha moments and I plan to go back to read it again so I can remember the most important lessons.. Buy this inspiring book if you want to know yourself better.Thank you Glennon!"
"I read Love Warrior during a time in my life when I was at a crossroads. Glendon‚Äôs powerful honesty and grit writing helped me make my decision to let go of my anger and begin again. I was so excited when Untamed was released. I am older now and at a point in my life where I want to be true to myself and free of people pleasing. Reading this book during a pandemic has helped me focus on myself and feel my feelings and love who I am. Untamed is a testament to strength, honesty and self love we as women all need to find in ourselves right now in this moment today! Thank you Glennon Doyle for being who you are ...you and sharing it with us all. I am buying this book to give all my tribe! A life altering readüôèüèª"
"Some nice quotes, but despite Adele raving about this book so I stupidly bought it, it‚Äôs just not that special. Save your money and get it from the library if you really want to read it."
"I can't even! I read tons of books. I hardly ever get one that's about self help, religion, or life views. Before I finished the book I had bought copies and sent them to people I love. The beauty, life and deepness of this book can't be described in a paragraph. I love her! I don't know her but I love her. Thank you for being brave and sharing your story. I have found myself fighting for my daughters to not be put in a little box. Now, I don't feel alone."
"This book was just okay for me. You could tell the author has a very liberal viewpoint, which is fine, but it felt like it was rammed down your throat a bit. And I'm not talking about her sexual preference. There were good parts though, I related to her parenting the most. Overall she has a good message, but I gave it away after reading it."
Repetitive. Not the ‚Äúself-help/motivating‚Äù book I had thought from reviews and description.Boring read.
This book was not for me. It came across very self help-y and preachy. It did not resonate with me but I can see how it could for many others.
"I have purchased this book four times already. A hardcover for me, the kindle version for me, the audiobook for me, and the hardcover for a friend. I'm confident I will be buying more. Glennon's words bring me joy and tears. They are real and honest. I have listened to one part of the book- FIVE TIMES! Her wisdom inspires me and her humor delights me. I am savoring every syllable and I'm so grateful the world gets to read these words!"
"I just finished and I want to read Untamed all over again.There is so much insight, so much knowledge, so much pain, happiness and love in these pages that I‚Äôm sure I didn‚Äôt get it all.I need to sit and be and know before I read it again. I‚Äôm sure there are more secrets hidden between the pages.Amazing book!"
"This book is absolutely incredible! i‚Äôm not even done with it yet but it‚Äôs made me cry, be on edge wanting more, and it really resonated with me and gave me a new outlook on the power we hold as women. i love how she writes! i can‚Äôt wait to finish it"
"She cuts to the heart of herself, letting her blood show that we don‚Äôt bleed alone, and we all bleed. Uplifting but grounding as well. She uses her story to bring to light they way her evolution can show us a path back to ourselves. Not by escaping, but by stopping and turning to the one thing we have this entire life, ourselves. Thank you, Glennon. Your words help me heal and learn and inspire me to be more me than ever. To challenge my beliefs and prejudices and to never stop knowing or being better."
"I am writing this review after reading Untamed for a second time! It‚Äôs one I no doubt will continue to reread as it speaks to me on different levels depending on my circumstance at the time. I have two daughters, and it opened my eyes to so many things I taught them (some of which I hope they unlearn). Every woman needs to read Untamed‚Äîit will touch your soul, likely make you uncomfortable at some point, but it will no doubt help you grow and KNOW! Thank you Glennon‚ÄîI look forward to rereading and leaning more many more times!"
"This book is astounding. Glennon writes in a vulnerable way that really pushed me to be uncomfortable while feeling heard. I do not have children and there are parts of this book I just don't relate to. However, I am someone's child and reading it from that perspective still challenges so many beliefs I was raised to uphold. This is a book I believe every woman, mother, child, and man should read. You likely won't be bedazzled by every word, but there is absolutely something soul-shaking in here for everyone."
I bought for my wife who wanted it as a gift. It encourages women to turn away from their husband and brainwashes them to dep0end on themselves. I found it 6 weeks later with underlined sentences that were clearly a focus in her life to become independent and care less about me. At that time she said she only loves me as the father of my kids. That was 6 months ago and I have done everything to save my 15 year marriage. It looks like she won't come back to reality and my kids will have a broken home soon.
"I am reading this magical book right now. Initially, I was absolutely floored to read the Chapter called polar bears. It is one of the first few chapters, and four simple pages explained myself to me in a way that I had never understood before. That chapter hooked me, and I have been absolutely moved ever since. I‚Äôm coming to realize that it is no mistake that this book is out during a pandemic when everyone is reflective and at home. It is doing the exact work it is meant to do, and I am very grateful to Glennon and her family for the sacrifices that it took to make it. Many thanks for your journey, your struggles and your brilliant shining light.Lots of love,Molly Chester, from The Biggest Little Farm"
"I was so excited about this book and really wanted to like it. With 80% five star reviews, how could I not? I couldn‚Äôt get past page 84. So, I thought I was missing what all the hype was and started over. This time only made it to page 78. What am I missing that so many others are seeing?"
I loved this book! It was amazing! I had hoped to finish it in a day but it took me two mainly because I highlighted some of it and made notes in the kindle version. Great book Glennon!
"Glennon, I know you read all of these reviews which makes me so happy because I need you to know that, before I read this book, I had about 8 people tell me that when they were reading it, they kept thinking of me and my current life circumstances. All of them told me that I must read it ASAP.  I figured this was no coincidence so I swiftly ordered it. They weren‚Äôt kidding. Your words came to me at the perfect time in my life and I don‚Äôt believe this was a coincidence...my HP always has a plan. This book strengthened my conviction to move forward with a decision I had been laboring over for years. Your vulnerability gave me strength. Thank you for telling me it was ok to begin a new chapter in my life. For reminding me that I am the main character of my story and I get to be happy too. XO"
"After only a few pages into Untamed I wanted to ensure I savored every reading moment of this book. Now that I've finished, I will treasure it.Glennon Doyle's sharp wit and humor are as entertaining, as are her insights on ""Know""-ing ourselves profound. She's fierce and she's fragile. She's real and she's flawed. Who can't relate to those traits and not be drawn in by her sheer honesty?Her personal stories illustrate so poignantly the struggles of shedding societal convention for personal truth. She covers some of our deepest angst and issues sexually, as parents, as partners, and as human beings struggling to be human. It is a journey that takes practice and patience.I highly recommend this book along with huge appreciation for the reminder to prioritize my ""Jen""-ness."
"This is one of the most important books of our time.  I feel like it should be a required read when you turn 18. Read it and you will learn more about yourself than you ever dared to, and become a better person because of it.  Glennon‚Äôs perspective is so insightful, truthful, and raw. I‚Äôve never read the same book twice, but I‚Äôm already on my second run through. I want to be sure I didn‚Äôt miss anything the first time, and want to really absorb everything she has to share.  Add it to your collection- you won‚Äôt be disappointed."
"I was really looking forward to this book because I usually really like  Glennon's messages. This one though, was not so great. It was preachy and political. Some nuggets of goodness. But overall I don't recommend it."
"I found the authors style to be too preachy, like she‚Äôs got it all figured out and is going to tell us how it‚Äôs done. She also totally discredits and even makes fun of the main premises of her previous books and announces how wrong she was so it automatically takes away her credibility for me."
"I was excited to read this book because I kept hearing great things about it. It's a fast read and that's the only good thing I thought of it. I did not connect with this book like most people did and kept wondering ""What am I missing that is so great about this book?"" I do not feel like I could relate to any of it.  Everyone is different though."
"I'm really excited to read this book, as I've heard great reviews of it, but I was disappointed to recieve my new book with scratches on the back cover. Obviously it won't affect the story, but when I buy a band new book, I expect it to be in great condition."
"Everybody should read this book! I had thought this was a girl's book but it's not, everyone should read it. She has an interesting and intelligent way of looking at life. Even if you don't agree with her, you should read it to understand her perspective. This book definitely gave me a new perspective, being an Asian female who came from a traditional family and community. I'm so happy that I came across to this book, even though my mindset will not completely change over just one book, this book definitely taught me to look at life and relationships in different ways. THANK YOU Glennon!"
"This book is super easy to read. It‚Äôs is a fun writing, full of messages, quotable lines and for sure your mind will be exposed to new possibilities, POVs and an empowering message to live what is true and beautiful for you. Buy and read it for yourself. ‚ô•Ô∏è  #thanksglennon for sharing your experiences and insights with us!"
"This book was disturbing to me. I have to admit I cried during much of it. There was and always has been the idea that I was not enough. And in a few placs, it wasn't a good fit for me. Mostly though, it caused me to think, wonder why am I not enough, why  this self doubt, why am I the only one. Their find out that I am not... I am left unsettled, but maybe with hope."
"I was so excited to read Untamed!  I'm a fan of Glennon Doyle and had loved Love Warrior and Carry On, Warrior.  I could not have been prepared for Untamed.  This book has touched me in places I didn't know existed in my brain, body and soul.  I have felt vindicated, victorious and guilty all within 5 pages.  Glennon's willingness to not only live her truth but also to share her truth is what will make this planet better.  I thought I would read it cover to cover in one sitting.  Instead that I have to take it in doses.  Not because of boredom but because I need to time to sit with the messages not only that I'm reading but more importantly the feelings that I'm feeling.  When I'm not reading it, I'm processing in the best, most healthy way.  I love it.  You will laugh, cry and if you're really open to it...rise."
"I really needed to read this. When you go through every day and wonder if you're enough, if you're doing it right, if you're where you're supposed to be in life - you need to tap into the knowing. The knowing well tell you what you already knew. I don't think I've been listening to my knowing all that well. This book gave me the thought trajectory to move forward. IDefinitely worth the read."
"After reading the whole book, while listening to the audiobook, I want to make so many changes in my own life, I hardly know where to start! I highlighted so many key quotes and took so many notes, that I‚Äôll start with those. I can see a total re-read/re-listen in my near future. So much good advice, told through some many stories. Highly recommended!"
"I absolutely loved and devoured this book! Being human is hard, being a girl becoming in the world is hard. Thank you Glennon for reminding us to find our selves and the fire inside us before the world indoctrinated us. In this wonderful memoir, Doyle was able to share her story and reflections on being true and unapologetically herself, and inspires the reader to do the same. True confidence is loyalty to self. It's not easy to transform yourself, be strong and face the potential of pain through the process, but it's the person on the other side that you become that makes it all worth it. ""I see your fear, and it's big. I see your courage, and it's bigger. We can do hard things..."""
"This is an AMAZING book‚ù£Ô∏èEvery woman (and man too!) should stop what they‚Äôre doing and READ THIS BOOK IMMEDIATELY, especially if they have any daughters. After the first few pages you‚Äôll be dumbfounded at how we float through life obvious to the gender biases we continue to perpetuate. We‚Äôll all remember that ‚ÄúUntamed‚Äù girl we all tried to domesticate."
"I loved this book, I love it so much I have to get the hardcopy. I couldn't put it down and was finished in two days. I loved the messages and the fire that was burning inside of me while I was reading it. This is my first read from Glennon. After reading this book I went on the read  ""Love Warriors"" I would highly recommend both books and I would also suggest reading Love Warriors first."
"This Woman, both as an author and role model, is beyond inspirational. Her ability to share the most vulnerable moments in such a poignant way, but still served with humor, is entirely unmatched. This book is an incredible read for anyone‚Äîmen, women alike. Such a beautiful reflection on how the challenging moments in life can help us transform. Love, love her!"
"I've been following Glennon since I was pregnant with my son over 10 years ago. My favorite part of her writing is how I can take my own personal journey while I read hers.  I am inspired by her ability to be vulnerable and do the next right thing for her. This book is so important for me right now as I learn to be free, from a marriage that didn't work for me but not lose the man/father that I respect. It's crucial as I raise these gorgeous humans that are my children to understand that the world is hard but they can be brave.  Thank you Glennon for the humor and friendship you've given me through your writing.  I'm sure you hear this all the time, but I feel like we would be friends...the kind that don't ever communicate because I can't text or call either."
"Glennon Doyle's resonated with me in so many ways. My friend actually purchased this book for me for my birthday last year (May 2020), but I had a lot going on, and just couldn't get into reading it, or anything. This year I finally read it (March 2021), a couple months ago and was amazed!!! I purchased this book for my friend who's birthday was in April, and I hope she will enjoy it too. It is very empowering."
"The best. All of your books are great but this one is unmatched. You are an artist communicating all the things I should know but I‚Äôve been conditioned to NOT to know. I‚Äôm reading for the second time now, purchased for friends and family and can never say enough about your exceptional untamed masterpiece.You my dear are such a blessing to humanity, to love, to mothers, to daughters and our sons.Thank you.I know in time you will have more for us and I will wait. Not patiently, but I will wait on the edge of my seat until Untamed + Unfiltered comes out.PS. Robert‚Äôs wife will be untamed soon. Very soon.XOXO- Harmony"
"There‚Äôs a reason why this book came out just before this pandemic craziness! Having this book to read has helped me through this time of chaos and ‚Äúsocial diatancing‚Äù. I believe God has a way of placing things in front of us with good intentions and this book was it for me! I just fell in love with a woman for the first time this past August and before that I was hiding the person I really wanted to be, I feel alive when I read each of these pages of Untamed. I feel free, I feel strong and more importantly I feel loved. Thank you for sharing the most vulnerable times and topics of your life. I hear you all the way!Bridget M"
"Although I‚Äôm not a ‚Äú feminist‚Äù.  This book is so moving. I laughed, I cried and I said WOW! This world goes around, with everyone‚Äôs different points of view, and that‚Äôs why I love your book. I love that we live in a country where we can say and read anything.  Also big fan of Abby and your instagram posts. My husband is also a neat freak. Haha‚ù§Ô∏è"
I wish every person in America would read this book.  As someone who is learning to adjust my beliefs as I learn there were parts that were difficult for me to read- but that‚Äôs the whole point.  An absolute validating and life changing book.
"This is this is the first review I have ever written...about anything.  I bought this book because I really love what Glennon and Abby do for this world.  I was also intrigued by the posts promoting the book.  I have never read a book that spoken to me as much as this book has.  I've read it once and plan to read it over and over again until her messages become part of who I am.  As a Mom, daughter, wife, working professional, it has addressed everything happening in my current world.  I feel as though Glennon wrote this book to me.  Glennon, thank you, thank you, thank you.  I plan on getting this book for everyone I know if they haven't read it.  Do not hesitate, just start reading."
"I really enjoyed Glennon's first book, to the point where I re-read it (something I never do). I was expecting the same with this one, but it was written in a completely different style. It's very choppy/short chapters and kind of all over the place. I still love Glennon and her message of following your true self."
This book should be mandatory reading. It is a beautiful piece of art that reminds me I'm not alone in this journey. Glennon speaks to my soul in this book and it's quite impressive. I can't explain how influential and inspirational this book is and will be in my life.  So happy to be reading this book. I believe every woman should read this for sure.
"A friend bought this for me and a friend. It was so good I read it and then bought a copy for myself to highlight‚Äî parts for myself and parts I want to read to my two daughters. I then bought another copy and sent it to my mom. I bombarded my sisters in laws enough they bought their own copies. Personally it resonates. But beyond her personal story, her message is life changing. It‚Äôs everything you‚Äôve questioned in your head out on paper to make you feel like you are human and not alone. If there was ever a book I would say is required reading for both males and females it is this book. Reading it for the second time in less than a week is still opening doors to my soul. I am eternally grateful to this woman I can only wish I knew. Beautifully written, incredibly real. I needed this for a long time. Thank you. In all honesty, thank you."
"This book was super hyped up by so many people and I‚Äôm not sure why. It started off okay, but became super whiny, self-righteous, and all over the place. What I thought was a memoir became more of a self-help book. Falls in line with the preachy works of Rachel Hollis. Tried to push through and gave up after 60% of the book. Save your money."
"I couldn't put it down. Glennon finds a way to make you laugh and break your heart at the same time. I am an educator, mother, partner, feminist and survivor (of many things) and I filled the book with highlighted passages to share with friends, family and students.It's the best Mother's Day gift I have ever given myself."
Such a great read! I have been snapshotting tons of pages and sending them to my friends! This book has something for everyone in it. You will not regret reading this!
"I pre-ordered this book months ago and in a twist of madness and fate it came at the absolute right moment it was needed: Quarantine. These stories pull you in and wash over you. In a time of social distancing, living in her memories and anecdotes, is a form of human contact that is sustaining. This is a collection of triumphs, struggles, hilarity and humanity. READ IT. Feel all the feels. Be better because of it. Thank you Glennon Doyle."
"This book has inspiring elements, some beautiful quotes along with some good advice on self actualization. I was moved and inspired through different parts but by the end, I was put off by the lack of cohesiveness and was left feeling like I read a very loooong (and at times unhinged) facebook post. There were good nuggets though."
"This book is beyond amazing.  Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down, and as soon as I finished all I could think was... I sure hope this isn't her last book!!  While reading I laughed and cried and enjoyed every word.  THANK YOU, Glennon for having the confidence to live your truth and share your story.  This book gave me a new confidence, a new outlook and a new understanding on all the things.  I might be biased, because I am also a Doyle, but I think Glennon's wife is right, she is the best writer in the world."
"If you identify as a woman over the age of, say, 35, then you probably need to read this book. No, not probably. It should be required reading around the time that your doctor recommends your first mammogram. This book has helped me find my voice, speak my mind, and realize that life is short. What am I waiting for?"
"I purchased this book, because I saw Reese Witherspoon raving about it. It‚Äôs okay, very repetitive and got boring very fast. I‚Äôd never read it again."
"This is the book. THE book. I laughed. I straight out ugly cried several times reading the truth Glennon wrote so MF-ing eloquently. It is so refreshing and lovely and true. I‚Äôm reading it again because I want to enjoy the words again. I‚Äôm also buying copies for all my sisters, daughters, and friends. Beautiful. Beautiful book."
"I LOVE Glennon Doyle so maybe I am biased but this book is one of the most important books I have ever read. In my opinion Glennon is a magical human and if I could have dinner with one person, for me it would be Glennon (and hopefully she would bring Abby). UNTAMED inspired me so much and I know I will read it many more times. I have told everyone in my life to read it. Glennon wants us all to be true to ourselves and to really know who we are. She shows us how to do that through her own journey. Do yourself a favor and read this book, it will be one of the best things you have ever done for yourself. G, thank you for giving the world this beautiful gift. You are so incredibly loved and this book made me feel so loved, seen and held."
I love this book and took a screen shot of nearly every single page. That means that I found something relevant and moving and magical that I wanted to remember and share in nearly every page. I stopped taking screen shots and just bought two more copies and sent them to my friends. I feel that anyone who is doing work to make themselves better than they were yesterday will cherish this book and be as moved as I was. It is so hard to articulate the process of growing and learning and becoming but Glennon does it in this book and I love her for it. She is my hero and a world treasure and I may wallpaper my new single lady house with highlighted pages. Thank you Glennon!!
Didn‚Äôt realize this book would be so preachy. Gave it three stars for the anticdotes and funny stories. But I was NOT looking for any kind of ‚Äúself-help‚Äù. A little disappointed how this came across.
"When I first started the book I thought to myself ""just another cliche self help book"" I decided to keep reading and was very glad I did. The book is filled with good stuff for the heart and told in a funny and short way. I can easily!y refer back to the chapters I need. Although I'm not a parent the book is wonderful for those moms raising kids. I will hold on to thks book tight and refer back to it when I catch myself thinking off the beaten path. Well done Glennon!"
"The book was inspiring and thought-provoking from start to finish. She puts words to ideas and practices in the absolute best way. I want every woman to read this book and really absorb it. If we all did it, we could change the world. It‚Äôs a must-read. I feel like I need to read it 50 more times to really make it sink in. SO AMAZING"
"4.5/5. I blew through 80 percent of this book within 3 days, and then it took me weeks to finish the rest. I didn‚Äôt want it to be over. And yet the last bit seemed to drag on for me. I plan to read it again in the near future, but I believe this book can be done in segments when your soul needs it most, even if that means sticking with one chapter for a very long time."
What an amazing book.  It was an eye opener and a true motivation.  I can relate to so much in the book.  Glendon truly is an artist with her words and stories.  People kept asking me what I was smiling at while reading the book.I feel empowered after reading it and it makes me want to be brave like you talk about.
"I've never read any of Glennon's books, this is my first and I absolutely LOVE it! Her style of writing made it easy to put down and pick up frequently during a busy work week. And her genuinity cut me to the bone. I cried with laughter, with pain, with joy, with anger. Oh wow. What an experience! I feel like I have grown exponentially from start to finish. Can't wait to read it again üòç"
"Amazing Read ! So many feelings and thoughts that we have been taught to bury deep. Glennon is a Prophet for the Heart and for so many that don't have the courage to say what they feel. I  Love, Love, Love this book. It's a keeper and so are the lessons she so generously shares with the world.  XOXO"
"although the author is an eloquent writer, the story is very slow and can be confusing. i was on page 100 until I finally realized where she was going with her thoughts."
"I didn't think I'd make it past the 1st 30 pages to be honest. I felt a bit underwhelmed. In all fairness, I didn't know what to expect from this book. I'm glad I read it through to the end. It reads a bit peculiar however there are some solid gems and words of wisdom imparted throughout"
"This book was medicine for my soul. I‚Äôve wrestled and fought and cried over the religion I was raised in. I‚Äôve mourned the end and believed again. I‚Äôve walked out of a broken relationship and found myself standing alone for the first time in a dozen years. I‚Äôve grieved deeply the loss of people I‚Äôve loved most. I‚Äôve sought therapy for anxiety, depression, and ptsd. After all of this I‚Äôve found myself standing alone unsure of who I am and what to do next. This book was a healing balm to my confused soul. It reminded me who I am and how to find my passion. It reminded where I came from and where I can go from here. I needed these words, I needed this medicine."
"I loved everything about this book, and I couldn't have found it at a more perfect time in my life. It is beautiful, brilliant, inspiring, empowering, thought provoking...I could go on and on. This book truly helped me on my path of self discovery, and I definitely think it is one I will keep re-visiting. I cannot recommend this book enough and tell all of my girlfriends about it."
"I‚Äôve waited so long for this book. It could not get here fast enough. I‚Äôve been following Glennon since the Momastery days and this is the best version she‚Äôs yet to be. This is her heart and soul on paper and I‚Äôm a better human being for having read her words.I‚Äôd also like to add that I think perfectly written for a time like now. The crazy in our world. The unknown. I‚Äôm quarantined in with my kids. I can read a story, reflect on it, clean a little more, play, read another story. Being stuck in and confined to my family bubble, it‚Äôs allowed me to take every word in. It‚Äôs allowing me to find my knowing. She puts into words what so many of us long to say or haven‚Äôt quite found the words powerful enough. She nails it. All of it.I love this book and I love her because I am her."
Too preachy
Chapters are short and bounce from one year to next and back again. Absolutely loved her other books but this one seems forced and repetitive from things written in previous books.
Did not like this book at all
"Glennon's writing makes important life lessons easy to read and understand. No matter your circumstance, you will feel seen and be able to relate better to any human you encounter. This book should be required reading for all parents. I know it's a must with all of my future baby shower gifts!"
"This book was amazing. I didn‚Äôt realize that I needed it as much as I did. Regardless of where you are in life, Glennon reaches out and touches your soul with her intimate perspective and constant champion of self-truth.This book will make you feel. Make you think. And force you to dive deeper into places of yourself you‚Äôve never thought to go."

  ¬†My copy goes from page 128‚Ä¶.and then all of a sudden it‚Äôs pages 81-128 again and then to page 177. This is a first for me. Bummed because it was supposed to be my airplane book for a long flight. The return window has already passed for this purchase. Any suggestions?"
"It's my fault.....I should have read the reviews first! had no idea what this book was about when I purchased it. I bought it simply because Reese Witherspoon recommended it. I would describe it as an autobiographical, self-help book with a Christian bent. Not what I needed or was interested in right now."
"If I could give this book 45 stars, I would. From beginning to end, I laughed, cried, nodded my head vigorously, and at a few points yelled ‚Äúyes yes yes!‚Äù To say this book has changed my life in a week is an understatement. I felt stuck before I read it, and less than a week later, I am unstuck in more than one area. Thank you, Glennon! Anyone who knows my work as a comedian and storyteller, never would‚Äôve guessed that I was ‚Äútame‚Äù.But I WAS! I wasn‚Äôt being the real me. Now, however, I realized I had been holding back my true self all along. Thank you for giving me permission to become even more untamed, more unfiltered, and more myself than I ever thought possible. You are a godsend and tomorrow, I start reading Untamed for the second time. Your biggest fan, Lisa Lampanelli @lisalampanelli"
"I thought this was going to be a book about the author‚Äôs journey of coming out later in life.  It‚Äôs actually just like if you took 100 cliche metaphors and divided them up into arbitrary chapters.  Really trite, would pass or get from library."
"An open reflection that opened my own heart. Glennon‚Äôs words could have easily been my own, though they would never have sounded that good if I put them to paper (but they sound pretty dang good in my head).  So many takeaways. I wanted to tear through it, but I would have to put it down and take time to digest and reflect. I never wanted it to end. I will be re-reading this one from time to time.Everyone is golden. I am. They‚Äôre not even locked. Let others be wild. Unlearn. Love without trust is not love at all. She‚Äôs relaxing on me! What do I love? When heartbreak rings, answer the door."
"I did not particularly enjoy this read.  While I appreciate the author‚Äôs candor and insight, I found her to be a bit quick to blame others for her own inability to know herself before commiting to relationships.  Could not relate to her at all.  She apparently finally found herself and I have never lost myself."
I was so excited to read this book. Lots of my friends suggested it. I was had already decided it wasn‚Äôt for me about halfway through but I forced myself to finish anyway hoping the end would surprise me. The author seems to totally contradict herself. Might keep and reread when I‚Äôm older with kids. Wasn‚Äôt for me.
I read a lot of self-help books (always trying to make myself more acceptable to the world!) and I love a lot of self-help books. Harriet Lerner‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Dance of Anger‚Äù comes to mind. This book was the first one to introduce me to the radical concept of trusting myself above all else. My world will never be the same.
"I ordered this book because I fell in love with Glennons other work ""Love Warrior"". That book truly changed me. With ""untamed"" I feel the same. It is as if she is giving permission for things that are in my head yet society makes me feel as if they are not okay. She is telling you it's okay to scream them from the rooftops. I am not a mother, and yet when she talks about motherhood I find myself wishing I had been told or taught the things she realizing are important to teach her children. Glennon has such an amazing way with words I feel incredibly different after reading a few pages. I cannot stress hard enough how wonderful this book is and I'd love to scream from the rooftops that this is a must read."
"Laughed at many parts and overall enjoyed reading but I don't know if it""s so terribly hard to listen to your ""knowing""  and walk away from a long unfulfilling marriage when walking straight into the arms of another....? Should have listened to your ""knowing"" when there wasn't someone there to catch you, maybe?  That would have been truly authentic, Glennon. :)"
"I heard that Adele loved this book, so I bought it.  It's a bio essay with some of life's lessons mixed in. I am still trying to get into it."
"I have known for a long time what a great writer Glennon is. I first picked up ""Love Warrior"" when it made Oprah's List like a lot of us. However, ""Untamed"" is her best work yet. She made me laugh, she made me cry, she realized that I'm a darn ****** cheetah. Glennon, with her with Abby, and Together Rising prove that even one woman can make a difference in the world. I can be that one woman. She encouraged me to pick writing back up. She shows me how to be vulnerable and more compassionate. This is a book that I will always remember. During all this COVID 19 madness, I just mailed to my 69 year old dad and 67 year old mom to check out. Thank you, Glennon! All the love."
"This is a story of becoming. Of learning to know. To trust. To exist fully. This has been and will continue to be my work. Thank you, Glennon for this gift of words that describes how I feel."
"This book is a story of a woman finding freedom from societal expectations, and thereby finding true love and happiness on the other side of bulimia, alcoholism, and divorce. Inspiring and gripping, Glennon's story will have you laughing and crying - sometimes simultaneously! Highly recommend!"
I LOVE this book. I have loved Glennon‚Äôs writing from her first book. I feel differently than the one negative review that I read. I LOVE that Glennon has changed and evolved in her three books! It is actually very freeing and what I enjoy most about her. I‚Äôm 51 and feel like I would have written three very different books as I learn more about loving and TRUSTING myself over the last 30 years. Isn‚Äôt that the point that we can learn and change and create the journey we are supposed to have on this earth? I underline and dog ear every page. LOVE you Glennon and when you finally get to do your book tour I hope to get to be in the front row.
"Glennon has outdone herself with this treasure.  What a gift.  I will re-read, highlight and quote this book for a very long time. I think it‚Äôs a must read for all women. I bought copies for all my daughters and friends.  It is so important for women of any age to give themselves permission to live their best possible life and that motherhood does not have to equal martyrdom. I‚Äôm a changed person for having read this book.  The conversations with my daughters has been the biggest blessing. We all are better and stronger .... and more untamed....for having read this book.  Thank you, Glennon."
"3.5 stars. There were portions of this book that were great, especially when discussing racism & white supremacy. At other points, I was ready to abandon the book. I know others enjoy this author; for me, she's not my cup of tea."
"I think anyone who has not only experienced grief or loss or shame, but committed to learning more about themselves in the process, knows that the gift is the revolution of becoming more who we really are with time and experience.This book is truly about one persons process that she is willing to share with all of us. I am deeply grateful for the people who have been to hell and back, even more so when they‚Äôre willing to say it out loud. We all have a story that, when understood, shows how we became exactly who we are today.There are only a few books that have shifted my life or the way I view myself, and this is one of them. I sent this book to every woman I love, because I wish I‚Äôd read it when I was 20."
"Excellent book! I underlined and made so many notations in it. I love books that I can get gems out of to think differently, that open my heart and my mind. Thank you Glennon for your raw honesty! I am learning how to trust my Knowing and this definitely helped me in that journey."
There was nothing entertaining or life changing about this book.  I couldn‚Äôt even finish it since it was so boring... not sure why this person is glorifying something that hundreds go through. Nothing special here just a bunch of rambling stories.
"LOVED this book! Amazing, well written, enjoyable book about discovering and becoming your authentic self. I read it with a highlighter in hand. It‚Äôs not written like a self-help book at all, but I found myself gleaning so much from it. Her humor and insight made it a delightful read."
"What a book of short thoughtful chapters to make you look inside yourself and consider new ideas and thought processes. Not exactly self-help but not exactly not self-help, this book opens doors you didn‚Äôt even know could open inside your brain. Highly recommend for today‚Äôs world, today‚Äôs women and girls, and today‚Äôs challenges."
This book is the best book I've ever read!  I tell everyone that this is a must read for every single person in this world!  I love how Glennon describes so much I can relate to!  I gave it to both my daughters who are in their 20's & they are telling all their friends they need to read this book as well!
"I can't believe how much this book has impacted me already, and I'm only 24 pages in. I purchased it immediately after watching an interview with Glennon and Marie Forleo. Glennon's stories feel so real and relatable, and her writing style is short and concise. While the world is shouting ""women's empowerment"" Glennon is saying, ""yes, and this is where we start."" These are everyday, real-life examples of how women become caged. The reason I love this so much is that it is so dang relatable, instead of preaching big, complex, and unattainable ideas about women's empowerment. I can't wait to share this book once I've finished it with all of the women I know and love in my life.Buy this book. You won't regret it."
"I love Glennon. Maybe you don't know who she is, maybe you do and don't love her, but either way you should read Untamed. It's probably the next right thing, to be honest.To those that are saying that Glennon has changed, aspects of her message have changed, etc -- perhaps that is the entire point. Glennon isn't telling you exactly what to do, what is true and beautiful for you, she is telling us that you know what is true and beautiful for you. We don't need a guidebook, the guidebook is already in us. Untamed is about trusting your truest deepest self, and running wild with that trust.I'm pretty sure every page of this book is stained with my tears. I'm sharing this book with every woman I know -- because it has changed my world and I think it could change yours. Thank you, thank you, thank you Glennon walking me home to my wild, untamed self."
"This purchase was made for a Book Club I belong to. I had a most difficult time reading the material, eventually finding it on my Libby Audiobook App, I was able to finish by listening. Most of the substance in the pages is something one learns in middle school. It did give me additional compassion for others with mental illnesses. Author uses a lot of ‚Äúwe‚Äù as if we are all in this together and in agreement, personally it was a big waste of time for me."
"For so many decades I had taken in the cliches and soundbites of a generation.  ""Just Do It!"" and ""Be all that you can be."" Messages like ""You can find your purpose in 40 days,"" and others like it caused me to feel much confusion and fear when, after following what i thought was my one true calling, I lost it all due to a brain tumor and two surgeries that left me disabled.  After 7 years of full time college and about 5 years of work, the tumor returned and I lost my career.I didn't think God would let something like that happen. After all, I had ""the promises!:  I spent years trying to figure out how this could happen. My faith was sorely tested. My interpretation of the Bible and messages like, ""just pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" caused me much internal pain. I have pushed against myself so hard that it has left me exhausted and in physical pain more times than not. This book gave me permission to be human...a frail human with more compassion for other frail humans. Kate writes brilliantly about her own struggles during a terrible diagnosis and shares her thoughts and fears with wit and authenticity without leaving the reader with no hope. It reminded me of reading the Biblical book of Esther. God's fingerprints are everywhere, even when His name isn't mentioned."
"Kate Bowler is a truth teller. With her hilarious, sarcastic wit, she courageously shares her medium-sad story with the world. Inviting us to live our own messy, beautiful lives without promises. And offering hope where so often there just isn't much to be had. I ADORED this book! And I'm moving forward with a view of the world AS IT IS. Beautiful. And terrible. What a truth I needed to hear!"
"In No Cure for Being Human, Kate Bowler gives us an intimate look into her cancer journey‚Äîfrom her diagnosis to the days, months, and years that follow. She challenges many of the go-to responses to our mortality‚Äîcarpe diem, bucket lists‚Äîand asks: When there just isn‚Äôt enough time, how does one spend it?Bowler helps us feel our raw humanity, unfiltered. Her truth is painful, poignant, and, full of joy. Her words are a gift if we let ourselves sink into the depths of her experience. Highly recommend."
"I spend last night waiting for this book to upload. Then I spent my day reading and reflecting as I continued to keep my coffee cup full.  So much to think about, so much to encourage me, it filled my day. I feel like I was given the glimpse into a personal friend‚Äôs life. A life where they shared thoughts that are never spoken out loud. What a gift to find these thoughts freed to enter all of our hearts."
"I was anticipating the arrival of this book, after being mesmerized by Kate‚Äôs first memoir - Everything Happens for a Reason, and other lies I‚Äôve loved. This didn‚Äôt disappoint. She shares her journey with honesty and insight. She ties it back to so many cultural beliefs, and I imagine most readers will find this book eye opening. She really gives a glance into what it is like to live, when you‚Äôre not guaranteed your future, especially in our culture of self-help where everyone seems to have a fix for everything. She speaks truth to what it means to be human and to be beautifully fragile. I highly recommend!"
"I brought ""No Cure for Being Human"" to my PET scan, and it felt like bringing a knowing friend along, the kind who's as good at understanding what *not* to say as she is knowing what to say at the perfect moment. Kate's hard-won wisdom, carefully doled vulnerability, and humor (no ""u""; I'm American) have led me to become a long-time fan, and ""No Cure"" delivers it all and then some. It's a good thing I bought the Kindle version, because I highlighted perfectly crafted sentences on page after page. I would have made a mess out of print. If you're going through a craptastic time involving radioactive tests and way too many needles, read this book. And if you're not, read this book. It's a guidebook for raw feelings and hard decisions, and it's written by one of the best."
"Packed with illuminating insight, sage awareness, and laugh out loud ‚Äòisms to get you through every day. I‚Äôm so grateful for Kate for telling it like it is: the finitude, uncertainty and realities, grief and gratitude, dashed dreams and hopes. So much living while facing so much uncertainty. She shows us how to do it. Because, yes, there‚Äôs no cure for being human. Beautifully sculpted sentences with a lifetime of insight for all of us."
"This book takes you into the middle of what it's like to live with a chronic, incurable condition--cancer.  Sounds like fun, huh?  Well, actually it is... Kate is funny, really funny and very clever in her funniness.  BUT, she's also honest and deep and her writing is so beautiful!  I try to savor books--but this one I didn't want to put down--I devoured it.  And I'm a better human because of it.  Kate gives the gift of helping me understand on a visceral level a little of what it means to live with no cure for being human.  Buy this book. You will love it."
"The best book I have read in many, many years. More than words on paper or a kindle, this was a living heart filled with love poured out into infinity. I‚Äôll be honest, I read a lot and my mind will sometimes wander during the reading. Not with this book folks. My mind was locked in with such focus and magnetic pull it seemed as if the words were floating off the pages of this book right in to my very being. Kate Bowler is an absolutely phenomenal writer. I read all kinds of books on a variety of subject matter, many of them very well known with blockbuster sales. None of them come close to the sheer presence and heartfelt power of this book. This is an extremely important book that will change your life for the better."
"What a breath of fresh air! The author takes us on a ""medium-sad"" trip through her cancer journey. She reminds we humans that life is more than bucket lists and living a life where everything is fine, whether it really is or not. Being human is hard and beautiful--soaking in the love all around us, marveling at and in God's love and creation. I read this book as I listen to the audio, the author's voice reading it as she intended it to be read...I recommend it!"
there are lists of books you must read before you die.this book is among the several to be read so you will know how it is that we ought to live
"Thank you, Kate Bowler, for saying all the hard, beautiful and raw words that give us permission to live in the ‚Äúlumpy middle‚Äù without resolution, yet with hope. This book is exquisite, witty, funny, sad and a balm."
"...beautiful, raw and honest mind. What a gift to the world you are, Kate. Thanks for the reminders of grace and love from those we journey with."
"This book opens with Kate's grim diagnosis, when she has been given a set number of days she must pour her life and her love into. Through her poignant prose and quick wit, Kate cuts through the hollow cultural cliches to get to the marrow of it all: we are finite, fragile creatures who are held together by deep love and hope. Perhaps being human isn't something to escape or out work or out hustle, but a beautiful, terrible truth. As Dr. Bowler says, ""It takes great courage to live. Period."" This work and Kate's words will stick to your ribs."
I have read both of the Author's recent books (both this week!) on her experience with having...and surviving Cancer.  I love her dry wit and style of writing.  I have never copied and pasted so many quotes from a book (for my own personal journal). She is courageous and inspirational.  Bravo Kate!
"I am on a cancer journey right now.  Reading this book helped in that there was no sugarcoating of Kate's journey, only accepting what the reality truly is.  Too many people tell me ""you've got this"" and I don't want to disappoint them and tell them truthfully I am scared.  People tell me you've got God on your side when I feel it so unfair to have cancer.  This book is not cheer cheer I beat cancer but the truth and reality of the journey.  This book is not meant to make you feel better but make you think.  I appreciate that.  It is an inspiring story and I enjoyed reading this book very much."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this book from Kate Bowler.  She tells the story of her journey with cancer while reflecting on cliches and important complicated truths.  For example, she tells us that instead of ""No regrets,"" the complicated truth is ""Facing the past is part of facing the future"" and that ""You are invincible"" might be countered with ""No cure for being human."" I appreciate her willingness to struggle with the chronicity of her condition.  Additionally, she has a great sense of humor and introduces us to statues of the world's largest things.  Worth reading and discussing!"
"Kate Bowler writes from specific personal experience with stage 4 cancer at age 35 -- but her words really speak to anyone experiencing adversity. I can say that after experiencing my husband's accidental death and reading dozens of grief books, there are few writers who ""strum my pain"" better than Kate. Her book ""Everything Happens for a Reason and Other Lies I've Loved"" was my Christmas reading for 2018. I travelled to hear her speak at the Aspen Institute in early 2019, am a regular listener to her ""Everything Happens"" podcast, and have now just devoured this book. Over and over, she puts the perfect words to feelings I can not express, and makes me feel just a wee bit less alone."
"Kate Bowler is a master storyteller. She had me laughing out loud and then thinking 'Wait, what?' as she tied the story to a bigger thought. Anyone who loves wit, snark, irreverence and also tends to ask 'Why?' might like to dive into this one."
So good. So needed. I laughed and cried in equal measure. What a beautiful tribute to being human and alive
I bought this book because of all the 5 star reviews. If there was a - 5 I would give it but I am stuck with giving it a1 star. I have read 62 pages of this boring book and doubt I will read anymore. So far I haven‚Äôt found anything good to say about it.
"This book is both delightful and as Kate says, ‚Äúmedium sad.‚Äù I downloaded the book and couldn‚Äôt put it down until finished. I highly recommend!"
"This is a book for those in search of rigorous honesty. She pulls not punches. She writes clearly and ruthlessly about the pointlessness of life and how, in the end, that's where find meaning and grace. I'll be reading it again."
I could not put this book down. Read it in an afternoon.  Beautifully told memoir full of love a d life
She writes in a strong human voice. I'm thankful for her wisdom and faith. Both are real and tangible. Another heartfelt offering.
A must read for us and our caregivers. Gave words to my own emotions. Thank you from so many of us facing the final chapters.
"Kate Bowler did it again! She wrote another book honoring her humanity and ours and makes us laugh while doing it. Bless her wit, perceptiveness, and wisdom. Don't miss it!"
"I could not put this book down. It is raw, emotional, hard hitting, and honest. I found myself with tears streaming down my cheeks one page and laughing out loud the next. As a medical professional I am so disturbed by the authors experience but I am inspired by her reaction to it. Thank you Kate!"
"A confrontation with imminent death that doesn‚Äôt settle for easy answers.  It‚Äôs Christian in the best and most profound way, very aware of the limitations of what can be known as well as the hope required to move into an uncertain future."
"Honest, needing to hear these very words today. Kate brings beauty to the mundane and hope to those that strive for more."
There are so many nuggets for living this life in the book - I will be reading again and again!
"I devoured Kate Bowler's first book in a very short time. So when I read No Cure for Being Human, I made myself slow down and savor this one. Bowler has a way of making me think and reflect on both her life and my life. She also can make me cry and she can make me laugh. Sometimes almost at the same time.No Cure for Being Human is more of her true story about her life as she has faced a cancer diagnosis as a young mom, married wife, friend and family member. She shares things realistically. I almost feel like I am standing with her in the doctor's office or wanting to hold her hand as she waits for the oncologist's report. Having been with a few doctors myself this summer, reading her work, has caused me to nod my head as I think about my own doctor visits. I also could relate to her thoughts on how to deal with life after such a diagnosis. Should she make a bucket list? How should she live her best life after her own body tried to kill her (as she says)?I would recommend No Cure for Being Human to anyone and everyone. But to someone who has to deal with a difficult diagnosis, I think it could be especially helpful. I enjoyed reading her story and her realistic, but refreshing outlook on life.I received a copy of this book from the author and the publisher. All opinions within this review are my own."
Wow. Kate Bowler. Thanks for making me sob through a book.No self help cliches here and no pick yourself up by the bootstraps jargon. In fact no cliches at all. Just real down in the dirt in your guts honest truth. But somehow that truth will give you hope. Will focus you like a laser beam on what‚Äôs real and what‚Äôs really important and worthwhile.This is a book I sped through in a morning and will buy as as soon as it comes out because I will want to read it again and again and mark it up from cover to cover. It‚Äôs one of those books that sits with you a long time. It will make you ponder and even changes you. Not because you‚Äôre psyched up and on another self help kick you‚Äôre starting on Monday  but because it‚Äôs true and profound and funny ( Kate is really funny by the way and she made me laugh and cry ) and beautiful and real and it‚Äôs meant to be thoughtfully and slowly and mindfully pondered . It‚Äôs a little like the Velveteen rabbit in someone‚Äôs personal story form. Read this book my friends. I highly recommend it. Preorder it. Buy it when it comes out. Read it slowly.  Again and again till it sinks in deeply and all the fur rubs off in all the best ways. You will not be sorry.
"What I expected: the same gorgeous writing and careful, generous, kind thoughts as ""Everything Happens for a Reason."" But also maybe to be real depressed? Or to disagree a bit? With how very, very anti-, like, trying? Bowler can sometimes be?What I got? I got to finally understand that Kate Bowler is not anti-trying. She's just being honest that the best we can do is to try and enjoy our lives in some moments and to try and get through them in others. This book is such a balm for those of us who are never going to look like Best Life material.The thing about being chronically ill (or mentally ill or disabled or...) is you come to realize how everyone is pretending. Pretending they are OK.Pretending they can't get sick or lose someone or fail at their careers.Pretending that ""fine"" and ""super-duper"" and ""here are my vacations and successes"" is the definition of normal.We tell each other that pretending helps somehow.But the truth is, there's a lot of freedom to be found when you can't pretend anymore.When there's no cure, you get to just acknowledge that things are good and bad, all the time, forever.This is a book for us. the humans.for everyone incurable.for everyone who woke up one day and found pretense was lost to them.There are so many more of us than we sometimes think."
"In July 2019, I was in grad school hundreds of miles away from home when my mother was diagnosed with cancer. That night, a friend sent me a link to Kate Bowler's podcast and encouraged me to listen. I was instantly drawn into both the tragedy of Kate's story (a young professor, diagnosed with a horrible disease, suddenly struck by the finitude of life) and the way she seemed to have become so remarkably at ease with it. Over the next two years, I devoured her writing, podcast episodes, and social media posts at every chance I got, often finding comfort and strength from how she was choosing to live her life in the aftermath of terrible news.So, when I was given the opportunity to read an advance copy of No Cure for Being Human, I obviously jumped at the chance. I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but I was certainly not disappointed. In the memoir, she explores the question of how to live a life that you didn't choose for yourself, all while including vignettes from her childhood in Canada, the adventures of her toddler son, and interactions with her colleagues at Duke Divinity School. It is deeply funny, surprisingly relatable, and thoughtful.As I read (and then re-read) the book throughout the summer of 2021, my mother was finishing cancer treatment, I was starting a new job, and the question of what, if anything, I had gotten out of the past year was lingering over my head. I was struck by the way Kate was willing to admit that life before this terrible thing happened was better than life after, but didn't use it as a hitching post for self-pity. I have held onto this seemingly contradictory idea ever since, often returning to the text as a reminder that life doesn't have to have gone the way you planned for it to have gone well.Kate's faith is evident throughout No Cure for Being Human, though it never feels overtly religious. In fact, her writing is approachable to people with a strong faith or with no faith at all. Though she deals with themes that some readers will view through a spiritual lens, they are also profoundly human. If you have ever found yourself wondering ""what is this difficulty teaching me?,"" only to later realize that it may not have been teaching you anything at all, you will find that many of the themes featured really sing."
"Kate's writing is stunning. If you haven't read her first memoir, ""Everything Happens for a Reason (and other lies I've loved),"" stop right now and pick up a copy. It's a keeper.""No Cure for Being Human"" is her second memoir that digs even deeper to questions about meaning, suffering, existing as a human in a finite body. I stopped to reread passages more than once, as her thoughts provoked my own questions and tender places. The realness with which she shares her experience and asks difficult questions is disarming and alluring. This is one of those books you highlight something on nearly every page, full of wisdom and depth.I was honored to have Kate as my professor for Church History back in seminary. It was before her cancer diagnosis, and we were her first class she taught after having her son, Zach. So much of that class was memorable, not only for the creative ways she covered the content, but her clear delight in the fun side of life. Years and chemo treatments later, that perspective may have shifted but has not disappeared. Kate somehow holds together deep grief and levity in a way I wouldn't have thought possible.This a book to be savored, to share with a close friend, to journal. ""No Cure for Being Human"" is one of the most honest & insightful books I've ever read."
"Hilarious and irreverent takedown of the positivity industry.Absolutely enjoyable read.At times, reads more like a novel than a memoir."
"It's clear from reading ""No Cure For Being Human"" that Kate Bowler has endured tremendous anxiety and suffering since her diagnosis with colon cancer. At the same time, she also manifests joy, grace, and empathy toward those enduring their own hardships. Because of that empathy, she has become a light to many people who felt emotionally and spiritually alone in their suffering, for whom Christian bromides and new agey slogans didn‚Äôt fit their reality. Her compassion, and even humor, come through in ""No Cure For Being Human,"" offering honest hope to those who need it - and an understanding that not all of life's problems can be fixed with positive thinking."
"Life with God is a journey. I consider it somewhat of an adventure. Because God is always working. But sometimes, in the midst of our busy lives, we can easily miss His Hand in what happens to us.This is my true story. I had pre-ordered this book, ""No Cure For Being Human,"" because I had gotten to ""know"" Kate through her social media presence. I do feel I know her. However, I believe it is the Spirit of God in me who recognizes the Spirit of God in Kate.On the very day this book came out, before I even had a chance to look at the book--I received a phone call from the VA hospital. I thought it was just to make another round of appointments. But the person told me I have a terminal lung disease. (Don't we all have a terminal disease)?Unfortunately, my wife was on a vacation with her mom and sister and I was home alone for the day. Well not completely alone. Jesus was there. And Kate was there.This is a true story and I do have a witness, because I had a very young man here at my house when I received the call. This young 23 y/o brand new father heard the phone call because I had put it on speaker expecting just a routine call. Poor kid. I felt more sorry for him than I did for myself in that very awkward situation. But I digress.I was reeling emotionally. Completely alone, as my wife had gone on a road trip with her sister and mom.  Alone with all the thoughts. All the questions. The what-ifs. The what am I gonna dos. The what about my family questions.I'd been introduced to Kate's work through a suffering friend who'd discovered her work. God brought Kate into my life right at the beginning of the pandemic. Her ministry had become a life-line for me in my faith journey. God found me a church that respected COVID protocols. Now I've been in church for over a year, and I'm developing friendships which I haven't had for years.What I'm saying is I feel like I know Kate personally. I think this is because Kate actually is who she appears to be. She kind of reminds me of one of Jesus' disciples. When Jesus saw this disciple, Jesus said he, the disciple, was a person with ""no guile."" That's how I see Kate. She's fully human. She's R-E-A-L.I do not idolize her. Nor do I idealize her. Why would I when she tells us all of her doubts and fear and struggles being human? But I do have deep and abiding respect for her as a person. These are the type of humans I need to emulate.The book. If my description of Kate and her work has not sold you on the books, I just don't know what else to say. I am a person who separates books into categories just for my own learning and level of interest. This book, along with Kate's first book--another NY Times bestseller--are in my ""go to"" books for life. For me, they are not just to be read. They're to be studied. Lived. They are reference books on how to be a decent human.I call her ""my dear sister Kate,"" for that is who she is to me. That night, the night I learned the diagnosis--the night Kate's book came out--I was tired so I thought, I'm going to message my dear sister Kate. I needed to tell her. Of course, I wasn't expecting a response from a human with two best-sellers, a bajillion social media followers and a crazy, zany schedule that makes me tired just reading it.Suddenly I noticed there was a response to my message. It wasn't Kate's assistant. It was Kate herself. Because that is who Kate is. Kate gently said she was sorry for my experience that day and that I was not alone. And she was absolutely correct. What a human!So, buy the books. Buy treasure for your soul. You won't regret it. I do recommend the audiobook, because Kate (of course) reads it herself, so you get all the inflections of voice and Kate's whimsical little childlike half-laugh when she thinks something is funny. And most things are funny to Kate. I think.Kate, thank you so much for allowing God to use your personal tragedies to give out His love to starving, weary, thirsty people. I treasure you, my dear sister Kate. And not because you're famous or incredibly talented and gifted. Because you are fully and unabashedly human. You are real. You are Kate."
This was an excellent book. Written from a place of genuine tenderness. Thankful to Kate for this work.
"A beautiful look at the things that matter. Purchased copies for my friends, too!"
"I love Priscilla Shirer's teachings and always learn so much.  I was really enjoying the Elijah study until I got to the last week of the study and noticed that pages 193 - 208 were missing had been replaced by a repeat of pages 177-192.  It's disappointing to not have the content for the last week after doing the entire study.  And Amazon says my window to return the book has closed (Feb 8).  I never thought to inspect the entire book when it arrived to make sure the pages were all there and in order nor do I think I should have to.  I think in this circumstance, I should be sent a replacement.  I'm doing the study virtually, so can't look over the shoulder of someone else to see their book."
"Editted to add that Lifeway is sending me a replacement book. The book itself is awesome, but there was a bad batch missing pages as indicated in my original review below. Check the pages as soon as you receive the book, so you can return it before it is too late.I loved this book & Bible study.....until I finished page 192. Pages 193-208 are missing & in their place are duplicate pages of 177-192. This is near the end of the book, so the return window has closed. I don't see a question section for this product, so I can only write a negative review. If the seller can send a replacement book, this review will be updated."
"This is yet another excellent study by Priscilla!She writes as if she is sitting across the table looking at you and listening to you.Elijah is an Old Testament hero that actually has a lot for us to learn from. Especially how to pray and how to move more deeply into our relationship with God.Her writing is practical and the study asks very good questions that invites you into deeper Scripture study AND asks you questions that allow you to look closely at yourself. She moves toward helping you recognize God moving in your life‚Äîbecause He is!!!  We need her help to ‚Äúclean our glasses‚Äù to see Him at work. And she does a very fine job in this study.I find her studies are good for individuals to study privately as well as for group study. There are videos soon available, or you can open your Bible and use this study guide without the video. I believe the videos will be icing on the cake to these studies!"
"If you are living by a dried up brook, this is the book for you!  God shows Elijah how to totally trust in Him when there is nothing but Him.Priscilla Shire knows how to deliver the Scriptures just like her Dad Tony Evans!  She is a gifted speaker. Author and Bible study leader."
I haven't finished it yet but had to come on to start my review and will update when I have finished. This book is very relevant to what is happening today. It makes me excited to do the daily studies. If you can get the Audio bundle that accompanies it. Very powerful! FIRE!!!
"I ordered this book in February, excited to join the Bible study group at my church. However, I have gone through the book only to realize that chapter 6 is repeated twice and a significant number of pages are missing from each copy of chapter 6 of the book. There should be a study for days 1-5. I have a Day 1 and then a Day 5 then it repeats the entire chapter again with a Day 1 and a Day 5. Unfortunately, by now I am outside of the return window! So, I am stuck with an incomplete book!"
"Was supposed to be a new copy, but it sure doesn't look like it is."
I‚Äôm happy to have the book but something happened in transport and the top corner is creased. I hope I can get a new copy but if not I‚Äôll still be okay getting the lessons.
FYI not much room for your answer's.  Hard to keep track as author did not put 1 kings 18 or 1 kings 17 in daily questioning that flutters the reader who us challenged and her videos we not a success at weekly studies unable to run weekly and she flashes the answer's and writing styles are different to manage for the reader challenged such as myself.Study is excellent and a bit to wordy ask you a question in studies and then answers it in immediate paragraph or next. I was frustrated with this study as book is different to read as ink color and text is different
my copy of this book was defective it was missing pages 177 through pages192!  Amazon reordered it to replace I hope the next copy is correct with ALL the pages!!!!
My book was great until I reached the last 4-5 of the end of the book.  It was missing all those pages and had repeats of the week before lesson.  I would really like to get the book with the correct pages.  Pages 193-208 are missing.  This is the last week (6).
i ordered the 2 study workbooks in jan. 2021. we just finished the study a week ago.  the last part of the work books were missing. we couldn't finish our study in the book.  would you please send us new books with all of the days of the study intact?  we'd really like to have what we paid for.  thanks
This study book is brilliantly written and easy to follow along to
I am having the same issue as others with missing pages. Priscilla has done an amazing job once again with this study but it is very frustrating that I received a book that is missing most of week six.
"This is an amazing study, but it‚Äôs missing half of week 6. My book has misprints. After page 192 my book goes to page 177 again. It is missing days 2,3, and 4 for week six. I love the study and luckily someone else in my bible study was able to send me photos of the missing pages, but kind of confusing and disappointing. Look through your book to make sure all the pages are there!"
"We chose this study this summer for our small church group and was it AMAZING?We all love our sister Priscilla Shirer! She is such an incredible teaching power house of God's word. I mean don't get me wrong, there is a lot of homework but man was I overwhelmingly crying about God's revelation and timing in my life. It was a coincidence that we picked this study just to hear a guest Pastor at our church talking about ""Elijah"" the very same day. And of course the coincidences didn't stop there, they just kept going all the way to the sermon of another Pastor who have mentioned ""Elijah"" this past weekend which was our last week. We were all like we know him :) This study will challenge you, push you and will bring you to the point where you will be able to answer: ""Where am I"", ""Who am I"", ""Whose am I"" and all the whys behind every answer you give that is an excuse to not move forward in faith.I urge you that if you are looking for your next step and want to grow in His word then read this book. Thank you Priscilla for all that you do for us girls and His kingdom and thank you for your ongoing passion to push us forward. May God continues to bless you as you keep on moving forward spreading his Light on His word and promises for our lives. We love you and can't wait to read your next book.Thank you Jesus for all that YOU are all that we are because of YOU. Use us for your glory, kingdom and power... Amen"
"I felt I needed to write an honest review for those of us who struggle with anxiety/depression/mental health issues. Maybe you know and can relate to Elijah‚Äôs story and are considering this study to see how this Biblical hero navigates and encounters God in his darkest moments.I was thoroughly enjoying the study until week 6, which is when we find Elijah at his weakest moment, when he ran away into the wilderness and into the cave.  This is the part I had been looking forward to because I have been there.I noticed though, that the author approaches Elijah‚Äôs situation with much judgment and assumption that is not supported by scripture.  After reading 1 Kings 19:4 the author concluded ‚ÄúFor Elijah, this season of fatigue uncovered an inflated ego underneath his tough exterior‚Äù (pg. 192).  An inflated ego?  I just don‚Äôt see that in the text.  I see the downward spiral of fear and shame.  Elijah had a holy longing to see revival and that didn‚Äôt happen, of course he was crushed.Next, after reading 1 Kings 19:11-21, the author concludes ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs question, in conjunction with the remarkable happenings soon to follow, are about to expose a mound of self-focused pity that had consumed Elijah‚Äôs thinking,‚Äù and she says Elijah would ‚Äúemerge spiritually, mentally, and emotionally from the self-obsession he‚Äôd allowed to overtake his whole outlook on life,‚Äù (pg. 207).To those of you struggling with mental health and depression, I know this is not a choice.  We don‚Äôt choose depression, and I think there is a stigma among Christians that- well if we just prayed more or had more faith, if we just kept our eyes on God, we could just pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and get on with it‚Ä¶That‚Äôs not how it works.Thank God that He doesn‚Äôt judge and address Elijah (and us) the way the author does!  I am also surprised that the author didn‚Äôt propose the mystery of spiritual warfare here.  We see that before Elijah fled into the wilderness, that it was the Lord who girded up his loins and strengthened him to outrun Ahab to Jezreel (1 Kings 18:46).  Why?  God‚Äôs hand was in all of this.Overall, this was a challenging study.  I am a lay person and lead a women‚Äôs small group, and I chose this for our fall study.  As a working mom, I found the homework to be too much, but to get it done we went at a slower pace.  I have the utmost respect for the author and her ministry, but I would have appreciated an approach to Elijah's depression that was compassionate and not judgmental.  What gave me peace in this last week of study was not in my homework or video, but reading and re-reading the actual scriptures- from 1 Kings 17-19.To those of you struggling in a dark season right now, you are not alone, God sees you and loves you dearly.  He won‚Äôt address you with words like ‚Äúself-obsessed‚Äù and ‚Äúover inflated ego.‚Äù  He ministers sweetly and tenderly to your deepest needs, and if what you need is repentance that will come from a place of love, not condemnation.  Humans have the power to label things (and people) but only what God says to your heart truly matters."
"To say that this is one of the most profound Bible study‚Äôs that I‚Äôve ever been apart of is an absolute under statement! I can‚Äôt get enough of studying the life of Elijah. This Bible study has made him come to life all over again. Please, don‚Äôt miss this study. It was one of the best decisions so far in 2021. You will not be sorry. Buy the book!"
"Fabulous Bible study!  The author really makes you think about what Elijah truly experienced and brings that to today and your own life experiences.  It really helps you to find God's purpose for you.  This is a study guide that goes with a very enlightening video series.  I think you could do the study without the video series if you needed, though.  There is a page to fill in answers from the video each week, but the rest of the study that really corresponds to life application does not need the video for answers.  Highly Recommend!"
My book had some pages missing.  Could not finish the lesson.  Some default when assembling book together.  Did not realize until this week when doing my study.  The book was Elijah by Priscilla Shirir.
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
        
    










  
  
    
  ¬†I'm on week 5, day 5 of the book study and realized my book is missing several pages. It goes from 176 to 193. Then goes from 208 back to 193. Very frustrating!"
"This book needs a LOT of time. For every few pages, you‚Äôll need to go to the Bible & read 10-20 pages, so it looks manageable, but it‚Äôs not. If you have several hours per ‚Äúday‚Äù it would work. I was looking for an all inclusive book...meaning the Bible verse needed be in the book.  Unfortunately, with my schedule I do not have 2 or more hours to devote to each day, so I gave it away.It‚Äôs kind of expensive to need to pay extra for the videos, which I did not factor into the 2hourish daily study because I didn‚Äôt purchase actress."
I was very disappointed to find out this book required an additional purchase to complete the lessons. The note book is useless you write in this book for every lesson. I love the message and Bible study but she is making quite a profit/business off the Bible. I hope she's giving back.
Using this book along with Patricia‚Äôs videos gives insights on Elijah and his circumstances that I had never thought of and makes it meaningful in relation to our spiritual journey. I highly recommend this study because I believe it is so far the most valuable I have gone through.
"Priscilla Shirer as covered Elijah well in this book. She compares other bible prophets, biblical map routes and places, Bible passages and references, and the Israelites.  Pagan gods are just squalling bugs that should be treaded upon.Our Bible class does a week a lesson and is a lot of work for each day to cover the five lessons each week. (about 40 pages with many scriptures to look up and ponder)Suggestion: meet every two weeks or once a month."
THIS STUDY IS WELL WRITTEN AND VERY THOUGHT PROVOKING.  I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT TO ANY ONE WANTING A CLOSER WALK WITH GOD.  THE AUTHOR DOES A GREAT JOB.  AND THE LEADERS OF THE BIBLE STUDY ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO A VIDEO THAT GOES WITH EACH WEEK OF THIS STUDY.
"Highly recommend this study. Unfortunately, my copy was missing pages from the final week so I didn't realize until after the return window was closed. I contacted Lifeway to see if I could get an electronic copy of the missing pages. They were not able to do anything since I ordered through Amazon. As the window is closed and there is no way to contact without starting a return, a review is my only recourse. Seems there was a problem with this printing so check your copy when you receive it. I do recommend the study!"
"Not quite done with this study but will update anything when I am. So what do I think so far?‚Ä¶ I am loving it! Sure, there are some things I feel like get a little political or controversial, but it doesn‚Äôt take away from the study one bit. I just see it as a difference of opinions and that‚Äôs fine with me. Priscilla does a great job at weaving biblical times into today‚Äôs society and culture and our own lives. There are so many other great things in this study that it is definitely worth checking out and doing with family, friends or a small group. However, I would say, I would not recommend this study to a new believer. I would have been super intimidated by this study had it been my first."
We are starting our second week and all I can say is Wow! God has certainly lead us to a very timely subject. The video was powerful and full of so many impactful truths. This is an equipping source for believers to look at some pretty amazing details of The prophet Elijah's life and his call to serve God. Details that aren't much different from we as believers are currently facing.
I love Priscilla Shirer! She is a extremely gifted teacher of God's word.  This study is so timely for the covid pandemic and is quite honestly one of the most exciting Bible study courses I've ever taken.  Follow along with Priscilla as she guides you through God's Word showing how God prepared Elija to be one of the most famous prophets of the Bible. This study guide was hard to put down!
"Priscilla Shirer puts out consistently good Bible studies and this was no exception.  I knocked out one star for some repetitiveness from her other studies, but I definitely got quite a bit of spiritual value from completing this book.  The videos are very nice, if you want to purchase them in addition to the book, but I don't think they are essential."
Another great Bible study from Priscilla Shirer.  Focuses on times when God takes you through a wilderness and you can't understand why or see what He's doing.  Expect Spiritual growth!
"This was a great study! Priscilla is my favorite Bible study teacher and she brings Elijah to life and his struggles, his vulnerabilities, well as, his strong faith in God. Priscilla's teachings showed how our struggles and vulnerabilities are reflected in Elijah's struggles, vulnerabilities and his faith.  Great study!"
"I learned a lot with this study, though towards the end it was a bit repetitive. Might have been better for a four or at most five week study. I did not do the videos as they were a cost, and after renting the first one did not feel it added more to my study than the book already did."
"Great workbook bible study.  You can do it alone or in a group.  I have been a Christian since childhood, but still found things to learn, getting a lot from this book.  If you want to grow closer to God, this book will help you get into your bible and better understanding what God is doing in your life and why."
This study is phenomenal!! Everyone needs to do this one. Priscilla knocked it out of the park. One of the things my Bible study group has said is that it‚Äôs touching them exactly where they are right now. That‚Äôs how you know that the Holy Spirit is all over this study.
Priscilla doesn‚Äôt disappoint with this Bible Study. Each week is better than the last. The Holy Spirit sits with me as I study and shows me God‚Äôs hand in my life. I encourage you find a study group to do this story with. It will bless you.
CHECK YOUR BOOK because Missing pages 193-208 are missing. I can‚Äôt return because I noticed at the end of my study and it‚Äôs too late to return. I‚Äôm so upset!! I just read that this is happened to many others you would think that they would recall the books but they still kept selling them. No Integrity!
"Our Bible study went through this together and it‚Äôs been amazing! It chronicles the different seasons Elijah went through and the lessons he learned in each. Because of that, I think it speaks to every woman, regardless of which season they are in."
Such a good Bible study! Especially for this time! Makes Elijahs life come to life and helped me remember he was a real man and had real hard issues to walk through. But he did it by faith and knowing who His God was and what He could do!
This was a journey into Elijah's life as it mirrors modern day times!  The drought vs. the pandemic!  I am always amazed that the God who spoke then to Elijah is still speaking to us today!  You wont be disappointed - Make sure you get videos that accompany this study on lifeway website.  Definitely in for a treat!  Enjoy!
Powerful study
This book has to be the greatest work from Priscilla Shirer by far. From chapter one I have been seeing the mighty work of God in my life and in our group. I recommend this book with a rating greater than five!
Used for a Bible study group. The content questions were tough to understand. Even some of the choice words in reading content was challenging. My phones dictionary was helpful. Overall. Im very thankful for this new knowledge of Elijah. How his life pertains to our life today. This study does have great applications. We see a broad perspective of Elijah‚Äôs trials triumphs and victory!
Best book ever by Priscilla Shirer!!! It has given me so much so far. I am 3 weeks in. I believe this book is what all Christians need right now. Order fast because this book is freeing people and breaking people out of emotional chains.
"Prascilla Shirer is an incredible christian author and speaker who speaks from her experiences as a woman of God, a wife and a mother. This is one of many books that speak life into your soul and draw you closer to God!"
I am on day two. I ended day one in tears and day two the same way. It‚Äôs so encouraging to know that God can still use me even in my imperfections. This book is so empowering! I love it. I would highly recommend.
Priscilla has done it again!  This Bible Study will open your spiritual eyes to a message you haven‚Äôt seen before.  Highly recommend this for a Sunday School or small group study.
"If you truly study this book, you will see God using Elijah as he does us.  He always grooms/prepares us for the job he wants us to do.  It gives us growth in the waiting times."
"This was not my favorite Priscilla Shirer study, but God always has a way of speaking to some area of my life, and Priscilla is one of my favorite people to be His conduit."
This was by far the best study I have ever done. Had an amazing leader and women in my group. Such a great study for introspection. The videos were fantastic. I highly recommend this study.  Priscilla hit it out of the park. Thank you Lord for leading her on this!!
Received written in and missing 3 pages.
"This Bible study was apropos for the time. Being a true follower of Christ requires us to be bold and stand for God's truths. There will be situations that cause us to be unsettled and fearful, but God will direct us, hear our prayers, and provide for our needs. I highly recommend this study with a group of women."
"Leading a women‚Äôs group through this study guide, along with the videos, and it has been wonderful. Priscilla Shirer has some of the best curriculum for small groups."
"God often leads me to study that directly speaks to my current circumstance, problem, or attitude I‚Äôm dealing with. This book was certainly written for me. Excellent!"
"If you are looking for a Bible Study, look no further!  Priscilla Shirer is a gifted writer and speaker.  The study is very timely and she goes in depth to help you understand the context! I'm half way through.  I've learned a lot, and I have loved the study!"
Every person on the planet needs to do this study!! I‚Äôm leading a bible study right now with this book and it is amazing! Priscilla always does such a fantastic job with her studies and this one has been my favorite by far!
This study is amazing!!!!! I highly recommend it to everyone who wants to really study God‚Äôs word & be challenged in your walk with the Lord. Pricilla is a gifted lady. I want to do all of her studies. I‚Äôm reading Fervent next!!!
Best Bible study I‚Äôve done in a decade! Very appropriate for the times we are in and yet the lessons inside this book will be good for any time. Phenomenal!
This is truly a life-changing Bible study.  I have completed it by myself and am goingvto lead a group study of it this Summer.  I know I will refer back to it time and again.  It is very relevant to the times we are living in.  Highly recommend it for both individual and group study
This is the best Bible study book I have read! I love Priscilla Shirer and will be ordering another one of her books! I love that she relates biblical situations back to our lives.
This study is AMAZING.  A daily study to meet once a week with group and discuss. Such wisdom and insight. I highly highly recommend.  Blessings to you.
This is a great study. After completing the study the women in my group voted to restart it.This study opened our eyes to a lot of things not only in Elijah but in our lives as well.
What an awesome Bible Study!!!  Priscilla  really gets to your heart and makes you think. I highly recommend this book by yourself or in a group. Her videos that go with it are great too.
I‚Äôm only a couple weeks into this study but it is rockin my world! I love the structure of the book. There‚Äôs in-depth questions but it isn‚Äôt too much.
Wonderful study on the prophet Elijah. Great insight and understanding on the power and purpose of various seasons and trials in life.
"Mrs Shire is an outstanding, woman of God. I have enjoyed her for many years, books, streaming events and even in person. Can't wait to get into this study!"
Priscilla did an excellent job with this book! It is challenging & thought provoking! A must for Christians that want to have a more intense relationship with God! Everyone can be an Elijah!
Our church Bible study is readying this together.  This book among her others will really make you think about how you feel. And your thinking. How you deal with every day life situation.  A must read book
"Love LOVE her Bible studies. This was was terrific also! If you love this one, you will also love her study on Gideon."
We didn‚Äôt start this study right away but I wanted to be sure to get my book. Once we started the study and got to chapter 5 I found that my book goes from page 176 to page 193.By that time it was too late to return the book. This was a pretty important section of the book. Very disappointing.
Great study book!!!  It will give you such an in-depth look at Elijah and how his story can connect with your life!!!
This was an extremely well-written study.  It is so relevant for the social climate that we are living in!
"Good little study guide. I didn‚Äôt do the audio or video version of the study, but still enjoyed this guide."
I have  loved this Bible study on Elijah. This study has been more in depth than a lot of other studies I have done in the past.  I‚Äôve totally enjoyed it the videos with Priscilla that go alone with the study they are an added bonus
I liked the product but my book was defective.  Of course I did not look ahead for the study and on week six my book went from page 192 back to page 177.  I was missing three lessons in my book.  You should look ahead to make sure your book is complete.
This is the first Study course that I have done with the addition of a CD and the results were very rewarding.Kalee
the book was in depth. I always get my Bible books At Amazon they really deliver them on time. Thanks
This bible study is for the serious disciple! Priscilla tells it like it is! Are you willing to do what Elijah did to get what Elijah got???
"What are you waiting for before you decide to order this book? It is written with you, personally, in mind."
I am loving this study! We are doing this one in group and it has been amazing! Definitely recommend!
This is an incredible study. I love that it has combined the readings and the workbook unlike some where you have to buy both a book and the workbook. The messages are so relatable and her writing style is easy to read. Really enjoying this study and highly recommend.
"Amazing study, so timely. Priscilla uses her God given gifts in such a beautiful way.  I could listen to her teach/preach forever. Her passion for sharing God‚Äôs almighty power and plan for each of us is always inspiring. Love how she calls each of us her sisters throughout the study, she makes it easy to feel a spiritual connection to God‚Äôs word and her as a sister in Christ."
"what can be better than being encouraged to be in THE WORD.  also, to realize Elijah and people we may put on pedestal's in our lives are human just as we are....join a study today!"
"Our ladies group is doing this study... if you love Priscilla Shirer, you will love this study"
Amazing study! I could only buy 4 and I needed 12 so had to purchase at a different site.
What a great study this is. This book combined with the online Bible Study with Pricilla Shirer
So far I love this bible study....
Changes that childhood Bible Story to Focused reality...Awesome way to shift the paradigm from story to Bio!!!
I can't say enough good about this study! I highly recommend it! Very biblically sound. I loved it!
"I bought this book to use in a Bible study I am doing at my church.  It is a wonderful study and very worthwhile.  I highly recommend the book.  It takes you through the story of Elijah and the experience at Mount Carmel.  It goes into detail about his life, and the stages God brought him through and how it applies to our lives even today."
I bought this nook for a bible study on Elijah. However the book is incomplete. It repeats sections and incant do the last week because missing day 2-5.  How could they do this?
I love this book it give me a good insight into the life of Elijah.
The book arrived with damage to the cover as if it were a used copy. Great book...not so great shipping and handling.
Great study book. Gives wonderful insight into the study videos.
A++++ Only on chapter 2 and I can say this is the best study I have ever read! So timely for what season the world is in. Buy it ladies you will be blessed beyond words
We are starting a bible study using this book and it is in perfect condition
This book is for today.  Christians need to read this study!
I so enjoyed this Bible study! Priscilla Shirer just is such a great teacher. Would do it again if have the chance.
Great study guide to dig deeper into the book of Elijah.
"If you love Priscilla Shier, you'll love this study!"
Awesome book with the videos you can rent or buy.
I love Priscilla Shrier and this one is great!
"Not finished yet, but loving the descriptions."
"I loved this Book, we had a Bible study with my church and it was amazing! The first book I read by Priscilla was the armor of God, she always delivers and guides you with passion and with power through the word of God! Pure fire!"
"I'd buy it as a gift , or even buy it again,  it's awesome ! Best one yet. I noticed the journal a little late, maybe next time.  Absolutely 5 stars üåü"
Loving this study! I also got the videos. Super study as always from PS!
One of the best studies I have done!
This Bible study was great and inspiring.  Priscilla does an awesome job and is souplifting.  Highly recommend this.
We‚Äôre using this book along with its paired videos to teach a Friday night Bible Study and it has been an amazing experience!!  I highly recommend this book.
You can never go wrong by ordering any of Priscilla Shirer's Bible studies.
Just the right book for the nible study
Can't wait to get into the lessons with my Bible Study Group!
Arrived and in excellent condition
Great Bible study material
This is a great bible study.
This is the best study I have done in a long time. Priscilla Shirer once again knocks the ball out of the park.
A wonderful study!!!
Not a complete study guide‚Ä¶ must buy or rent videos ‚Ä¶ and or supplement with reading portions of the Bible‚Ä¶ disappointing
Great study book
Awesome series.
This study seems to be better than some at engaging the reader to interact with the cited scriptures and provoke reflection on Biblical events/circumstances as well as daily life application.
Sister has another winner. Her style of teaching keeps you digging deeper.
"I am currently doing this study...I am only going into the second week, but truly love it! I feel God working and feel his presence! Priscilla Shirer words in this book is easy to understand and truly touches my heart! I have obstacles to overcome and I feel like this study was written for me!"
As expected
Excellent
Nothing
"I'm moving right through this study only to discover on Week Six that days two through four are missing!!!  That's a about twenty pages and a lot of days when you're really into a study.  Otherwise the product would be five stars, it's a fantastic study."
Great study
This was written for me!!! Take this journey! Priscilla takes you through life as God sets the course for your tomorrow‚Äôs.  I know through my crazy life God is getting me ready for my ‚ÄúMt Carmel‚Äù. This study gives strength and direction to rely on God and his timing.
Perfect for my Bible study. Easy to read and follow.
Love this study!! I buy these studies and do them by myself in the mornings. I am only halfway through but definitely a lot of great insight. Analogies and metaphors are entertaining and relatable. She makes you feel like a friend!
AMAZING!!! I love this book. Day 1 itself was powerful let alone the rest of the days. Definitely a worthy study!
Truly one of if not the best Bible studies I have ever done. The scripture of Elijah's story broken down to understand God's plan for and with him in a deeper way. Worth it whether you are looking for something now or later.
This is an excellent Bible study. It will change your life. Priscilla Shirer is truly anointed with the Holy Spirit and she is a truly gifted writer.
Such an amazing bible study for this time. I encourage you to buy it and get yourself ready to be confronted and released into this modern world with the gift of Elijah!
I highly recommend this study.  I am half-way through it and it is great! Priscilla is a gifted writer and teacher.
Excellent and in depth
"Arrived on time, in good condition and as expected. Enjoying the Bible study so far."
Great book!
Wonderful Bible study from Priscilla.  She digs deep into the life of Elijah.  I have found all her studies to be great and they always bring out things I would have never seen on my own.
AMAZING!!!!! Opens up the depth to a great biblical character!! Love this
Awesome book
"Bought this book for my hubby , hubby approved üòò"
Very good
Doing an intense study of the prophet with Phyllis Shriner witch is really thought provoking and challenging! I am enjoying it immensely!
This study is excellent just like Priscilla's previous studies. I have never done an in depth study of Elijah and this was/is a wonderful experience.
Great study for many
"Excellent study!!!  Practical, great videos, and learned a lot."
Best study I've ever done!!!  I totally identify with Elijah & my faith has grown immeasurably with this study!!!!
I haven't started reading this as of yet. My church starts a Bible study on Elijah on the 28th. I am looking forward to this study.I would recommend this book.
"We haven't started our Bible study class yet, but I'm sure it will be a awesome lesson."
Love this study!
"Perfect study for these difficult times.  Priscilla Shire leads us through Gods word with grace and encouragement, while challenging our walk."
My book appeared  to be unsticking as soon as I opened  it .

Bible study
Priscilla Shirer is my favorite Author!! Love this book!
I could not recommend this book enough. Priscilla shorter‚Äôs artistry for relaying God‚Äôs word is a master piece. I highly encourage this for a women‚Äôs Bible study group!!!
Started reading this amazing study book! Starting a Womans small group in the fall and we will work on this together!!!!!‚ù§Ô∏èüôå
Studying now
This Bible study is amazing! I would definitely do it again! God knew I needed it and it came at the right time! I would recommend it to my friends!
Another phenomenal study by Priscilla Shirer!
Great study!! Books came quickly.
This is Priscilla Shirer's best study yet! I liked the personal applications.
I absolutely love this book. Great study!
This book challenges you to study and evaluate and doesn't just unload someone else's perspective.
"Excellent, thought provoking, devotional.. I have gifted this book and will gif a few others it‚Äôs so good!!!"
Excellent study book. It is an intense study.
"This is the best devotional! It was hard to put down, to be honest."
Great study book and doing the study alongside the videos. Definitely worth it.
You are never disappointed with Priscilla Shirer! Great study!
This goes down as my most favorite Bible study. I‚Äôve grown so much in my faith walking through this study.
"Marvelous Bible Study. Convicting, Encouraging and motivating."
Love this book
Incredible study that really makes you examine your life!
Impactful to women!
Amazing!!! 10/10 must read!
This was an eye opener for a change in my life.  I would highly recommend.
Just stated the study and it is really awesome! Can‚Äôt  wait to get more into it!
Love This study
Another solid Bible Study!
A bible study that I will keep where I can refer back to it. A real eye opener.
Buy this study book if you truly want to deepen your relationship with God.
Excellent. Timely
Awesome Bible study. Love Priscilla Shirer‚Äôs Bible study.
"Like everything about this product, cleans my floors very well."
"Quick delivery, love the study"
Very in-depth. Excellent study
Powerful and life changing! A must read!
I loved this Bible plan and Priscilla
A class in Bible study
Amazing study!!!
Great!
Great book
"Sadly, I am so disappointed with this study.  Shirer begins the study using an analogy of the beauty of a ballerina's foot in its shoe compared to the bloody and bandaged foot hidden in that shoe.  She uses that analogy to introduce her point: ""Everyone wants the glory, but few are willing to pay the price required to get it.""  And, she contends, that is how we read scripture:  all rosy, all happy, all good.  Perhaps, that is Shirer's experience, but it certainly isn't mine. I feel she is writing to people who have never suffered, and is attempting to prepare others for the suffering to come.  But anyone who has already walked through the fire (or, is walking through it) is quite realistic of the contradictions displayed in the biblical stories.  And the person who has walked through the fire has learned obedience and perseverance.  I dislike when a writer of Bible Studies assumes her/his reader knows nothing.  Another example is she spends a lot of time writing about putting people on pedestals, and proceeds to have a lot of questions about that.  It doesn't even occur to her that a reader does not put people on pedestals.  What about considering that person?  What about a question such as:  If you are not one to put people on pedestals, what do you suppose caused you to be that way?  Have you always been that way?  Or, is it something you learned after becoming a Christ-follower?  Another example:  she asks how does it encourage you to realize Elijah struggled?  Well, it doesn't encourage me at all.  What encourages me is Romans 5:3-5.  Someone's failings does not make me feel better that I'm not the only one to fail.  Absurd!!  Another is her injunction to quit hiding one's humanity.  We show our humanity every time we ask the Brethren to pray for us.  Anyway, all that to say I am very disappointed with such a naive bible study.  Oh, and one final comment:  People, amazon reviews are about the material written, Not missing pages.  You have missing pages? Contact amazon for an exchange."
"I just finished this study with my Bible study group and...WOW, I am blown away. This is a phenomenal Bible study that I have every intention of going through all over again because there is SO much to learn, take in and study. This Bible study has changed me in best way possible and it's exactly what I needed after a year of this pandemic. This was my first time reading anything by Priscilla Shirer, but it definitely won't be my last. She has a very special way of ministering from a point-of-view that is relatable and engaging; I felt like she was speaking directly to ME as a friend and sister. I can't wait to do more of her studies and I cannot recommend this one enough."
Bible has incredible scientific accuracy like about the fillo we ing:1. Round Earth hanging on nothing2. Jet streams3. Man from soil4. The hydrologic cycleMuch more!This book talks of Elijah and asks what we can do to be like him. What we ask him if he were still with us today and see I in!
"SO GOOD! I learned a lot! Was challenged in my personal relationship with God. Appreciated the study of Elijah and God's work and relationship with Elijah.  If you wanna dig deep, you won't be disappointed."
My church's women's ministry did this whole study for small groups. It went through not just the flashy pretty glorified moments of Elijah's life but used the lowly moments and deep reflective text to expose where the intimacy and growth happens leading to our own experiences of God's Glory.
This study is amazingly powerful!  My copy is so marked up. I loved it.
Love Priscilla - she is always captivating and challenging!
I'm enjoying this Bible study. It's added to my knowledge of this subject. And it was well written.
We bought this book to do as a group girls Bible study and it had been completely amazing we are 5 weeks in and I recommend it to everyone!
Helps me grow closer to the Lord. Love all of PS Bible Study
Will be using it in my class
I loved this Bible Study. Absolutely awesome! Would definitely recommend.
"I thought it was just me who was having problems answering the questions in the book but, several women in my group said the same thing.  The questions are hard to understand especially for newer Bible readers. Thankfully  I found a few YouTube videos to help me each week."
"I am so blown away with this study of Elijah. I have learnt so much in depth with the alliance of Elijah. His commitment, his boldness and his fearlessness to deliver God‚Äôs word in 1Kings 18.Priscilla Shirer has written this so beautifully, clear snd precise.I am so glad that I bought the book along with the videos. Thank you, Priscilla Shirer."
I am using this book at the moment for a Bible Study and it is very good also explanatory. Priscilla Shirer did her research thoroughly and I am enjoying every read. Thank you Priscilla Shirer. You are a chosen vessel.
This is Priscilla Shirer‚Äôs newest bible study.  Our ladies group is about half way through it via Zoom and are enjoying it.  We are using the video that goes with it but it could easily be done without it either in a group or alone.  I knew very little about Elijah but I‚Äôm learning how to apply his experiences to my life.  Priscilla explains everything so well.
"Amazing bible study book! I wasn't expecting alot out of it, but let me tell you that it is REALLY strengthening my faith and very convicting questions. Love it!!"
Amazing study!
"John Mark Comer is one of the foremost voices for followers of Jesus in today‚Äôs world. He deftly and expertly unpacks complex post-modern / post-Christian thought and makes it approachable, understandable, and helpful for anyone. But it‚Äôs not enough to just biopsy it and help us understand ‚Äì he continually points us to Jesus and the practices of Jesus, which have the power to change us over a lifetime. He wrecked all of us (in the best and most gentle way) with ‚ÄúThe Ruthless Elimination of Hurry‚Äù, and now he takes all of us on a deep dive about ‚Äúthe three enemies of the soul‚Äù.JMC has given us a gift with this book. His ability to curate, simplify, and synthesize content is astounding. There are over 400 footnotes in this book, and it is not a long, dense read! And yet, his words and thesis are the throughline of it all, and his down-to-earth, approachable style make what could easily be a heady topic one that is easily accessible and applicable to your life today.I so want to regurgitate quotes and insights from my myriad of highlights, but I wouldn‚Äôt be doing JMC‚Äôs beautiful narrative justice. I‚Äôll leave you with two heater quotes though‚Ä¶‚ÄúLies, that come in the form of deceptive ideas, are the devil‚Äôs primary method of enslaving human beings and entire human societies in a vicious cycle of ruin that leads us further and further east of Eden. This is why Jesus came as a rabbi, or teacher. What is a teacher? A truth teller. A moral cartographer. Teachers give us mental maps to reality. In doing so, they set us free to live in congruence with how life actually works. When Jesus said, ‚ÄúYou will know the truth, and the truth will set you free,‚Äù he was simultaneously saying that we‚Äôre enslaved by lies.‚Äù‚Äú‚Ä¶giving in to the desires of our flesh does not lead us to freedom and life, as many people assume, but instead to slavery and, in the worst-case scenario, addiction, which is a kind of prolonged suicide by pleasure.‚ÄùThis is not a book you read quickly and remark, ‚ÄúThat was a great read!‚Äù It is deep content to wrestle with, re-read, and prayerfully apply to your life.Simply put, this is a must-read."
"I recently finished Jackie Hill Perry's Holier Than Thou and was very moved to ask God to expand my view of Him and pursue holiness more intentionally. I was wondering how to walk out pursuing holiness when I saw this book was coming out in September. I signed up for the book launch to get my hands on it sooner. I am thankful. It is a simple read in John Mark Comer's communication style which is very conversational. It is also straight forward look at culture, flesh, sin, and our response to pursing holiness and the battle for attention and souls.Walking this out is not simple, but Comer gives some great practices to weave into daily life as we walk in the Spirit and Resist the Devil. He pulls no punches and gives a great overview of what the world, flesh and Satan are and how we can resist and how we can become accomplices. He gives the reader much to chew on but also doable actions as we put ourselves in spaces to allow the Holy Spirit to work in us.I highly recommend this book. I think it would make a good group study for accountability or discipleship. It is an easy read, but also challenging us to work out our salvation. Comer invites all to a full, abiding life with light and truth.I was given an advanced copy from Waterbrook publishing to review. All opinions are mine. I enjoyed it so much that I ordered more copies already to share."
"The secular world‚Äôs democracies are waking up to the truth that its most dangerous threat is not terrorism, communism or some other external threat. It is lies. In this book, John Mark Comer places the devil as the driving force behind this deception in his ongoing campaign to up the entropy in our cosmos. However alternative facts and misinformation isn‚Äôt the focus for this author‚Äîit is the renovation of the Christian heart that he‚Äôs investigating. What is happening to the Christian heart? What lies haves crept into our understanding of what it means to follow Jesus? How do those insidious Screwtape victories leverage the natures of our flesh? And how, through generations of subtle twists in our Christian culture, do these lies have the potential to wreak more havoc on the human soul than the easily recognised lies of the world ever could?It should be no surprise that John Mark Comer draws on the tradition of the church, and giants like C. S. Lewis and Dallas Willard, to inform his thesis. It‚Äôs also no surprise that‚Äôs he‚Äôs able to make these ideas accessible to a modern reader. Finally‚Äîif one has read anything from Comer recently‚Äîone would know that Spiritual Disciplines (or, as he prefers: practices) are on offer as a salve.What was surprising to this reader was the insight into the underlying theology of the author, which paints a world-view and understanding that finally brings the likes of ‚Äúhuman nature‚Äù, ‚Äúthe devil‚Äù, ‚Äúgood and evil‚Äù, ‚Äúsin‚Äù and ‚Äúthe kingdom of heaven‚Äù together in a way which doesn‚Äôt require hand-waving or conveniently ignoring parts of Scripture.‚Ä®This is a remarkable piece of work from John Mark Comer that revives the gospel and confronts the reader with a striking question: am I living the gospel, or a lie?"
"So many great challenges to those who want to make a difference in this world. Comer quotes many authors, which made me keep a list of new books to read! Writing from his world view in Portland, Comer is able to exhort the reader to rethink what and why they believe. He includes so many references and has action steps to take. You cannot read this one without it challenging your thinking on social issues, politics, heaven, religion, and so much more. Full of scripture and a reminder to me of what I had forgotten or chosen not to live on from Scripture. This is such a perfect book for NOW! This is a keeper and will be a classic for showing how this generation of believers changed the political and social landscape today and influenced the masses for Christ!"
"Written in an approachable style, this book shows off John Mark‚Äôs skillful ability to distill the best information on a given topic down into accessible concepts. It flowed beautifully between dissecting the problem and offering biblical hope in the form of practical actions that are essential to following Jesus in this day and age. During the thoughtful and thorough critique of the problems (the three enemies), he doesn‚Äôt leave you there, thank goodness. ;) He follows up with everyday tools to combat each enemy in your life (there‚Äôs even a worksheet in the back based on a book by a fourth century monk ‚Äì love it!). Be ready for some philosophy, psychology, and of course, solid, biblical theology. It‚Äôs challenging, convicting, and somehow, leaves you encouraged and definitely empowered. As a fellow Portlander, I‚Äôve unfortunately seen too many family members and friends start to ‚Äòlive lies‚Äô and eventually fall away from the way of Jesus altogether. That is why this book feels so very important and deeply needed for believers in our time. Wherever you‚Äôre at, it‚Äôs one that will stay with you, and you‚Äôll return to again as you put to practice the practices."
"Part 1 Devil: provides absolute no realLife examples on what demons look like today. For example ouija boards r currently being sold in toy section marketed towards our children, also tricking them into witchcraft sorcery through entertainment like Harry potter, spells and sorcery, gives illusion of sovereignty w no need to seek God. Devil also enters our minds whispering lies of fortune/misfortune told through (it‚Äôs just for fun) tarot, etc ‚Ä¶ instead section covers;story of Adam/Eve/snake, devil is real, enters our mind through our ideas, and via social media. Devil‚Äôs purpose: pull you away from God. To prevent this, pray. (Does this guy even know what witchcraft is?)Part 2 Flesh: Overly repetitive, Provides 2-3 examples on an already made point. Use of space fillers is literally same as making me listen to a story w no point or purpose, but to waste time.By providing examples/def of Flesh repeated/extensively covered through span of 3 chapters. states nothing more than that we‚Äôre not animals, have the choice/option to choose, have discipline, walk like Jesus, to do so, pray. (Thanx for the tip)Part 3 world: Again fails to provide real life examples of devil in our everyday life. could have so easily mentioned of so many demonic practices pushed by today‚Äôs Hollywood pop culture, advocating for vulgar music such as #wap, how Beyonc√©‚Äôs ‚Äúalter ego‚Äù Sasha fierce is of the devil taking over the body, what about MK ULTRA, MIND CONTROL, literally so many different ways, sadly the example he chose to use wasCD burning, how piracy has become a norm, which ultimately gives thought of theft as also being normal. (Who burns CD these days?!)author more concerned of how readers may perceive wrong idea/viewpoint than actual teaching. (Don‚Äôt get the idea of, don‚Äôt think I am etc ‚Ä¶)Author more concerned w ‚Äúflexing‚Äù philosophy education than teachingAuthor more concerned on his perception/appearance/performance than teaching. section 1 has high usage of uncommonly used words, which quickly dwindles down to zero soon after.Author more concerned on ‚Äúplaying safe‚Äù appeasing to the ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù in message. no conviction, power, persuasion in teaching. Very blah, step below ‚ÄúLuke warm‚Äù  at best. What a waste of time and energy"
"John Mark Comer‚Äôs latest book is a return to the coffee table where Comer simply speaks to you. For better or for worse, his writing comes off as an honest and raw conversation. (A style that I‚Äôve grown to love.)This book focuses on the three enemies that ever believed must battle against. The devil, the flesh, and the world. I particularly appreciate Comer‚Äôs unpacking of Paul‚Äôs ‚Äúthe flesh‚Äù and what it means to fight against it.Overall, this book was insightful. For anyone who‚Äôs followed along with Comer‚Äôs podcast, This Cultural Moment, you‚Äôll recognize several themes that appear in the book."
"I‚Äôm a huge fan of JMC‚Äôs writings and thoroughly enjoy each and every work he puts out. The thought looming in my mind as I‚Äôm reading each book as it releases is ‚Äúthere will never be a better JMC book than this,‚Äù yet each time, alas, I‚Äôm proven wrong.His resilient literacy, his diligent word-choice, his relatable writing style, his friendly conversational tone, his seasoned vocabulary, his determination for truth, his unrelenting passion to teach the way, all coalesce in this book.Insightful, entertaining, helpful, enchanting, hope-filling, gospel-oriented, grace-based, riveting, helpful, are all words that come to mind when reading this book.An instant classic and must have for any serious thinker, religious or non alike. Brilliant masterpiece. Well done friend."
"John Mark Comer has his finger on the pulse of our culture more than any thought leader I know of today, and he's written a beautiful book on resisting the pull of the three ""enemies of our soul."" He deftly outlines the dilemma - we live in a culture where people believe truth is relative and our own internal narratives are often louder than any other voices. He points out the common lies we should be wary of and instructs on how we as followers of Jesus can actually live in the world but not be of the world. A phenomenal teacher and clear communicator, he deftly instructs his audience on how to identify the lies we believe and formulate a strategic plan to overcome these lies with truth. Some books you read and then shelf. This one I know I'll be coming back to."
"The book was pre-ordered because I found Comer‚Äôs sermons relevant, insightful, and powerful. My enthusiasm with the preacher bled over to excitement about his book Live No Lies. The title is appropriate to the book‚Äôs contents.Subjectively speaking, however, the writing style left me disappointed. Instead of reading a book, I felt as if I were reading a sermon manuscript that needed to be preached in a series entitled Live No Lies. The author is a better preacher than writer in my opinion.One gets lost in poor editing, writing format, and the endless quotes almost suggesting an implicit message of ‚Äúlook how much I‚Äôve read.‚ÄùComer‚Äôs thesis is on target. I only wished for a more seasoned delivery that didn‚Äôt get in the way of the message."
"This book is kindly incisive. It‚Äôs punchy, engaging, deep and cuts to the heart of things. There‚Äôs so much history, theology, and research behind this framework, but it‚Äôs easy to understand, and practical to the core. I haven‚Äôt been more personally convicted, while simultaneously given practical tools to grow through a book in a long time."
"Live No Lies was an engaging and challenging read. John Mark caught my attention in the early part of the book with the story of Evagrius and his manual to combat the devil. In addition, the framing of the book was helpful as he laid out his practical argument for how to overcome the lies that come our way. Speaking to the practicality of it, I enjoyed how he pushed us, the reader, toward a rule of life and the monastic handbook in order to put it into practice. We need next steps to make this a part of our lives, especially because combatting the devil, the flesh, and the world seems abstract.I recommend this book to anyone looking for a guidebook for waging spiritual war where the enemy is taken seriously, but not anxiously. It's for those who are looking for help in this disinformation age and are looking for taking as much responsibility for themselves to they can live whole."
"Simply put, this book must be a new staple for anyone seeking to follow Jesus in today‚Äôs cultural climate. In our modern day full of conflicting messages and constant (mis)information, this book arrives on the bookshelf with a surprisingly timely, strong, yet gentle message. JMC seamlessly blends biblical truths, cultural analysis, and humor into one concrete guide to enrich and strengthen your spiritual journey. In Live No Lies, you will encounter resonant wisdom, deeply sorrowful realities of our day, compelling points of great hope, and a profound strengthening of your apprenticeship to Jesus. Never before have I read an author integrate such all-encompassing ideas and concepts into language that is easy to follow and, honestly, fun to engage with. At the end of it all, JMC draws us gently back to the life, example, and teaching of Jesus. Thank you, John Mark, for always keeping Jesus in the center, even when you could easily steal the glory with your work."
"In his book, Live No Lies, John Mark Comer has offered readers a glimpse behind the curtain to see some of the major driving influences on the lives we live. But, he doesn‚Äôt stop there. Instead of simply identifying the problem or the challenges we face, he offers time-tested and battle-proven steps to overcome them. He points out that when we accept lies we subscribe to an ‚Äúunreality‚Äù that appeals to disordered desires which leads to a broken and fallen life. And then he offers practices that we can adopt and implement to find ourselves more grounded in reality, with healthy and ordered desires, to bring greater wholeness to our lives and the world we live in.I definitely recommend this book. It is an easy and enjoyable read that will provoke you to look deeper into the way you see and engage in the world."
"‚ÄúLive No Lies‚Äù helps navigate what it means to practice the Way of Jesus in this postmodern, post-Christian age. The cacophony of ideas (many of them deceptive ideas) that have emerged in an undeniable way over the last five years have left us on edge, upended, and exhausted. Not only does John Mark Comer chart how we got here, going back to the beginning of time, but also he gives a map for how to get through. Each of the enemies of the soul has a weapon (or two) to counter it, a spiritual practice that reclaims and reshapes us in our inner being.This book is a deep read, not an easy skim. Each word, each idea means something. There is no throw-away content here. Take your time and read it slowly. When he says he‚Äôs doing a deep dive into philosophy but he knows you have it in you to stay with him, stay with him. It‚Äôs foundational. You‚Äôre not just learning what has been going on, you‚Äôre filtering your personal experience through the insights he presents.Also read it with friends if you can. I set out on this journey with a couple of great thinkers who are also spiritually sensitive. Sharing the experience has meant everything. I am fully confident that the truths and practices in this book have power to change individuals, communities, and the church as a whole. They are transformational.Finally, this book is the first since grad school that I‚Äôve read and annotated the Notes. I didn‚Äôt want to interrupt the flow of content, so I largely ignored them during the initial read, but, wow, they are an amazing resource in their own right. I‚Äôve got supplemental material to read for months (years?!) alongside the library of Scripture."
"Run to buy this book! This is a much needed read for this time and age, where lies are running amok in our society and minds. Comer writes as a pastor, a brother in Christ, who has done extensive homework in these areas, and has distilled it for all to understand. He thoroughly lays out the enemies that sabotage our peace - the world, the flesh, the devil. I had so many moments in reading this book where major gaps in my understanding were filled, and deep encouragement in how to fight the good fight."
"I have read all of John Mark's books and have been deeply shaped by all of them. This book is something different. A great temptation of today is that we have to be loud and attacking to get our point across. But John Mark shows us otherwise with a tone that is full of love and humility. Even if you disagree with some of the points in this book, you are compelled to continue to read and understand deeper. This will book will continue to resonate and challenge me to walk forward in my walk with Jesus in asking the question, ""what lies am I believing about myself""?Thank you for sharing your gift with the world, John Mark."
"We‚Äôve been lied to. For decades now, deceitful ideas have played into our disordered desires, which have normalized values once thought unimaginable. As a result, the world has drastically changed, and we wonder how it happened so quickly. John Mark Comer addresses this phenomenon head-on in his latest book, Live No Lies. First, he lays out conceptual stepping stones that assist the reader in making sense of this complex shift step-by-step. Then, with clarity & grace, he offers a Northstar to help us navigate the world we live in today. I got my copy of Live No Lies on Amazon Prime with FREE delivery."
"The good:1.  Accessible writing on a difficult subject that is a joy to read.2. The ability to draw from so many resources - theology, psychology, spiritual formation, philosophy.3. The profound insight into our cultural moment that is treated with care and nuance.The Bad.1. Not enough footnotes. ( just kidding) There are almost 50 pages worth which is a treat.Overall, just a fantastic book. John Mark has become my favorite Christian writer alongside Tim Keller."
"John Mark Comer has such a clear way of communicating difficult topics, and this book is no exception. While it is a heavier book that pushes you to truly confront the lies you may believe, in an effort to help you become more like Jesus.This book speaks absolute truth, even when uncomfortable, but you as the reader will come out a stronger believer if you take these words too heart."
"Anything JMC writes is literature gold. It always reads like a conversation between you and him over a cup of coffee, very unique. What JMC does really well is explain the why behind the what. More than just practical steps on how to recognize and resist the 3 lies, he explains in a historical and then in a modern sense what those 3 lies are. Where they came from. And what to do next. This book equips you perfectly to live out your healthiest most wholesome life spiritually."
"I cannot recommend this book enough. John Mark Comer‚Äôs critiques are never void of love. Something I deeply admire in his pastoral work and writing.In the opposite fashion of his book ‚ÄúGarden City‚Äù, ‚ÄúLive No Lies‚Äù takes our cultural advancements in the west and lovingly critiques the West‚Äôs involvement with the world, the flesh and the devil. A not so hot topic inside and outside the western church today. If you enjoy reading books on cultural ideologies and societal commentaries, this book is so beneficial for your spiritual formation and your growth in knowledge. Another thing that John Mark Comer does extremely well.Have your soul nourished by the truth of God while you honestly observe the world, it‚Äôs a whole lot more fun that way."
I‚Äôve read most if not all of John Mark Comer‚Äôs books but this may be my favorite yet. I love the way that he can illustrate the past with the present. Analyzing culture and making abstract observations more tangible. I couldn‚Äôt put this book down! It was like reading through the last year‚Äôs news highlights from a religious point of view rather than a world view. Making sense of all the unsencable things happening in our world. I LOVE this book and would highly recommend it!
"Thankful for John Mark's consistent and humble voice over the years, and this book is some of his best work yet. A must read for any follower of Jesus in our current cultural moment."
"This book covers so many intense topics, it‚Äôs hard to begin to summarize. But the two chapters that really got me were ‚ÄúThe Law of Returns‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Brutal Honesty About Normal.‚Äù Super good read though, and has me thinking a bunch."
"I am not an avid reader, but John Mark Comer is such a good communicator that after reading ‚ÄúThe ruthless elimination of hurry‚Äù, I knew that this book would speak to me as well. Correct! The Holy Scriptures have a lot to say about living out best life and JM has done a wonderful job of displaying the theme of living into the actual truth of life. Thanks brother John and keep up the great work. I will be gifting this and your other books to many many friends."
"This book comes off as easy to read and simple to put into practice but touches at a deeply profound area of our daily lives. In our secular culture, it‚Äôs so easy to not pay much attention to the reality of spiritual warfare and the devil ‚Äî but it‚Äôs enemy underneath most of our trouble. This book is a helpful survey of who those enemies really are, what their strategies look like and how to best fight against them as you follow the good life of Jesus. Read this and meditate on its implications!!!"
"Concepts about the world, the flesh, and the devil have been thrown at me for a while now. But this was an epiphany for me. Understanding how these lies affect me and how I can combat them is already improving my life."
"Ever since purchasing this book 2 weeks ago, I have probably referenced it every day. I have so enjoyed this language to put behind what‚Äôs going on in my head, my spirit, and my world. It‚Äôs so helpful. I love how conversational his writing is and I think this book is a beautiful challenge for all Christians and non Christian in today‚Äôs world. Me and my wife are making a monastic handbook for combating demons together! LOVE THIS BOOK. Buy it NOW!"
"I‚Äôm not sure that I‚Äôve read a book that is more timely to the culture we are currently living in than this. JMC does an incredible job both describing the current cultural climate and offering sound, theological groundwork with which to break loose of the lies abounding in it. This was a very easy read, each chapter had me highlighting material and he gave great summaries following each section of the book. I can‚Äôt recommend this book enough!"
I‚Äôve been reading his books for years and am beyond thankful! He‚Äôs incredibly gifted at writing. I want more to write like him. I understand everything he‚Äôs saying and can hear him reading it. The same way he does his teachings is the same way he writes.. genius! Writing biblical truth down in ways that just make sense is soooo needed!
"This book was amazing. Rife with Scripture and TONS of resources, Comer gives you practical ways to combat these 3 enemies. Ways that he was able to extract from Scripture that I knew in my head but have always had trouble articulating, much less, been able to write them out as instructions as simple as ‚Äúdo this, this, and this to refute the lies.‚Äù I am so grateful for this book and for the truths found within it!"
I don't take time to write reviews so when I do it's for books that make my unofficial top 5 book list. This is a super important and relavant book for our current moment in culture and the church. Required reading for anyone serious about growing in their walk with Jesus.
An incredible read for a modern day disciple of Jesus. Navigating these in-depth practices and realizing I do t have to life a life of burnout and breakdown. I can follow some of these modern day monastic disciplines and experience some of the ‚Äúgood life‚Äù John Mark alludes to. I‚Äôd your faith has been shaken and your peace undermined‚Ä¶consider this book: I‚Äôm re-reading after I finish: it‚Äôs so good. Well done John Mark and team!
"JMC does it again with perhaps his best work yet. For anyone seeking the truth of Jesus Christ and how to live by faith in today‚Äôs culture of chaos and deconstructionism, this is a must read. His rare combination of lacing biblical knowledge, spirit and truth is evidenced in every word included in this work. I have read it and will read it again. Well done, JMC."
"John Mark does a wonderful job of bringing the long historic thoughts surrounding the world the flesh and the devil into a completely relatable, completely understandable new light. This is such a useful follow up to his previous book diving into what it really means to live in this spiritually charged world we inhabit.Could not recommend enough."
"This book is so full of truth and equips the Christian to truly die to self and live for Jesus, to combat the 3 enemies of the soul (the devil, the flesh, the world) and is a refreshingly convicting dose of reality and truth that we so need to see our existence and purpose through."
"Without a doubt, this is THE book for our cultural moment. John Mark Comer writes with intentionality, clarity, and conviction, which translates powerfully to the reader. Live No Lies will open your eyes to the spiritual battle we are engaged in, encourage you to draw nearer to Jesus, and empower you to be who God created you to be and to live the life He designed for you to live!"
"This book is one of my favorites I‚Äôve ever read. It so clearly breaks down culture today and helps cut through the fog of not knowing which was is up and which way is down. I‚Äôm a pastor in South Florida and I will highly recommend this book to our whole church. I‚Äôll likely take our staff through it, and we‚Äôll probably do a whole series inspired by much of the content."
"It‚Äôs a deep read. This is not a fluff filled book. It‚Äôs such a necessary read for those of the Christian faith. As always, John Mark Comer brings truth in a relatable way while spicing it up with his wittiness. Highly recommend!"
This book is relevant and a must read for our day and time. Highly recommend!
Very thankful for JMC and the effort he has put into this work. He does the heavy lifting for your spiritual benefit. Live No Lies is a great read for someone new to faith or mature in their walk with Jesus. It will equip you with knowledge and practices to flourish in this age. Get it.
John Mark is one of my favorite authors and pastors. He has a way of taking dense spiritual formation language and translating it for the every day follower of Jesus. Live No Lies tackles some tough topics and John Mark does an amazing job in rooting whatever he is arguing for in the way of Jesus.
"This book has been so formative for my spiritual faith. In today‚Äôs sociopolitical climate, it‚Äôs refreshing to hear someone speak so clearly from the perspective of a follower of Christ, and to be so direct yet loving about it. This book is needed in this generation and should be talked about more!"
"JMC does it again. Takes immensely meaningful biblical knowledge, wisdom and practical insights and boils it down into captivating modern reading. INCREDIBLE READ!"
"A definite recommendation to those who enjoy this author. Similar care with research and tone. John Mark at his best in revealing outright lies, and channels his inner Lewis by presenting literature so that truth may win."
"JMC writes clearly and compellingly about the three enemies of our soul: the devil, the flesh and the world. Must read!"
This books is the best non-fiction I‚Äôve read all year. Incredible work from JMC.
"John Mark Comer speaks the truth in love. I enjoy his witty writing style. I recommend this, and all of his books on spiritual practices and formation. Well done!"
A book that everyone must read as we navigate today‚Äôs world. Such a timely message! So well written!
John mark is in my opinion the most important author out right now. He‚Äôs so thoughtful and challenging. You will not be disappointed but rather inspired to live differently!
Ancient truths with a fresh perspective. JMC hits it out of the park again.
The design of this book is nice. Almost too nice. The design is suspiciously nice.
Thank you for writing this. Thank you for honesty and truth.
John Mark‚Äôs work here is so important for our current Christian climate.
Life transforming and thought provoking work.
"Wow, what an amazing book.  The message is timeless.  How profound, accessible & prophetic Live No Lies was constantly reminded of these attributes in C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity.  There are so many followers of Jesus that like children of divorced parents uncomfortably stuck in the middle of Unsympathetic Fundamentalism & Progressive Relativism.  Neither feels like home because we desire to love God, cling to the truth of His word AND love our neighbor pledging our allegiance to the Kingdom of Jesus instead of political parties.  Interestingly, Jesus befriended and loved the Zealot and Tax Collector alike while challenging their cultural ideologies to invite them into the reality of His Kingdom instead.  John Mark Comer guides the reader through this tightrope of grace & truth in a balance I've never experienced before (and I'm a major nerd who has read literally hundreds of books about theology, culture, the Church & the Christian life).  I bought the audiobook on audible and the listening experience was incredible.  The author, John Mark Comer personally narrates the entire book, giving it a fireside chat-like experience.  I personally always love it when the actual author narrates their audiobook.  Additionally, Comer is a master communicator who is both interesting and easy to listen to.  I got through the book in just 2 days because I couldn't stop listening.  So if you are looking for a book about following Jesus in the 21st Century, look no further.  You've stumbled on a true treasure..."
"John Mark Comer does what few Christian leaders have been able to do during this tumultuous year and a half of Covid-19 and U.S. politics* - he's managed to point us back to The Way of Jesus when so many have lost the way - outside the church but, alarmingly, within. He reminds us to look to our Savior and his example when the voices get loud and angsty. JMC reminds us that we are in a battle against the principalities of this world and we must resist the temptation of our flesh but the patterns this world offers up as benign habits and indulgences.I wish I could put a copy in every Christ follower's hand as it is sobering yet needed encouragement and correction for this age.*My one caveat is that he seems to make a few comments that, I would argue, is unfair to ""liberals"" and I was a bit disappointed in this because I have always respected JMC for being apolitical/politically homeless at least to the public. These comments, and others, seem to tip his hat toward agreement with conservatives and that is troubling considering the moral and ethical hypocrisy that side of the aisle has revealed."
"I really enjoyed John Mark Comer‚Äôs newest book, Live No Lies! He writes with wisdom and insight in a relatable, down-to-earth way. The way he broke down and expounded on the common Christian phrase ‚Äúthe world, the flesh, and the devil‚Äù opened my eyes to the insidious spiritual warfare we face daily. He addressed issues and topics we face in our culture and political landscape without leaning more towards one political party; I thought he did a great job sticking to Biblical truth.One of my favorite parts was the summary at the end of each section with definitions, key Scriptures, key points, and a summary of the book as a whole so far. It helps collect your thoughts and have a quick reference point to go back to. The message of this book is one I believe the church desperately needs to hear today. It‚Äôs cultural commentary, impactful theology, and practical advice. I highly recommend this book!I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own."
"Do you believe there is a spiritual battle?  John Mark Comer does and he clearly identifies our enemy as Satan. He balances biblical theology with current events and trends and speaks truth into our contemporary and confused culture.  He is an astute observer of people and trends and a brilliant voice for today.  Live No Lies tackles the deceptive ideas that surround us and the way these mingle with our desires that have become normal in our society.  JMC uses the biblical lens of the world, the flesh, and the devil to demolish the faulty ideas we embrace and live.  He calls out the elephant in the room and then he offers hope to identify, to fight, and to defeat these deceptions.  I expect this book will turn out to be the best book I read in 2021.I was provided with a digital copy of the book for my honest review."
"This may be the most important, perceptive and hopeful book I have read this year! Mark Comer is an engaging, intelligent writer and his take on Spiritual Warfare is brilliant and timely. Even a casual observer can sense that our world is increasingly divided and sick and John Mark provides a compelling diagnosis and compassionate prescription. In this book, Comer unpacks what is known to followers of Jesus as the three enemies of the soul: the devil, the flesh, and the world. In doing this, Comer calls in conversation partners from Scripture, the early church, the reformation and our own time. Rather than wringing his hands and lamenting, the author directs the reader to spiritual formation in a way that encourages and inspires. If you are a Christ-follower, read this book and give copies to your family and friends!"
"Live No Lies: Recognize and Resist the Three Enemies That Sabotage Your Peace by John Mark ComerI absolutely loved this book. This will definitely be a book I reread many times. The main point of this book is living as exiles in modern day ""Babylon,"" aka, the world, our cultures, and our flesh.John Mark explains that lies we believe and their pull come from 3 places; the world, the flesh, and the devil.He starts off with the devil, where lies and evil all came from. He explains the method the ""Father of Lies"" uses to trap us and how he has used this same method on every human, including Jesus, since the Beginning. He explains why Jesus came as a teacher.Next he moves to our flesh: ""our base, primal, animalistic drives for self-gratification."" He gives the key to overcoming our flesh and gives a direct correlation between fasting from food and resisting temptation.The third and final enemy is the world, not the people of the world, but ""a system of ideas, values, morals, practices, and social norms that are integrated into the mainstream and institutionalized in a culture corrupted by the twin sins of rebellion against God and the redefinition of good and evil."" In this section, we see the way culture ""colonizes"" us and the church into thinking what is good is bad and what is bad is good.This book covers a lot of heavy topics, but it's done in a gentle way.  It's deep and well researched, with many outside resources referenced (Christain and secular) and Scripture quoted. (One chapter has 53 resources in the notes section.)Every human needs to read this book because every human believes lies and has to fight the world, flesh and the devil every moment of every day. This book gives some practical help and suggestions to guide you from living and believing lies to being free in Christ. He gives us guidance in how to change our thoughts from lies to truth.There are many things in this book that I learned about that was never taught in church or Bible school, like why fasting from food is so important and why Jesus, other than being God and sinless, was able to resist the temptation of the devil after he fasted for 40 days.You can pre-order Live No Lies from anywhere you buy books. It releases on September 28, 2021.*As part of the launch team, I received my copy early to read and review.*"
"John Mark Comer does a brillant job of analysing the culture we find ourselves in, both in the church and outside it.  His perspective is disarming and at the same time empowering, giving the reader the ability to see what the problem is and also how he or she might be a part of it‚Ä¶.all the while pointing the compass north to a more orthodox understanding of Christianity, which we so desperately need.This isn‚Äôt just a great read, it‚Äôs a book I‚Äôll re-read again and again.John Mark‚Äôs personal discipline of reading widely and deeply is beginning to bear fruit in spectacular ways. You can often tell if an author has done ‚Äòresearch for the book‚Äô or, instead, reads so widely and deeply that he or she understands a subject at a much more profound level than can be conveyed in a single book. John Mark is clearly in the latter category. As a result, this book, John Mark‚Äôs wisdom and his voice is a gift to us all.Disclosure: I read an advance copy of Live No Lies from the publisher and have since purchased my own copy."
"It‚Äôs crazy that‚Äôs it‚Äôs gone this fast, but almost 2 years ago on a family vacation, a light turned on for me. I picked up a book that my wife had just read called ‚ÄúThe Ruthless Elimination of Hurry‚Äù.  The content of that book could have done two things. Allow me to get defensive of my lifestyle and values, or open me up to change and evaluating what‚Äôs truly important to our family..Thankfully and prayerfully, it was the latter. Evaluating our lives in Christ and what‚Äôs important not only to us but to God as towhat we do with the time we have. It lit a fire. A fire to change. I think I‚Äôve always known who I am, but certainly not to the depth I‚Äôve come to appreciate now. Life isn‚Äôt perfect and neither are the all decisions we make. But I know now exactly who I am in Christ and that the practice of being closer to Jesus is just that. Practice. It won‚Äôt be perfect. But you certainly can train with the help of the Spirit to be more aware of God‚Äôs love and the nudges you get to love better, serve and feel more intimately close to those around you. To be more grateful..@johnmarkcomer has come out with a new book. Live No Lies. I have been fortunate to be on the early book launch team for this project. Just like The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry, this book has so much food for thought. It discusses and gives you practices on how to notice how the devil lies to us about who we are. How the desires of our flesh play a role in cementing those lies. And how the world around us backs those desires up and tell us they are not only normal, but encouraged. This book is a modern explanation of Spiritual Warfare and how to be counter anti culture to the world under the lens of Jesus..It is a book not only helpful for our time, but necessary. If you are a Jesus follower or in any way curious about knowing who you are in Christ, this book is for you. And I appreciate John Mark‚Äôs heart for sharing it with us. May it help me to press against the lies the devil puts in my head, and lean more into the identity I have in Jesus."
"For anyone seeking true freedom and growth in Christ, this is a must-read. Eye-opening, funny, insightful, challenging are just a few adjectives that come to mind, with many, many more I could use. John Mark writes from a place of real-ness, and from truth, explaining context as well as highlighting neuroscience and current psychology. His style is also easy to read. I don't like those books where I feel I like have to really slog through it, and then feel like I can barely understand it. This is not one of those books. There is definitely much to think over, so I wouldn't say it's a quick read, but I would say it will change your life and is worth the time to read, and then put into practice what you have read. And this book IS super practical. Outlines very specific things you can do to move forward in your faith, and why you should do them."
"Uncompromising but gentle, John mark comer has given us a gift that is no doubt from the Holy Spirit. I know this because everything is backed up with scripture, and he even touches on hot button issues in a way that disarms the reader no matter what you believe. a lot of people tip toe around topics like sexuality and marriage.. but John mark tells no lies and does not shy away from the actual truth. Which means telling it all as it really is.The three driving forces behind the fall of man that he explains in this book - the flesh, the devil and the world - are not complicated topics. We MAKE them complicated or more commonly ignore them completely and John mark brings the focus back to the simple truth of the good news. Jesus is the way, the truth and the life. It‚Äôs really that simple.So many things as a child I did not understand and I feel now like the missing pieces are connected. I grew up with questions like ‚Äúhow do I know if I‚Äôm saved?!‚Äù ‚ÄúHow do I know Jesus really is in my heart??‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy would god send good people to hell?!‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy does god let evil things happen!?‚Äù I wish I could hug my inner child and tell her now, ‚Äúyou have it backwards. it‚Äôs not God that allows it. We do. We let evil in by trusting lies instead of the truth of gods word‚ÄùHe really walks it out plainly for those of us who never really understood what it means to follow Jesus yet grew up hearing that you need to. I grew up ‚Äúbelieving‚Äù but not truly understanding.One thing I really appreciate is the gentleness in which John mark tackles these topics. I‚Äôm not left feeling like I‚Äôm this terrible person (which would invoke some defensiveness) instead I feel.. deceived, like we all are in desperate need of a savior. And instead of stopping there he points the reader towards Hope in Jesus by confronting the problem head on: which lie convinced us that we know better than God? What lies do we believe today? Are we living those lies or living the truth from the one who created everything?"
"This stunning and intelligent book will strengthen and encourage you while explaining what is happening in this unique cultural moment. These are easily some of the most impactful and important words I've read this year. A thorough examination of truth, lies, ideas, spiritual formation, freedom, love, The Spirit, power, culture, and the world. I cannot recommend this book highly enough, a *must read* for every follower of Jesus and anyone wondering where this current cultural tide takes us. You'll want to buy it so you can underline, highlight, and refer back to often. Well done and thank you, John Mark Comer."
"In Live No Lies, John Mark offers a much needed roadmap for spiritual formation amidst our cultural moment of political religiosity, division, and spiritual syncretism. In a time when it‚Äôs easy to feel hopeless regarding the alarming rate at which young people are abandoning their faith and suffering abuse at the hands of the church and ‚ÄúChristians,‚Äù John Mark offers a hopeful text for those who long to follow the way of Jesus when it seems to be less popular to do so.  His insight on the three enemies of the soul is profound, robust, convicting, and so so timely."
"This may be one of the most important books you could read this year! In a world that villainizes people, Comer identifies the devil, the flesh, and the world as the real enemies that sabotage peace. The book is tirelessly researched, yet Comer never loses his own voice, which rings like a chat with a wise old friend. In Live No Lies, Comer walks you through his points, clear, and practical, but never loses a sense of hope. Definitely worth your time and attention!"
This book has ignited a passion for Christ and living out His truth like never before. Identifying who the real enemy is and how to fight that enemy is something I believe we all need now more than ever and John Mark Comer is providing us with what we need to do those things. Stop what you are doing and go get the book now!
1. the devil2. the flesh3. the worldTakes potshots at liberals.Reasonably well written.
JMC convicts me every dang time.I love how he exegetes both the Biblical world and our world with such depth and breadth!This book has helped me understand myself and our culture in a new light by being awakened to the spiritual realities around me and how they practically play out. Grateful to follow JMC on the path of following Jesus!
"John Mark Comer brilliantly communicates what Christians historically have been teaching for centuries when it comes to resisting the enemy in the areas of the devil, the flesh, and the world. Comer helps the reader to see how these three things are present in today's cultural moment and how the way of Jesus is better.I can't recommend this book enough."
"This is a book for our time. Incredibly insightful for where we are now in terms of post Christian culture in America, but doesn't leave you in despair. The book is full of hope and sound truths from the Bible.It practically equips the reader to go out into the world loving Jesus with heart mind and soul."
Very needed in our day as we are bombarded with a variety of lies
"John Mark Comer‚Äôs best work. The content is complex and consequential, but his writing style is approachable and inviting. You may be tempted to read it quickly. Resist the urge. Sit in and with these words and treat yourself to thought, contemplation, and real consideration. JMC, bravo."
"John Mark does an amazing job of articulating what it looks like to be formed in an increasingly post-Christian society. Comer ties ancient Biblical tradition with the power of the Spirit to equip present day followers of Jesus with practical tools to combat the things unseen. For any serious Christian in today's world, this is a MUST read!"
"I already knew this book would be 5 star content, but font choice gives all the more reason. Convicting truth and quality aesthetics? Double whammy."
All of his books are great but this might be his best yet. One of the best and most timely books of the last 10 years. Comer deals with a difficult topic in a way only he can. Will be buying this and recommending this book to lots of people!
Anything John Mark puts out is gold. This book will show you how to separate the truth from the lies. I highly recommend this book.
"Can‚Äôt recommend this book enough. The work John Mark has put into this book, his other books, his church, practicing the way, and the Global church is remarkable."
John Mark does it again! A must read for our generation!
Can‚Äôt recommend this book enough!
Easily the best book I‚Äôve read this year
"I love the way John Mark Comer writes. He writes intelligently, yet he explains things so well. I couldn‚Äôt put this book down! It really helps highlight the lies that we too easily believe, that drag us down and potentially stop us from living the life God has for us. If you have read The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry, you will love this. Read it for yourself - you won‚Äôt be disappointed."
"Having read and loved all of John Marks‚Äôs previous books especially, Garden City, God has a name and The ruthless elimination of hurry I was eagerly anticipating this new book. When I heard the title I wasn‚Äôt quite sure what to expect but a book on Spiritual Warfare I certainly did not expect.I think this book and the conversation it creates is so timely and a necessary reminder that to follow Jesus is a path of overcoming the world, the flesh and the devil so that we find the life that is truly life. The life Jesus promised in John 10:10. I thoroughly recommend this book."
"This book is so timely and JMC offers a beautiful counter-narrative to the polarization in America that cuts to the heart of who Christ called us to be and how he has called us to live. Thank you, John Mark."
"It‚Äôs crazy that‚Äôs it‚Äôs gone this fast, but almost 2 years ago on a family vacation in Cuba, a light turned on for me. I picked up a book that my wife had just read called ‚ÄúThe Ruthless Elimination of Hurry‚Äù.  The content of that book could have done two things. Allow me to get defensive of my lifestyle and values, or open me up to change and evaluating what‚Äôs truly important to our family..Thankfully and prayerfully, it was the latter. Evaluating our lives in Christ and what‚Äôs important not only to us but to God as towhat we do with the time we have. It lit a fire. A fire to change. I think I‚Äôve always known who I am, but certainly not to the depth I‚Äôve come to appreciate now. Life isn‚Äôt perfect and neither are the all decisions we make. But I know now exactly who I am in Christ and that the practice of being closer to Jesus is just that. Practice. It won‚Äôt be perfect. But you certainly can train with the help of the Spirit to be more aware of God‚Äôs love and the nudges you get to love better, serve and feel more intimately close to those around you. To be more grateful.John Mark Comer has come out with a new book. Live No Lies. I have been fortunate to be on the early book launch team for this project. Just like The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry, this book has so much food for thought. It discusses and gives you practices on how to notice how the devil lies to us about who we are. How the desires of our flesh play a role in cementing those lies. And how the world around us backs those desires up and tell us they are not only normal, but encouraged. This book is a modern explanation of Spiritual Warfare and how to be counter anti culture to the world under the lens of Jesus..It is a book not only helpful for our time, but necessary. If you are a Jesus follower or in any way curious about knowing who you are in Christ, this book is for you. And I appreciate John Mark‚Äôs heart for sharing it with us. May it help me to press against the lies the devil puts in my head, and lean more into the identity I have in Jesus."
"John Mark invites readers to think deeply about what keeps us from joy, and gives a framework and the tools necessary to help us thrive. He reminds readers that walking with Jesus among many things, includes a battle. Each section explores the three historically understood within Christian tradition, enemies of the soul: the devil, the world and the flesh. He brings ancient thought to a contemporary audience, balancing academia and relatability with finesse.  His thoughts are masterfully researched, defended and communicated. He writes with an invitational style and does not leave readers wanting with the question ‚Äúnow what?‚Äù, but supplies readers with practical steps to move toward a deeper sense of joy. Thank you John Mark. I‚Äôll be handing out and recommending this book for years to come. A must read for pastors and church leaders."
"This book which feels like a Part 2 of The Ruthless Elimination Of Hurry, is a must read for anyone interested in thoughtfully following Jesus. John Mark puts words to the things you have been feeling but haven't been able to articulate, or you don't even realise you've been feeling deep in your gut."
"John Mark Comer's latest book challenges the reader to think about what they think, how they think, and why they think. Well researched and communicated clearly, this is a much-needed book for today's culture."
"That would be appreciating it, and soaking in the caring, compassion, and love of the author. While the book understandably has a decidedly Christian slant, it should resonate with any person who has faith, is seeking faith, has abandoned faith, or has the slightest bit of compassion for our planet and its inhabitants.The more people who read and understand this book, the kinder our world will be.Although I was gifted with an advance copy, I‚Äôve purchased one that I can share with others."
"Once again John writes the words that I think every day. I don't feel preached to or yelled at, just reminded of the good in life. A must read for anyone who is tired of the negative coming from the front of the church and looking for a more loving path to spirituality."
"Pavlovitz was at one time a successful evangelical pastor. Then he pursued a spiritual journey that took him to a place where he now says he would no longer describe himself in such terms. His is a messy faith, he says. He questions the existence of hell. He questions the purpose of prayer. While there is much about which Pavlovitz and I do not agree, I realize this is a valuable book that should be read by Christians, whatever their tribal description. He's not one of ‚Äúus‚Äù any longer but, my goodness, does he have some insightful comments.Pavlovitz writes as an insider. He has studied and preached the Bible for decades. He realizes he, like all of us, is working with an incomplete knowledge and understanding of what Scripture says. But he does know Jesus gave us one assignment, one great command: to love God, our neighbor, and ourselves. And Pavlovitz doesn't like how contemporary Christians are handling that assignment. He recognizes a ‚Äúloveless, Jesus-less Christianity‚Äù that exists today. (89/2553) He wonders what happened to compassion, the essential aspect of following Jesus. He identifies toxic faith and bad theology. He knows when a counterfeit Christ is being presented. He is concerned that we are no longer representing a God that non-Christians would want to seek.Pavlovitz's faith is messy. His theology is fluid. Nonetheless, his spiritual journey has yielded one statement he can hold on to: ‚Äúfaith shouldn't make you a jerk.‚Äù (684/2553) Rather, we should be people rooted in love for humanity (all of it, not just the unborn). We must stop being a barrier to God. Pavlovitz has observed the behavior of Christians during these last years, during the time of crisis, and has seen the facade of loving Christianity ripped away. Rather than wearing a face mask as a deeply spiritual act embodying love for neighbor, for example, not wearing one became a loveless act and a political weapon.This is a thought provoking book. It is especially of interest to people who have left organized Christianity, feeling the rug has been pulled out from beneath them. You are not alone in your messy faith, Pavlovitz assures. You will be helped to imagine what being a Christian is like when walking out the command to love. This book is not for Christians who think they have their faith settled, however, who are dependent upon that hour Sunday morning for their spirituality. You are not ready for the uncomfortable work of reexamining your image of God and the love He commands.I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher. My comments are an independent and honest review."
"I love everything John writes, and have all his books. I give his books as gifts and the recipients immediately understand why I sing his praises. As he does in all of his writings, with this book, John hits the nail on the head when it comes to living an authentic life, being true to our spirituality and treating others with kindness, tolerance and dignity. He teaches us real, human lessons and does it in such a way that is beautiful and moving and inspiring. Anything John Pavlovitz writes is a MUST-READ."
"I've been a fan of John's blog for several years and have read some of his other books. I was fortunate to get an advance copy of this new book--and I loved it.For most of my life, I've never felt that what I felt and believed fit into a particular denominational box of religion--particularly the one labeled ""Christian."" When I look out at the world, I often think, ""If THAT is 'Christian,' for sure I don't want anything to do with it."" The hypocrisy I observed in the church of my youth turned me away from any formal structure.This book really helped me frame my spiritual journey and put so much into words that were beyond my grasp. I would love to buy this book for many of the people I know and say, ""This!""If you have felt some dissonance, observing the void between what the ""religious"" people in your life, or on tv, say and do; if you wonder if there is anyone else who struggles with finding a place to fit; if you are even uncomfortable with the word 'God,' -- I encourage you to explore this book. (Available 9/28/21)There are too many passages I've underlined to share fully, but here are some of the initial thoughts that spoke to me:-""If God is love and if you're emulating that God, then you should be loving. If you claim a religious worldview or have spiritual aspirations, those should yield more compassion, not less; more decency, not less; more generosity, not less. If not, what's the point of having them?""-""Whenever people say, 'I'm spiritual but not religious' this is usually another way of saying, 'I've outgrown my God box and I am currently looking for a bigger one.'""-""Our initial faith traditions are all valid and meaningful. They can give us a working language in which to speak about the mysteries of this life, but whoever and whatever God is doesn't require them. . . .I've grown to feel really sorry for people whose religion seems settled and finished, those who've so systematized and shrunken their spirituality down that they no longer question or dream or imagine more.""""It's almost impossible to love your neighbor as yourself if you believe that your neighbor is in some unrepentant sin that disqualifies them from proximity to a God you have intimacy with."""
"There is a geography to Sacred Spaces.  While the journey through these spaces is deeply personal, it is also universal in its hope of harmony with the world and the forces that shape and confront us.  John Pavolitz has written a deeply thoughtful book to guide the journey for which I am deeply appreciative.  I read it straight through and am pleased to recommend it to fellow travelers."
"I enjoy reading pretty much anything John has written, and I highly recommend this latest addition to his collection of timely and valuable books about how to live as a compassionate and contributing member of our society. As with his previous books, John's writing speaks to the heart and is profoundly moving. His words are just what is needed today to help navigate the challenging times we live in. This book, as well as his others, is accessible and valuable for folks of all persuasions, including Non-Christians like myself."
"John Pavlovitz's writing is comforting , challenging and inspiring. His wisdom, kindness and decency shine through every word. Highly recommended."
"John is an earnest, honest author and person. His humility adds credence to this work. Thank you John."
"John has called for a bigger table where all have a place.  He has called Christians to account for shutting the door on the poor, the stranger, and any who have a different belief system.  In this book, John calls for Love - for remembering that the Essence of God is greater than a human mind and soul - than my human mind and soul - and that we must let God out of our human-created God Boxes.  The simplicity of God is Love, of love of God and your neighbors as yourself is a difficult lifelong path made easier with the humor and experiences John puts into his newest book.  A must-read!"
"I‚Äôve been a fan of John Pavlovitz on social media for a while now, so I was pretty excited to see he‚Äôd written a book.  Pavlovitz is a progressive Christian pastor who isn‚Äôt afraid to go against the grain and call out evangelical hypocrisy on the religious right.Pavlovitz tackles topics like race, gender, and religion with his signature candor and compassion.  He exhorts us to be more Christ-like, kind, and intentional in our spiritual lives.  Reading this book requires open-mindedness and a willingness to be uncomfortable with ourselves, but that‚Äôs a good thing.  Examining our viewpoints and considering different perspectives can lead to change and growth, and this book certainly inspires the reader to do so.I would recommend this book to anyone, Christian or otherwise.  Yes, it‚Äôs religiously based, but it‚Äôs overwhelmingly human too.  I‚Äôm likely not the traditional target market for this book; I was raised Catholic, but have let my faith life lapse somewhat, turned off from church by many of the same things Pavlovitz discusses about those who call themselves Christian but act in ways that couldn‚Äôt be further from Jesus‚Äôs teachings.  Reading this book was enlightening and affirming, encouraging the reader to view Christianity and love through a different lens."
"John‚Äôs new book is a must read for everyone who has forgotten our basic need, desire, and calling to live lovingly in all of our affairs- once again John is showing us what being a person of faith-any faith- is all about. Love!"
"John Pavlovitz is a rare voice of love and reason in an era of conflict and cruelty.  Thank you, Mr. Pavlovitz, for continuing to spread your message!"
"If this book makes you uncomfortable as a Christian, you might need this book more than you think."
"I am not particularly religious, but John's book ""If God is Love, Don't Be a Jerk"" has a message for all people - religious or not. He writes from his heart and hits you in the gut - right when you most need to hear it! I highly recommend!"
"Excellent book with the most important reminder: God is love. I hate to say ‚Äúunfortunately‚Äù, but unfortunately this is a book many Christians need, as so many have forgotten how to be an example of Christ in such divisive and tense times. Grateful for John‚Äôs message and very much can‚Äôt wait to share with others."
"I am a PK (preacher‚Äôs kid). I grew up with hellfire and brimstone, but as I aged could not equate what I thought Christianity should be (Christ-like) with what I saw in so many proclaimed ‚ÄòChristians‚Äô.  It‚Äôs been wonderful to find John, who realizes that the main point of the New Testament is that we should LOVE OUR NEIGHBORS AS OURSELVES. I bought 3 paperbacks to give to family members, and am getting the Kindle version for myself."
"John is about the words and walk of Christ himself. Christ was a healer, a redeemer, one who loved the stranger, the outsider. To me, Christianity has become a cultural symbol for values that really don‚Äôt seem to mirror the humility and compassion of the Christ I grew up learning about. John has a way of separating Jesus from his followers that invoke his name for less than Christian purposes. I for one am grateful. He is one of the few who has kept me from walking away altogether."
"I read all of Johns books. While I‚Äôm not religious, I love the ‚Äúlove‚Äù that is shown in all of his works. As long as John writes books, I‚Äôll be reading them."
John‚Äôs Facebook posts kept me sane during the Trump administration and the pandemic. He puts what I‚Äôm thinking into words much more eloquent and understandable than I ever could. This book does not disappoint. Lots of people are getting this for Christmas. Check out ‚ÄúA Bigger Table‚Äù while you‚Äôre at it.
"I have been anticipating this book for a while, hoping John would help me make sense, or peace, with our society. He speaks from a place of compassion and truth. I hope those who are cemented in their stance of selfishness and gullibility will take a step forward by reading this book."
"Most of us aspire to be good people. We don't always succeed, but we try. In ""If God is Love..."", John Pavlovitz tackles the topic with sincerity, humor, and above all love. Although written from the lived experience of a Christian, it has a universal message that transcends tribal divisions."
This thoughtful and simply written book is so easy to understand for anyone like me who can get so confused trying to interpret the Bible .  Thank you!
"When John the Baptist walked this earth, he said things that angered the Pharisees, Sadducees and King Herod ‚Äî but as we know they were words that had to be said.  To force an opening in the darkness, where the light will be able to illuminate.  This is what This modern day John;s book is all about.  Open your eyes!  Hear with your heart.  Think with your mind and stop following the false prophets of right wing ideologies aka ‚ÄúEvangelicals‚Äù would have you believe.  This is truth.  God is love, so Don‚Äôt be a jerk!"
"I have been awaiting this book for some time.  I follow Mr. Pavlovitz on social media and have been inspired,  entertained,  intrigued, and challenged by his writing.  The book, so far exceeds my expectations.  In our troubled world, his is a soothing and steady voice with a much needed message.  We should all stop being jerks."
"John is amazing amazing human. He speaks like a true, genuine follower of Christ. He speaks from the heart with true intention about inclusion & love. We need much, much more of this!"
John has an amazing way to speak in the written word everything I wish I had said.
"After years of feeling that I no longer had a place in today's conservative Americhristian community, John Pavlovitz has convinced me that the loving, merciful, empathetic progressive believers are the true followers of Christ's teachings. He writes with compassion and deep empathy, but he pulls no punches when confronting conservative religious bullies."
Read this and give copies to your friends. It's heartfelt wisdom and gives me hope for humanity.
"As an agnostic I was hesitant, but really glad I bought the book. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"but anyone writing a bad review of a book they haven‚Äôt read just because they don‚Äôt like what he stands for is, reaching for reasons to dislike anything and everything and that‚Äôs no way to live."
"The premise that God is love is central to Christianity, yet so many of us who aspire to follow Christ are branding the church as a temple of judgey intolerance. Pavlovitz holds our feet to the fire by inviting us to find, and disempower, our own inner jerk.The country needs this book.My faith community needs this book.And <cringe> I need this book."
"John Pavlovitz expresses his views on so many subjects in today‚Äôs  hostile world in a way I can totally relate to.  I‚Äôve been following him on Facebook for about 6-7 years, and his words always touch me and ring true.  He truly understands that ‚ÄúGod is love‚Äù.  He‚Äôs not a ‚Äúpreacher‚Äù he‚Äôs a ‚Äúpastor and teacher‚Äù‚Ä¶just like Jesus!I just got my book today, and what I‚Äôve read so far is great.  I can‚Äôt wait to finish it.  John did not disappoint."
We are all earthlings together. There's still hope. Or as some people may say WWJD. It's not always what you've been indoctrinated to.
"John eloquently writes what I'm thinking. He, like I, believe that the way we have come to treat one another is breaking the heart of Jesus! Many have lost compassion, civility, humility and love for others. He tells it like it is and gives valuable insight for everyone who reads this much awaited book!! I couldn't put it down and highly recommend it for everyone who calls theirselves a Christian. It gives enlightening perspectives on what we think we know about the love of God and Jesus. I LOVED IT!!!"
"John angers hypocrites because they experience cognitive dissonance when he lays it all out bluntly.  Insightful author that calls out hatred, then gets accused of being hateful for calling others out. Talk about projection!"
"I have read John's previous books, blog, and Twitter and Facebook posts for a couple years. In this book, he reminds us of God's love and how important it is to reflect this to the world. Too often,  those in the faith community fail and it reflects poorly on God and those that profess to be Christian. John reminds us what it really means to be Christian."
"Received the book today and immediately started reading it!  Just like "" A Bigger Table"", John's new book reminds us why we are here, and how easy it is to love one another.He writes like we are having a conversation. It's an easy read, and if you're anything like me, it will leave you feeling like getting up off the couch and helping someone....anyone....everyone.Be well John...the world needs people like you!"
John is especially mindful .  His words can change how you see the world and your life.  He‚Äôs the best!
"Dear John,I ""unboxed"" God as a preteen when I realized that the people inside the box (not all of them, of course, but, honestly, a majority) treated me and my siblings terribly. We were products of a broken home - in the 60s - and on welfare to boot. We were so humiliated by these 'Christians' that we hid under the stairwell after ""big church"" so we didn't have to go to Sunday school.I'm now 67 and I've been struggling with my faith ever since. I spent so many Sundays trying various churches, trying to find one that fit my beliefs. I got so tired of the elitism, backstabbing, and downright meanness. I wondered if i was doing Christianity wrong, but if I was, I didn't want to be 'right'. But then I feared that perhaps God truly was as they espoused in church and I would be going to Hell for all of eternity. Then again, if heaven was filled with ""in-the-box"" Christians, I really didn't want to hang out with them for eternity either. I was officially in faith limbo.¬†I have always said that the Bible can be boiled down to two words: Be nice! You have successfully managed to make it one: Love.¬†My faith has held steady throughout my life; I just had nowhere to express it. And I almost felt embarrassed to call myself a Christian. Then, about two or three years ago, I saw one of your posts on fb and I was absolutely gobsmacked. Your sense of humor while tackling the problem of those who cloak themselves in Christianity while spewing venom spoke to my heart. I began following you immediately. I bought Stuff That Needs To Be Said and loved it.¬†But this new book resonates with me in a very different way. I began crying on the second page. Tears of joy, I assure you. You have given me the gift of owning and feeling comfortable in MY faith. I felt such an overwhelming sense of relief that there are others like me: I can worship God and act Christ-like without having to listen to what a terrible person I really am and being subjected to Christian abuse and hypocrisy inside the box. I knew that innately I was a good person, but you have given me validation to live my kind of faith. I cannot thank you enough, Mr. Pavolitz. You truly have changed my life."
"I pre-ordered this book and it arrived ""hot off the griddle"" in my Kindle soon after midnight on its release date.  I've found it very readable; and I'll slow down when I read it again.  Most of us are searching, even after we settle into our church ""homes"" for five...ten...thirty years.  The belief in things unseen may come and go, but the concept that God Is Love is immutable for many believers.  Pavlovitz is obviously troubled by the increasing emphasis on the tribal aspects of Christianity in a time when Jesus' teachings often seem to be ignored; and he's not shy about expressing his anger and frustration.  Outrage over perceived hypocrisy is, after all, a time-honored theme of writing about faith. There's humor in this book, and anger, and no small measure of heartache as the author writes of his struggles to reconcile the teachings of faith with the realities of society.  In that, he likely mirrors the emotions of millions who've tried to hew to religions that too often seem reduced to formulaic ritual or what amounts to a secret handshake.  Whether or not one agrees with Pavlovitz's assessments and observations, his book should afford the opportunity for personal examination of one's own faith and how it's being lived. [Aside:  I have seen some reviews by people who admit they haven't read the book, but who feel free to rate it based on who they perceive the author to be.  That type of pre-emptive condemnation based on identity is a slippery slope, whether in publishing, restaurant critiques, education, or many other aspects of life.  Surely we can rise above the equivalent of ""I haven't read your book but your dog is ugly and I hate your hair and politics"".]"
"If you haven‚Äôt been reading John Pavlovitz these past years, you have been missing a special voice.  I happened upon his Facebook page at a time when I was in distress over what was going on in our country and wondering where our faith-based institutions were in the chaos that was being created.  John reached out and encouraged us all to follow the truth, to continue to show love to all, to truly grasp the message of Jesus Christ in all of his humanity.  I cannot tell you what this clarion voice in the darkness meant‚Äîto know that I was not alone in my bewilderment and in my questioning.  John is an includer and all are welcome at his table.  Do yourself a kindness and include this and all of John‚Äôs books in your personal library."
"Just received my copy and am more than halfway through. It will be finished before bed. And if I continue to mark pages, there‚Äôs no way I will share it.  So good and so spot on. I will reread multiple times so I can digest all the words. John speaks directly to my heart why I walked away from the ‚Äòchurch‚Äô. My faith isn‚Äôt gone but I can‚Äôt be around those who profess faith and yet treat other human beings as unworthy of love, safety and freedom in their lives. If you are questioning why your faith wavers when you are around toxic people, pick up a copy and see why."
"Received my copy last night. So, Lily and I are up early (6:00a.m) to learn better ways to continue our lives pursuits of loving others as God loves them and not being jerks. Since she is constantly attached to me, it is my belief that if I‚Äôm not a jerk, she won‚Äôt be either. I know that we teach others how to treat us, animals included.Thanks John Pavlovitz for another, sure to be, spot on, in your face, no holds barred, truth bomb of a book. Lily and I are praying for you and your speedy recovery after surgery. Thank you for always keeping it real and for sharing your wisdom, heart, and soul with those of us who care enough to not be jerks.‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèªNicole & LilyGA*I will update again when I‚Äôve finished the book. I‚Äôve read all of John‚Äôs other books, and all of them get 5 stars from me. So, I leapt on faith that this book will also be a 5 star read."
I've been following John's writings for a couple of years and appreciate his boldness in calling us all to live better lives.  I'm excited to read his latest work - I know I will be challenged to be a better human.
"I discovered John Pavlovitz a few years ago, and I credit his caring and compassionate writings--calling out hate--with my survival since the nightmare that began in 2016. I am not a Christian, but he speaks to me in a way that is not preachy. I read through this book quickly in just a couple of days--and I will be reading it again. And probably again. He reminds us that there is good in the world--even today. Highly recommended."
What a refreshing book :)
"That is the John Pavlovitz message that is written on the masks I have worn during the pandemic. His message of kindness, compassion, and rational thinking has been a big part of what has helped me through the craziness of the past five years of hateful rhetoric and stress. This new book continues that message. Some of his thoughts are calming and reassuring, while others make me pause to think about what more I can do to be the kind of person the world needs. I am among the people he describes who has drawn away from organized religion when he wrote, ‚ÄúSadly, the American Church has in many ways become the greatest argument for someone not becoming a Christian, for rejecting organized religion and never looking back.‚Äù While I am not religious, I find that John's message touches my heart and comforts my mind. I highly recommend this book to everyone, but especially to those who are disappointed or disenchanted with the radical turn that religion has taken in the last few decades."
"I was so excited to finally receive this book last night ‚Äî and now that I've started reading, it definitely doesn't disappoint. John Pavlovitz's inclusivity and passion for social justice have made him one of my favorite bloggers for many years (yes, this nice Jewish lady is a huge fan of a Christian blogger - and this is the stuff that brings us all together and heals the world).I expected this book to warm, meaningful, touching and passionate (which it so very much is!) but the unexpected gift is how downright funny it often is too! I've actually laughed out loud a few times. What a lovely way to deliver such an important message! If I had to find one fault with the book it would have to be that it's so engaging that I'll be done with it way too fast and I just want it to go on.I'd totally recommend this book to anyone of any faith looking to deepen his, her or their connection to God and to humanity. Bravo!"
How fearful one must be to rate a book they haven't read.  John Pavlovitz is an amazing pastor and author who is not afraid to call out the hypocrisy of many self-proclaimed Christians.  If that strikes a nerve perhaps ask yourself why instead of rating a book you haven't opened.
"I am halfway through the book and already I find myself agreeing with John's ""theology"" on every page. It has taken decades for me to try to undo the damage that organized religion has done to me.  Whether it is the contradictory characterization of God as both loving and judgmental, or the misogyny of the dogma and the clergy, or the inability to discern the one true message that should be present in all spirituality (LOVE ONE ANOTHER), I could no longer belong to a church that made no sense to me as a woman living in the 21st century.  And yet, John also acknowledges a grieving that never ends for the church of one's youth, not a grieving for something that actually existed as I once believed it to be, but a grieving for the innocence and simplicity of being able to hold onto a mythology that promised me immortality. I look forward to reading the rest of the book and re-reading it again and again. It is a crucial tool for those of us who have diverged from the institution to travel what often feels like a solitary journey towards truth and love.  Thank You, John."
"Timely, relevant and much-needed in the strife-ridden society that is America 2021"
"Any intelligent human who has rejected the seeming hypocracy of American Christianity, or any American who identifies as Christian, yet has questions about how their church can seem so irrelevant or hateful, this book is for you. It's not hard core theology, it's not difficult reading, yet it cuts right to the core of what it means to be a follower of Jesus in 21st century US. (hint: it's not repeating complicated creeds, it's not following a lot of seemingly arcane laws, and it's not showing up to the right church every Sunday morning.)Pavlovitz is one of a handful of thinkers and writers who have enabled me not to walk away from Christianity in disgust. Maybe he can do that for you, too."
"Or borrow it or whatever you need to do to read it.I follow John on FB, so was excited to read this book.  I'm a ""lapsed"" Catholic, probably closer to agnostic, but also familiar with advaita and ajata.  Basically I don't know what if anything I ""believe"".John ""gets"" this.  His insistence that God is bigger than any man made image rings true.But let me pull out one paragraph from the book that spells it out clearly:""I've always joked that I was going to start a new church: The Church of Not Being Horrible.  Our mission statement would simply be Don't be horrible to people.  Our what we believe doctrinal statements would be replaced by how we treat people promises: Don't treat them as less worthy of love, respect, dignity, joy, and opportunity than you are. Don't create caricatures of them based on their skin color, their religion, their sexual orientation, the amount of money they have, or the circumstances they find themselves in.  Don't seek to take away things from them that you already enjoy in abundance: civil rights, clean water, education, marriage, access to health care.  Don't tell someone's story for them about why they are poor, depressed, addicted victimized, or alone.  Let them tell their story and believe they know it better than you do. Don't imagine that your experience of the world is everyone's experience of the world; that the ease, comfort, support, affection you have received are universal.Don't be preoccupied with how someone experiences God, how they define family, whom they love.  Cultivate your own faith, family and marriage.""If I was to go back and join any church, THAT is one I could be a part of."
"John Pavlovitz‚Äôs words are down to earth and simple, and the title is perfect. He doesn‚Äôt try to impress anyone with how much scripture he can recite, or theological reasons to justify long held ideas, and some recent ones, that do not ring true for a loving God.I encourage anyone who has felt dissatisfaction with how twisted Christianity has become in some denominations to buy this book and breathe a sigh of relief and catch the spark of hope that it gives."
"I am not a Christian. I gave up questioning my Christianity many years ago. I am also not religious. I read this book because I admire the author for the good, honest human being he is and for his writing style. I bought the book and read it because I told him I would do so. I also cannot write a review of a book I have not read. While I admit I skimmed over the more religious part, I enjoyed a lot of the humanity that came through in the rest of the book, and of course his sense of humor.Like everything he writes, this is beautifully written."
"John Pavlovitz is perhaps the truest Christian I have ever had the pleasure to meet.  But even if you are not a person of faith, this book provides all the rationale for living the best, most compassionate, caring life possible.  I highly  recommend this and all of John's books and essays.  His writing is accessible,  reasonable, understandable, and oh so pertinent in today's negative and derogatory ""anti"" culture. Purchase this book; it will be a wonderful gift you give yourself."
"I bought two copies.  One to read, reread, and maybe read again, and the second to give away.  I must admit that I am not done reading it completely the first time yet.  I have been challenged by some of what John writes.  I see that as the point of any study - to hold my beliefs and knowledge up for review against new information.  The modern church institutions are not the keepers of who God is.  God has given us the Bible and the Holy Spirit to show who ""I Am"" truly is.  This book is challenging me to review things I have learned in buildings and seek God.  Thank you John for that.  May others find the same experience."
"I‚Äôm skeptical when it comes to ‚Äúself-help‚Äù books. Working for a nonfiction publisher, I‚Äôve seen thousands of them, some are even quite good. Religious-based self-help is in a category of its own, as it should be. Typically 25% of those books offer interesting ideas, the other 75% tells you things you know from Sunday School or Vacation Bible School, adding a serious parsing of Bible verses to fill up space.  THIS BOOK, however, ain‚Äôt like that. Nothing typical here, just a much-needed, straightforward wake-up call that every professing Christian needs. EVERY ONE OF US. If we think that Jesus‚Äô command to love God, ourselves and OTHERS is true, what a crappy job of it we‚Äôre doing. What a tangled web we‚Äôve weaved from such a clear and simple instruction. We seem to have decided that He made a mistake, so we added some conditions‚Äîwell, lots of conditions. How ashamed He must be when he sees the things we do (or don‚Äôt do) in His name. Wow. Granted, some people are difficult to love, but we make loving people we have never even met difficult because we insert political, social, racial, religious and god-knows-what-other conditions into it. We‚Äôve sure made a mess of the one thing that can change the world, ourselves first.  I needed this book and I consider myself one of the more loving Christians that I know. In fact, I‚Äôm going in for a re-read as soon as I order a couple more copies to give away. And NO, I won‚Äôt lend anyone my marked up, dog-eared, wine- and tear-stained copy, even after I get my kindle version."
"My ReviewIf God Is Love, Don't Be a Jerk: Finding a Faith That Makes Us Better HumansIf God is Love, Don't Be A Jerk may hit you right between the eyes. No matter what you believe or what political affiliation you might identify with, this book should make you pause and examine your beliefs. I couldn't put it down as the author seemed to be living in my headspace during these traumatic times.John Pavlovitz will have you exploring your beliefs about God and religion and where they originated in your life. Were we blindly led along our path to believe what we do?  Did we question and explore and challenge the religious authority in our lives that led us to where we are today? Is the way we treat people based on our religious background? Are we cruel in our judgment because we believe that is what God tells us to do? How do we interpret God's love? Is it a love of inclusion or exclusion? If God is Love Don't Be a Jerk should have us all examining how we live in the name of religion.I would imagine the author is going to get flack over this piece of work because it goes against the norm of what we expect from books about Christianity.  Finally, someone says what many of us have wondered but not dared to speak in our religious affiliations. John Pavolitz in If God Is Love Don't Be A Jerk, Finding a Faith That Makes Us Better Human Beings, challenges all of us to do better in our lives and our interactions with others."
John tells it like it is.
"I had the good fortune to find John Pavlovitz through social media and have become a fan of his work.  John is an excellent writer, he cites examples that I can relate to and pass along to others.  This book is a necessary piece of writing to help change this contentious world.  No matter what your religious beliefs are, this is a book for all audiences of all persuasions.  I'll be buying more copies of this book to give as gifts."
"This is the third book I have purchased written by this author.  Seriously, given the way the teachings of Jesus have been manipulated (and in many cases ignored) to marginalize so many groups and individuals for others' agendas, I have stopped referring to myself as ""Christian,"" or, find myself explaining what kind of Christian I am not when discussing my faith, which is a real shame.  Mr. Pavlovitch's books help me find perspective and get back to why I chose to be a follow of Christ in the first place.  This book and his other one ""Bigger Table"" have especially really helped  remind me that the majority of us are still here, trying to follow his teaching of loving, caring and service to others and that, maybe, there is more hope than it appears.  These books are well-written, and even if some criticize him for not following the current herd mentality, his writing comes from a place of love and compassion which is where, I believe, we are supposed to be coming from. Excellent read and something you may find yourself revisiting more than once."
"When I found Pastor John Pavolovitz years ago I couldn‚Äôt believe it‚Äìa pastor who truly walked the talk. Who called out those faux Christians and TV ‚Äúpastors‚Äù who are anything BUT Christian. Refreshing! (Shouldn‚Äôt be, but in this strange world of ours, it is.Who can believe some of the behavior of so called ""Christians?"" )His content is riveting and so on point today. And he's a really good writer. I mean, really good.If you want to read what a real Christian has to say, someone who walks the talk? This is the book for you. This will be a holiday gift for some of my nearest and dearest."
This book speaks to everything that I've been feeling and saying for decades (since folks in the Moral Majority tried to make me feel like I wasn't a Christian because I didn't fall in line with them...and it still continues).  Bless him for putting everything I feel into words.  What an amazing book...the best that I've read in ages.  It was worth the wait.  You won't be disappointed.
"This book makes me squirm.  I've had a terrible time loving people who are loud, hateful, and dangerous, all while waving American flags and smacking the least of these down with their bibles. But I am compelled to love my neighbor, as Pavlovitz points out again and again. Those who hate his message seem to be the very people I'm struggling to love. I dare anyone who despises Pavlovitz and the message in this book to find Jesus' words (in context) to justify such an angry position.  It isn't easy to love sometimes. It is hard to be human. This book helps me find a path to work on where I fall short. I needed this."
"I‚Äôve been reading ‚ÄúIf God is Love, Don‚Äôt Be a Jerk‚Äù, and I think I‚Äôve highlighted more in this book than in any other book I‚Äôve ever read‚Ä¶including textbooks‚Ä¶and I have a doctorate, so I‚Äôve read a lot.Statements like:‚ÄúThey (Christian Nationalists) assume that love for one must come at the expense of another; they reflect a fearful religion that suggests they are perpetually in danger; and they reveal a faith rooted in superiority and self-preservation, one that breeds hostility to those it sees as outsiders--which turns out to be an awful lot of people.‚Äù are mind-blowing to me as they describe so many of the ‚ÄúChristians‚Äù that I know, including the ones from my old church that judged, ridiculed, harassed, insulted, and threatened me until I left.This book has opened my eyes to realize that I am not crazy or a heretic for my thoughts and feelings about God and his love for us."
"I first discovered John Pavlovitz via his social media posts in the wake of Trump's election, and I admired the fact that a theologian was calling Trump and his followers out for their behavior, especially those who claim Christianity as their justification for being jerks. I have read his books--and they give me hope that the church I turned from because of its members is not truly representative of what Christianity espouses. I am unsure of where I am at this point, faith-wise; however, John Pavlovitz's platform and the way he uses it to essentially ransack the ""temple"" as Jesus did with the money-changers gives me hope that I will someday find my way back to the time when I believed that God is Love. Pavlovitz knows that God, not the One that so many ""Christians"" claim to represent. Thank you, John, for another thought-provoking book for the unchurched among your followers."
This author is extremely interesting! This is a very good book. Enjoy!
"I've no doubt this book will get slammed by those that object to recognizing the real call of Jesus to love, forgive, and accept everyone, regardless of race, nationality, gender, etc. But the author reminds us that Jesus spoke to us not as a politician vying for votes, but as a teacher reminding us to love each other as God loves us all. In some ways, as an older person, with a degree in religious studies, this seems so...basic. And yet, our current climate requires this kind of reminder, I think. If nothing else, it's a call to those of us losing hope in our fellow humans, to hold on, keep trying, and remember why we follow the spiritual path we do.  Highly recommended for those looking for some hope in these troubling times."
"I have just received my copy of this book and have barely had time to scan through it.  It appears to be, like all his other writings, honest and blunt -- and a book I'm going to love.  He writes of what he calls an ""aspirational faith"" -- the faith we most of us aspire to while knowing full well that we continually fall short.  But occasionally falling short is okay, because the God he loves loves us unconditionally and just keeps on loving us regardless of stumbles and failures.  This is the news we need to hear, and this is what John's books continually offer to me -- reassurance, hope, love -- and an on-going call to keep trying to do better at loving those who share this time and space with me.  Be well, John, and keep on writing.  We need you."
"This book is brilliant. Thank you John for your courage to verbalize what so many of us think. Sending you healing vibes. Godspeed.Lucky for me, I unboxed God a long time ago. I often call her a ‚Äòshe‚Äô because why not. I have two running paths back in Philly that marked many short and many many MANY long runs ‚Äî the Ben Franklin Bridge and Kelly Drive. And when my mom would ask me, as she often did, to get to a church on a Sunday, I respectfully remind her that it was those running routes that made me feel closest to God.‚ÄúWhen you begin to unbox God, you find yourself uncomfortable in church or religion because these places begin to feel restrictive to your soul. The prayers might no longer ring as true, the creeds may seem unwieldy, and the sermons start to sound alarms of hypocrisy. These are the growing pains of realizing that whatever holds this life together is a bit bigger than the old story you were taught and memorized; it goes beyond the borders that you‚Äôd mapped out. That‚Äôs when you discover that God has left the building and that maybe you need to as well.‚ÄùI left the building a long time ago ‚Äî and learned that it is how I treat my fellow human that counts.Pastors, ministers, faith leaders around the world ‚Äî if you‚Äôre still trying to fit ‚ÄúGod‚Äù in a square peg or a round hole  ‚Äî take note. Respectfully, your playbook is outdated."
"Now, I agree with most of what he says and writes and I respect him more than I used to.I have been following and reading John's writing for years.  I have often described him as someone who I don't always agree with but I always respect.  That very important trend continues.  God is Love - not if, but He is - and we shouldn't be Jerks.  Oh what a wonderful world this would be.  If we all found faith that made us better humans, the world would be a better place.  And we would all be better off.  I would have said, 10 years ago, that John was off base with this goal.  But reading his work - not only the books but the FB posts, the comments, the tweets, they have all shown me that his goal with this book and his goal with getting people to think about their church and their beliefs makes us all better Christians."
"If you feel like something is ‚Äúoff‚Äù in religion, you‚Äôre right and John‚Äôs book is a great read to walk though how loving EACH OTHER can change everything. It‚Äôs written from the viewpoint of a Jesus follower and I believe it‚Äôs applicable to everyone, regardless of your specific faith tradition. His experiences going from a pastor in an Evangelical church to the messy but genuine and love-filled Faith he‚Äôs living now, will likely resonate with anyone that has felt like there has to be more than what they‚Äôre experiencing in religious spaces. 100% recommend."
"I received my copy last week after pre-ordering in August. I've been a fan of John's for several years. He's authentic, real, and has a big heart. This book did not disappoint. His engaging style drew me in immediately as he discusses issues of spirituality I've wrestled with for a number of years. I'm learning that it's OK not to know all the answers. Most importantly, this book teaches me to think about the power of love in our broken world. I highly recommend this book!"
"I have followed John's blog for sometime now.  I bought a copy of this book with high hopes that it would be as good as his blog essays.  It does not disappoint.  With great humor he writes about how faith should make us better people, how to do love right.  If you are disenchanted with the church this is the book for you.  If you are in love with the church it is for you as well."
"John Pavlovitz is rapidly becoming a national treasure.  Throughout so much turmoil and chaos in our nation and around the globe, his has been a voice of calm and reason.  In his latest book, ""If God is Love, Don't Be a Jerk"" he once again proves what some of us have known all along.  He is a Blessing.  His words resonate to the mind, the heart, and the soul.  Rediscover your faith through a new narrative.  I highly recommend you make the time to read this exceptional work - if for no other reason - for YOU.  Thank you John!"
"I have been searching for a while for someone who could understand my religion/spirituality/faith/what has the world come to and why dilemma for a few years. Deep talks with friends of faith, and friends of no faith. This book, and Johns sometimes raw but usually humorous truths, really have voiced what I have been trying to understand about myself. I‚Äôm so grateful he took the time to put this all out there. Love!"
I find it interesting that Pavlovitz's biggest detractors exhibit neither compassion nor insight. I hope that at some point they actually read his work and it manages to break through their malicious ignorance enough to inspire them to engage in some self reflection and maybe find some empathy.
"His writing is open, honest, sharing what millions feel today. Religion is being used as a political weapon and the words of Jesus are crushed beneath manipulation and selfishness in our time. His writing, his words, are welcomed by those of us watching ‚Äòreligion‚Äô become cult."
"I read a review where someone was bashing the book, and the author, without actually having read it! My comments are in response: This review is so amazingly emblematic of White Evangelical ‚ÄúLet-Me-Bash-You-With-My-Bible-Belt‚Äù member‚Äôs thinking! And also an amazing incentive for those of us who have a HEART AND A BRAIN to pick it up and read it. I am on Chapter 4. Believe me, where I live, I KNOW the LMBYWMBB MAGA folks. When I tell them Trump is an epic Third Temptation fail, they don‚Äôt understand what I am saying. I left mainline church in the early 90‚Äôs. I saw MAGA coming, honestly, just didn‚Äôt have a name for it then. I called myself a Christian in diaspora. I am back in a Brethren congregation where I am boldly living honestly and bigger. John and other liberal writers have been my guides and I am forever grateful for his work and bold life-affirming love!"
"I‚Äôm a ‚Äúuse to be‚Äù Christian, but I have been following this amazing man for some time now, and I‚Äôm so pleased that he has written this book. Our poor, broken world needs more compassion like this man offers on a daily basis. I encourage everyone, of any faith, to read this"
"As always, John Pavlovitz provides the perfect words for this moment in time. This book is straight from his very big heart and provides words of hope and honesty at a time when our world can seem so hopeless and full of dishonesty. If you haven't read it, I recommend you do!  You won't regret it."
"This book is all about the love God has for each of us, and loving each other. It sounds so simple, but John talks about the ways we‚Äôre getting it right and the ways we‚Äôre getting it wrong. This book is for everyone who has questioned what they were taught, and was criticized for doing so. It answered questions I never thought to ask. It is for those who those who go to church and those who don‚Äôt. I will probably go back and re-read it several times."
"I am a voracious reader of mysteries and an occasional reader of non-fiction.  When I got this book, I put aside my current thriller briefly to just read the introduction. An hour and a half later I made myself stop and put the book down because I was plowing through it like a Baldacci masterpiece.  There has only been one book I've read, other than the Bible, that totally changed my thinking and my heart: the small parable by Charles Sheldon - ""In His Steps: What Would Jesus Do?""  Now I'm reading a 2nd book that is already changing my thinking and my heart - ""If God Is Love, Don't Be a Jerk"".  If you're really comfortable with your relationship and understanding of God and don't want to be made uncomfortable, don't read this book.  It is dangerous.  But I urge you to read it anyway.  We need people to represent the ""God who is love"" accurately and this book will help."
"I just got my copy and I've already began reading - Just the intro has me nodding in agreement and wishing everyone would read this and LIVE THIS!!!  Thank you John, for again, keeping it real!"
"If God is love, don't be a jerk is a brilliantly written book about the divine responsibility we have to each other to just be kind. If Jesus were alive today, this is surely a book that he would write. Highly recommended. It will lift your soul and brighten your day."
"Today's ""Christians"" are not living up to what my Bible teaches me.  If they can support the Republican party, and trump in particular, then they're supporting a way of life that is not according to Christian teachings.  I hate to have to tell them, but Jesus wasn't a blue-eyed blonde and America is not God's chosen land.  And God does not put certain people in office because he's not into politics. Thank you, John Pavlovitz,  for speaking the truth.  We need more people like you who are not ashamed to stand up for REAL Christian values.  Well said.  Enjoyable read.  Keep spreading the truth, my friend!  Excellent book!"
John P critiques those who claim to be religious or Christian but don‚Äôt actually follow the words and actions of Christ. I.e. they aren‚Äôt being good humans to fellow humans who are struggling. His honesty is refreshing.
"After having read some of John's other writings, I purchased ""If God Is Love....."" as soon as he announced the date it would be released.  It arrived right on time on 9/28 (the release date).  I definitely was NOT disappointed.  As I read it, it's as if John is speaking to me, personally.....today.  The fact that it addresses TODAY (elections, conspiracy theories, pandemic, etc) makes it all the more relevant.  For anyone who is struggling because the old answers just don't work any longer, this book is a must."
You don't even need to be a Christian to have each chapter in this book make you think deeply. What did Jesus say was the most important thing for humans? (hint: not hate or judgment or arrogance) How are evangelicals today spreading their own hate filled word and using politics as a cover?Love is key and it would be a nice thing to see it in more Christians again. Gift this to your legislate their personally chosen faith relatives. Maybe they'll learn how to  make sure they are working for Christ and NOT for themselves and politics.Great red letter view of Christianity.
Such insight of what spirituality and religion mean today. Thought provoking and a great comfort to those who see ‚Äòchurch‚Äô as being too small. This book challenges old time beliefs and would  be of interest to those who are seeking greater meaning in their spiritual path. Great book for discussion groups. Well written and funny at times - a delight to read. Highly recommend.
"John's writing in ""If God Is Love"" is much needed in today's world that is filled with so much hate. His words and posts also saved me from deep depression during the Trump years. I couldn't believe people I knew who I believed to be Christians with high moral values willfully embraced and supported the hate and division  It was against everything I had been taught and believed in. We are called to love others, no matter their color or beliefs.  In a time when I felt I could not find a kindred soul to talk to, John's words calmed my soul. Thank you, John!"
"I can‚Äôt begin to tell you how un-put-down-able this book is. I received it yesterday and am neglecting everything that needs to be done because this book is amazing! I‚Äôve tried to follow the Christian tenets all my life, but over  the past few years I‚Äôve become embarrassed to use the word Christian when speaking of my beliefs. The word is being used by so many to justify terrible actions. This book is helping me navigate the choppy waters of today‚Äôs crazy world. John, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking my hand during these stressful times."
Helps put in perspective the time we are living in with the most divisive time of my life and I am a senior citizen!  How do we continue to love especially those that are so hateful. What would Jesus do.
John's books reflect the world that I truly want to be a part of.  He reminds us that our faith does not need to be weaponized to take away the needs and rights of others.  That it is a sacred sense of belonging to a world that cares about others and wants a better place for all of us.  His writing reminds me of the small church I belong to where your fatih does not have to mirror those of the other congregants but we can live with and accept everyone for who they are and what they believe (as long as it is not being used as a tool against anyone).  When you want to feel hopeful pick up one of John's books or read one of his many wonderful writings from his FB page.  You won't regret the time spent.  And you will feel better for it.
"I have been going through the same transformation as the author for years.  He is so knowledge, insightful, and wise.  He writes with humor and truth.  I find this book a must read. I can't put it down."
"Patiently, I have been waiting to read this book. It is finally here, Christmas came in September. Definitely, will be sharing this thought-provoking book with friends and family."
"Those of us who have left the church as a result of Evangelical bigotry and greed,  now have a voice speaking for us and giving us back our chuurch. Well done. Tears of joy."
John Pavlovitz left his Christian yardstick in his back pocket; he measured people's worth with an honest and open heart. John looked at a raw and beautiful world which God created. He saw the love which God has for us as having no preconceived boundaries. He skillfully shares his insight as a gift bestowed him to widen God's table to both the church and the humanity outside it's walls.
"John's genuine empathy comes through in sometimes humorous, sometimes sobering prose. An excellent read for anyone who has truthfully decided to follow Jesus--towards justice, equitable opportunity, beauty, and love."
"I opened this book around supper time on the day it was delivered and literally couldn‚Äôt put it down until I finished it sometime in the wee hours of the morning.  As someone who grew up in the church, spent years deeply immersed in the church, but struggling of late with the disconnect between the commandment to love and the reality of church‚Äôs response to the world, this book spoke to me, wrestled with me and ultimately helped me clarify a lot of my issues. It‚Äôs a must read if you have a faith that doesn‚Äôt quite fit anymore."
"This book is a gentle, yet truthful, path to confronting one's belief system and challenging us to make our practice reflect what we say we believe. I'm only just in the first few chapters and yet have learned a great deal about holding myself accountable and showing my faith in action. I can already tell that the pages of this book will soon be lovingly dogeared and adorned with colorful highlights of points that resonated with me."
"I'm not normally interested in ""God"" books, but have been following John Pavlovitz on Facebook, and I like what he has to say about God and spirituality . He speaks the truth about what is happening to Christianity in our country. From the catchy chapter titles of ""The Dude Abides"" to ""Love Your D**n Neighbor"", this book will take you on a journey of self-examination and a-ha moments,  unlike any other. Read it, savor it, read it again.Order this book now, you won't be disappointed."
"This book speaks to so very many issues that I have struggled with over the past several years of deconstructing my faith/indoctrination/worldview as prescribed by my upbringing. If, like me, you've found yourself at odds in recent years with people you used to respect & admire but cannot reconcile their complete disregard for Love as a verb, this book is a must-read."
"This is a great book, regardless of your religious/spiritual affiliation or lack there of. John has a way of excavating & communicating the basic tenants of spirituality/religion & life simply, compassionately, passionately & humorously, from his own experience, that also invites the reader to do the same. As with his previous books, he asks the reader to look deeply within themselves to question whether they are indeed practicing the base tenant of LOVE to ALL of humanity. I resonate profoundly with all of John‚Äôs writings & musings on the state of our world & our involvement in it! This book does not disappoint! I am hopeful that it reaches the audience that needs it most &, at the very least, brings about more compassionate discussion, understanding, empathy & love to a world that desperately needs all of the above! Thank you again, John, for your words of wisdom that are a balm to a weary soul!"

I was introduced to John‚Äôs books during the early days of the pandemic. He speaks from the heart and I find myself relating to his words; they help me know I‚Äôm not alone in this crazy world that‚Äôs filled with too many people who purport to be Christian but their actions say otherwise.
"John P. is a very good, descriptive writer, he is a caring, humane person and I thought thisbook was very thoughtful and needed. Thank you so much."
His conversational style makes what he writes extremely personal (e.g. his parenthetical insertions).  It seemed he already knew my religious upbringing and where I am with it today.  It's a blueprint for me going forward.  Bless you John!
I‚Äôm so grateful that John has put into words what I feel.  This is a book that will stay close at hand for a long time.
"I have to first admit that I had to stop reading after the first few chapters! Why? Because I was laughing so hard at John's description of some of his antics! Once I caught my breath I continued and Oh what a joy this book is, with a refreshing breeze blowing through the pages. After chasing various forms of 'religion' in my life, I found myself in perfect accord with John's words. In my opinion this book is a Must Read for everyone, regardless of what religion they follow."
I am thoroughly enjoying John's book. It is written as if a dear friend came over and you are having a wonderful deep philosophical discussion about growing as a person within your faith. He uses stories and examples that make me think.
"I am a fan of the writing and viewpoint of John Pavlovitz, and have read his previous books.  His perspective about God, religion, love, acceptance, and humanity are insightful and inspire me to look at things sometimes through new eyes.  My perception of what God means has always been a vision of pure love, and this book follows that idea and questions why some people who claim to be believers act in ways that do not reflect the teachings of a loving God, but rather seem filled with rage, hate, and intolerance.  If you too believe we need more love in the world, this book is for you."
"Another addition to my JP library!  As a recovering Catholic that also happens to be gay, John has again discussed God and faith that makes actual sense.  ‚ÄúThough Shall Not Be Horrible‚Äù. What a simple concept!"
"It is SO nice to read and follow a ""Christian"" author, speaker and person who actually UNDERSTANDS the gospel of Jesus Christ.  Got my copy today and have already started it - but the husband keeps taking it away from me (he thought it was a book about how to tell HIM not to be a  jerk - LOL)!  Seriously, for anyone who reads this book, you'll be surprised to learn how long-held beliefs mold our relationship with God and with other humans.  Don't be a jerk indeed.  God is Love.  Full stop.  Thanks, John, for reminding us over and over and over!"
"Once again John Pavlovitz shows through his writing that he has a deep understanding of human nature. He has been a beacon of hope and compassion for so many during the past 5 turbulent years and continues with his latest book. He always seems to put into words, so eloquently what we all are feeling. His insights and observations always make me feel that I am not alone in these troubled times. The title may be provocative, but the message is clear. Kindness and love, no matter your religious beliefs are what binds us together and will save us as a planet. Highly recommend read!"
"I've found so much comfort in John's words. It's as if he reads my conflicted heart and answers it with words of love and acceptance. If you have been troubled by the path our society has been going down for the past several years, John's words will help. I promise."
"I've been on a spiritual journey for over 40 years and this book is a beautiful bridge between those who know and walk a spiritual path and those who know that the path that Jesus actually taught and lived, one of love, seems vastly different in many instances from what passes for Christianity these days.  This is really rare, but I found that I liked every chapter even more than the one before, and they're all profound.  Love the work being done here, the hard and messy work of an authentic spiritual journey.  It's beautiful.  Pass it on."
"This book is for all people who see a mismatch between the Jesus of the Bible and the Jesus of the Church. Who feel like we have to qualify a statement of being a Christian with ‚Äúnot THAT kind of Christian, I promise!‚Äù John offers some hope, and the knowledge that you are not alone. Thank God."
I have been following John Pavlovitz for several years and heard him speak a couple of years ago. He‚Äôs a fabulous writer-open and honest about his faith journey and calling out hypocrisy. This book doesn‚Äôt disappoint. It‚Äôs fabulous.
"I'm a big fan of the author after following him on FB over the last couple of years. Even if you are a God non-believer this book still provides inspiration and a common sense approach on how to not be a jerk. It's all about LOVE, people! I give it a whole hearted recommendation."
"John Pavlovitz has been the voice that has articulated reason, hope, acceptance,and sanity so many times for me in the last few years in a world that seems to have lost all these things. I have shared his thoughts often with others because they express my ideas so well. Thank you John for your care with words and feelings and ideas. A gem."
Arrived yesterday and I cannot wait to read the whole thing. I follow John on Facebook since 2020 and have been very encouraged. I also got the kindle version.
"I love following John on social media. It's so comforting to know that there's someone that understand what real Christianity is, so many do not understand that. Their actions and thinking are often completely opposite. When I saw his illustration ""unboxing God"" I had to have it."
"I knew devout people were serving God as missionaries and ministers, priests and nuns, and people who wrote glorious prayers in the church section of newspapers (but not me).  I was just a young woman stumbling through life breaking the 10 Commandments as I went.  I believed in God and His Son Jesus, but I felt I had worn out my ""forgiveness"" pass.  It was hard to believe that God loved me.  Then I found John Pavlovitz's writing and have read his books.  This book is the best of his series and I believe that God speaks through John to give us the the same hope and peace that Jesus offered to the sinners of His day."
"The author puts words to thoughts many have had or at least felt for a long time.  He encourages the reader to examine and grow faith at a timely juncture in our culture. A great tool , and some laughs to help us live authenticity."
"Please be aware‚Ä¶.there are ‚Äútrolls‚Äù freely admitting they have not read this book, giving it a one star rating just to trash the author.  Read it for yourself.  Imagine yourself‚Ä¶imagine the world‚Ä¶living in such a fashion."
I love the message this author sends.  Treat others with kindness.  A great way to reaffirm the goodness of humanity at a time when there is such a lack of humanity.
"Too many people of ""faith"" have hijacked the message of what it means to be a follower of God, and twisted it into something unrecognizable. John endearingly steers that message back to it's  true meaning, how compassion towards fellow humans is the truest way to show your devotion. The world could use a few more like him. Well, a lot more!"
"This book caused me to think, to explore further my faith, and to recognize in myself some of the fallacies that I have hidden in the back of my mind. So much is said and taught about religion, Christianity, Jesus, and those terms have been wrongly used to justify so many hateful things, that we need to be reminded of the core of faith that improves us individually and collectively, and what love for others and for God really requires of us. Step back from all the issues and problems couched in today's news and explore what matters going forward in our faith and our humanity."
"He has elicited and expounded upon the very message that Jesus was sent to teach us.  It is written with humility and humor as all of us on this journey must admit to our failings when we fall short of this greatest commandment.  His criticism of Evangicals is very reminiscent of the publicans and Pharisees of the bible, which makes this book something that everyone should read!!!  I couldn't wait to get my copy and, though I question some of John's theological conclusions,  I was not disappointed!  I highly recommend ""If God is Love, Don't Be a Jerk"".  He makes the job of being a Christian attainable for anyone and reminds us of the words Jesus spoke:  ""My burdens are light""  when He invited us to come.  It promises to be a remarkable journey!"
"I absolutely loved this book and will be gifting copies to my girlfriends! In our current state with all the vitriol and faux Christians, This spoke volumes.. EVERY SINGLE WORD!Thank you John!!!"
"For years I have struggled to understand how Christians can hate and condemn people of color, or different cultures & religions, or people with sexual orientations different from their own. John clearly details how if we are Christians, we need to follow Christ's teachings of love and inclusion and it gives me hope that there are people who  do this."
"John Pavlovitz does an excellent job of pointing out the inconsistencies between what we as Christians say we believe and how we treat others. If Christians lived out the love Jesus commands us to, churches would be overflowing and the world would be a kinder, gentler place.  While I may not agree with every position of the author, there is so much that I do agree with.  The author speaks to many inconsistencies that have bothered me about those who profess the name of Jesus while showing disregard for the least of these.  I strongly recommend this book."
"This is the first book in years that I‚Äôve bought a second copy of. It made me break out my highlighter, which is rare! I started unboxing Christianity many years ago, though I only recently left my church home. John‚Äôs words truly speak to my heart as to several of the reasons I chose to leave. Our world would be a much better and kinder place if more people had a broader, more expansive view of Christianity that this author writes about. It‚Äôs a must read for everyone, though I‚Äôm unsure the ones who need to read it the most will."
"Still haven't finished this book yet but John's writings speak to the heart, invoke thought and spark conversations.  Truly a gift to this crazy world we are living in ... sharing his wisdom and inspiring us all to lead a life of kindness, decency and caring for humanity as we love our neighbors as ourselves."
"In this era where jerks abound, finding John Pavlovitz gives us hope. Raised in a fundamental upbringing where there were so many incongruent messages and being a jerk was common practice for those who professed to be Christ-like, I‚Äôve found John‚Äôs writing to be healing. Never undermine the power that a man of faith transparently admitting the errs of the religious over-culture and the need for us to call it out has on those of us who were confused kids hearing hateful messages from pulpits. Thank you John for shining a light on the hard conversations. His writing is sweet elixir and gives me faith. He‚Äôs the walking the walk kind of ‚Äúreligious‚Äù leader I wish I‚Äôd had in my life growing up and I‚Äôm so pleased to have found now."
"John Pavlovitz is that rare kind of writer who can make you want to do better without making you feel bad. His clarity and compassion are unrivaled in the blogosphere these days, and he comes down on the side of love and kindness for all, all the time. I'm a Buddhist, but grew up Christian, and I know enough of both to know that he teaches the pure truth of both Jesus and Buddha. Highly recommended, and would be a great gift for Christian friends and family who have strayed too far into the arms of rigid holier-than-thou fanaticism."
"""If perfect, fear-expelling love is real, this is what it looks like; a forgiveness more relentless than my failings.""This sentence keeps sounding through me, bringing a renewed hope to a soul battered in these ugly, difficult, divisive times.  We are all in desperate need of this relentless forgiveness, and I am grateful for it."
"Although I am only half way through this book, I am so grateful for these words and this author. Another seeker who has struggled this year put me on to this author. 2020-2021 has left me with dismay & disillusionment of the American Christian church. This book reassures me that my confusion could actually lead me closer to Jesus."
"Enjoyed this book every bit as much as I've enjoyed Pavlovitz's earlier books and his columns. If you're a social justice Christian, you will love seeing so much of your own views reflected in this book, perhaps even better explained than you could have explained them. Pavlovitz is a consummate communicator!!!"
"My copy just arrived!  I pre-ordered the book based on my love of John's previous two books and his thoughtful, inspiring blog posts.  I am Jewish clergy, but I love to share John's clear-eyed, insightful thoughts on life, death, and living a meaningful life with my congregation."
"Thank you John for putting MY thoughts in a book I can't wait to read again and share with others. Like you, it took awhile to realize I hadn't fully exhaled for some time because my box was constricting my God."
"I am not a student of theology, and at my age things assimilate slowly. However, this book hits me right between the eyes‚Ä¶ And helps me to quantify things I felt for the past 83 years. We may not agree on everything, but that‚Äôs just what John preaches! Thank you forgetting the gray matter active again!"
"First book in over a decade that made me grab my highlighter. Pavlovitz clearly articulates messages of love, kindness, and global humanity vs selfishness."
John's book seems to be speaking from my own heart.  I was raised a catholic and have always had questions about how Christianity shows up in people and especially over the last 6 years.  This book is clarifying for me and I hope it leads me to a better path and to be a more authentic Christian.
"I discovered John Pavlovitz and his writing on FB, and often was left saying, ‚ÄúWow, I wish I had written this. It‚Äôs exactly how I feel, I just could not have said it so beautifully.‚Äù His newest book does not disappoint. I continue to connect with his message, his understanding and perspective on religion, and his views on Christianity as love and how we live our religion, not how we preach it! His writing is spot on and alive with an authentic voice. I will keep this book close at hand for review and revisits."
"You speak my language, John. These past five years of fake hate ""Christianity"" has taken its toll, I definitely outgrew my ""God box"" and my faith in humanity plummeted, tho not lost completely. Your book has shown a spark of renewal and understanding. As well as ""whiplash"" from agreement nodding, LOLThis book should be required reading for everyone,  all faiths, religion, etc.  Thank you John and blessings to all."
"I love the authors authentic story telling style that helps bring deeper meaning to my Christian faith. I‚Äôve always wanted a deeper, more personal relationship with Jesus and this book helped me to cross that bridge."
"I've followed Pavlovitz's blog/writings for a while now. He inspires and challenges us to look honestly and simply at our beliefs. This book is a straightforward, deceptively easy read that takes not prisoners when it comes to refuting those who would pervert the simple purity of Jesus' teaching - that love really is everything. And anything done, taught, or thought out side of love and unconditional, radical acceptance is not Christian."
"Wonderful! Love, the greatest commandment."
"Organized religion can ruin one's faith. Unfortunately, Evangelical Christians have used the bible as a tool of hate and manipulation, not as a book of love and acceptance. Thank you John for confirming what I always knew in my heart, but was afraid to believe."
"An uncomfortable but necessary book for those who think God‚Äôs love manifests only in money and entitlement, a funny, heartwarming, validating book for everyone else. Once you read the story of ‚ÄúUnintentional Spandecide caused by reckless arrogance,‚Äù you‚Äôll know you have to keep going‚Ä¶üòÇüôèüèº"
"John‚Äôs latest book caps the way forward to a hopeful future. Read this important book to get clear on what can be here to stay - love in all its beautiful and active workings and why being a better human is more compelling than being anything else in this world that needs kindness, ferocious faith, and the uplift of simply doing better! We can benchmark humanity‚Äôs movement forward with this book that takes a stand for what can be."
"This book not only helped me understand I am not alone in my thinking, but it also got me to thinking of ways I could do better in my own life. In the era we are in, we should all be willing to show more love to ALL people, not just the ones who look like us or the ones who are easy to love."
"It's rare for me to find a person, in this case a writer with a powerful voice, who speaks what's deep within my heart. The words I'm not able or allowed to say in situations are the ones that he manages to resurrect from the depths of me time and time again. Please read this book, follow him on social media, read his blog, engage with him on matters you don't understand. He's humble, honest, wise, and prophetic. John Pavlovitz is in touch with what it means to be a Christ-follower. I'm a big fan of someone who exemplifies this with their whole life."
I very practical approach to finding how to live your faith in a challenging world.
John Pavlovitz speaks with searing clarity to the great divide between religion commandeered for specific goals and the essence of spirituality. There‚Äôs a reason why people are identifying less with church and more with the spiritual bottom line: LOVE. I am clergy and he speaks my thoughts and heart. I found myself sighing with relief at being heard. He is an important voice.
"When a man can give a self acclaimed atheist hope, you know he's on target. He writes with great thought and eloquence, which as a wannabe writer myself impresses me. He cuts through all the nonsense of organized religion and gets to the real meaning of faith. And that is, if your faith isn't expressing love for your fellow human being, then you need to get a new religion."
"John Pavlovitz is a true minister of the Gospel. He is not out for your money. He doesn't make promises, nor does he want you to live in fear.  He wants to lead us to a better society through actively following God."
"‚ÄúMost of us are not looking for an existential crisis-but let‚Äôs be willing to have one‚Äù. John Pavlovitz. His new book is out and it does not disappoint!  Run, don‚Äôt walk, to buy it now!"
"Such a great read in this day and age of those professing to be Christians not  walking what they are talking. Thanks John for an inspiring, soul uplifting book. If you truly love God all‚Ä¶. Then don‚Äôt be a jerk, Jesus wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ ‚ù§Ô∏è‚òÆÔ∏è"
"I have been following John Pavlovitz for a few years now. I have been reading his essays and have always found him to be inspirational. He helps me feel up, when I am down. He is full of heart and love and it shows in his writing."
"I'm not a Christian but follow John Pavlovitz via email and on Facebook.  In this book as with all his writings, John speaks from his heart with humor, with straightforward common sense, and, most of all, with love."
"Only halfway through John's book but completely captivated over his ability to express his convictions and ponderings, with direct connection to my very soul, especially with the clarity that 2020 continues to provide about church and Christian behavior. Eternally grateful for him, one of the wisest people that I ""share life with""."
This author regularly and succinctly speaks back to the dark authority vindicative religious right that walks with a heavy boot on the back of society‚Äôs neck. Yet he still believes in God. Amazing
"John Pavlovitz If God Is Love Don‚Äôt Be a Jerk is magnificent!  Deceptively deep in its easily, appealingly readable text, it is thoroughly researched and aptly annotated.  The text weaves scripture into the lively written discourse of the book while listing impactful citations in the end notes; I‚Äôm annotating my Bible with finer insights.  What I dared voice by myself in shared Bible study is affirmed within and throughout this profound book.  Yet, it draws me to further expand my sense of and relationship with God, Who is Love.  Thank you!"
"For most of my life, I was a typical evangelical Christian. A little less than a decade ago, I started thinking more independently about what true spirituality is really about and what God really expects of us. The more I read and studied and contemplated, the more it affected my understanding and beliefs in what was required of a true follower of Christ.  It caused a change in my political affiliations, a change in my church association, and hopefully has made me a better human.  I started paying attention to John's tweets and participating in some of his Patreon virtual meetings and now am reading his book again a little more slowly and in depth this time around. I do not agree with all of his theology but the premises of his book is spot on."
This book is a must own/read. Written for the time we are experiencing by a thought provoking author. It may either solidify or challenge your spirituality‚Ä¶ it will certainly make you THINK‚Ä¶ at 81 years old‚Ä¶ I highly recommend this.. it‚Äôs a read for all ages!
"After reading the first two chapters--my thoughts were.....thank you Lord!  Finally someone has put into words what I have been feeling/experiencing for several years now.  John's writings are enlivening, liberating, causes one to soul search,  and absolutely a breath of fresh air for those of us striving to let God ""out of the box"" so to speak!  And.....I love the title!  We all have met people, and to be honest, have sometimes acted  the jerk!!  I look forward to many more books!!  God speed John and thank you....your work is a gift!!"
"A welcome book from one of the few public Christian figures that I believe is genuine and sincere. The fundamentals from the gospels is to love others, help others, and Pavlovitz embodies that in his postings and his writings, and no doubt, in his life."
I can‚Äôt understand how any Christian could disagree with any book based on this premise.
"Read this. Read this. Read this. This is the book all the so called ""Christians"" need to read and not just read it... Read it, comprehend it, and LEARN from it. I cannot recommend this enough."
"I just want to say thank you to the author for writing this book. It is well written and easy to read in small doses or in one sitting (which is what you'll want to do once you start!) I have been feeling much ""less than"" due to a chronic health diagnosis, and this book is helping me put life in perspective. ""As jacked up as the world is, we get to be the people who show up and remind it that goodness still inhabits this place, that loving human beings haven't called it a day..."".Buy the book. You won't regret it !"
"If you grew up like I did in a cookie cutter church - this book will confirm what you already new, but didn‚Äôt want to admit. John is a breath of fresh air. It‚Äôs a book you can‚Äôt put down"
"Speaks to the heart of our inner struggle.  What does it mean to be a good person?  How do we really love others?  Can we accept others that believe differently?  Thought provoking, compassionate and timely."
"John is highly skilled at helping us dig through faith traditions to find the truth and the love shared by Jesus Christ, defining and understanding Christianity for all of us."
"John Pavlovitz has done it again! He continues to put into words things that I think and feel. His writings continue to assure me that I'm not alone, and I'm not crazy. That white, American, evangelical ""Christians"" have all but forsaken their namesake as they bend over backwards to worship not a golden calf but an orange buffoon. Jesus gave us one job: Love ‚ù§ There's no wiggle room there."
"John has a wonderful way of looking at Christianity.  Open heart, open mind, and a philosophy of loving everyone -- just like it says in the Bible, especially the part in red letters."
"Half way through the book which arrived yesterday.  Pages are dog earred for future reference.  Passages are underlined. God is so much bigger than the boxes we try to put God in!  God is gendered, multicultural and global. God is love. If we follow God, we must love everyone,  even those we want to despise."
I absolutely love John‚Äôs work.  He absolutely nailed it with this book.  The emphasis on LOVE is spot on. I have yet to disagree with any of the impactful words he writes. ‚Äú If God is Love‚Ä¶‚Äù is a powerful statement of what is so desperately needed in the world.  Dry thought provoking. Everyone should read.
"This is the first time I've read one of John's books.  I was amazed at how deeply it made me think about my faith. Very impressed with the content and the questions it raised for me.  Here's a perfect example...""If I never professed my spiritual beliefs, what would they imagine those beliefs were?""Thank you"
Written by former pastor. Easy to see why he is a former pastor as he denies the value of prayer or the existence of hell. I threw the book away.
This author has distilled my faith journey into words.  Its such a relief to know there are others who realize that being kind is not a weakness. (oh and there is so much more).
We are reading this as a family. We discovered we had outgrown the stories of our youth and wanted to be a part of faith that aligns with our values of today.
"John speaks the truth that so many people don‚Äôt want to hear. Religion in all forms is about compassion, empathy, inclusion, becoming better humans and lifting up the unfortunate.  This book is a great reminder of that.  A wake up call for those with the courage to look in the mirror."
"I feel like John Pavlovitz had a window into my heart when he wrote this book. He touched on so many topics that i have strong thoughts about but that I would never be able to put into words. I enjoyed every page! After reading this book, my faith has been restored. Thank you, John Pavlovitz!"
"I‚Äôm only on chapter 5, The Dude Abides (didn‚Äôt want to speed read through this book). I laugh, say yep a lot, and wonder where this journey will take me? Hard to put this book down to ya know, cook, eat, sleep! üíïüíï"
John reminds us in this well-written text that God is love and we are called to love one another. I highly recommend this book!
If only all ministers spoke so clearly about what is right and what is wrong‚Ä¶ we‚Äôd be so much better off. Pavlovitz makes spirituality and Christianity safe to embrace and frees us to love the promise of God and the goodness love can bring to humanity.
"A profound, approachable thesis that can be summed up in statement that God is Love. Well-written, down to earth, irreverent, funny, and truthful. Highly recommend."
"I left organized religion years ago because of the hypocrisy I found within it, re-enforced over these most recent years of spewed hate from so many of those professing love of God. I identify with John and this book puts into words what is in my heart and soul."
"I have been awaiting this release. I ordered it in May and received it today. I have followed the author on his page and find his writing insightful, relevant and inspiring."
"John writes with his head and heart, challenging and inviting us to be better, and helping us see how to get there. The book is compelling in its authenticity, simplicity, clarity, and call for love to have ‚Äúthe last, loudest word.‚Äù"
"I like that John has given voice to everything I've been struggling with. And that he offers solutions, like examining ourselves and rooting out the parts of ourselves that contribute to the problem."
"In a society that acts like the Religious Right is the only representation of Christianity, I am so grateful to have found an author that 1) helps me feel like I‚Äôm not alone in my Christian thinking, 2) gives voice and words in such a way that I feel better equips to share The Message. JP is a gift to our country and our faith. God Bless."
"This little book is such a heartfelt plea for all of us to walk in the way of Jesus of Nazareth, and a cry of anguish that Christianity so often pulls us to walk a very different path. I underlined, starred, folded corners and stopped to think more than I have with any other book. Grateful."
What do the lessons from Jesus tell us about navigating today‚Äôs world?  Author gives us great advice to guide us back to civility
"For those of us who have outgrown a childish faith and who still believe in Jesus, this is a breath of fresh air.  As a pastor with over 50 years of experience,  I highly recommend this book to Christians and seekers who cannot tolerate mindless fundamentalism and nationalist religion."
"Another timely book from this spiritual wordsmith. I look forward to his postings; they always speak to me. When I hear him preach and read his writings, I don't feel so alone. Thank you! Get well soon."
"Reading this book made me feel like John Pavlovitz took exactly what I was feeling and wrote it down, albeit much more eloquently than I could have. I almost never use the highlight function on my Kindle, but with this book, I used it constantly because there were so many things that I knew I'd want to go back to later.This is a book to read again and again and again."
"This is a spot-on message to those of us who call ourselves Christians. We, especially, should be living out WWJD. Instead, Christianity today seems to be mired in self-proclaimed persecution, narrow-minded theology, and flat-out racism and misogyny. We must do better."
Excellent and honest. He presents a perspective of how religious institutions have resisted change and become more political and influential in our country.
A refreshing read in this day of christians who are not Jesus followers.
"John is digging into the soupy mess of organized religion and the box it can feel like some are trapped in. The big message is what all christians need to hear, love is love is love. Period."
Anyone who reads his blog will appreciate the opportinity to experience more of his powerful perspective on  Christianity that is relevant and spritually helpful.  He is provocative and challenging.  John offers a positive and helpful view of personal faith.  Hard to put the book down once you read the first page!  Thanks John!
"John strikes the core of what so many of us feel today. Whether you follow an organized religion or are disenfranchised , these words reflect all the emotions of living a faith filled life‚Äîwith love towards all."
I just finished reading John‚Äôs new book and thoroughly enjoyed it.  His honest writing helps provide clarity to the disturbing time we are living in. I plan to read the book a second time to make sure I did not miss anything.  Highly recommend!!
"This book is for all of us who are Christians but don‚Äôt recognize the scary type of Christianity that seems to be in our face all of the time these days. This is a book about the big, expansive love of Jesus and how we all can live out that life. This book is healing my soul. Thank you for writing this, John Pavlovitz!"
"I‚Äôm of the ‚Äúbigger table‚Äù inclusion perspective. But with COVID19 and politics, I find myself wanting to either be a jerk or respond to those I think are behaving like jerks. John Pavlovits made me reset my thoughts and analyze how I really want to behave."
"Never believe you know all the answers, never take for granted what you believe and why, give this book a chance it will redefine your own goals towards faith and what it is to you, not to someone else, but to you."
This books speaks of the issues facing the Christian church today. I have am thankful to find I am not alone in my concern for the role many Christian leaders have taken in politics and global issues. This book should be read by every Christian today.
"So pleasant to read a positive, well thought outBook!"
"A thoughtful, refreshing and wonderful message that the essence of Christianity is a love and compassion that embraces everyone. Provides enthusiastic encouragement for us to open to examining our lives and faith to be loving, not resentful."
Even as a 'non-believer' I find John Pavlovitz's thoughts comforting and insightful. The idea of people refraining from being jerks interests me.
"I couldn't wait for the hard copy, so I started reading it on Kindle, and I'm glad I did - the sooner this message gets out, the better!  John Pavlovitz is a master at making his message compelling, funny, tragic, and and inspiring at the same time.  A must-read for both the pessimist and the optimist.  I can't put this down."
I‚Äôm only on chapter 4 and I‚Äôm totally enjoying this book.
"This book tells us the TRUE story of faith, religion, beliefs and humankind.  What he says needs to be taken to heart both by those who agree and considered by those who disagree.  No one needs to be a jerk for any reason, it is as simple as that."
I‚Äôm still reading and it is just what I‚Äôve been wanting for the last several years.
The basics of Christianity applied to today's fraught American political atmosphere. Valuable and timely. Highly recommend it. Share it with your friends.
Good food for thought in this time of negativity.
"I love this book, it‚Äôs honest and refreshing to read a book that talks about Christianity in a way that makes you want to be a better human being.  I find myself highlighting passages that I want to remember. Excellent book for today‚Äôs Christians."
The book is absolutely wonderful.
"This book makes you think as you are reading it. The author, John Pavlovitz, is a passionate writer. It flows well and can be easily read."
Wow! Best book I have read in years! I devoured it! Buy it for yourself to read over and over and buy a copy or two for friends! They will love you for it!! Thank you John for putting my heart into words!! You are such an encouragement in a world gone haywire! üíï
"If you are looking for answers, this book will definitely help!"
I really enjoyed this book. Highly recommended.
"The author‚Äôs voice is one of vision and practicality, simultaneously.  Our current society is divided on so many issues, and this book offers practical suggestions on how to bridge the gaps and be decent human beings. I was reminded anew that God is all about love, and we need to be the same."
"Great book.  John is passionate about Jesus and takes an honest, no nonsense, truthful approach about how we should be living our lives and showing compassion to people in this crazy world.  Whether you go to church or are sick of church or are sick of the so-called evangelicals, John will tell you what we should be about in this life."
"What our world needs most is the understanding of Gods true character of love. God has attempted to reveal that love throughout the Bible, His Handywork and through others who truly know Him.  John is one of those people, as is evidenced in his work."
A powerful reminder of how the teaching of love is too often missing when discussing God
Not enough stars for this masterpiece of explaining christianity and Christianity. I‚Äôm going in for a second read this week. Read this - don‚Äôt be a jerk
Everyone needs to buy and read this book.
"Rarely does a book move me the way this one did. John has put into words what so many of us are feeling and trying to understand. The world needs more people like those who will read, appreciate, and relate to this book. An absolute, ""must read!"""
"Many people are losing their faith as Christianity has become a tool to cause divisiveness rather for connection. John encourages us to live a life as Jesus did.  Loving unconditionally, lifting those who are downtrodden, being a shepherd who enfolds and cares for creation and people...and yes, that includes those you call enemies."
"Great book by John Pavlovitz, bought an extra copy for a friend.  This book should be standard issue.  Thanks John P."
I‚Äôve been struggling with my faith and this book sums up how I feel!  John gets to the basic teaching of loving all human beings. I‚Äôve always felt religion makes it too complicated when all God wants us to do is love other people.
Forty years after an annulment at the hands of the Catholic Church I have still been dealing with the aftermath of that experience.  This book brought me closer to the God I truly worship and the person I want to be.
John Pavlovitz is authentic and this book is written with the same candor as his other writings. It comes from a place of compassion for all human beings. The author promotes a world in which those who claim Jesus live by his true teachings.
"John, thank you this thoughtful book that reminds us to make ourselves a light and be a reflection of the divine love within."
About half way done with the book and am enjoying it so much. Relatable to today's issues. Great read.
My 11 month old Lab absolutely tore into this book with everything he has‚Ä¶I think he liked it?
"It's here and it.is.amazing! I pre-ordered ""If GOD is Love, Don't Be A Jerk"" and it did not disappoint. Buy it, read it, live it!"
John comes thru again with honest reality that many of us need. In the world we live in now we all need to remember to love one another and get a dose of kindness and truth. Love all his books.
"Having a anxiously awaited this new book  from John Pavlovitz, I was not disappointed! I confess, I also ordered an additional copy as a gift.  John is right, Love IS Here!"
This will be a staple in my library forever
The way we treat our neighbors is the best way to gauge your walk with Jesus.Phenomenal book that I will be gifting at Christmas.
Best book I‚Äôve read in awhile and he said all the things I think and gave me more to think about myself within. Wonderful book. Highly recommend!
Very interesting and easy to read. It's much harder to stop.
"Whatever your religious or non-religious preferences may be,  this book will help you to think about how you view the world.  If given the chance, it might even cause you to really question some of those beliefs."
The title alone says what should be obvious whether your a believer or not. John says what many just think. It opens up an opportunity to at least have dialog. Being a jerk is a choice an often an excuse. We can do better!
John hits the basket from mid court again. A wonderful and much needed book.
Thank you John for yet another masterpiece in what being a Jesus-follower really should look like. Beyond grateful for your courage and sharing your heart.
John is an incredible writer who makes us all feel more inspired to do better and be better. I highly recommend this excellent book.
I am part way through the book and loving every word.
"While some of the text is specific to the times we live in, there's some timeless insight that I can apply going forward too.  I really enjoyed this read."
There is nothing to dislike about the book. It comes from the author‚Äôs heart and deep beliefs. I would recommend this book to everyone whether conservative or liberal as it gives food for thought
From the first page I felt relief knowing that I was not alone in my way of thinking today. I ordered four more books to share with close family and friends who I feel will have similar thoughts and feelings. Thank you!!!
I‚Äôm currently on chapter three. Taking my time to absorb this well written work.
I am so grateful for his courage to speak the truth. He is so honest. I have bought 4 copies of this book to share with family; I have never done that with a book before.
"This book is absolutely amazing.  If you are going through a faith crisis, this book is a must read."
"You can‚Äôt read it without searching your heart on where you stand and what needs to change to live in a more loving, caring, and accepting world. Equality is for ALL."
Comforting wisdom
I like John's ability to tell the story about what is happening in the US at this time. John's focus on loving your neighbor is such an important message at this time.
John Pavlovitz is one of my favorite inspirational writers. This latest book is very encouraging.
I got it today and have read two chapters already. I can certainly identify with what he is saying so far. I can‚Äôt wait to read more tonight.
"Pavlovitz‚Äôs writings are a source of support in helping us know we are not crazy, even though our world is. And that our faith witness still matters!"
Most of which I agree with. John Pavlovitz is an amazing author who makes it so easy to read his words of encouragement & love.
A book that makes you think.
Caused me to reflect!  Gave me knowledge about understanding other people and their belief systems.  Excellent read!
This author says in words what many of us are just silently thinking. Love his candor.
This book is a great reminder that God is Love and Religion isn‚Äôt God.
I liked it all.  John has a great way of spreading the love God has for us and how we can return his love.
It helped me in my struggle with my spiritual faith vs my lost faith in the Christian churches of today.
Uplifting and offering hope for my children and grandchildren‚Äôs future.
I'm a long-time fan of the author...this is another of his thought provoking and inspiring works.
John Pavlovitz put into words thoughts I had long been trying to solidify.
His best book yet!
I‚Äôve followed him for years and read his other books. This one did not disappoint.
Fantastic and real.
Just started to read this book and already love it! It's a book hard to put down.
Easy to read and hard to put down.
Inspirational!  He speaks truths not catchphrase religious regurgetation.
Easy reading but thoughtful questions leading to self examination.
John Pavlovitz is a true example of what a Christian should be.
"I've read his other books and they are amazing, too!"
This tome stimulates this old Ozarker's mind.
"A wonderful book by a great guy who is not afraid to tell the truth about the phony "" Christians "" who do not follow the teaching of Jesus."
A wonderful read.
"In this turbulent time of those peddling hatred and evil while claiming Christianity, John‚Äôs clear eyed, conscientious message of love and hope, and the example of Jesus has reassured me of God‚Äôs love.  He makes sense of the nonsensical, with humor and dignity. So glad for this book."
"John Pavlovitz is a true Christian, who walks the walk and talks the talk. A kind and loving human with a devotion to Christ that shows at the center of all his love. John Pavlovitz speaks from his heart, showing us how to be better Christians and how to show love toward others as Jesus would. God bless John Pavlovitz and his love for others. I loved this book, found it to be highly enjoyable and very uplifting. I hope you will too."
"I have the Kindle copy. I discovered John Pavlovitz through a random Facebook search and am so glad I did. I then read several of his quick/easy read articles on his website.Chance would have it I discovered him right before he released this book.I‚Äôll say though I am not finished the book I was hooked from the introduction.I am not a big reader, not at all. However, I find Johns writing style to be so inviting, engaging and refreshing from other books or articles I have read.This book is reasonably priced. Give the free sample on kindle a try and Im certain you will go ahead and buy the remainder of the book.I plan on getting his older ones as well.Such an uplifting and inspirational author.Enjoy."
"This book feels like it was written by a 12 year old discovering decency for the first time. The author believes it‚Äôs groundbreaking, but it‚Äôs just basic, poorly written material. It‚Äôs probably because the author is just discovering the idea of compassion for the first time. A quick glance at his social media reveals he doesn‚Äôt understand compassion and has no business teaching others about not being a jerk. It‚Äôs shallow and poorly written. I recommend Crazy Love if your looking for something to teach you about not being a jerk by a much better author."
This author has restored my faith in humanity. Well worth the read and follow on social media!
I have other books by Rev. Billy Graham and added this to my collection.
I love this author. His words are always so wise and sometimes what you least expect from a preacher.  His commentary got me thru the election and the pandemic and I always quote him. I wish him nothing but the best in upcoming days.
"However, Pavlovitz's book is a refreshing reminder that the gloom in today's world that I'm seeing is not mine to own, and there's hope for those who want to retain traditional faith."
Sometimes the truth is hard. But he speaks it. Keep it up John.
He truly preaches Christian values. Highly recommended
I agree with every word!
I freely admit I bought this book and read it. I also freely admit I am an Army Chaplain with 30 years experience in and out of the military. I think it is important for everyone to know the kind of person John is. He is a person of deep faith and compassion and it shows in this book. He clearly shows that if we believe God is love them we must act with love. Old tropes like hate the son and love the sinner only show that those holding these views do not fully understand the meaning and power of the God of love. If more people would take up John‚Äôs call to love more fully the world would be a far better place.
"John Pavlovitz is a rare author who understands Christianity involves compassion and love of your neighbor no matter their race, gender, faith, or sexual orientation.  Thank you for your fearlessness."
Pavlovitz and his books have been one of the few voices of Jesus‚Äô love and compassion when much of what I‚Äôve seen recently as ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù is condemning and mean spirited. This book is basking in the love of Jesus!
"Looks like some of the reviewers didn‚Äôt bother to read the book, or missed the point-Thou Shalt Not Be Horrible.Following in the footsteps of his 2 previous soul enriching books, ‚ÄúA Bigger Table‚Äù, and ‚ÄúHope and other Superpowers‚Äù, John delivers a balm for our soul in these trying and divisive times yet again.In ‚ÄúIf God Is Love, Don't Be a Jerk‚Äù, John addresses the core ideas of our religion: the existence of hell, the utility of prayer, the way we treat LGBTQ people, the value of anger, and other doctrines to help all of us take a good, honest look at how the beliefs we hold can shape our relationships with God and our fellow humans.This book explores how we can embody this kinder kind of spirituality where we humbly examine our belief system to understand how it might compel us to act in less-than-loving ways toward others.This simple phrase, Thou Shalt Not Be Horrible, could help us practice what we preach by creating a world where love has the last word. Well worth the read.And ignore the horrible trolls üòè"
"If God is love, don‚Äôt be a jerk John Pavlovitz  Westminster John Knox PressAs I read this book, I imagined a conversation between the author and Rob Bell, the author of Love Wins.""Rob, I read your book and it really got me thinking. I was thinking I could write about the same topics, but I would make it clearer.""Rob responds, ‚ÄúMy book isn‚Äôt clear?‚ÄùJohn, ‚ÄúNot really, you dance around the topics of hell and salvation but when I finished reading, I wasn‚Äôt sure where you stood. Do you believe everybody goes to heaven or are you just questioning whether a God of love and a place of eternal judgment are compatible?‚ÄùRob challenges him, ‚ÄúIf you think you can do a better job, then have at it.‚ÄùJohn takes up the challenge and this book is the result.There is no hell. We are all good people. Most evangelicals are white republicans, and they don‚Äôt give a damn about anybody else. Also, the Bible would have been written differently if there were some women on the editorial board.Now, in case you get the impression that I didn‚Äôt get anything out of the book. That is not accurate.I think every Christian should read the first chapter, ‚ÄúYou had one job‚Äù. (Spoiler alert) We are to love God and love others. That preaches.As the author states at Kindle location 35 ‚Äú‚Ä¶I often envision an exasperated Jesus coming back, and the first words out of his mouth to his followers as his feet hit the pavement being, ‚ÄòYou had one job: Love. So, what happened‚Äô.‚Äù I wonder the same thing.I also wonder if lack of love was the impetus for the rest of the book. In other words, would the writer have fled orthodoxy if we all loved our neighbors as commanded?In calling us to love the author has given away too much ground, even questioning the authority of the very Scripture that gives the command to love.I agree that many of the messages that are preached and many that I have heard have not oozed love. I have heard it said that Jesus taught more about hell than heaven so we should preach more about hell than heaven. Just simple math. I would counter that with some other statistics‚ÄîJesus says more about finances than he does about hell so let‚Äôs hear more about our finances and stewardship thereof.But the solution is not to do away with hell.I agree with the author‚Äôs point that much that is heard from evangelicals demeans or, in some way, does not appreciate the gifts God has given women. However, suggesting this is because the Bible was written by men questions the inspiration of Scripture.Didn‚Äôt God oversee the writing?The author in another chapter makes a big deal that God is not male and at the same time writes of God‚Äôs feminine qualities. So, getting back to the point about the Bible authors foisting their male gender on the words of the Bible it occurred to me that, as the author states, the Hebrew word ‚Äúruach‚Äù (spirit) is feminine. That being the case can‚Äôt we say the feminine was represented on the Bible‚Äôs editorial board. If the Spirit didn‚Äôt like what was being written, if it were too male, the Spirit of God could have it removed.Besides the issue just raised Mr. Pavlovitz doesn‚Äôt clearly state that the Bible is not superintended or inspired by God but he does take a few digs at the authority of the Bible for today. For example, when speaking of Genesis 1-2 he questions whether this 4000 year old poem is clear enough for us today. If we throw out Gen 1-2 because the chapters are a poem, what can we get from the Psalms that Jesus quoted with authority?Two other things had me scratching my head, and he may just be exaggerating to make a point, but‚Ä¶. he states that ‚Äú81% of white evangelicals ended up passionately embracing both him (Donald Trump) and that message (Make America Great Again). As far as I know there no survey has measured the passion or the real reason so many evangelicals supported Trump.He also writes that the expression, ‚ÄúLove the sinner, hate the sin‚Äù was an invention of the Religious Right (location 1072), When did Augustine join the religious right?  It appears Augustine was one of the first to say something like that and I heard the expression long before Mr. Pavlovitz was born.It seemed to me that the author is less than humble in claiming he has heard all the arguments against what he has to say and don‚Äôt bother me with your concerns. However, when I got to Chapter 17 High Horses and Better Angels the author is clear that we need to hold our opinions without a sense of moral superiority. (Kindle location 2205). That reminds me of a quote from Anne Lamott (I think) ‚ÄúOur opinions may not be right, but we think they are, or we would change them.‚ÄùAs I read the book I kept asking if the message of the Bible, the good news, spoken in love, and not with the judgmental, hateful timbre often heard, would have kept the author within the boundaries of orthodoxy.In making a point about the lack of love Mr. Pavlovitz, by his own admission, has stepped over the rather expansive lines of orthodoxy.(Kindle location 508) So what basis does he have for, Love your neighbor as yourself?I hear what he is saying, and it should affect every message I preach, every word I say and every interaction I have. We have one job, Love.I received an ebook from Westminster John Knox Press though netgalley.com with the understanding I would read it and write a review."
I've been following John for some time now and am never disappointed by his insight and personal integrity when it comes to faith.  Too often the church majors in minors and minors in majors and loses the essence of what it means to be people of faith.  The wisdom offered here is timeless and can cut through the weeds that too easily entangle us on our Christian walk.  I bought two copies to have one to share.
"Pavlovitz reminds us of what we ought to do -in the best possible fashion ! We have been reading each of his thoughtful , profound ,insightful and humorous pieces on  life ,grief ,faith ,love and the search for faith and an authentic understanding of Jesus too - for nearly a decade . Though we haven't finished this book yet -we're thankful for it already ."
This is a refreshing book from a man who lives his faith without the hypocrisy that‚Äôs all too common of so many others who call themselves Christian. His is welcoming and empathetic to ‚Äúothers.‚Äù
"Despite what some of the trolls may say, this is a thought provoking book. John Pavlovitz nails the ""don't be a jerk"" concept. Some other reviewers need to hear that message most of all"
Some truths are hard for religious people to hear and this book is full of them. It‚Äôs a breath of fresh air to read it and feel like maybe everything isn‚Äôt entirely awful if there is someone out there that cares enough to write an amazing book like this. I will be giving it as Christmas gifts this year.
love this author.  he is a voice of reason.
A unique perspective.  Please read this work !
"I‚Äôm a fan of all of John‚Äôs books, but this may be my favorite. Solid writing from an accomplished author."
"The biggest issue with Evangelism, from my experiences from the pulpit, is sheer hypocrisy and hatred the Evangelical movement portrays.I've seen it happen around me, it happened in every church I was part of and whenever I preached against it, the ""board"" would have me removed.It's a sad state of affairs but today's Evangelical churches are spiritually identical to the Pharisees of the Gospels.Because Evangelicals are often the ones who stand on a soap box and doth protest too much, many non Christians assume Christianity is synonymous with racism, bigotry, arm chair ""vaccine research"", and the folks who voted a serial sex offender as President.However, I also partially blame mainstream and progressive Christianity as being too quiet while their ""crazy cousins "" wreck spiritual havoc.However, John, puts things into perspective with an actual point of view that centers around the greatest commandment Jesus ever taught. ""Love God and love your neighbor as yourself."""
John Pavlovits is a amazing man and amazing author. This book is top tier and worth the read.
He knocked another one out of the park. He is so relatable and always finds a way to put into words how many of us feel while maneuvering this crazy world.
"John Pavlovitz has written a powerful book that challenges the reader to really think about the conclusions we hold about the character of God. Our ability to be loving to ourselves and our neighbors is in many ways a product of these conclusions.""One set of answers will yield a hopeful, compassionate benevolence that continually moves us to welcome others in and to live with an openhanded generosity...and another is likely to construct a scalding, brimstone-laden judgmentalism that leaves us predisposed to exclude and prone to finger-wagging.""The author believes we should be compassionate and empathetic to our fellow human beings. We are all jerks at times...setting out to hurt another person and succeeding. We should ask ourselves, ""Am I trying to understand this person, or am I trying to defeat them?"" Understanding is a key element in love.We tend to see the world through the filters of our personal background, culture, and education. It is really difficult to be open-minded and understand the reasons for our preferences and prejudices. We live in our own little world and are mostly ignorant about how the rest of the world is living. This book encourages you to open your mind and your heart. It asks you to really SEE what is going on around you. Your religion is not what you believe, your religion is how you treat people.Mr. Pavlovitz comes down hard on traditional evangelical churches and challenges them to be ""The Church of Not Being Horrible."" We have ONE job: LOVE!FYI ~ I received a free digital copy of this book from NetGalley."
"I've added this book to a number of treasured sources, when I give up and need to realize that I am not alone. There is at least one powerful voice that I count upon to stand and speak beside me. That is the voice of John Pavlovitz."
"John Pavlovitz rarely pulls a punch, and he doesn‚Äôt disappoint in his latest missive to those of us who identify as spiritual or religious. The namesake of the Christian religion is extremely clear that the greatest commandments for its adherents are to ‚ÄúLove God and ‚ÄúLove others.‚Äù Why, then, do so many of his followers spew hate (or at a minimum, act like jerks).Pavlovitz explores how a fear-mongering faith often leads to fear-based disdain for those ‚Äúothers‚Äù who are ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù and how if you keep your God in a small ‚Äúrigid box,‚Äù don‚Äôt be shocked to end up with a ‚Äúrigid frozen faith.‚Äù  I wonder if the old hymn is still correct - that Christians will be known by their love? I wonder what response you‚Äôd get if you ask non-Christian folk whether or not  that statement were still true.  I‚Äôm betting some within the Church would be embarrassed and become defensive (or even ‚ÄúJerk-like‚Äù) by what they‚Äôd hear - which would only confirm society‚Äôs view of much of today‚Äôs Christian Church.‚ÄúEvery good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit‚Äù (Matthew 7:17).  Thank you, John, for continuing to bear good fruit."
"A loving, thoughtful look at what it should mean to be a Christian‚Ä¶I‚Äôm only a third of the way through and I‚Äôm laughing and also sorrowful for what our world could be‚Ä¶"
I have not read this book yet but I did just purchase it. I have been following John on social media for many months and I enjoy his writing very much.His message of love and hope is exactly what we need in these dark and troubled times. I anticipate this book with all my heart!
I enjoyed this book immensely! Very important in these socially challenging times!
"John Pavlovitz hit it out of the park with this book! It is thought provoking and very well written, and he tells it like it is. I HIGHLY recommend it. ‚ù§"
"Unlike the trolls that admit that they didn't read the book, I AM reading it (on KIndle) and it is full of REAL LIFE information for REAL LIFE Christians in today's world.  John speaks to the heart of believers about how to REALLY love each other and those around us and NOT be ""jerks""."
"I‚Äôve been reading Pavlovitz‚Äôs blog for several years. In today‚Äôs environment, where Christianity has been co-opted by the far right and made unrecognizable to those of us who actually believe in the teachings of the Bible, John is a breath of fresh air. He‚Äôs the kind of man I grew up thinking Christians should be. His writing is down-to-earth, but profound at the same time. He says things I think but don‚Äôt have the ability to put into words. I highly recommend this book if you‚Äôre concerned about the kind of Christianity found in the Bible."
Mr. Pavlovitz does it again. He captures what‚Äôs in our hearts and minds. Love is doing good and being kind.
John powerfully advocates for a more equitable and loving society and emphasizes that Christians shouldn‚Äôt oversimplify or cherry-pick from Scripture in order to justify beliefs. Absolutely would recommend this book to everyone. Love‚Ä¶
"Great book, very relevant for the issues we currently find ourselves surrounded by."
"The author is amazingly accurate in his assessments. I have heard him speak and he truly is speaking from the Christian perspective. You know, the one that follows Jesus, the one who believes what we do for the least of us we do to Him. Thank you, John."
"Pavlovich speaks truth unabashedly, yet with faith and love."
"John Pavlovitz, leads with humanity and love, first and foremost. He understands that loving our fellow people doesn‚Äôt mean passively accepting their hate, intolerance, and bigotry. He provides the frank discussions this claiming Christianity while actively making life painful for others need. Maybe especially if you‚Äôre NOT a Christian, and you‚Äôre confounded by conservative white evangelicals and their decidedly un-Christ-like beliefs, this books will be a balm."
John is such a great writer.  Love all of his work.
"True Christian values, deeply comforting messages."
"I became aware of Mr. Pavlovitz on twitter.  My terrible habit of doomscrolling would suddenly be interrupted by a moment of clarity or a drop of peace because his tweet was kind.  It was loving. It was decent.  And often it was funny.  His book is all those things.  If, like me, you often feel lost and repulsed by  this terribly dark time we are struggling through, a time where the light feels very dim and you almost cannot recognize humanity anymore‚Äîread this book.  It is very good for what ails us."
"When life gets complicated, it's important to remember the essentials.  God is love, and His greatest law for us is to love one another.  In these complicated times, John Pavlovitz's reminder of this essential rule is more important than ever.  His message is as good for our community as it is for our souls.  Everyone wins."
"Initially, it was the title of this book that caught my attention. But the content of the book kept it.‚ÄúI often envision an exasperated Jesus coming back, and the first words out of his mouth to his followers as his feet hit the pavement being 'You had one job: Love. So, what happened?'‚Äù‚Äì John PavlovitzIn a world where Christians can often be the ones acting the most unloving, this book is needed to remind us to do better.‚ÄúIf we were to reflect and have honest conversations with one another‚Äîand more importantly, with people outside our gatherings‚Äîwe‚Äôd likely find that the most serious wounds to the body of Christ have been self-inflicted. The Church is not fighting the rebellious, faithless, heathen world, as I‚Äôd always been taught, but itself. And as a result, I find myself in two fierce battles lately. I am simultaneously fighting both with and for my faith tradition.‚ÄùThe things we hear about the church‚Äôs reputation these days is troubling. Another quote from the book:‚ÄúSadly, the American Church has in many ways become the greatest argument for someone not becoming a Christian, for rejecting organized religion and never looking back.‚ÄùBut even as we fail to live up to the ideal image of Christ, can‚Äôt we at least not be jerks?It‚Äôs not easy, but I want to do this:‚ÄúLoving beyond our capabilities is almost always going to be inconvenient beforehand and beautiful afterward, rarely the other way around. . . . Nothing feels as good as when we show someone more decency than they may deserve, when we err on the side of loving them‚Äîeven if their response is less than appreciative.‚ÄùThis book encourages us to err on the side of loving more and judging less.Love is our one job. Let‚Äôs not screw it up.I highly recommend this book to help us.My thanks to NetGalley + Westminster John Knox Pressfor the review copy of this book."
"I've been a fan of John Pavlovitz's writing for a long time and always look forward to his articles, posts and books with great anticipation.  His words have helped me navigate the very difficult societal and political challenges we've faced since 2016. There have been many times his words have helped me move forward with life upon  discovering that family & friends I'd loved my whole life, were truly not the people I thought they were.  The realization that I am not alone and reading the honesty and clarity of his words on  society, religion, & politics helped put a healing balm on so many inflicted slights and wounds and be able to move forward."
"I enjoyed the privilege of an advance reader copy of If God is Love, Don't be a Jerk.  It is written in a very accessible, short paragraph style that encourages the reader to mull over and absorb the content.  The book lifted my spirits and put in to eloquent words some of my beliefs about being a disciple of Jesus."
"John's writings have been key to my sanity over the past several confusing and terrifying years. Anyone who questions his being truly Christian is obviously of the fundamental and exclusive mindset. I've experienced his work as a practical view of the ""Good News"" and an example of how to live it."
"I love reading John's books!  I had really lost my faith after 4 years of Trump and John helped me realize I can still be a Christian without be a part  of the corrupt, hateful, narrow minded evangelicals."
"So grateful for this author's eloquent reminder that the teachings of all the world's great spiritual leaders include the tenets of love, compassion and yes, tolerance. The house has plenty of space for many rooms, with rooms to rejoice in anyone's beliefs and rooms to be inclusive and rooms to share one's humanity without fear. Those who operate out of fear and righteous judgement may find a few lessons in here."
"John writes amazing, heartfelt books. I have loved his writing for a long time now and he has the heart of a true Christian. I am not even Christian myself and love his writing and respect him and his beliefs. His work always speaks to me and enhances my life. This book is wonderful and I love it!"
"Borrowed a friend's copy and read it in one day.  I just had to come and leave a review even though I didn't make my own purchase.  I will be getting my own copy, that's for sure!  John's intelligence and compassion come through, even through the sad/unpleasant parts."
John Pavlovitz explores how we can embody this kinder kind of spirituality where we humbly examine our belief system to understand how it might compel us to act in less-than-loving ways toward others.
"Another winner from the author who is as good of an author as he is a person. And if you know how fantastic John is, then you'll understand what a compliment that is. This book is another brilliant account and I'm so stoked to own it."
Everything he says I feel too. He is brave in telling his truth. Jesus would be proud
"I have been following John's blog since 2017, and he never ceases to amaze me with his ability to just say it like it is with straightforward, articulate but readily understandable insights. There's nothing complicated about being a good person, and trying to do the right thing if you follow God's lead. And you don't have to be a Christian to be able to appreciate John's plainspoken, from the heart, observations. An infinitely easy, and important read, for anyone who believes treating others well is what we are called to do in this life."
"I love this book!  John Pavlovitz leads the reader through imagining what our lives could be if we  could live our lives in a new, faith filled way.  His writing is thoughtful and on point.  This book is a game changer."
"I absolutely loved this book.  In his wonderful and down-to-earth way, John reminds us why we are here.  I was born a Catholic, raised a Catholic, and abandoned catholicism a long time ago.  I no longer follow any religion other than the two great commandments: Love God, and love your neighbor.  This book sets that out perfectly!  God Bless you, John!  Over and over and over again!"
"""If God is Love, Don't Be a Jerk"" by John Pavlovits  A good book to get you THINKING,,, IF you are brave enough to read this book from beginning to end.IF you care to stretch your boundaries and take another look at your congregation whether it be a church or just those you associate with socially.  This just might be a great book to read as a group and discuss the Chapters as you go.  There is a 'discussion guide' with starter questions for each chapter.  If you have a lively group, you will probably come up with plenty of points to discuss on your own. Note: book would have been better served without the political bias barbs. Being a member of a political party (or any group) does not mean blindly following all actions of party/group leaders.  Religion and Politics do NOT make good bed-fellows.  One thing I think is quite true of each of us‚Ä¶ we tend to gather together with those most like our selves.  Others who, mostly, have the same values on the things we think are most important.  Sadly, that is at the same time, what separates us as we judge those outside our group as needing to change and be like us.  Which wouldn't be so bad, except each group thinks they are the ONLY group that is attempting to live the 'Best/Right Way' (including this author??).  Happy Reading ! !NOTE: I received an ARC of this book from the publisher via NetGalleyThis review is my honest opinion.  Wish my church congregation would read this book."
"This book speaks to me. In this topsy turvy world we now live in, a voice of reason."
"‚Ä¶in the era of ‚Äúthe cruelty is the point‚Äù. If you‚Äôve felt dismay and despair over the lack of unity, compassion and decency and failed to find it in the church, this will give you hope."
"...they sadly are not running out of jerks. And too many of them profess to be following Jesus, who was all about love. Confused? Read this EXCELLENT book. It appeals to the entire spectrum of belief, as it should."
John and his message represents  what Christianity SHOULD be. Uplifting.
"I have always found the people who claim to be Christians so that they can hurt others offensive and ill informed. To have a minister take the time to honor a God of love and joy is refreshing. If we all treated each other well regardless of specific religion (or even lack of religion), the world would be a wonderful place."
We need authors like John Pavlovitz!I was very low after the 2016 election. John's words gave me hope and mademe realize I was not alone.
"John Pavlovitz delivers a long overdue reminder of what it means to be a Christian. John has provided words of comfort, compassion and strength to help many of us Christians navigate a chaotic and, at times, traumatic five years. John is an ever present light in the darkness and his words are a welcome calm amidst the storm."
"This book will make you think and change the way you interact with the world! The book discusses how God commanded us to love and how we are failing to live this commandment. The book gives real life examples of people professing their Christianity but not showing it in life. I connected with this book on a personal level and have many highlights throughout my copy. The author gives many examples of how to change the world that is around us. This is a must read book, especially if you‚Äôre struggling with your faith in the world we live in now."
This is the work of a man who has thought deeply about the essential message of Christianity and is encouraging us all to follow that message in our daily lives.
"John Pavlovitz is an antidote for our times, speaking loving truths that are essential for an authentic spiritual path."
"On pages 9 -11, I was introduced to hilarious John Pavlovitz! I've read and heard indications of his sharp and self-deprecating wit before, but this may be his best effort to date. His retelling of donning jeans of yesteryear and paying the price for that decision induced gales of laughter on a day I desperately needed comic relief‚Äîand had me wishing for the video! John uses his humor as effectively as he does his capacity to ""call it as he sees it"" throughout this gem of a book. I can already see that it will be a read/ponder/read-again investment and hope it will help me be a bit more courageous.I'm so grateful for John's gift of words, Stuff That Needs to Be Said (his blog), and each of his books. John's willingness to step into uncomfortable spaces and take us with him reminds us that this life is extraordinarily messy, especially in recent times. LOVE is the only answer and if we can choose love over all‚Äîminute by minute and day by day‚Äîit is far less likely that we will be jerks. I highly recommend this book and each of John's books for folks of any faith or none at all who desire to be kind humans."
What  wise and compassionate writer. Can't get enough.
"This book is about what the world actually needs. I am not a technical Christian, but I have read what Jesus actually wrote, and it is all about love and inclusivity and empathy and compassion. Sadly, many Christians identify themselves by judging, excluding and punishing. I think that is a big part of what is making our world more violent. This book is about what Christ authentically tried to teach. It's a joy to read!"
John is an amazing human being who has a profound understanding of the human spirit.  He was disgusted by DJT and saw him as the antichrist;  I have to agree. Amazing book.
"It‚Äôs a breath of fresh air these days finding a true Christian who walks the walk and talks the talk. Thank you, John for being the voice of true Christianity. This book Is just that, a true, open and honest voice"
This book gives me hope in humanity and actually helped me get closer to my faith. I love hearing from Christians who don't use Christianity to poo poo on others.
"John‚Äôs writing is thoughtful, honest and always timely. He is helpful for all those who are trying to learn about faith, whatever that means to you.  He is funny and worth the read."
A worthwhile read from a thoughtful perspective
It was though provoking and enjoyable
"Truly John has once more done an outstanding job! If you love God, or merely have heard about God, get this book!"
"Johns words have gotten me through this entire pandemic, and the past 5 years of chaos in america. He is a beautiful soul who just speaks to my heart and to so many others. he walks the walk, not just talk the talk.. he is the epitome of  what you want a man of faith to be."
I began following John Pavlovitz after being so disillusioned by the false media outlets and the horrible state our country was in and the division created by the last administration.  I use my own brain first and foremost but Mr. Pavlovitz was on the same page. He spoke of love and pointed out the false sheep.  This book does not whitewash.  You get warts and all and I can't begin to tell you how I appreciate that. People too often put their faith in men as opposed to God. God is love indeed.
"Perfect timing for a book like this! John puts into words what many of us, who feel a disconnect from the typical ‚Äú Americanized Christianity ‚Äú are feeling. This is truly an inspiring &thought provoking book that will leave you inspired, hopeful & not alone. This is a must read for everyone.A. Lerew"
"When you already know you're going to like a book, it's just that much more of a pleasure to click ""Buy now."" I've read the author's writings for a long time, and 3 pages in, I know this is going to be a really good read. Not always a read that's easy to accept, though -- John states his mind, and doesn't mince words as he gives counsel, like too many ministers do. Even so, he manages to inspire and comfort and occasionally make me laugh out loud. I've taken at least a few lessons from everything I've read from him, and I think other readers will too."
I read all his articles and books. He has been a wonderful voice against all these fake Christians who hate anyone that doesn't go to their church. I was raised like John.
This is a book for the ages. What would Jesus do? John knows and you should too. Jesus would likely be horrified by the tone and tenor of the conservative christian movement. Read this and fix yourself.
"John speaks TRUTH. Oh, that we could all live the title of this book."
"John is a voice crying out in the wilderness of this mess of Christianity that we have in America declaring, ‚ÄúBe the people of love that Jesus taught you to be!‚Äù He is an essential voice that we all need to be paying attention to right now."
"Whenever I‚Äôm losing faith in humankind I read John & my heart heals.He says the hard things that need to be said, the voice of truth that you hear inside you, but don‚Äôt hear enough people saying out loud these days.He hold us all accountable to LIVE demonstrably in LOVE, and not cloak ourselves in a facade of calling ourselves something, and acting completely antithetical to our faith‚Äôs truest principles.He is a true warrior for humanity, and we are lucky to have his work & his words at this most critical time."
I got my book about a week before the actual release date. I read it cover to cover in a matter of days. This book and John‚Äôs blog post have helped me feel less alone during this season where so much of the church is decidedly Republican. It helped me to sort through a lot of the issues that have bothered me about how the church is behaving at this time in history. It is also helpful to know that others share my concerns. John does such a good job in helping us all to remember that we need to be more loving. His other books are all great reads as well. I would highly recommend them all.
"Another amazing book from an outstanding author, activist, and all around great guy. This man writes what is in my head and this book is no exception! The haters can say what they want about John Pavlovitz, but his words have helped keep me sane these past 5+ years! He has a true heart for people and demonstrates what ‚ÄúLove thy neighbor ‚Äú really means. Get this book!"
"John Pavlovitz is perhaps the truest Christian I have ever had the pleasure to read. But even if you are not a person of faith, this book provides all the rationale for living the best, most compassionate, caring life possible. I highly recommend this and all of John's books and essays. His writing is accessible, reasonable, understandable, and oh so pertinent in today's negative and derogatory ""anti"" culture. Purchase this book; it will be a wonderful gift you give yourself."
I enjoy his writing.
"It tickles me to feel buoyant while reading a Christian pastor‚Äôs opinions. After all, I was raised an atheist. But during this era of political insanity, John Pavlovitz‚Äô thoughts, and his new book, ‚ÄúIf God is Love, Don‚Äôt Be a Jerk,‚Äù add to my spiritual raft.Pavlovitz remains poignantly relevant, thought this piece was completed after Biden won the presidency, but before the January 6th Insurrection. Specifically, he addresses whether we can truly love people who are invested in hatred. The question rings repeatedly as we watch political and religious pundits condemn everyone who doesn‚Äôt fit their narrow guidelines, who inspire violence while perpetuating falsehoods,.An ‚Äúundersized theology is usually revealed by those we seek to exclude, the people who draw our animosity‚Ä¶The implications of a Maker who made Everything that has been made are fairly knee-weakening‚Ä¶ When you meet another person‚Ä¶you are coming face-to-face with a once-in-history, never-to-be-expected reflection of the image of God‚Ä¶a Muslim, or a Jew or a Buddhist or a Sikh,‚Äù he suggests.Pavlovitz mentions a fellow lecturer who was heckled by right wing members of her audience. She invited them on stage for a hug, saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt agree with you, but I love you.‚Äù While he  doubts he could be as generous (me, too), he keeps looking for ways to apply Jesus‚Äô teaching to help him turn the other cheek.Here‚Äôs another portion of his answer. ‚ÄúIf perfect, fear-expelling love is real, this is what it looks like: a forgiveness more relentless than my failings.‚Äù  As in Pavlovitz‚Äô prior book, ‚ÄúA Bigger Table,‚Äù he perseveres in his desire to reach every heart, to remind us privilege and power aren‚Äôt necessary to feel safe ‚Ä¶that, in fact, these attributes contradict the gospel, which prefers reliance upon one‚Äôs God.Frankly, I‚Äôve been horrified by my anger levels at the prior administration, and am offered a new phrase, ‚Äúredemptive anger.‚Äù It‚Äôs useful fury which allows people to take constructive action on behalf of our views. He contrasts it with ‚Äúrighteous anger,‚Äù which too many of us have used to justify mean-spiritedness.Mostly, I love Pavlovitz because his observations capture my spirit by setting it free. ‚ÄúBeing human is hard. We weren‚Äôt prepared for it. None of us asked to be here‚Ä¶we never really have control over very much, despite sometimes imaging that we do. We come wired for all sorts of fears ‚Ä¶ with individual quirks that so easily derail our progress.‚ÄùIf, like me, you find your ‚Äúquirks‚Äù burdensome, maybe these words will lift some of the load. ‚ÄúRather than God‚Äôs plan, which is much too difficult to see from the street level, I look for God‚Äôs presence: for the compassion and mercy and love and goodness,‚Äù visible in the world today.If any of the quotes mentioned touch your heart, invest in some spiritual healing: ‚ÄúIf God Is Love, Don‚Äôt Be a Jerk,‚Äù for real."
"I have followed John for a while and love that he is the type of Christian I was raised to be - back in the day. Now, so many people pride themselves on hating others ‚Äî in the name of Christ. What the? When Christ is the opposite of everything they are doing! (Not exactly sure when all of this changed.) Christ healed the sick, fed the hungry, clothed the needy, loved thy neighbor, and he doesn‚Äôt hate ANYONE‚Ä¶ These ‚ÄúF your feelings‚Äù, ‚ÄúYour health isn‚Äôt more important than my freedom‚Äù people are NOT CHRISTIANS!!! Honestly, WHAT WOULD JESUS DO???"
"John gives me hope for Christianity. Why? Because he is a critical thinker and questions the dogma, not the spirituality. I plan on buying this book next month because what he writes daily resonates with my own recognition of spiritual Truth. And his words are poignant yet easy to grasp. So if you are questioning your beliefs or feel lost in what your church tells you to believe, follow John on social media and then buy this book."
"John Pavlovitz is the writer I look to as an antidote to the toxic ‚ÄúChristianity‚Äù seen all too often now in politics and society in general. I wish every supposed follower of Jesus would read his reminders of what it means to be a true Christian, or just a kind human."
John is clear and forthright. Thank you for speaking  out!!
"John explains in easy to understand terms the real basis for what people of faith are supposed to be about, simply caring for others. It isn't complicated we just need to get past our primitive survival instincts that make us lash out in fear against change. Our greed, competitive nature and fear of people and cultures that are different are natural primitive instincts. Too long religion has been used to divide us, it is time for that to change. This is a great starting point."
I really enjoyed this book. This is the best one so far!
"‚ÄúIf God is love and if Jesus is the perfect expression of that love and if I am supposedly trying to follow that Jesus‚Äîhow can I be so love-impaired so frequently? How do I miss the singular point so consistently?‚ÄùBeen  reading it tonight and, as everything he‚Äôs written, it‚Äôs on target, thought provoking, lucid, humorous and a true look at where Christianity is in our country. Not always pleasant or easy but true things said with honesty and‚Äî‚Äî love. Thank you to John Pavlovitz."
"After hearing only voices of hateful, judgemental, unchristian, morally bankrupt radical right-wing religious hypocrites for so long, it's a relief to finally hear a voice of reason, of love and acceptance, a voice (AND actions) that actually aligns with Christ's teachings. Dare I hope?"
Highly recommend!
"John is an incredible pastor and author. The principle of showing God‚Äôs love to others seems simple, but based on the world we live in, it‚Äôs apparent that it‚Äôs not. Glad to have this book as a reminder and resource."
Love the book title.  John tells us how to NOT be a jerk.
I've been following this author for sometime through social media.  He thoughtfully articulates his vision of a compassionate Christian life through thought word and deed.
"John has once again delivered a blistering treatise on our current dilemma in the American Evangelical movement. He is direct, loving, and hilarious. Oh and passionate."
"Loved this book‚Ä¶.though to be fair,I knew I would.  John is all about love and being real and true to what Jesus taught us.  This book is just more of that, written beautifully and perfect for the times."
"Mr. Pavlovitz provides a balm for our collective, troubled soul ‚Ä¶ and helps us see that there is a fairly simple life path that can lead us to healthier relationships, outlooks, and ways to relate to others. I  find his plain-spoken analyses helpful to change the way I look at my spiritual and secular lives ‚Ä¶ and I am grateful to him for every word. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Highly recommend this book!
"I only started reading John's Twitter and articles a few months ago.  I am the Auxiliary Chaplain of our local VFW Post, and his messages have really hit home. While I was raised Catholic, I do not practice anymore. I do, however, write a newsletter article every month as Chaplain.I lost my oldest son in 2017. Since that time I have been on a spiritual journey (with my son's help).Once I started reading John's Twitter articles, I began to have a very different outlook on things. They really made me think. I have used his articles as a basis for several of my Chaplain's messages. Please read John's book. You will begin to think about things you never did before, and I really believe it will make you a more tolerant and better person."
The best author of authentic Christian values.  How to hold on to hope in these dark times.
Wonderful! Just wonderful!
I love John‚Äôs writings and follow him on Instagram.  I love this book and hope everyone takes the time to read it.
This author is such a blessing to those who are struggling to find the Christians in the sea of ‚Äúreligion‚Äù. This book is an excellent reminder that TRUE followers of Jesus are out there and willing to speak what is right!
"If all Christians were like John Pavlovitz, the world would be a much better place. His writing preaches love toward others, with no reservations with an almost painful honesty."
"This guy is how an actual Christian should act. He isn‚Äôt a modern fake xtian like many are today, like a certain red hat wearing crowd. The book is insightful and worth every second it takes to read."
"John Pavlovitz nails what Christianity should be about.  Well written, engaging, convincing."
Great read
Always full of valuable insights
"I have enjoyed ALL of John's books.  He is an excellent writer.  He has the courage to ""say things that need to be said"" AND while he is a Christian pastor and I feel he writes from a Christ-like perspective that encompasses ""love your neighbor as yourself"" he seems to truly speak the ""greatest of these is love"" message that I believe the Christ would want us all to speak and live.  Thank you John for once again ""saying things that need to be said"" that will help me be a ""better human."""
"Wonderful book with a point of view I find so helpful. I grew up in the church where we loved and honored everyone, supported workers, helped our neighbors. He reminds us that the hijacking of the church for extreme right wing politics is a travesty and must be challenged by people of faith."
"John Pavlovtiz is saying what needs to be said. This treasure of a book, shows us love and compassion is what God is about.Inclusive love is what our faith journey should be about and John puts that on full blast.No matter your faith tradition, even if you don't hold to any particular one, this book will share there is hope to be had in these challenging times.Your hearts will be full reading this and all John's writings."
Pavlovitz remains a much needed progressive voice in American Christianity. His writings are a challenge to the Prosperity Gospel and white supremacy that dominate much of American Evangelical Christian. His writing resonates with exvangelicals and those who understand following Jesus to mean doing what Jesus said we should actually do.
Thank you for giving us hope
Thoroughly enjoyed the book.
I did not purchase this book from Amazon but highly recommend the read.
"I‚Äôve followed John since 2009. He‚Äôs One of the most authentic believers that I know. He lives what he believes and this book expresses that in detail.  If all professing Christians would take a step back and look at themselves Through the lens  of this book, It would do much to heal our families and our nation."
"If anyone should write this book it's John Pavlovitz. Smart, intelligent, and on point. Love is love, it's all there is."
Pavlovitz's uncommon brand of spirituality speaks to both people of faith and others.  His insights are lucid and compelling.
"Haven‚Äôt read it yet, but cannot wait!"
"I am not a religious person per se, but was drawn to Pavlovitz‚Äôs writing during the Trump years.  I bought my first ever ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù book ‚ÄúA Bigger Table‚Äù, and loved it.  Whether you are an observant Christian, or not, his message of love and inclusion is inspiring.  He writes with a no-nonsense style, is not patronizing, and encourages us to look at our own behaviors and beliefs with a critical eye.  A worthwhile read."
"Great Author and thinker.  This book will get the Trump Cult all sorts of butt hurt, because he is honest, and they are nothing but hypocritical pieces of trash.  So, as long as your not a piece of trash, you will probably enjoy this book."
üëè
"Highly recommended. How to make sure that love has the last, loudest word in our interactions with our fellow humans."
"In response to those who think John is a hypocrite and not a Christian‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.there is only one requirement for being a Christian and if you profess to that, the natural response is to love your fellow man.  John writes about this.  It‚Äôs as simple as that.  He‚Äôs easy to read and presents a Christian way to live your life.  Bravo!"
"Not just for Christians. If you are human, it's a necessary read."
I just love how John demonstrates what real Christianity (should) look like.
A book all who claim to be Christians should read and take to heart.
Kudos to Mr. Pavlovitz for a well written perspective during these very difficult times.
John has once again captured the true spirit of the love that this world needs so much. His words speak to his readers on a very relatable level and he truly inspires! Definitely a worthwhile read!
I loved it! John Pavlovitz is probably the only Pastor I follow these days.
Great book for everything that is going on right now!!
I love anything this man writes!
"If you only have room for one book this year that helps you find your way in our ever more increasingly divisive world, this is the one. John Pavlovitz captures how to get back with your better self and connect with others no matter their religion or color. We can all build bridges instead of walls."
I just got this yesterday and haven't finished it yet.  But so far I think it's one of his best.
I like the way John speaks his truth.  He has compassion and bravely says stuff that needs to be said despite the haters.
John challengers us.  I can't wait to read his latest book.  The others have all become important parts of my library.
Spot on!
"This is a beautifully written book about what it means to be a thoughtful, loving, passionate believer in a Christ who loves us abundantly!"
"John teaches us how to walk the walk vs just talking the talk.  Our good deeds for others are what make us truly Christ-like.  He is progressive in his thoughts, faithful in his beliefs and a has a strong moral compass for which we could all learn to follow.  Phenomenal book!"
Can't wait to read this from my library!
"John is a brilliant writer who definitely hits the mark! He is a true disciple of Christ. Thank you foe standing up for truth, John."
"I wish I could write ,or even talk like John writes . A wonderful book"
"This is what every person around the world needs to read! We are all one human race, and love should be our religion!"
John is amazing.  Don't listen to the haters.This man is a true Christ follower. A teacher of the first degree.
I love everything he writes. He often puts my thoughts into words.
"Thank you, John for saying what so many of us feel."
Loved this book. John is a wonderful Christian. The kind of minister we need more of today.
"I was already a fan, but now even more so."
This book will make you think. And we all need to do more of that.
I love John's writing and I couldn't wait to buy his book.
Thought provoking and beautifully written. A must read!
I really enjoyed this life affirming book.
I love this book.
An important read
Loved this book
john got me through the pandemic and the trump years - he is a healer - and a great writer
If only American christians would be more christ like.
"Mr. Pavlovitz restores my faith that there are still true Christians and Christian pastors out there amongst the hypocrites. His words ring true and I was inspired to read his book after connecting with his blog posts. This is with a read and may change your heart or give you hope, too."
"The spot-on BS detector for the current state of US Evangelical Christianity. This is irrefutable, relevant, and centering. Outstanding."
A very well written book that helps answer lifelong questions !! You come to understand that God is truly a loving God.  I am forever changed !!
"Christians get a bad rap these days‚Äîthe loudest, meanest, and most militant seem to predominate. I was born into a devout Roman Catholic family, rejected its patriarchy, and searched for a faith that I could follow.  Years of searching led me back to Christianity, and John Pavlovitz‚Äôs book explains with kindness, intelligence, and good humor how to find a faith that works to the good of everyone. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a faith to follow."
"John helped me remember what the primary tenant of Christianity must be, that God is love and we should love our neighbor as ourselves.  Indeed, this is an important message for believers of all faiths.  I really appreciated how he explored how many have gotten off track while still offering hope that we can find a faith that will make us better humans.  I highly recommend this book."
"God bless you, John for writing this book.  It is a message that is so needed by this horribly troubled world."
"Highly readable, well written and a direct reminder of the importance of the two most important commandments: love God and love others.It is in an American context, but the lessons are universal."
""
"I first started reading John Pavlovitz when I was first coming out (literally) as a pastor/chaplain from a conservative, evangelical denomination.  John's posts were a comfort to my broken soul and it often felt like he was the lone, prophetic voice - calling out truth to such a dark and demonic culture of hate towards queer folk (in particular).  This book is a culmination of John's teaching about the essence of what the Gospel and indeed, faith, should be about.  I highly recommend this book - especially for those who are trying to make sense of an evangelical world that has been overtaken by politics of hate.  In his book, John presents a model of the Gospel that actually capitalizes on the very essence of the Christian faith: to love.  Pure and simple - and yet the message seems to be lost in today's evangelical church.  I am so grateful to John Pavolvitz for reminding us all in his writing that the message of love is simple, but working it out in our broken world is going to take a lot of effort and courage.  Highly recommend this book and check out John's blog as well.  His voice is so needed in our world today."
"This book grabbed my attention from the introduction onward. I may not agree 100% with everything written byJohn, however it served to force me outside my normal thinking perimeters. It is very easy to settle into a comfortable orthodoxy and feel assured that we are aligned with the teaching of Jesus. This book reminded me of the need to ‚Äòopen our eyes‚Äô, to think outside the box and to seek forgiveness for not seeing people in a manner as Jesus himself would."
"I have read a number of John‚Äôs previous books but this is the best by far. I love his direct style of communication that comes from the heart. If indeed God is love, then why are so many of his followers acting like jerks? This book helps to explain why this is so and outlines a way to more resemble Jesus. It clearly speaks to the toxic culture of present day evangelicals in the USA and how that brand of religion has aligned itself with the flawed MAGA cult of the GOP. It is a book of hope for it is firmly planted on the bedrock of Jesus, the one who spent time with the publicans and prostitutes of his day.  John makes it quite clear that he way you treat others is an intimate expression of how you treat God. In other words, whatever is your declared theology your actions clearly reveal what you truly believe. So do you want to be a jerk or an agent for goodwill to all people. Choose wisely."
For everyone who thought about buying this book but haven't ordered it yet....Please order it.  This man has such an amazing insight into things.  You will not be disappointed.
This book should be read by all followers of Jesus and those who claim to love God.
"Insightful, entertaining but also serious as hell: Thou shalt not be horrible.  A core text for churches and schools."
Well written and so insightful .
This is definitely the most difficult book ever read! The reason is it was so hard to read through the tears. Dane Ortlund really gets across what the heart of Christ is truly like. We have such a poor understanding of the nature of Jesus love for us and this book did such a great job in presenting that. I have been looking for a book like this for a long long time and I‚Äôm grateful that I found it. May God bless this author !
"Personally, this book has moved into my top 3 favorite books of all time. Years ago, I read The Heart of Christ by Thomas Goodwin. That book has been my favorite ever since. Ortlund‚Äôs Gentle and Lowly makes Goodwin far more accessible. Drawing on some of the most beautiful biblical texts that reveal the heart of Christ, Dane Ortlund writes in a way to help the reader be sure of Christ‚Äôs heart for them. Whether it‚Äôs through Christ‚Äôs present intercession for us, him being an advocate for us, or him loving us until the very end, this book will jumpstart the dead heart as the fountain of God‚Äôs love pours grace on to you from the heart of Christ himself. I bought this book for all the leaders in my church so they could be refreshed and be refreshing to others. Get this book."
"Must buy. Must read. Hard to imagine that any Christian wouldn‚Äôt be benefitted by this work. Christ is seen so clearly and majestically in Ortlund‚Äôs work. I have already bought 6 copies to give out and have sent the link out numerous times. It‚Äôs is theologically robust and clearly in-tune with historical theology. It is also model exposition at times as well. All of this is awesome because I feel confident giving this to an aged saint or an inquisitive unbelieving high schooler. Very few books today have been written like this. You have to go back years to find something like this. This is the second book that I‚Äôve read from Ortlund and he has greatly impacted me with both books. This one though is pure gold. It‚Äôs something that I‚Äôm turning into a sermon series as well! This is Christology at its best and at its warmest. We need this book during this time. This is a top 5 book for me. I don‚Äôt say that lightly. Dane, thank you!"
"I bought this book on the recommendation of my best friend.  I am so grateful to have done so.  It is a profound little book that is packed with glorious truths about the heart of Christ toward all who are His.  It is a rare teaching, to say the least, as so many times these days there is much teaching that leans toward legalism and chastisement and warning; and rules;  and on the other side of the aisle, there is a lot of teaching that is totally not Biblical (i.e. much of the Charismatic teachings that make God our Santa Clause).  For one who grew up in a very abusive environment, and never feeling I will ever be good enough in many circles, the truths in this book have touched me more deeply than any other book I have ever read in my life, other than the Bible, itself.  Dane Ortlund has a true gift of being able to make his point in ways that deeply touch the heart.  This is a book I will read over and over.  I have read it very slowly to be able to think about and absorb the truths more deeply.  I pray that everyone who does not know the Jesus that Dane Ortlund speaks of in this book is able to get a copy of it and that it is as healing for them as it has been for me.  It is one I want to stay on for some time.  It is literally life-changing.  I have come to a place of understanding there is absolutely nothing I can do about my sin, as I am born a sinful creature, and that will never change this side of eternity.  That is not to say that God is not doing a major work of sanctification in my life that will continue till I see Him face to face.  But it means that He has such incredible sympathy for us in our fallen condition.  It is the most humbling book I have ever read.  It has done far more in moving me to pursue holiness than all the teachings and warnings I have heard from the pulpit all the years of my Christian walk.  It causes me to want more and more of Jesus and our Father, rather than driving a wedge of condemnation between me and Him."
"Honestly, this book is in the top 5 books I‚Äôve ever read. Not only is it well written, but the research and interaction with source material is excellent given the finitude of works on this facet of the person of Jesus.The strength of this book is not in the writing, research, beautiful cover however‚Äîthe strength is in Ortlund‚Äôs muse. Jesus, the gentle and lowly Savior, is seen in a new light and it‚Äôs in this light cast by Ortlund that Jesus is seen as the Great Savior he is.I could go on, but I can‚Äôt recommend this book high enough if you want to discover a Jesus you‚Äôve heard about but maybe never knew. You will meet him in these pages.I will never read the gospels the same."
"Through the timeless influence of Puritans such as Goodwin, Bunyan, and Edwards, Dane Ortlund has written a treasure for readers on the heart of the Savior toward sinners. Steadfast in Scripture, these pages discuss not only what Christ has done but also what He is currently doing. Saved, justified, and yet Christ also intercedes (presently, now!) as part of His personal rescue.Each chapter starts with a key passage that reflects the essence of Jesus‚Äôs character and being, highlighting the heart as the ‚Äúcenter of who we are.‚Äù Scripture describes Him as the epitome of humility. One of my favorite sections was chapter 7, ‚ÄúWhat Our Sins Evoke,‚Äù which unpacks how Jesus draws near with love when we fall short. ‚ÄúHe sides with you against your sin, not against you because of your sin.‚Äù It can be easy to think He is done with us or will one day grow tired of waiting for us to get it together. Instead, He is...Gentle. Lowly.These are the qualities that our Savior possesses. These make up His most natural posture. He is accessible, welcoming, gracious, drawn to sinners and sufferers. Beautifully written...Get this book to lift your spirit and know more fully the heart of the Lord then, now, and to the end of the age (Matthew 28:20)."
"Dane Ortlund leaning heavily upon the Puritans and great Theologians of history, such as Bunyan, Edwards, Flavel, Goodwin, Sibbes, and Warfield, has done an excellent job in increasing our appetite to read their works ourselves. He often comments on or paraphrases their quotes drawing out one or two great points, but fails to mention the others. And at times he lacks the clarity and completeness demonstrated by the Puritans, which could present an imbalanced view of Christ and or the Trinity. Although what was presented is immensely comforting, especially being reminded of the grace, mercy and patience of God when we sin, but the imbalance can lead one into antinomianism, and at times he contradicts or at a minimum creates confusions around some of the perfections of God.It would serve us well to read these older authors ourselves and the Scripture ourselves and write down our own meditations and learning points..."
"If you are struggling to believe God loves you in spite of your sin and failures, this book is for you. And even if that isn‚Äôt a struggle you have, if you want to know more about the incredible, invincible love of God, this is wonderful book. Bathed in Scripture. One idea from the book...we know what Jesus has done for us...but, who is He? If we are wanting relationship with Jesus, one He died for us to have, we must go beyond knowing and understanding and believing what He did and into who He is. This book is a precious beginning and or deepening into that journey. You will be encouraged!"
"Our church small group has been using this book for the past month.  The gentle, compassionate heart of Christ is compelling and the author does well to present that.  However, a stumbling block occurred in chapter five page 56 with the sentence:  The text tells us: ""since he himself is beset with weakness.""  Hebrews 5:1-3 is clearly speaking about human high priests and not Jesus.  The author went on to use this misreading as the main point of chapter five.  Unfortunately, the result is that extra care is needed to make sure there is not an over-stretch in interpretation elsewhere."
"This was not what I was expecting from the read.  The reviews for this book are so positive but I have to say this is a book that if you truly read it, it is going to take forever!!!!!!!  Almost every paragraph In the book has Bible references to look up. Unless your have these verses memorized and I highly doubt the majority of us do.  This book is also written with more difficult verbiage than is necessary.  I love Christ and love his message and wanted the book to be like engulfing myself in a big hug during this crappy year. Instead I feel like I‚Äôm reading a school assignment that is more of chore."
"This has easily been one of the most impactful books I have ever read. I have long known about the legal aspects of the Gospel - that I am saved by grace and justified by faith in Christ alone. I have long known Romans 8:1 says ""There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus"". But I have never taken the time to truly meditate on the heart of God towards redeemed sinners like me. Gentle and Lowly does such an incredible job of helping the reader fix his or her eyes on who God is and what He is like towards His people. I've come to discover in a fresh way that Jesus' first impulse is not to push me away when I sin. Rather, my sin draws out His compassion. That is a game changing truth.Please read this book. It will encourage your soul tremendously!"
"First of all, I am in the minority of reviewers as most really enjoy this book.  Second, let me be clear that I don't find the author to have been unbiblical (for the most part) and the overall covering of the topic is fairly accurate of sound doctrine.With that being said, I did not enjoy this book at all. The overall somber tone of the book and very flowery language made the topic drull and boring.  The prose made my internal reading voice read it in a slow and whispery manner.  A lot of the book has quotes by authors that it seems like it would be better if I were to read those books.  The number of quotes and direct attribution from other authors like John Bunyan and especially Thomas Goodwin makes major parts of the book superfluous.There is some good coverage of the topic and would be beneficial for new Christians.  There is also a little bit of the balance of love and correction.  However, there are times when Ortlund takes it too far.  He talks about correction being something that pains God and that it's unnatural for Him to do.  Again, I don't attribute this as ""blasphemous"" to the author but the flowery nature of the writing tends to dip into these types of incorrect views.  There are many chapters that didn't have much of a point of being there and the coverage and length would put them as subheadings with the quickness they were covered.I did not enjoy this book and if you did that is ok.  I enjoy a good kick to the heart in my reading from time to time.  However; the flowery prose, the abbreviated coverage of the topic, and the direct quotes enmass by other authors did not do justice to the topic.Final Grade - D-"
"This book reads like a devotional, and that‚Äôs how I went through it. There‚Äôs a lot to like about it. There‚Äôs some biblical and historical theology here.On the other hand, I felt that it dragged on at times. Some chapters were good and well-supported, while others seemed to press the author‚Äôs point a little beyond what I believe the scripture supports. I think he tended to be repetitive beyond what was helpful, and sometimes it seemed that he was trying to find more than was there in a few chapters.On the whole I certainly recommend this book. It‚Äôs comforting, challenging, and his premise is sound. I pray this work encourages many."
Whenever I open this book I weep. It is full of truth and grace and I will forever be recommending it to everyone I know!
"Overall, the book has little to offer. Those who fit the author‚Äôs narrow view of a ‚Äúnormal Christian‚Äù are probably already familiar with this retread of works which have been in the public domain for centuries. Those who don‚Äôt are likely to end up blaming themselves for a poor understanding or experience of Christ because of the book‚Äôs unacknowledged biases. Avoid.The author presents his personal experience of Christianity and the Bible as universal truth. For example, he takes for granted that Puritan men in the 17th century had ‚Äúparticular clarity and insight‚Äù into the Bible, to the extent that he says the strategy of the book is to take a Bible passage ‚Äúor a bit of teaching from the Puritans‚Äù to consider what is being said about the heart of God. However, the only evidence he gives of this particular clarity and insight is that he personally felt his understanding of the Bible improved through reading these men. He fails to give either a convincing explanation of why these men‚Äôs insight should be viewed as universally applicable or demonstrate an understanding of the limitations that their worldview might have for a non-male, non-white, non-Western, non-Protestant, etc., etc. audience. It might be something he hasn‚Äôt had to consider prior to writing the book, as he‚Äôs spent almost the entirety of his career in positions that currently or historically categorically excluded certain groups. However it‚Äôs a flaw that‚Äôs fatal to the book‚Äôs premise of universality.The book consistently positions those who are not in the same population segment as the author as little more than supporting characters in the ‚Äúnormal Christian‚Äôs‚Äù quest to know the heart of God. It fails the Bechdel test spectacularly‚Äî women appear in an illustration striving (unsuccessfully) to put into words how amazing a husband is. Chapter 3 compares Christ to ‚Äúa compassionate doctor [who] has traveled deep into the jungle to provide medical care to a primitive tribe,‚Äù an analogy that has been out of favor for its clear Western arrogance and disrespect of indigenous cultures for at least decades.The introduction states this book is written for ‚Äúnormal Christians,‚Äù but prospective readers should be aware that the worldview and literature the author draws on represent an extremely narrow view that categorically excludes large segments of what would generally be considered the ‚Äúnormal Christian‚Äù population.Readers who are part of these categorically excluded segments will find themselves at best confused by how fundamentally inapplicable most of the text is to their Christian experience."
"Calm. Captivating. Convincing. Curative. In ‚ÄúPoetry and Prose in the Sixteenth Century: the Oxford History of English Literature‚Äù, an article on the Puritans seeks to correct some commonly held notions about them. ‚ÄúWhatever they were, they were not sour, gloomy or severe; nor did their enemies bring any such charge against them. For example, Roman Catholic Thomas More criticized them for their ‚Äòlightness of mind‚Äô and ‚Äòvain gladness of heart‚Äô. It seems then, as now, what the Puritans said seemed too good to be true. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so grateful for the thorough, measured, quiet way that the author of ‚ÄúGentle and Lowly‚Äù examines what the Bible says about the heart of Christ. What he says does seem too good to be true, yet the author gently and carefully shows that what the Bible reveals about Christ‚Äôs heart is gloriously good and true. The last thing the author says is, ‚ÄúThe Lord Jesus, the Great-heart. Who could have imagined that you, the most exalted, are the most tender? Meditating on your heart gentleness reduced me to tears more than once as I wrote. Tears of wonder, of relief. ‚ÄòWho then is this?‚Äô‚Äù (Luke 8:25). I‚Äôm on my third reading and the wonder, relief and tears keep coming."
"This book is a best-seller for a reason. If, like me, you grew up in the church and somehow adopted a view of God that led you to believe He has a grudging, stodgy kind of love for you, then this book will be paradigm-shifting for you.I've long struggled to believe that the Lord loves me, individually. Generally speaking, I know He loves me because He set His affections on me and chose to save me before the foundations of the word. But sometimes that knowledge doesn't permeate the heart when you feel you should be less of a sinner than you currently are. I don't know exactly when or why I began to view God as a disappointed grandfather who begrudgingly hands out quarters with a scowl on His face, but I've struggled to overcome that false belief for decades.What Ortlund helped me to see in Scripture is that the heart of the Son reveals the heart of the Father, and He is a Father who pours out love on me (me!) in a swollen, overflowing river that cannot be measured or contained. He doesn't love me less when I sin. He draws me deeper into His love.The chapter that probably encouraged e the most was chapter 21, ""He Loved Us Then; He'll Love Us Now."" If you struggle to believe that you're fully forgiven for the sins you committed after conversion, this chapter will right your flawed view of God's love and forgiveness as explained in Romans 5. Truly, I'll return to this chapter over and over again.Do you think that God begrudgingly loves you because He promised to but maybe perhaps doesn't have much affection for you? This book is for you. Read it. Savor it. Believe it. The heart of the Savior and the heart of the Father pour out love and kindness and mercy in a stream so deep and wide, you cannot fathom its depth.8 likes"
"All the great reviews so I thought surely this was a big winner. Unfortunately I couldn't even get through the first yawning chapter. I'm sorry, as the title truly made me want to love this book, but the writing simply was not engaging enough to keep my interest. It read more like a history book and there wasn't enough voice or character to draw me in. So it now sits on my shelf with about 20 other too-good-to-be-true spiritual books that spouted greatness and spawned boring prose."
"People who grew up in a certain kind of church soaked in the message of ‚ÄúTry harder to do better because God might have deigned to save you, but he doesn‚Äôt really like you that much.‚Äù They live under constant pressure to earn God‚Äôs love and approval with a constant sinking feeling of failing to do so (even while professing a belief in his mercy and grace). This book destroys such a disapproving, aloof image of our Heavenly Father and his Son Jesus Christ.Jesus described himself as ‚Äúgentle and lowly in heart‚Äù (Matthew 11:29), and in 23 short chapters Ortlund (with the help of various Puritan theologians) explores many facets of his compassionate character. We are reminded what it means when we say that Jesus ‚Äúloved me and gave himself for me‚Äù (Galatians 2:20). These pages offer a beautiful, soul-refreshing description of the believer‚Äôs loving relationship with the One who ‚Äúis the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature‚Äù (Hebrews 1:3). This is not lightweight downplaying of God‚Äôs other attributes so we can focus on his love drivel, but biblically grounded praise of the One who is perfectly just and righteous and whose heart is characterized by mercy, grace, and compassion.My only quibble with the book is that (like a lot of things that come out of The Gospel Coalition) it is a bit hero-worshippy toward the Puritan theologians. However, the quotes by these men that pervade the book demonstrate why this admiration is not wholly misplaced.Overall, I highly recommend this book. There might not be anything particularly new here, but it eloquently pulls together many biblical strands to remind us that ‚ÄúYes, Jesus loves me; the Bible tells me so.‚Äù"
"AW Tozer wrote ‚Äú‚ÄúWhat comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us.‚Äù This wonderful book by Dane Ortland has opened my heart, mind and soul to help me know God better through learning about who Jesus is. I have this book on Kindle. It‚Äôs on my phone and I know I will refer to it often to remind myself who Jesus is and how much God loves me. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has not yet discovered the love of Christ. For those who have trusted in Christ, your love for Him will grow as you discover even more of His love for you."
"Referring to theologians like Edwards and Goodwin, Dane Ortlund has written one of the best Christian books I‚Äôve ever read. While reading, the book‚Äôs dedication to Scripture brought tears to my eyes and I took so many notes. This is one you‚Äôll keep on the front of the bookshelf and is absolutely needful for the 21st century Christian experience."
"My vocation in life is to write and teach about the mercy of God in Jesus Christ. I read many books. I have written a few. On occasion ‚Äì and those occasions are sadly infrequent ‚Äì I will pick up a book that so overwhelms me with the message of God‚Äôs love that it refocuses me on the Main Thing; it reinvigorates me with a passion to keep doing what I‚Äôm doing; and it makes the mercy of God so palpable, so unmissable, that I sit there reading with a huge smile of joy spreading across my face. Dane‚Äôs book did that. Read it. Savor it. And thank God for such voices in our worn and weary world, famished for mercy."
"This is definitely not the kind of book I would have looked into buying myself; especially when I had never heard of this author before. Thank you to the person who recommended it to me! I am glad he did!The Gentle & The Lowly paints such a great picture of the heart of God through Jesus Christ. The author based his book around the teachings/studies of Thomas Goodwin (no idea who he or the other guys mentioned in this book were, until now).The book was difficult to read, not because of the so much theological background and verses of the Bible quoted on it to reinforce the statements; but because of the statements themselves!The author's writing style is slow and comforting; so the reader has to have a deep desire to read/learn about these topics otherwise this book could become boring and/or dull to him/her.Sometime it is really easy for us as Christians to share the Love of Christ to those who are hurting, but when it comes to us... it becomes somehow hard to apply it to ourselves. We forget that we also have seasons of suffering when we need the reassurance of the love of Jesus fir us! We are at times the ""sinners and the sufferers"" as well! And this book is a gentle reminder of our great need for the love of the Father as we walk our Christian walk!Thanks you to the person who recommended this book to me, I would have not found it by myself at all! Thank you to the author for writing this book about such a beautiful truth... the heart of love of our Savior for us!"
"As beautiful of a work as I have had the joy to read in my lifetime. A treatise for the ages.This book sheds light on the hope found only in Christ. A fresh glimmer of the love of God to sinners and suffering saints, alike.‚ÄúMeek. Humble. Gentle. Jesus is not trigger-happy. Not harsh, reactionary, easily exasperated. He is the most understanding person in the universe. The posture most natural to him is not a pointed finger but open arms.‚Äù P. 19‚ÄúLook to Christ. He deals gently with you.‚Äù P. 51‚ÄúChrist was sent not to mend wounded people or wake sleepy people or advise confused people or inspire bored people or spur on lazy people or educate ignorant people, but to raise dead people.‚Äù P. 151‚Äú the evidence of Christ‚Äôs mercy toward you is not your life. The evidence of his mercy toward you is his‚Äîmistreated, misunderstood, betrayed, abandoned. Eternally. In your place.‚Äù p. 154."
"After reading all the positive reviews I was looking forward to an inspiring and uplifting read. I‚Äôm a Christian and have received the wonderful grace and mercy we have in Christ.I‚Äôm guessing this book is really meant for those who may doubt Jesus‚Äô love?It is an awkward read. Like a long proof.Hundreds and hundreds of quotations make up most of the book. Scripture quotations, Puritan quotations, Calvin‚Äôs quotations, quotations from Confessions, quotations from Catechisms.Maybe this was written with a particular denomination in mind but for me I had to force myself to finish."
"There are few books that I would say have serious ""changed my life."" Obviously, the Bible, God's written word, is the absolute authority (Sola Scriptura) and has transformed my life and continues to shape me day by day, but then there are really good books which it's authors have sought to rightly explain and apply the Bible to our lives. For me, those really good books have been ones that have given me major paradigm shifts in my life as a Christian. Titles like Don't Waste Your Life and Desiring God by John Piper, Systematic Theology by Wayne Grudem, and the Doctrine of the Word of God by John Frame have been foundational to my understanding and walk with God and are always near me in my bookshelf to pick up. However, it has been a long time since I felt a significant shift and renewal in my heart from a book like I did with these books.What's so fascinating is how God has used this small book to radically rock my heart to tears with the simple yet profound wonder of the heart of my Lord and Savior, Jesus, the Son of God!Honestly, learning how Christ's heart is towards me has been so radically life-changing for me because it has clarified and helped me live out what I believed and known to be true but yet somehow not have fully lived out or experienced. Reading that the Chrisitan life is all about coming to Jesus no matter how you feel because you know how Jesus feels toward you has transformed how I see my daily life. As I fight sin, I fight sin by coming to Jesus who says true rest is found in him and he will always give it. When I fail in that fight and sin, I don't have to feel shame and condemnation because he bore it all and his love intensifies even more for me.There are so many quotes to write here, but my goal in this review is to just say this: Please buy this book, read it, recommend it to others, and be refreshed by the Gospel of Jesus because you know more his heart in all of his redemptive work. To know that you are united with Christ always means that you are eternally invincible.Really? I can come to Jesus with all my filth and failure?""If you knew his heart, you would."" - Thomas Goodwin"
"A simple, clear, encouraging book about the heart of Christ. Highly recommended.‚Äú'Gentle and lowly.' This, according to his own testimony, is Christ‚Äôs very heart. This is who he is. Tender. Open. Welcoming. Accommodating. Understanding. Willing. If we are asked to say only one thing about who Jesus is, we would be honoring Jesus‚Äôs own teaching if our answer is, gentle and lowly.""""He doesn‚Äôt simply meet us at our place of need; he lives in our place of need. He never tires of sweeping us into his tender embrace. It is his very heart. It is what gets him out of bed in the morning.""""Whatever is crumbling all around you in your life, wherever you feel stuck, this remains, un-deflectable: his heart for you, the real you, is gentle and lowly. So go to him. That place in your life where you feel most defeated, he is there; he lives there, right there, and his heart for you, not on the other side of it but in that darkness, is gentle and lowly."""
"Ortland‚Äôs argument in this book seemed almost too good to be true. Could Jesus really love a sinner like me that deeply? Doesn‚Äôt he get tired of my coming to him again and again? The resounding no in answer to this exhausting accusation will lift the spirit of any Christian who has ever wondered how Christ could put up with them. It‚Äôs his heart! What wonderful news for sinners! Read this book and find comfort for your souls. Let‚Äôs not only bask in the glory of such tender love, but let it also affect how we parent, how we treat our spouse, and how we make disciples. Because if Jesus can be gentle and lowly towards me, how can I not be like him in how I treat others, by the grace that he gives me? I‚Äôm already looking forward to rereading this book and letting its truths further sink into my heart."
"I did not purchase this book when I originally intended because of some of the reviews I read. I am finally glad I did. Maybe it‚Äôs where I am right now, but the author helped me see and connect with Jesus in a way that was not theological. He made me really think of Jesus as a man, a person and a friend. Someone in my corner who is there especially when I fail and struggle. I am tired of Christian self-help books that try to get me to work harder at being good. This book helped me rest on my savior more than others I have read. I will read this book as a reminder and companion with my bible so I can remind myself of Jesus‚Äô heart towards me. Very good book."
"I did like the clear biblical teaching about the love and mercy of a Christ, which is not in opposition to his lordship.Main verse is Matthew 11:28-29Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentleand lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.Which was also the favorite verse by Philip Melanchthon.Mercy triumphs over judgment and we cannot turn our back on sinners under the human excuse of purifying the Church, but restore them especially in the local church.Let‚Äôs remember the priority set in JamesJames 5:19-20My brothers, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back, let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from his wandering will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins."
"At first glance I thought with disdain, ""All we need is another 'Jesus is your boyfriend' book."" I was completely wrong. Rooted in Biblical texts and grounded in tried theology that has stood the test of time this book moves us to encounter what the Bible says about Jesus' orientation toward needy sinners. It does not add sentimental fluff, but it does not stop short of all that the Bible says about Jesus and his heart for his people.It was particularly helpful to me and my family during days of unusual conflict. And I don't know many people who are not walking in unusual conflict during these broken and chaotic days. I recommend it without reservation."
"I have never done a book review before reading this volume.I came to Christ 37 years ago, but though I do not regret that decision for a moment, that decision was fear based. Hard on others and harder on myself for sins and mistakes both real and imagined.Though we need to have a healthy fear of God, it was like I missed a big part of Christianity for years.This book did give much for me to think about in terms of whom Jesus actually is without violating anything any true Christian would believe about Him. Probably filled in some blanks for me about living for Jesus really means...and maybe given me new insights about who He is...particularly His love.Put your Bible first. But read this too."
"Our pastor told us that this is the best book he had EVER read, and he told us he has read 40 books just in the past 6 months.  So I picked up the book and read it.  Remarkable, it is.  Dane Ortlund has thought deeply and followed obediently after the Holy Spirit‚Äôs leading in his writing of a phenomenal book on Jesus Christ‚Äôs heart for us."
"Ortlund created a beautiful atmosphere within every page that he wrote in this book by perfectly emulating Christ in a way I have never thought of or was able to comprehend. Reading this book was timely for me as I have struggled deeply with dark valleys I know I navigated myself into. Out of the entire body of text, I have held closely to this one part, ""Reject the Devil's whisper that God‚Äôs tender heart for you has grown a little colder, a little stiffer. He is not flustered by your sinfulness. His deepest disappointment is with your tepid thoughts of his heart."" I have never thought of our limited understanding of God and His never-ceasing love for us to be His greatest pain. I am thankful for Ortlund and for God to use this author to help me and all believers to see Christ's heart broken down and depicted with such beautiful Biblical backup and truth. I have never felt closer to Jesus nor understood the grandiose love He carries for all of us and always will. This book really drew me into the heart of Christ. Please read this; I have already gifted it to many in my life with confident knowledge it's going to direct them on a path similar to the one I have found myself on. <3"
"Dane Ortlund writes out of a deep knowledge of biblical languages, culture and practice...but more importantly, out of a deep, personal, intimate relationship with the Triune God.  He also shows us the heart of some of the Puritans who also wrote out of this intimate relationship with a God who can be known and experienced.  This book, one that I cannot read several pages in one setting, but need to read it slowly, digesting each part, is one of the most impactful books I have read this year.  It is one that will remain on my desk to pick up and look at it time and time again.  I have recommended this book to several people, including my wife, who is also on an amazing journey with the Savior, and she has benefitted greatly from this book's pages.  If I can be so bold, if you are a serious Christian, wanted to get the most out of your relationship with God, pick this book up and savor and digest it's pages.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed."
"For 30 years, besides the Gospels, I have looked and read many books on Jesus to seek to better know Him and His heart.  Some were just ""fluffy"" and others were too theological that made Jesus seem impossible to know.  However, I cannot recommend enough ""GENTLE AND LOWLY"" by Dane Ortlund.  He does a masterful job, short chapters that delve into the true heart of Christ, the One who is gentle, kind, welcoming of sinners....this book makes you really want to love Him even more.  I find myself talking to the LORD as I read it.  Great stuff.  Best book I have read in years.  Check it out.  Well worth the buy."
"No book has impacted me as significantly as this one (barring scripture of course)...I‚Äôve wept tears of joy repeatedly as I consumed this slowly. The chapters are short and full of heart enrapturing truths. This is sure to be a Christian classic (should the Lord tarry)...thank you Dane for writing this...and thanks to your dad for showing you a fathers heart...but most of all, thanks be to our Gentle and Lowly Savior, Jesus...the BEAUTIFUL ONE."
"Every bit as good and even better than I thought it would be.  It's the best Christian book that I've read in years.  It focuses on aspects of Jesus that are often overlooked.  Yet once it's pointed out in the book, it's so clear.  You'll see your relationship with Jesus in a new light, and it will bring you closer to God.Thoroughly Biblical.  It's not soft on doctrine or pandering to people.  If you're even thinking about reading it, do yourself a favor and just get it."
One of the beautiful things in this book that it lays out the heart of Christ (which is in the title) but the author pulls from scripture and from puritan authors as well to help supplement. J I Packer once said the most important thing to a person is what they think about who God is and this book definitely helps clarify or introduce Jesus and showing how that reflects on the trinity. A lot of times people think that God is angry in the Old testament and chills out in  the New testament but it is the same God through it all and this book shows clearly how God is perfect and how that reflects his attributes.
"This is one of the best books I have ever read, and it landed in my lap at a time I desperately needed it's words. It honors and exalts Jesus Christ by explaining the clear biblical teaching of His eternal character. But it's no stale theology. It is essentially pastoral, apply the glorious truths of our Savior's heart to His people who are in such great need of the assurance of His love. It never minimizes His authority or His position as the just judge of all, but details how the truths of His wrath and judgment exist side-by-side with humble, immeasurable love. I wept over every page, tears of comfort during a season of catastrophic grief. I'm grateful."
"A review you can actually trust! I never knew I needed this book. It‚Äôs a great read even for those not currently going through tough times.In the deepest depression I have felt thus far in my life, this book helped me to see Jesus‚Äô heart in a whole new way. He doesn‚Äôt just cast us away like garbage and doesn‚Äôt leave us to suffer alone. He is right down in that pit with us!Like Voddie Baucham says, ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt say amen, you gotta say ouch.‚Äù This whole book is a good mix of amen and ouch, but in a good way.I learned a lot about myself and Jesus after reading this. I recommend this to anyone, not just those going through hard times."
"Jesus isn't as we expect! I'm so grateful to have read this book and discovered Christ isn't repulsed by me or disappointed when I sin in ""that way"" for the 5000th time. He moves toward me! This book is for everyone, and it's especially for those who are sick and tired of being sick and tired. Let Christ reveal himself and I hope you come away with a bonfire of affection for him after reading this work!"
"There is no book that I have consistently enjoyed reading or looked forward to reading more than this book. I believe this quality can be wholly attributed to its subject, namely the heart of Christ. Christ's compassion and mercy burst through these pages and engulfed me in the sweetest grasp of awe and joy time and time again as I was drug into the promises of God in His Scriptures. I did not realize how flawed many of my thoughts of Christ and God were especially in relation to my personal sin till I read of His true heart for me.I cannot recommend this book enough and I look forward to reading it a second time as soon as possible. Get to know God as He presents Himself in His deepest form in His Word and do not let traditional notions from any source other than Scripture define your everyday sense of Christ's heart for you."
"I have to put it down because I cannot read more than one chapter at a time. My spirit is blessed and my beliefs transformed with tears that testify to the power of the Holy Spirit working in me with every word. It overwhelms me with a deep appreciation, bitter realization, a soulful yearning, and sweet conviction showing me the Savior I have longed to know - and who knows me. Why, after 30 years of walking this road to Calvary, have I not known this Jesus? The church needs this Jesus. The world needs this Jesus. As a pastor - it has changed me and how I teach, disciple, and introduce others to Jesus. I highly encourage you to gift this book."
This book is like honey to my soul! I do not review often but when I do it‚Äôs because the product is superb! Ortlund captured the heart of Christ for sinners and sufferers in words that are like a balm to a wound. Just do yourself a favor and get this book. This is like a rich feast so read one chapter a day and meditate on it. This is Christian ‚Äúpsychotherapy ‚Äú ( care of the soul) at its finest! The Puritans have truly been the doctors of the soul. Only if more scholars would repolish these old jewels to a language we can understand today!
"Even those who love Jesus, who seek to know and obey God, who feel they have a relationship with Him have greatly misunderstood his heart. Though we may have not slandered His name and reputation, characterizing Him as this wicked, violent God like His fiercest critics do, we have characterized Him as one who is often disappointed in us and ready to discipline us (though He does do that in love). To read this book is to survey the Scriptures and thus uncover His heart which is drawn to us. You do that as soon as you can. Buy this, borrow it and read it and open up your mind and heart to His."
"The heart of Christ, and thus the heart of God, is such a core biblical doctrine, and one which the gospel of salvation to sinners through Christ presupposes.In this book, Dane has honored his father, grandfather, and Heavenly Father by recovering this doctrine and introducing it to a world that is much in need of it (I know I am). The gentle and lowly essence of Jesus is offensive to our proud human hearts but is a magnificent balm to sinners and sufferers. Read it, and read it slowly with your bible open."
"Reading a few pages of this book each day has been a wonderful highlight of the day.  It is so encouraging and thought provoking.  I particularly appreciate that the author supports every claim with scriptural reference.  He also discusses and thoroughly documents references to the writings of many well-known theologians.  Having been trained and published research in mathematics, I am extremely picky about the integrity of any work that I read.  I think it is even more important with scriptural work to the point where I will stop reading a book if I can find no basis for a given claim.  I am so glad to have found this book."
"Since March 2020, I had been battling on going chronic health issues, when in December 2020, I also contracted Covid.  I was in a deep, deep, dark place of confusion, hopelessness, and suffering.  How ironic it was the Christmas season and feeling this way made it all the more worse.  I had such guilt because of that too.  But then, something happened that shocked my brain and system back ‚Äúon line‚Äù.  It was a little gift a dear friend dropped off at my doorstep shortly before Christmas.  It was this book.  While my health struggles have consistently remained, with ups and downs, I am different again, somehow I am keeping my emotional/mental health in a much stronger place, because of this gift, ‚Äîwhich kept bringing me back to the heart of Jesus in a way I had never heard before, had never really absorbed in this way before.  ‚ù§Ô∏è Just reading the Introduction began a life changing journey.  Reading ii in my quiet, resting time, one chapter,  at a time, sustained me in a miraculous way.  Forever grateful for this book which opened my eyes to the full meaning of the depth, the height, and the breadth of Jesus' heart for me."
"Based on so many positive reviews, I ordered this book only to abandon it after a few chapters. Highly intellectual and unrelated to Christians not involved in seminary or academia, trying to find the real world application is laborious. If you‚Äôre interested in understanding  Christ‚Äôs love by dissecting root words in Greek and lots of Puritan literature, this is a great book for that. Or save your money and just read the original Puritan authors cited excessively throughout this book."
"If I believed what this book says about God‚Äîthese truths Dane Ortlund reminds us of‚Äîway down deep in the depths of my truest self, I‚Äôd never be shaken. ‚ú®We all know in our head that God loves us but still tend to doubt it in our hearts because we think His love is like our love. But this modern classic flipped on its head every wayward thought I‚Äôve ever had of God and multiplied times infinity every facet of His beautiful heart that I‚Äôve ever caught a glimpse of. ‚ú®I‚Äôve savored each chapter over the last month or so and can honestly say I love Jesus more for having read this book. And I think you just might too. ‚ú®"
"I literally recovered from the doldrums by reading this book. I am a believer, love the Word, church, the Word. So much of the time beating myself up mentally for failure I. Daily ways,and, wanting to be righteous.  This was like a salve, and, I actually am able to love others and live out more because I am greatly loved by the Father"
"In his introduction, Ortlund says the book is written ‚Äúfor the discouraged, the frustrated, the weary, the disenchanted, the cynical, the empty,‚Äù so that encompasses a lot of us. He unpacks truths from the prophets, to the apostles, to the Puritans. We were blessed when considering various passages of Scripture dealing with the heart of Christ. It is a powerful book and one worth reading - and re-reading. We have purchased copies for others and highly recommend it to every believer."
"This book is much needed for many preachers to read! It is rooted in the Reformed and Puritan writings, but one can disagree with Calvinistic theology and enjoy this book! It points out the deep and gracious heart of God for sinners! God isn‚Äôt like us in our flippant loves. He loves to the end, and He loves fully. This book captures that heart well, and is written very well.In ministry I have dealt with people, and I myself have thought that God‚Äôs promises of love don‚Äôt apply to me. This book was written for people who struggle with that very fear. Read this, and know that Jesus the Messiah and Lord of the universe loves you. Yes, you."
"This is one of the best Christian devotional books I have read in years. The book is laid out in very easy to read, shorter chapters, 23 in all. I would suggest reading one chapter a day as a devotion and let the truths of the chapter ruminate in your heart. The book focuses on the heart of Christ for us, but also touches on the heart of the Father, and the heart of the Spirit. Ortlund has done a fantastic job distilling and bringing alive the very heart of the Gospel that comes to us in the person of Christ. We have a savior that deeply loves us, is not put off by our sin, but rather like a well trained Doctor, runs with joy into our brokenness to bring healing. The truths brought alive in this book are profound and life giving. This is a must read."
"Dane Ortlund provided this book in a timely manner ‚Äî right in the middle of a pandemic, and even still the content of this work would lift up any believer in any age at any point of time in their lives. What he writes is almost hard to believe as he moves back the veils we have placed over God‚Äôs heart for us. He helps the reader to see God‚Äôs heart more clearly and provides scriptural support along the way so that you‚Äôre made fully aware that he isn‚Äôt just writing some feel good book, but rather he‚Äôs illuminating something that many Christians fail to see, a thing that‚Äôs supported by scripture.I recommend this book to every single Christian because this book speaks to everyone. Dane does a great job of addressing the spectrum of believers in his book. It‚Äôs a book that I would be looking to reading again and again. It blessed me and I hope it blesses others as well."
"Come see and taste the heart of Jesus in this theologically rich, but accessible book full of God's infinite grace and mercy. 2020 for us all is arguably a year of pain, suffering, frustration, anger. Whoever you are and wherever you are, your heart needs this book. From the get-go Ortland asks the question that is often overshadowed in the church today: do we know what the heart of Jesus is like? Maybe we've known or perhaps heard of what Jesus has done for us on the cross. We've heard of His resurrection and defeat of sin. We've praised Him for his glory, victory, and majesty. But maybe our deepest sin struggles and daily revelations of our shortcomings still give us pause: does God still love us?""when we sin, the very heart of Jesus is drawn out to us"" (pg 69). Ortland's seemingly cringey and blasphemous statement perfectly encapsulates the compassionate, gentle, and merciful heart of Jesus. Ortland does not skate past the discipline and holy wrath that our sins evoke in God, but masterfully navigates through scripture to explain how the very divinity of God inclines His heart to mercy rather than judgement to those trust in Jesus. This is probably the best Christian book I have ever read."
"This book was so well written and felt very healing as a believer to read. I will be recommending this book to others and I'm keeping it for my children to read as well when they are older. Biblically truthful, easy to understand, and not at all dry. Thank you Dane Ortlund for writing this book."
"This book is one that I cannot stop reading and reviewing for my daily inspiration. While the writing is amazing, it does require an understanding of some words not often seen in books these days. Christian or not, this is worth the price and the time to read and pass along. Since I will not part with my issue, I have sold around fifty for this author to date. If I had the money I would buy one for each member of my church."
"Dane does a beautiful job of lifting up the reader in the heart of Christ. He uses the puritans and other classic writers to support his exposition of the heart of the Lord. Most of all, he supports all of it with amazing insights in the scriptures that are sure to enlighten your awareness to the lovingkindness of God. Read this book if want to be encouraged in the Lord."
I absolutely loved this book. A friend recommended it and it did not disappoint. The author manages to bring to light many attributes about God the Father and Jesus that help to understand the heart of the Father. This is a great read to recommend for a regenerate believer who has made poor choices and bad decisions. I suppose a way to describe this book is as a convincing argument as to why the father of the prodigal son reacted the way he did.
"Too many words will trivialize this book's impact on me personally and its importance for Christians and non-Christians, who so often have a heart-level view of God as demanding, disappointed, finding us difficult to love. In short, we think God is like us. Thank you, Dane Ortlund, for leading my soul to fresher waters, greener pastures, and helping me believe that as one who follows Jesus, He actually wants me with Him. His heart is more full than I could have dreamed."
"I thought I knew who Jesus was until I read this book. I can tell this book is going to introduce the heart of God to many. The scholarship and attention to detail is stupendous. Of course, it‚Äôs all for our Father‚Äôs glory."
Did those criticizing it really read the book? I am truly sad for them if they missed the point. Get it and read it (or listen to it). I found some content to be a review of what I already knew (but still a worthwhile review). Other insights into God's nature and the source passages the author uses to build make his points were things I had not fully realized before. It is uncomfortably comforting to simultaneously reflect on how low you are and come to new appreciations of the Lord's unfathomable love for you.
"this book so perfectly reveals the heart of Christ for us - his love, his kindness, his care of us. every chapter was like a balm for the soul and the mind, perfectly laid out with scripture and the teachings of some of my favorite preachers over the years: jonathan edwards, john bunyan, and CS Lewis, etc. I cannot recommend this book strongly enough - my heart has been so encouraged."
"How many times have I sinned, whether secretly, externally or blatantly and listened to my feelings or satan whispering and instead of crying out to my Lord Jesus Christ and seeking Him, ran and hid? Dane Ortlund has brought to my attention that as a child of the King, that I should run to Him. He knows me better than I know myself and HIS love is greater than all my sin. He walked this earth as the PERFECT SACRIFICE and took my place and wants me to rest in HIM!! If you‚Äôre a child of GOD, and you struggle with being in CHRIST, read this book."
"This book made me cry multiple times. I‚Äôve never read such a caring, thoughtful and intellectual assessment of the heart of God. How have we evangelicals missed this? Usually when we focus on God‚Äôs love it‚Äôs fuzzy and somewhat cheap. But Ortland goes deep into theology of what mercy and love looks like in Christ. I truly recommend everyone read this book. There‚Äôs biblical focus, assistance from Puritan writers and a genuine pastoral tone throughout. Cannot recommend highly enough! [female, reformed perspective]"
"There were many times when I read this that, that I shed tears, tears of joy. I learned so much from this book. I was encouraged.  I am so glad this book was suggested to me. And it is one I will re read many times. This book brought me joy and made me think more about what it means that Jesus loves me. It made me more aware of sins In my life and some of my wrong perceptions of who God is and how He loves me, and that has implications on how I approach and why I fight sin in my life. This book as it says in the title speaks much on the heart of Jesus towards sinners, as a result of that I felt this book brought much hope, and that where it found that was in the truths of who Jesus is, in the scriptures."
"Was a good read. I think it was written in a style that was easily read, easy to understand, encouraging, and leads to loving the Savior more. Jesus has loved those who are burdened and downtrodden. He gravitated towards those in need. He still does. Buy extra copies. You‚Äôll enjoy the heart of this book about the heart of the Savior. Give a copy away."
Ortlund's approach provides insights into the heart of God and His redeeming grace.  This book is for those who have doubts and have tended to be more legalistic in their relationship to Christ.  There is a sense of freedom in being in Christ and living by trusting Him for salvation and eternity.  This brings us closer to the enjoyment of our relationship with Christ here and now.
"I stopped reading the ""New Reformed"" guys years ago, with all their reasons why your probably not saved,  but this book came recommended by some out of the Lutheran camp and now I'm on my second reading of it. I kept waiting for the shoe to drop, you know overflowing with grace resonating in your heart and then the two by four across the back of your head leaving you face down with the ""yes grace BUT"". Unless I'm missing something that shoe never dropped.  Grace is a person, Jesus, not just a doctrine or endless imperatives, Dane brings you to a person the human Jesus, who is God of course but someone who really knows you the worst, darkest regions of your being and still wants to be with you far more than you want to be with Him. Highly recommend this book to fellow sensitive strugglers in the faith.Thanks Mike"
"I didn‚Äôt have high hopes or expectations for this book, but I was very pleasantly surprised. I‚Äôm so glad I read it! I like to use a yellow highlighter when I read to mark important (to me) points. Well, a LOT of this book is yellow now! Sincerely, it challenged and deepened the way I view Jesus. I‚Äôm very thankful to God for the gift of this book and will be reading it again."
"The author points us to several places in Scripture I did not give sufficient thought. These places selected in scripture are considered at length to show what kind of heart God has for his people. There is also a very good explanation of our sin and feeling of guilt that should bring us to God and not distance us from Him. There are many good reminders of how God views and considers His people, which is not dependent on how good we are on anything lovely we bring to the relationship."
The book is a series of short devotionals which give unique perspectives on Christ.  I am enjoying it.  My church is going to do it as a study.  I am gaining new appreciation for the person who lived a sinless life and laid down that life that we might all become children of God.  I recommend it to deepen your faith.
"Initially a good message and all, but it becomes very repetitive quickly."
"Our church offered this study for a Sumer learning group. It has opened our eyes to the heart of Jesus, this book is for anyone discouraged, empty, or who has experienced suffering. In my opinion, it‚Äôs for anyone. The title says Christ‚Äôs heart for sinners and sufferers. Well, we are all sinners and suffers. It‚Äôs probably one of the best books I‚Äôve ever read. Eye opening."
"Distilling some of the Puritan writers earliest thoughts on Christianity, Dane Orland brings the gospel message to life in a new and beautiful way by focusing on the essence of Christ. Plumbing the depths of the New Testament with beautiful language and crystal clear analogies, I feel enriched and grateful!"
"Dane Ortlund beautifully and powerfully takes us to the center of Christ‚Äôs heart: His unshakeable love for broken people. Thoroughly biblical and following the lead of earlier masters such as Thomas Goodwin and Jonathan Edwards, Ortland puts on display the ‚Äúimmeasurable riches of [God‚Äôs] grace through his kindness to us in Christ Jesus‚Äù (Ephesians 2.7). If your heart is open to Jesus, this book will often bring you to tears of gratitude."
"Paradigm changing book....from the mind of God about the heart of God.  Challenges the human grid wesee God through & dismantles many subtle default understandings that inhibit our desire to approach God.  No matter how much you think you know God & theology, this book will cause your heart to melt into God's welcoming & tender heart.  A must read if you enjoy an explosion of your mind & realignment of your heart towards God's."
This is one of the best books I have ever read. The writer uses God's word and other biblical writers to show the heart of God and how he views us and it may be much different they many of us have been mislead to believe.
"From tears, to prayers to broad smiles, this lovely little book elicits them all. I think it‚Äôs the simplicity I can relate to, that spoke to my heart. I can almost hear my Lord saying, ‚ÄúYes! Yes! This is Us!‚Äù What a beautiful word picture of Christ in the Trinity. I wish every Christian would read it."
"I was a little disappointed.  This read a little clinical to me. I like some storytelling, how people have related in certain situations, biblically or unbiblically, and how God worked in their lives.Today‚Äôs people with their personal stories of God‚Äôs work in their lives is an added plus for me."
"He deeply dives into the Heart of Christ for us.  I deeply recommend this book for all believers. Jesus is for us in a away, I could never be for anything.  Trying to plumb the Heart of Christ is difficult and beautiful task and all of Christians should have this noble goal in our minds and hearts."
"I purchased my first edition of Gentle and Lowly in the spring of 2020. Since then, I've purchased something around 8 copies to give to friends and family. I cannot stress enough how incredibly impacted I have been by Ortlund's writing; it is incredibly understandable, quite concise, and theologically rich with indispensable truths about Christ and his heart for his people. I wish I could say more, but have no wish to type out a novel about how much I commend this book. That being said, a friend and I did a review on this very book on a podcast. Check out A Good Book Review (episode 2) on Spotify or Apple Podcasts for my 20 minute review of this book (please forgive my shameless plug)."
I absolutely loved this book. This author was able to use Scripture to vividly describe so many attributes of Christ. I've been a Christian since childhood and I feel like I have a much greater understanding of who Jesus is after reading this book. Highly recommend to Christians and non-Christians alike.
"I absolutely loved reading this book. The author Dane Ortlund, did an excellent job sharing Christ‚Äôs love for us is far beyond of what we can imagine.Jesus responds to us as a gentle and lowly servant because that‚Äôs His Character. He is attracted to us who continually mess up and He still loves us and invites us into relationship with Him. This makes me so grateful for the Lord Jesus."
The author he‚Äôs not only knowledgeable and heartfelt but is living out what he is talking about. That is what we need desperately as people of faith in Jesus that are living it out in 2021. Grateful for Dana Ortlund and for this fascinating book that is so theologically sound.
I really liked how he brought in Puritan thinkers to support his points on God‚Äôs love and compassion for broken sinful people. Most people equate judgment with the Puritans but not here.This book is hard to believe as life just feels contrary to what he was preaching. It was great encouragement indeed
Far too often we forget the heart of God toward us.  The darkness of our own sin blinds us to the reality of God‚Äôs love.  Ortlund reminds us from scripture that Divine love is not lessened by our sin but all the more beautiful.Never have I cried more reading a book.  Each chapter I was overwhelmed by the unconditional richness of God‚Äôs love for me.
"What is Jesus like, really? Dane Ortlund, using a wealth of scripture and a great host of wise church fathers, answers that question in a way that is hopeful, helpful, and tremendously encouraging. You will be glad you read this book. You will return to it often. This is the best book I've read in a while."
Very good book and learned a lot but very deep and almost like a conclusion of references as he frequently references other sources. Read it slowly over the summer. Great to learn the other side of our savior and not just focus on Gods wrath and judgement.
"After the tumultuous year of 2020, this book was such a comfort. Ortlund does a superb job showing us Christ in the scriptures, with the help of Puritans. It has been a fantastic resource to add to my daily devotional reading and I have come back to this book more times than any book in 2020."
"Wonderful book to deepen your understanding of the love that God has for us in and through Christ. This book is very helpful for anyone who is depressed or feeling unloved and alone. For the Christian it is a reminder of the great love we have been given. For the non-Christian, it reveals the great love they can have by accepting Christ as their Savior."
"...and I'm glad I paid attention! What a soothing, yet challenging, journey this book is. I was familiar with Ray Perkins but had never read anything by Dane. This is not a fluff piece but one which deserves to be highlighted, marked and read again."
"This book is well written and has been a blessing to me. I read a chapter a day as a part of my daily devotional. It is easy to understand and has a good bit of references to Hebrews, which is becoming my favorite book in the Bible.The download was very easy."
"The language and wording fit so well with the books title and was an easy read.  But it gave time to reflect and apply the truths found there - in.  Excellent for contemplating the truths of Scripture and Christ‚Äôs personality, especially as it relates to the believer.  Good book!"
"This book lays out the heart of God for us through His Son, Jesus Christ.  ‚ÄúGentle and Lowly ‚Äú is how Jesus describes Himself in the Bible.  How can you not help but love a God who is gentle and lowly, who loves us unconditionally, who is full of mercy and compassion?"
"What a great book! The perfect comforting remedy for those who struggle with the idea of being loved by God. There is no greater comfort than to meditate on the Heart of Christ for the sinner. And this book guides the reader to do just that, utilizing the writings of Puritans like Thomas Watson and John Bunyan. Ive sent this book to several of my brothers and sisters. I cant recommend it enough."
"Loved this book. Ortlund walks through verses in depth, that really explain the heart of Christ. I felt my heart warmed and softened by the beauty of seeing Christ's heart as to be believed correctly, from his own voice in Scripture."
"At times, I did find this book dull. But I suppose that speaks mostly to the slowness and sin of my own heart to embrace the love of Christ. If I read this again and truly believed these blessings were mine, I would not be able to put it down I‚Äôm sure. But maybe a re-read is exactly what would awaken such certainty."
This book's main focus is on Jesus and His grace and love. I had to pause during reading to fully grasp the beauty of what the author was pointing out. This is a must read.
"Rachael's early life was daunting, to say the least. No means of transportation except the waterways.  During her married life to Andrew Jackson the two forged a life fraught with politics, his long absences from home, her concern for his health .  Later in life Rachael found comfort in the Biblical teachings of the Protestant faith (Presbyterian).  It's a good read, I gave it 5-stars."
"I am only 3/4 of the way through but I must tell you this is the best book I've ever read, bar none, and I've been a happy reader since childhood (am now a senior citizen). Other reviewers have said it much better than I, but this book has drawn the eyes of my heart to my Savior in a way I've never experienced. If you are a sinner or sufferer, I beg you to read this book!"
"A must read for anyone struggling with doubt about Gods love for you or  if you have feelings of shame or guilt  or you grew up believing you had to earn Gods approval of you every time you messed up, this is a must read for you!"
"Great book! Pulls from scripture, early church writings, and Puritan preaching to give an emphasis on the sweeping compassion of Christ. Really recommend for times like these, when much of the church emphasizes His judgement rather than His heart for care."
"I have read few books that reveal the heart of Our Savior like this one.  Masterfully written, this book has been deliciously edifying.  We are so prone to find our treasure elsewhere, but Dane Ortlund has pointed us to the one who is truly the Pearl of great price."
"This has to be one of the most encouraging and helpful books I have read in the last 10 years. I just checked through our Amazon order history and realized we have already ordered 7 copies. One for me and my wife, and the rest for friends and neighbors. I remember first opening this book and wanting to read the whole thing in one sitting. Instead I slowed down and read one chapter per day and it was deeply encouraging. Thank you, Dane!"
"I love this book. Each chapter is like a balm to my soul, which is so easily forgetful of God's grace and love. Each chapter is an extrapolation of a certain passage of Scripture that speaks to God's heart towards sinners, and it has helped me immensely."
I am loving this book. I definitely recommend this for someone who wants to dive deeper in their faith and relationship with God. I enjoy how the author references so many different verses. It has definitely helped me grow.
"This is likely the best book I've read in the last decade (or more) for two major reasons:1.) It is beautifully written.2.) No text has ever made me pause mid-read to pray/confess/thank God as much as this one.¬†If you want to be blessed, read it."
"Excellent book describing the love Jesus has for us!  The is a book to be chewed, savored, and digested!  The author is absolutely amazing in his sharing of truth!!  Every Christian should read this book as God leads."
"Don't hesitate to buy this book. When you read it, you will not hesitate to recommend it to others. Read it to fall in love with Jesus again and again. I don't know the author. I didn't receive this book free for me to recommend it to you.  But now I highly recommend that you get it and begin to bathe (daily) in scriptural meditations on the UNFATHOMABLE love of God for you and me. Your joy will be full."
Haven‚Äôt started reading it yet but I‚Äôm excited to! I‚Äôve heard a lot of great things about it!
This one goes right on my list of all time favorites.Ortlund so clearly explains the depth of Christ‚Äôs love for you and for me; he makes it easy to appreciate the Lord for who he is as opposed to what he‚Äôs done for me.
"This is the best book I have read in years. If you feel that God's disposition towards you is always frustrated, indifferent, or upset this book shows you how to repent of your false view of God's love for his children. It is theologically rich while being accessible to the common reader. I would say the only problem is that the book should come in packs of two or three as you will be gifting this out to friends as soon as you finish. My wife and I bought three more as soon as we finished."
"So many of us struggle with the biblical fact of Christ‚Äôs loving heart toward us, and this book helped me make one more huge step toward understanding that in my functional faith, not just my confessional faith."
I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone that has a hearbeat. Take it slowly. Reread a lot. I've never highlighted so many passages in one book. I'm going to have to reread this book often. I pray the Lord will use this book to soften all his children's hearts and open our half-seeing eyes to see more of His glory.
"I love this book.  Like, it‚Äôs really good.  It‚Äôs the kind of book that‚Äôs meant to stir your affections for Jesus by holding high the very essence of who He is.  Each chapter is pretty short, and so you have time to reflect on what you‚Äôve just read.  I love that this book brings out some of the neglected aspects of Christ‚Äôs work, like his intercession and advocacy for His people.  This book is an absolute gem and is great for anyone who‚Äôs been bruised by the church, who feels broken, burnt out, ashamed, or discouraged."
I had heard good things about 'Gentle & Lowly' so far ordered myself a copy. And the seller sent me another book I was interested in on the Apostles Creed as a gift! I'm looking forward to reading both of these books very soon!
"Excellent book about the heart of God. A must read for everyone. If your view is that God is stern and disappointed in you, it‚Äôs crucial you read this book."
"This was so pleasantly surprised by how deep, theologic, pastoral, and encouraging this book was. If you‚Äôre looking to drink deeply of the grace of God, add this to your reading list."
This book is theologically rich and biblically insightful.  Powerful.  It provides deep pastoral care to the soul.  First I listened to the audio version of this book walking my dog at night.  It's read by the author.  Then I read the printed version to reinforce all I heard.  Listening to the audio was deeply encouraging.  Reading helped me retain and I could hear Pastor Ortlund's gracious tone.  This book truly reveals the heart of Christ to sinners and sufferers.  Get it.
"We can never understand the depths of Christ‚Äôs heart and love for us. This book gets you started digging instead of scratching the surface of what that depth looks like.  It encourages you to dig forever, knowing that you cannot possibly reach the bottom, but that the journey holds peace and joy in this life because of the finished hope of the next life."
"I liked that the author depicted Jesus Christ's heart for sinners.  He is gentle and tender in mercy.  Lastly, I liked that the author described the overlooked doctrines of intercession and advocacy."
The Biblical truths so eloquently described in this book are needed by all people. Come to the refreshing waters of Scripture and bask in the gentleness and love of God deftly communicated by Dr. Ortlund.
Absolutely loved this book.  God is present and wants to let us know that we can take heart that our sin does not hinder our ability to have a loving relationship with the God of the universe.  We can take God's yoke and live a gentle and lowly life full of joy.
"As a longtime Christian I thought I knew a lot about Jesus and perhaps I do.  But this book drew me in to know Jesus‚Äî his beating heart next to mine. Seriously, read this book and see Jesus in all his loving glory.  Life changing."
This book will penetrate your soul unlike any other. Especially if your image of God is like most people‚Äôs-someone ready to correct you and bring you in line with his list of rules.
"Even after following Christ for years, this book helped me realize I didn't understand grace and helped me SEE Christ. What does it feel like to walk with Him? Why is He stunning? The Lord has definitely used this book to bring me to my knees, blown away by God's character as He's revealed Himself in His Word. It is definitely a Bible-saturated presentation of the stunning nature of God."
I read this book 3 times so far. I keep reading it over and over again because it is such a beautiful portrait of our Savior. It is truly caused me to fall in love with Jesus in ways I've never known. It's also giving me confidence tocome to Jesus with my sins and brokenness and know that he won't turn me away. I cannot recommend this book enough. I would even go as far as saying it is in the top 10 books I've ever read.
"So many Christians, if they were honest, feel deep down they are not doing enough to deserve the love of Christ. This book dispels any notion that the love of Christ is conditional and is probably much greater than we could ever imagine."
"It is a wonderful book, I can‚Äôt recommend it enough, very well written. So much to evaluate in my own life and thoughts to ponder and encouraging in my Christian walk."
A must read.
"This book was a mandatory read for my office.  The plan was to speed read it and check it off.  Two chapters into it, I realized I needed to change my plan.  One chapter a day, writing on every page, re-calibrating my erroneous picture of Jesus, calling friends and encouraging them to buy the book, talking my home group into a group discussion around the book.  Wow!  Glad I was forced to read it."
Gently and Lowly is beautifully written and is filled with wisdom that I cherish.  This book was given to me as a gift and I‚Äôve purchased 3 new copies to share with others. Knowing the heart of Christ is a comfort to my soul.
"A must read for anyone carrying a burden of wounds, guilt, shame, disillusionment, and more.  It can be hard to remember Christ's heart to us when we feel this way.  This book is a reminder - a simple but powerful reminder.  Highly recommend."
This book is extraordinary. It is the most beautiful book I have ever read and has opened up dimensions of Jesus to me that I never dreamed possible.  I don't have words to describe this book. Just get it and see for yourself.  Magnificent.My heartfelt thanks to the author. WOW
"Clear, concise explanation of Christ's nature and full desire to be in relationship with you/me. No matter where you are in your walk this book breaks down the essential foundation of Christ's love."
Probably could have easily read Thomas Godwin‚Äôs books since he is quoted several times in all the chapters.  Easy read however.
I'm very easy reading book yet full of so many things I have failed to think about. a great book for those who have had faith for a long time or those that are early beginners in finding their way to Christ.
"A friend gifted me this book, and I read it last summer. I immediately let another friend borrow my copy. She still has it, so I bought a second, but I gave it away to my mom. So, I bought another copy for me and reread this month because it's just worth reading every year and giving a copy to all my friends."
Dane Ortland serves up an ice cold glass of the Living Water that flows from the heart of Jesus and refreshes like nothing else in the universe. Enjoy a deep drink.
"WOW! What a heart-warming view of our precious Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, Who knit us together in our mother‚Äôs womb and has a wonderful plan, hope, and future for each of us!"
Dane helps believers to see the good news of the gospel in a fresh way.  I left this book going to Jesus and loving Him more than I did.  A must read for every believer and unbeliever!
Excellent Book for Bible Study. Our Bible Study Group thought was the best book we have studied.Point‚òùÔ∏èJESUS‚ù§Ô∏è. Blessings üôè and Love ‚ù§Ô∏è Bill
"I love this book so much. I have struggled with how Jesus feels about me for most of journey with Him. This book brought me freedom and a new desire to just come to Jesus and continue to discover his Gentle and Lowly heart for me. You wont regret reading this book slowly, purposefully, and with open heart for God."
"This is rich and real, an exquisite picture of God's irrational love for us. I've read it on Kindle, and today I'm ordering a hardbound copy to re-read and mark up. Dane Ortlund gives the church a blessed gift, revelation of a salvation beyond our wildest imaginings."
Love this book!! Taking a deeper look at the heart of Christ and his love and compassion for us sinners.  We have ordered several of this book for friends.
"This book was suggested for our worship volunteer as a group read early in 2020.  How amazing of a gift this book was at the time and throughout the year of 2020 helping us all be encouraged and consistently reminded that God is near.  There is an invitation in the book to slow down, be still, and allow the Lord near.  What an incredible blessing."
"This is one of those life changing books you keep coming back to since it contains such indispensible truth. Written in a clear and understandible style, it contains helpful insights into how we should see our Savior and ourselves. I love the many references to the Puritans, which reminds us that these truths are not some new revelation, but have been embraced by other faithful individuals who have gone before us."
"This book revolutionized my view of Jesus‚Äô love for me. It was difficult to read many times...through my tears of joy and relief. Jesus loves me this I know...but this book helped take it to another level. My sin and weaknesses don‚Äôt repel Christ from me...it is the very thing that moves Him towards me. Hallelujah, what a savior!"
"Tremendously impactful book on the heart of Christ. Every chapter speaks to your heart and opens (re-opens) your eyes, heart, mind to the wonderful heart of Christ. Pick up and read and encouraged!"
I love everything about this book. If you really read it and just let go of any unbelief this book will speak to your innermost self and show you a love for Jesus you never knew
"Besides the Bible , this is the best book I‚Äôve read! It has answered ever question I‚Äôve ever had about my sins and unnecessary suffering. Truly a must have. One falls in love with Christ all over again.  Love this book."
"What a work of scholastic depth, with fresh insight. I‚Äôm going to read it again, and again, in order to allow the heart of Christ to be made more alive to me."
"Great book and I love how he talks about who Jesus really is a very strong man, but so very kind especially to the hurting."
I like how I learned about God's gentle and lowly spirit! It is.very biblical and it opened my eyes to.who God.really.is!There was some things I didn't know about resurrection and crucifixion that I learned and helped me understand GOd more!
Here the common perceptions of how we view God's character are peeled back. They are then replaced with beautiful pictures from the Scriptures of who our God in Christ really is.  No wonder so many have recommended this book. So thankful.
I have read and purchased several of this book to give in recent months. One of the best teachings understanding the heart of Jesus and our position in Him. Actually received some healing personally as well as the people I gave the book to. I would recommend to anyone.
"Ortlund elucidates his points well, but perhaps too verbosely and perhaps with too little velocity. I think that I would have enjoyed the book more if it were shorter, but I don‚Äôt think that Ortlund would have achieved his goal in this case of deeply studying the heart of God in Scripture. I think that, given the author‚Äôs goals, I liked this book as much as I could have."
"Very difficult to put down, I highly recommend it to everyone. It discusses something we all need to learn and remember as we go through this life.Edit: I liked this book so much I bought a hard copy and shipped it to my mom so she could enjoy it too"
"Please, read this book. It has been very transformative for me spiritually. If you are struggling with sin, read this book, if you are suffering read this book, if you are weary and heavy laden, read this book. It takes you into the heart of Christ, and there displays the riches of God‚Äôs indescribable love. I‚Äôm rereading it, half way through already."
Solid gospel that gave me a more accurate (and life-changing) understanding of Messiah‚Äôs love for me.  Wonderfully accessible yet accurate use of the Puritans on this subject.
"What a joy to read! The heart of Christ is lovingly explained by Dane Ortlund, with biblical examples and clear passages from several  Puritan writers.  An excellent read any time or season."
I loved this book! Such a new and deep perspective of God's love. I will read and reread this book to remind me of God's heart toward me. The author uses scripture and references to back up every point he is trying to convey. Great read.
"This book is one of the most thought-provoking books I‚Äôve ever read. Every chapter takes you deep into the character in the work of Jesus Christ. Every chapter leaves you in utter amazement at His grace, His mercy, and His love. It‚Äôs not a book you read in a week, but a book you chew on for weeks."
Our church small group is reading this book together.  It teaches how gentle and humble Jesus is towards us.
"Such a beautiful reminder of how Jesus sees us. Short chapters, based in scripture, expounded in knowledge. I love it so far."
I honestly found this book to be refreshing and helpful in my walk with our Lord. It was truly a book to really take your time and soak it up along with your Bible.
One of the most insightful books I have read in the last few years. In the tradition of the meditations of thoughtful/insightful believers over the centuries.
"This was a great read. Nicely builds up the case for the love of God to sinners. Helped me to see it once again from the angle of not losing salvation which the author clearly states toward the end. I am convinced God loves me but still find myself wanting to reconcile some verses that indicate you can lose salvation, nonetheless this is an exceptional book on the heart of God for us and highly recommend it."
"If you‚Äôve wondered what the heart of Jesus is like, get this book. It‚Äôs a gentle read, no rockets or fireworks. Just great insight into how Christ cares for you."
One of the best books I‚Äôve ever read. Helped me to see Jesus for who He really is versus how I was raised to view Him. I will read and re-read this one!
"This book is incredible. Probably the best book I have ever read on God and His heart. It is gospel centered, the gospel is the heart of this book."
"Dane Ortlund has written a treasure.  A window into the very heart of Jesus, who doesn't cringe at our sin and brokenness but meets us in the middle of it, then lovingly restores us.  Powerful and insightful book that I will recommend to many."
"This is the most encouraging book. There‚Äôs so much to think about, shifting my perspective about who Christ is and how much He loves me, that I‚Äôm reading it slowly, with prayer. I‚Äôve already bought copies for several friends, because I‚Äôm keeping this one!"
This is a fantastic book. Gives you a great study on the heart of Christ. It's so encouraging.
"Enjoyable, refreshing, encouraging.  An uplifting visit to Puritan authors regarding God's character and attitude toward us."
Wish I had read a book like this years ago. Excellent!  It is well worth sharing with friends and family.
An excellent book with trustworthy sources. A very intimate look into the Savior‚Äôs heart.
A beautifully written book whick seeks to reprocess Puritan teaching for 21st Century readers. It is wonderfully successful. It deepens and reinforces faith and love for Jesus. I feel deeply enriched for having read it.It is written with real clarity. It is a great book and one that I shall read again and again.
Our family ladies are enjoying a Zoom meeting with the book. New insights about Jesus. Wonderful!
"Dane has the ability to articulate the heart of our God in ways that not only give me rest, but encourage me to offer His love to others more sincerely because I comprehend His love to a new level.  His ‚Äúsearching‚Äù the Scriptures has given me a new understanding of familiar passages. Thanks be to God!"
A boring read
"This book reminded me of truths about God that I ""knew"" but didn't really KNOW. The short chapters make you feel accomplished. Feels like you can read a little bit every day, or you could read a couple chapters a day and it wouldn't feel like a lot. I want to read this at the beginning of the year every year now, and it will probably be my new go-to book for people."
"Love, love this book. Best book I have read in a LONG time. In addition to my book, I have ordered 4 more for friends so far."
This book is a very enjoyable read. Great use of vocabulary - truly paints a picture of God's love for us. This book was given to me by my Pastor-  who read it and then reread it as soon as he finished it. I loved it and bought a copy for my dad who is also re-reading it just after he finished it the first time!
"Excellent exposure about the heart of Christ. The author helps us to see.the compassionate - tender and slow to anger heart of our lovely Lord. What I get from the.book is that I can go to Him, to His heart no the time I'm living."
This book is incredibly well written. It was a great reminder of who Christ is and what His heart is toward us. This book will likely be a Christian classic!
"This precious writing is deep and yet movingly transforming as it shows us the very heart of Jesus! I have known Him, loved Him; served and taught about Him for most of my life but now I weep anew to almost feel the beat of His loving heart!"
Now reading this book and finding it  sheds light on the comfort Christ came to bring.
great for those who struggle with understanding that God loves them and that they are His!
"This is a fantastic and challenging read. Ortlund helped me break down preconceived notions about God's disposition towards my life, sin, and heart. I would (and do) advise this as a must read to anyone who is seeking God."
"Wonderful book, look forward to reading it in the new year with a friend!"
This is a great book that will help anyone understand or re-focus on the true heart of God.
A five star review is an easy choice. With the help of a host of Puritans Dane Outland paints a beautifully attractive picture of Jesus that could make any aching heart long to be closer to him.
Definitely shows a different side of how we usually relate to Jesus. Must read.
"Saw this book reviewed in a magazine and bought it on a whim. Only two or three times in my life have I felt that the Spirit was changing me as I read a book outside the Bible (and I am a regular, disciplined reader). Don‚Äôt plan to read this book in one day, but don‚Äôt quit once you start. You won‚Äôt be the same when you finish."
Amazing book. Eye opening and insightful. I recommend all Christians read this book. Ortlund does a great job of taking our eyes from the mundane tepid view of Gods love for us in Christ and showing his true love for Sinners.
Very comforting for those going through a rough time in their life.
Probably the best book of the summer. I given several copies away.
"Amazing book and journey into the heart of Christ! Praise God for Dane Ortlund. This book is necessary reading for everyone, but especially those who have trouble truly connecting and understanding the Lord‚Äôs love for them. This is not a book about doing, but a book about basking‚Äî basking in the love of Christ for you! Enjoy and be blessed!"
"Found myself thanking God for gifting this author to articulate scripture so elegantly. After a skydive once, I found myself saying, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go again!!‚Äù I feel the same way about this book."
This book has vaulted to #1 in my recommendation list.  My heart has been moved.  This should be on everyone‚Äôs must read list.
"This book is an incredible comfort to the soul. Whether you have been a believer for years or months, you will grow in your amazement of Jesus and Who He Is / What He Has Done For You."
"I bought this book from Crossway, not Amazon simply because it was out of stock on Amazon at the time I needed it. This is a good book to get to get a handle on how the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit think and feel about us.  I recommend it for that purpose as we often are far better at grasping that the wages of sin is death and not so much that there is now no condemnation to those that are in Christ Jesus.However, and this is a big however, there are some rather significant theological issues in how the author describes the nature of God.  The author in many locations describes or implies a heirarchical nature to the attributes (or essences, if you prefer) of God.  Another issue is that the author posits that the sinner receives more of God when the sinner sins and that God cannot truly be or express himself in his fullness unless we sin.I put the final issue by itself because I don't want to speak comprehensively about the book with regard to this one.  It is that (I think in chapter 5), the author references a phrase from Hebrews 5:2 and builds several paragraphs on that phrase; however, the author incorrectly assigns the subject of the quote as Jesus Christ, when the context of the passage states it to be human high priests, aka the Aaronic line vs a priest after the order of Melchisedec.Overall, it's a good book but with some fairly serious issues that could lead people into pretty serious wrong theology if they are not aware ahead of time."
"About half way through and as someone who doesn't identify as christian, the first chapter almost reduced me to tears. If you are someone who knows people who don't belong to the faith and don't feel adept at sharing the gospel this is a great book to share."
"This book has clarified and balanced my theology. My love for Jesus has grown, and I now have a clear understanding that the only thing He is asking of me is to recognize my need an dependence of Him. Praise God for this book!"
Dane is now one of my top authors. This book is incredible!
This book is well worth the read. Fascinating and careful look at specific texts in Scripture on the heart of Christ.
Beautifully written! I would highly recommend this book.
"instant classic says it all! Oh yeah, and your whole understanding of God will change if you even suspected that he was a monster who hated you and wants nothing more than for you to ""do more and be better"". SCRIPTURAL & JESUS-CENTERED & GOSPEL-BASED TO THE CORE."
I've read hundreds of Christian books and have never read one that addresses the heart of Christ as well as the Christian's identity in Christ. Our whole church staff is reading and I strongly recommend!
"This book was much more than I could have hoped for. The message just sits with you, leaving you no choice but to surrender to the One whose heart is utterly gentle and lowly and who beckons us everlastingly so, to come."
What a lovely read! It points you to the true heart of Jesus! It will encourage you tremendously.
"I now have a greater understanding of the heart of Jesus.  Knowing what I now know has affected my relationships with others, especially my children. I want them to know of the love of Jesus by the way I love them. My ability to love them is heightened by my knowledge of how Jesus loves me. This is a great study and I highly recommend it."
"I highly recommend this book, Gentle and Lowly. I brought encouragement for my wife and I when we really needed it. It shows examples of Jesus's true heart and how He cares for us in our time of disappointment and discouragement. I highly recommend this book."
"Great book, especially for anyone struggling with their Christianity."
Using this book in a small group bible study!  Very Good!
"This book gave me the hope and courage to believe that even someone as sinful as me could be forgiven.  If you have a terrible sin past,  this book will lead you to the very heart of Jesus."
This has to be. One of the best books I‚Äôve read in years. Wonderful. If you wonder about Jesus and his true character please pick this up. I will be reading this again likely several times.
Book arrived on time and was in fine shape as advertized.
"I bought this book to get a more in depth understanding of how vast the love of Jesus is for us. It doesn‚Äôt fail in any way to instill just that, that His heart for us is way beyond what we could ever imagine. My faith is being strengthened in so many ways as is my desire to become closer to God."
The Spirit moves through this book.  Christ's heart for His people.  WowThe chapters are small and the verse references are simple.  So read it slowly and let it reverberate.  Ortlund does a masterful job of expounding and complimenting Biblical truths with the heartbeat of a living God.
Wonderful book. Highly recommended. Great insight into the love of Christ.
"Salve for the heart wounded by legalism or any other bad teaching. A blaring signpost to the heart of God for a broken world. Buy it, read it, then read it again"
I have been a follower of Jesus for many years.  This small book is a wonderful reminder of the true heart of our Savior.  ‚ÄúCome to me all who are weary...‚Äù  Matthew 11:28
"As I read more and more of this book, I see the heart of my Savior centrally displayed in His Word. Phenomenal book and great intro into future readings of Puritan writers!"
"Helpful to remind you or tell you for the first time maybe, that Jesus‚Äô love for you is deep and his heart for you is kind and compassionate and your shortcomings and failures should never keep you from coming to him."
I LOVED this book! Highly recommend!
"Unique,  in helping you see the compassionate heart of Jesus for you and others. Very grace-filled and theologically sound."
I am about to read it again! It is that good!
This book is startlingly helpful to a Christian who has trouble trusting that God's grace and lovingkindness are for her!
A true journey through Scripture to the heart of Christ led by godly thinkers of the past and present. Ortlund‚Äôs humble and straightforward writing engaged my mind and heart. A book I will re-read again and again.
To try to even get a glimpse of our Fathers love for us is to lofty to attain.  Thank you for showing us His Heart and that it really is gentle and lowly!!
This book takes some of the most easily skipped over verses and highlights the importance of them. I never knew how little I about Jesus until I read this
This is an excellent book about the Lord Jesus Christ. Provides information about the heart of Jesus and how his followers can pray for a heart similar to His full of love and compassion.
"Was very excited to receive this package today, only to open it up and find it damaged. I love to be able to open a gift in the mail that has been nicely protected and handled with care."
Searching for confirmation of Gods love and forgiveness.  Currently reading for third time. Did not complete before I started re-reading.  What a gem!
One of the best spiritual books I have ever read!! Best understanding of God‚Äôs love.
I love this gem.
Just as promised
Awesome book that is very uplifting. It is very easy to read and understand.
This is a book to read slowly and more than once.  It is an uplifting view of God and Jesus that is not often communicated from pulpits or other Christian sources.  Well worth the cost and the time spent studying it and considering the powerful and comforting truths it offers.
"Such and encouragement for a hurting heart. A clear presentation of Christ, as He is, rather than how we so often imagine Him to be."
Ortlund resurrects the great writers of the past and weds them to the eternal words of scripture for the reader today. Thank you for clearing the path to the gentle and lowly heart of Jesus!
Great book
"Thoroughly biblical, a balm for the soul. An intriguing look into God's heart that attempts to rewire faulty thought patterns about God and his approach to people."
"Gentle and Lowly is a paradigm-altering, revisit over-and-over kind of book.With beautiful language and many wonderful excerpts from Puritan writing, Dane masterfully paints the picture of God‚Äôs loving heart.I promise you will not be disappointed if you read it."
I love this book.  It opens up one‚Äôs eyes to the depth of Christ‚Äôs love for his own and of God‚Äôs commitment to the plan of Salvation in an easy to understand writing. Dane Ortlund .
"This was such an accessible, rich, gospel-centered, and devastatingly powerful look into God‚Äôs heart for us. It helped me to confront and un-learn some subtly false things I didn‚Äôt even realize I believed about the Father until I faced them in this book. Can‚Äôt recommend this book enough!"
I can't say enough good things. Dane echoes the text of scriptures as he reminds us of the heart of God towards his people. Its a book I will return to often.
Excellent book
"Reading through this book showed me a side to The Trinity that I often overlook. The author pulls from Scripture and several theologians in order to give a truthful account of the heart of God.  I highly recommend this book to anyone struggling to see the ""human"" side of God."
"Good read, enjoyed this book."
A beautifully written book that expounds upon so much scripture to show me more of the heart of Christ than I had even dreamed.  Certainly in my top 5 favorite books.  I will be coming back to this one many times over.
"I have just finished reading this book, through many tears.Tears because I believe after walking with the Lord for nearly 30 years I had forgotten how much he loves us. Thank you Dane for using the English language in such a beautiful way."
Absolutely A Great Read If you want to know about Jesus and the Trinity !!!!!!!!
This book does a wonderful job to help believers have a deeper understanding of the true heart of Christ and the depth of His love for His children
"This book has given me such a fresh perspective on the person of Christ- His heart for sinners and sufferers. I recommend this book to anyone, but especially those struggling to balance ""truth and grace"". 10/10"
"This has been the only book my traumatized fractured mind has been able to read and take in. I can sit and read a sentence or two and be blessed and refocused, or I can read multiple chapters and have to force myself to move on with my day."
We will be reading and rereading of our assurance in Heaven.  Accept Jesus Christ as your savior and read! Amen!
This book was a salve to my soul. Rest in Christ. His love for me is greater than . . .
Highly recommended to draw your thoughts heavenward!
"The most uplifting, hopeful book I've read in a long time--and it's all right out of Scripture! Thank you for writing this book! I really needed to hear these words."
Read this book if you want to know the TRUE heart of Christ for his flock!
This book came highly recommended and it did not disappoint.
"Beautiful, biblical, doctrinally sound theological treatment of Christ‚Äôs heart for His children."
"Gentle and Lowly is a must read for anyone who wants a deeper knowledge and understanding on the heart of Jesus. This book is packed with emotional biblical truth, if you will soak in the teaching this book can be life changing."
"Very few books like this one - to be read, meditated on, rejoiced in,  and returned to often!  Best book I've encountered on Christ yet- - for it is not about what he has done, but about who HE is!"
Love this book. Beautiful book.
Would recommend this to really study the heart of Jesus. This book really allowed me to examine some hard truths but also rest in those truths.
"It's silly to review this book. It's silly because it's simply beautiful, and to parse it is a practice in poverty.Sorry, I let alliteration carry me away. Seriously, though, I'll be reading this book regularly."
"No, do not get the library copy. This book is personal. You'll want to let your tears hit the page and journal in the margins the goodness of God. Completely changed how I see the person and heart of Christ for me, in me, and to me <3"
Can‚Äôt wait to start reading
A great and revealing book on the love of God for humanity. Very practical and balanced presentation of mercy and truth. The book left me wanting to learn more about the heart of Christ for me
Great read and look into God‚Äôs heart!
This is a great book.  Speaks about the loving heart of Jesus.
"If you struggle with self-condemnation or wear yourself out trying to do everything right, this is the book for you."
"You will simply not regret buying and reading this book. If you want to feel Christ's love for you, take and read."
"This book took me to the depths of Jesus‚Äô heart for us, sinners. Hands down the best christian books I‚Äôve ever read. I used it as a devotional and read a chapter every morning, and it changed the way I go about my day! GET THIS BOOK!"
This is a much needed push back against our natural tendency to cast God more in our image than his own.  If you have ever doubted that God could truly love you (or even like you!) then this is a must read.
In my top ten.
"23 short, sweet and filling chapters that remind you of the great love of God for us in Christ Jesus. As a pastor, this was so good for my heart."
"A beautiful reflection on Christ's deep love foreigners that never cheapens His love by poo-pooing sin.Short chapters make it an inviting read, and wonderful phrases make it beautiful read."
"This book reminded me‚Äîand showed me‚Äîhow much Jesus loves me. I am recommending it to everyone in my church. I will also be using it for counseling, especially for those who are struggling with accepting God‚Äôs forgiveness or who are suffering."
Excellent look at the heart of Jesus.  Biblical and comforting.
"This book didn‚Äôt enlighten me to the love of Jesus, it flood-lightened me into His love.  This book didn‚Äôt lead me to the water of understanding his kindness and mercy, it propelled me into its ocean depths!"
Great content.  Deeply encouraging and by no means superficial or trite.  Recommend to all who desire to know King Jesus!
"This book is life giving and life changing!  What an amazing and Biblical view of who Jesus is, at His very heart.  Gentle and Lowly...thank you!"
You can read this book like any other book or slowly savor and meditate through it's chapters and sometimes even a single paragraph.
Great book. It truly displays the beauty of God found in Jesus.
I am not a theologian. This book explains many important ideas about Christ and brings in the writing of Puritans.  I have been touched by this book. It has spurred my love for Christ.
"Ortlund gives a beautiful dissection of the gentleness of God's heart and how He yearns for us. He uses scripture, sermons, and other theological writings to grip the reader with the true nature of God's heart."
Very uplifting and enlightening. It will be a book worth reading many times over! Highly recommend to all who want to know the fullness of Jesus love!!
I know God's heart for me more because of these pages.
This book is a must for every Christian. Today is my 70th birthday. I truly grieve that I was unable to read this book in my 20's. What a difference it would have made in my Christian walk.
"Everyone who finds themselves doubting the grace and mercy of God should read this book.  I will especially remember the instruction given to us in the epilog, 1.  Go to Jesus.  2.  See #1."
"A wonderful book about the heart of Jesus Christ which is theologically accurate as well as an interesting, easy read!"
One of the best surprise reads as of late. Theologically sound. Great for those in reformed circles. Great compilation of puritans and other great thinkers.
One of the best and most eye opening books on the character of God and heart of Christ I have read. So encouraging and worthy of reading again and again to remember the solid biblical truths therein.
This is a book for anyone who loves Christ.  This is a book for anyone who does not love Christ.  It is a book to read repeatedly.  I recommend it highly.
"Loved the heart of this book, to push us believers to Jesus‚Äô heart for his as we live for His glory!"
Was very comforting to know the love of Jesus and His heart of love for me and all who come to Him.
I loved this book and used it in a book club with a college group and it was so fantastic in changing my perception of Christ and His heart for people.
I would highly recommend this book. It would make for a great morning devotional as well as a good read throughout the day.
Best modern day book on suffering.
Just finished the book yesterday. So good that I‚Äôm rereading it already.
Never have I read a book that unpacks the heart Jesus as this book has. Highly recommend for all believers.
"Stunning. I do not have adequate words to describe the beauty and depth of this written work. Life-transforming for sure. All glory to our risen Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ."
This is easily one of the most life-changing books I have ever read! I read multiple sections many times just to grasp the truth more fully and let it really sink in and be transformative.
"As a Christian, this booked opened my eyes to who Jesus is more so than any other source I have ever read. I enjoyed every word!"
"I recommend this book to any person, believer and unbeliever alike, who wants to know more of this God-man, Jesus.You will be amazed."
Read this book because it was recommended by friend It did not disappoint
"You guys delivered greatly with this one, very timely delivery, and this is ""one great book""!!!!!"
"Beautiful, poignant, insightful it brought  me to tears many times. For anyone seeking the heart of Christ this is for you."
With each chapter of the reading of this book felt like a warm hug from Jesus.
Wrecked my heart in such a good way. Highly recommend this book. Be prepared to learn about God's heart for you. Such a blessing!
Great book! A must to truly slow down and connect.
I have to read each chapter like 3 times because it‚Äôs THAT good and rich! Love this book and the way it‚Äôs helping me know the heart of God through Christ.
"Great book! I am now reading many of the Puritan authors mentioned in this book, especially John Bunyan. Good sound theology and doctrine is a comfort and a blessing."
This book is a must read for all Christians.  It is such a beautifully written book and gives a great glimpse at the heart of Christ.
"If you let the truths sink in, it will deeply move and change you. You will be surprised by who you thought Jesus was versus who He actually is."
"In a season where I have never felt more defeated, Ortlund, has taken me by the hand and with the Lord‚Äôs help lifted my eyes to show me the heart of Christ."
This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. I highly recommend it. It will comfort you and help you get to know Christ's heart better.
We are held.We are loved unconditionally.We can truly rest knowing his heart is for us.Read this boom!
"This is simply an amazing book. It will be a book I read over and over, year by year. God bless you Dane Ortlund."
Fabulous book. Tried to order more but out of stock formie
Quite the gem. Totally recommend.
Great for a new Christian or a seasoned one. To see the heart of Christ so beautifully summarized brings so much adoration to our Lord.
"Breakthrough in understanding grace and that Believers are Christ‚Äôs spouse. Rich, powerful, deep!! Read slowly, one chapter at a time."
This is the most beautiful reflection of the heart of Jesus who is most attracted to us in our brokenness.
Beautiful book. Very helpful.
"I can't imagine all the people who reviewed this book have actually read it.  It is laborious to read, made a minor doctrine an issue of heresy,  excessively draws on the writings of man to build its theology, and reads like one of my least favorite seminary textbooks where it sounds academic in tone, but it leaves me unable it to my life in any tangible way.  However, the author did state in the epilogue that to try to apply this book to one's life is to trivialize is purpose.  I'm not sure the point of a deep theological study then, if it isn't for application.Now if the theological concepts had been presented in such a way that could be understood by those without advanced-level vocabulary and theological background, there might be something useful in this book.  However, it certainly shouldn't be marketed for the ""common"" Christian."
I am thoroughly impressed with this book.  Very well written and destined to be a classic! Can‚Äôt recommend it enough!
highly recommended devotional reading.
Wonderful book!  I would encourage everyone to read it.
"A must read! Will be rereading this book more than a few times, and the short chapters work great on breaks."
Truly one of the five best books I‚Äôve read in the past 20 years.  Recommend it to everyone.
No other book I've read has helped me understood who God is more clearly. A wonderful book that will surely bless any who reads it.

Outstanding book
As a gift
"After seeing so many rave reviews of this book, I really wanted to like it. I went into it excited -- it is beautifully designed and its thesis sounded excellent (a series of meditations on the heart of Christ as ""gentle and lowly""? Sign me up!). And for the first five or so chapters, it was indeed quite wonderful and encouraging....Then Ortlund finally started tipping his hand more with his Calvinistic theology. I knew it was coming (he's a TGC guy and quotes extensively from the Puritans, after all), but I was hoping it would stay more ""off-screen,"" so to speak. Unfortunately, and frustratingly, there are many points throughout the book where he promotes the idea of ""once saved, always saved,"" aka eternal security, merely asserting it as ""a glorious doctrine, a true doctrine"" (pg. 65) with scant exegetical support. Ortlund is happy to camp on John 6 or Ephesians 2 for a chapter, but he studiously avoids all talk of such passages as John 15, Hebrews 6, or 2 Peter 2. There aren't quite as many places where he reveals his Calvinist view of election/predestination, but they're lurking there, too.The reason this is a big enough problem for me to spend a review on it is that Ortlund's book will leave hundreds or maybe even thousands of casual readers feeling so awed by his beautiful prose that they will simply assume his theological propositions are right without actually considering the contrary biblical data that pose difficulties for his system. The main such difficulty being: How is it that God truly is love and is so full of lavish mercy toward sinners and prodigals, and yet he also (in Ortlund's theology, at least) unconditionally rejects millions of them to send them to hell for eternity apart from any choice of theirs? Discerning readers will be able to step back and consider whether Ortlund's striking presentation of Christ's deep and rich mercy can possibly be true apart from a non-Calvinist understanding of election, or whether the pairing of such lavish love with the doctrine of unconditional election would more naturally lead to something like universalism. But for those who aren't attuned to such theological considerations, Ortlund's book unfairly stacks the deck.So all in all, if you are already a Calvinist, this will likely be one of your favorite books ever. Ortlund's lovely prose and abundance of quotes from the Puritans will tickle your every fancy. If you're not a Calvinist, on the other hand, this book will leave you quite frustrated and at a loss for what to do with it other than admire the pretty cover and maybe enjoy a quote or two from the fifty percent of the book that's useful."
"Dr. Dane Ortlund has gained a reputation for writing Christian books that are solid, edifying, and gospel-centered. His newest work, Gentle and Lowly: The Heart of Christ for Sinners and Suffers is No Exception. Ortlund uses Matthew 11:29 as the basis for his writing:Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.The author writes, ‚ÄúThis book is written for the discouraged, the frustrated, the weary, the disenchanted, the cynical, the empty. Those running on fumes.‚Äù Ultimately, Ortlund is jealous to draw the attention of readers to the heart of Jesus Christ.23 chapters await readers who will be captivated, encouraged, and loved y their Savior. Some readers will need to readjust what they have previously learned about Jesus and move in a more biblically oriented direction. Ideally, this book should be read one chapter at time, in a devotional sort of way. Such an approach will allow the mind to be sufficiently instructed and the heart to be filled with encouragement.A few citations will give a sense of the tone and direction the book takes:""Jesus is not trigger-happy. Not harsh, reactionary, easily exasperated. he is the most understanding person in the universe.""""The Jesus given to us in the Gospels is not simply the one who loves, but one who is love; merciful affections stream from his innermost heart as rays from the sun.""""It is impossible for the affectionate heart of Christ to be over-celebrated, made too much of, exaggerated.""""Jesus Christ is closer to you today than he was to the sinners and suffers he spoke with and touched his earthly ministry.""""If God sent his own Son to walk through the valley of condemnation, rejection, and hell, you can trust him as you walk through your own valleys on the way to heaven.""Gentle and Lowly: The Heart of Christ for Sinners and Sufferers is packed with heart-warming scholarship and Christology that moves the soul. It is eminently practical and encouraging from start to finish. It will prove to be one of the most important Christian books in 2020!"
"Dane Ortlund‚Äôs new book, Gentle and Lowly: The Heart of Christ for Sinners and Sufferers, now shares top place as my all-time favorite book in the ‚Äúfeed my soul‚Äù book category of my library.In its 23 brief chapters, this book is filled with soul-nourishing insights on the heart of Jesus for every one of His followers. I love the way that in this book the key insights in each chapter are built out of texts of Scripture and are expressed in a manner which fuels personal worship of the Lord Jesus.The uniqueness of this book is how it immerses the reader into the inner life of Jesus ‚Äî with the aim of igniting the experiences of peace and joy as a deepened understanding of the infinite love of Christ for His redeemed people is unfolded.I cannot recommend this book too highly! It is a literary feast of Christ-glorifying and believer-nourishing treasures that have been mined from texts throughout the Bible ‚Äî as well as the foundational insights of a variety of Puritan writers -- most extensively of which come from Thomas Goodwin in his book The Heart of Christ. Dane Ortlund‚Äôs new book will, I believe, become a classic in the years to come. It truly is that good! As a result, I want to commend Crossway for publishing this book as a hardback ‚Äî as it is of such great value that I intend on coming back to its pages regularly as fuel for my growth in Christ."
"I would have given this book fewer stars but I do think that it is a good read for the target audience - Reformed Christians who lean more towards Calvinistic theologies. My parents gifted me this book with proclamations of ""This is the best book we've ever read,"" ""It is blowing our minds"" and, ""We've never heard these teachings before."" My parents have been Christians for nearly 40 years and have been in Reformed circles for at least the last 10, so it is a more than a little distressing that any of the information in this little book was shocking to them. In fact, after finishing this book I am stuck between anger and heartbreak that it is so groundbreaking for them. None of the teachings in the book were new to me and I was actually pleasantly surprised by how often I found myself nodding in agreement with what the author was saying. The lack of this sort of teaching is partially to blame for my departure from the main theologies of Calvinism so I'm glad to see that this book exists.HOWEVER, despite the many times I agreed with the book, there were also many times that I nearly threw it across the room. The book contains multiple instances of cognitive dissonance. It is not odd for the author to spend multiple pages making a (usually) excellent point and then suddenly destroy that point with a single line or paragraph. When I was in Reformed circles many of these issues were explained to me as ""two sides of the same coin."" However, since it has been years since that was the water in which I was swimming, these issues leapt from the page as being inconsistencies which cannot be logically explained.Also of note is that every theologian/author/preacher referenced in this book is a white male of European decent and some of them had rather problematic views on slavery. Non-white theologians existed long before white theologians. I'm sure Mr. Ortlund would have found some Black and Brown theologians to include in the book if he had thought to look.Finally, as a woman, I often felt like this book was not for me. In fact, I almost checked to make sure that it wasn't specifically listed as a men's book. I've been a paramedic working in a ""man's world"" for nearly 20 years and I've never felt more overlooked and unwelcome as I did while reading this book. This could have easily been avoided by making sure that the vast majority of the illustrations didn't use male pronouns. I didn't need this book to specifically address ""women's issues,"" I just needed it to acknowledge that women do exist as members of society."
"For devotional literature, this book is surprisingly not lame. Its use of Puritan writing in particular gives it some grounding in the past and helps to swerve it away from the hoke of most contemporary popular Christian writing.As for its theology, it presents a softer side of Calvinism. Though reformed, Ortlund emphasizes the doctrine of perseverance more than the more familiar and harsher Calvinist doctrines of limited atonement and the predestination of some to damnation. As such, the book's errors are primarily the errors of Calvinism: in particular, the idea that if you're elect, nothing you do can lead to forfeiting your salvation. This is meant to be comforting. If you are struggling with sin or doubting your salvation, rest easy knowing that nothing can remove you from the safe hands of the Lord. Of course, if you ever do lose your faith and die in a state of unbelief, then you weren't really saved to begin with.Ortlund also wants his readers to know that at core God is not wrathful but merciful. But if God is primarily merciful and desires at heart to forgive, why would He pre-determine the damnation of billions of human beings?"
"Have read it and I am disappointed with the abandonment of classic theism, and the doctrine of adoption, for emotional pictures of who God is. It should only be used to exercise ones discernment."
"I was excited to read this book but I couldn't get through the narrow reformed theology. I had to quit. Admittedly, if I get a whiff of reformed theology it's hard for me to get through because it's done so much damage to Christianity. My advice, read Henri Nouwen instead of this book. You'll get a broader and deeper understanding of this topic."
"There is not enough space to list all the books that have been written about Jesus. Of writings about his person and his work there is no end. Yet this is the first time I can recall ever reading a book simply about who Jesus is, about his very heart. What attitude or temperament does Jesus have? Is he cold and firm, hardened off by his holy expectations and a humanity that has never once met them? Is he barely keeping it together, frustrated beyond words by his dense disciples and their continuing inability to understand or obey him? Or is he merely disinterested in us, come here by the Father‚Äôs bidding to do a job that he just wants to finish and return to glory?Dane Ortlund‚Äôs recent Gentle and Lowly: The Heart of Christ for Sinners and Sufferers is a book-length reflection on Matthew 11:29 where Jesus actually just tells us what his heart is toward us: ""‚Ä¶I am gentle and lowly in heart"" (ESV). Ortlund points out that Jesus didn‚Äôt actually need to ever tell us what his heart disposition toward us is, but he does, and it takes us by surprise. After all, if we take God‚Äôs holiness and our own sinfulness seriously, we expect wrath toward us for our waywardness and selfishness. Yet this is not what we find at all, and Jesus comes to us with words of comfort and kindness. His disposition is one of compassion.The book unpacks various aspects of what this means for us and the various questions it might raise in our minds (""Well ok, but what about God the Father?""), as well as how it affects how we walk through our lives. There can actually be a sense of trust toward Jesus rather than of trepidation. One of the most helpful things for me that Ortlund addressed is that while there is a place for judgment toward sinners, judgment is really God‚Äôs ""strange"" work while his natural work is mercy. He wants to know and be known by his people, and while judgment of sin is the natural outworking of him being just, it is not what he wishes to do.I found the language of judgment as his ""strange work"" to be immensely helpful and even comforting, but also instructive to me as a father. I‚Äôve grappled with how to feel toward my children when it seems like they constantly vacillate between disobedience and obedience, and I have to toggle in and out of correction mode. It is easy for the day to get into a place where I feel like I‚Äôm constantly correcting them and so my heart becomes anything but gentle or lowly; I‚Äôm irritated and on edge. To think of my correction of my children as ""strange work""‚Äîsomething I engage in because I must as a responsible father, but not a natural posture‚Äîfinally resolves the tension in my mind between grace and justice toward my children.The other interesting thing about the way Ortlund puts the book together is that each chapter reads and explains scripture with a different Puritan writer, so it‚Äôs not really a book about what the Puritans thought about Jesus‚Äô heart, but it‚Äôs also more than just random citations of historical authors to lend an air of pedigree. His brother Gavin Ortlund published a book last year, Theological Retrieval for Evangelicals (which I reviewed here), which is all about the need to not disconnect our devotional and theological thinking from the past, but to answer our questions alongside Christians from the past. The brothers Ortlund must have a common agenda, because I couldn‚Äôt help but notice how excellent an example Gentle and Lowly is of doing exactly this sort of theological retrieval.The book is simple and straightforward, and I‚Äôm glad I read it. I easily commend it to you as well.DISCLAIMER: I received a copy of this book from the publisher for the purpose of a fair, unbiased review."
"Like many, I had been waiting in anticipation for this book for about a year. I knew something of what the subject matter would be, and couldn't wait to finally read it. When I finally sat down and read all the way through, I was genuinely at a loss of words. It came up to and exceeded my hopes, and, even better, it opened up a new door of communion with Christ in the wonder of His heart.I believe the book is an instant classic. I am slow to say it (but say it I will), I would place this on the SAME level of excellence as Packer's ""Knowing God"", Michael Reeves' ""Rejoicing in Christ"", and even Puritan classics like Sibbes' ""The Bruised Reed"" and Owen's ""Communion with God"". This is certainly high praise, but I believe it is warranted. I give it this praise for 2 reasons primarily:(i) BEAUTIFUL CONTENT.  We have (and we should have!) hundreds of excellent books on the Person and saving work of Christ. We are deeply grateful for this as the Church desperately needs it. But outside of certain Puritan books and evangelical preachers here and there, we do not have much on this precious subject of the heart of Christ. As wondrous as the saving work of our Redeemer is, how wonderful it is to have someone take you by the hand and lead you into the heart of Christ behind it all!  In his heart of hearts, who is Jesus?  This is the highest and sweetest discovery, and Dane Ortlund has given us a masterful exposition of the breath-taking heart of Christ.(ii) BEAUTIFUL WRITING. Many books have excellent content, for which we give thanks. However, beautiful content is not always matched with beautiful writing. John Piper has often emphasized the importance of ""saying beautifully"", and we sometimes wish an author would have gone just a little slower with his book and focused on ""beautiful writing"" so that the subject grabs our attention, warms our heart, and sticks in our memory. When beautiful content is beautifully stated and unfolded, the book becomes ""timeless"" and it is likely to have long-lasting influence for generations to come. We need new classics, and we especially need them on the best subjects; but for this to happen, we typically need beautiful writing. Ortlund's book is masterfully and beautifully written.I am already working my way through it a second time, which is itself a commendation of this book -- my soul and life needs it so much I am forced to read it again, come back for a second serving, and let it become part of my spiritual life."
"Gentle and Lowly"" by Dane Ortlund zeroes in on the second Person of the Trinity and His heart for ""sinners and sufferers."" I haven't finished reading this one yet but I'm recommending it anyway because I like it so much already and because I think it is such a timely read. Consider this description from the introduction: a
""This book is written for the discouraged, the frustrated, the weary, the disenchanted, the cynical, the empty. ¬†Those running on fumes. ¬†Those whose Christian lives feel like constantly running up a descending escalator. ¬†Those of us who find ourselves thinking: ""How could I mess up that bad--again?"" ¬†It is for that increasing suspicion that God's patience with us is wearing thin. ¬†For those of us who know God loves us but suspect we have deeply disappointed him. ¬†Who have told others of the love of Christ yet wonder if--as for us--he harbors mild resentment. ¬†Who wonder if we have shipwrecked our lives beyond what can be repaired. ¬†Who are convinced we've permanently diminished our usefulness to the Lord. ¬†Who have been swept off our feet by perplexing pain and are wondering how we can keep living under such numbing darkness. ¬†Who look at our lives and know how to interpret the data only by concluding that God is fundamentally parsimonious. ¬†It is written, in other words, for normal Christians (13)."" t
But here's the clincher, ""Gentle And Lowly"" totally builds right off of ""Delighting In The Trinity."" It addresses key questions like ""How does the heart of Christ relate to the doctrine of the Trinity--does Christ relate to us differently than the Father or the Spirit relates to us?...How does his heart related to his wrath? Yet again, how does Christ's heart fit with what we find in the Old Testament and its portrait of God (14)?"" o
The book takes its title from the one passage in all four gospels where Jesus gives us a description of His own heart--Matthew 11:28:30, which reads, ""Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly of heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light (18)."" Ortlund builds heavily on this description, but with the following important qualifier: ¬†""This is not who he is to everyone, indiscriminately. This is who he is for those who come to him, who take his yoke upon them, who cry out to him for help. ¬†The paragraph before these words from Jesus gives us a picture of how Jesus handles the impenitent: 'Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida!... I tell you that it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you"" (Matt. 11:21.24). 'Gentle and lowly' does not mean 'mushy and frothy."" C
Go get on Amazon and buy these books. And I'm not even getting paid to say that. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†I should be getting paid to say that."
"How would you describe Jesus? How does Jesus describe himself? Do you know him? Do you know his heart? In Gentle and Lowly, Dane C. Ortlund shows us the heart of Christ for sinners and sufferers.About the AuthorOrtlund is chief publishing officer and Bible publisher at Crossway. He is an author, editor, and church elder. I believe these roles place him in a unique position to write this book. Out of all of the attributes of God, he sees Christ as gentle and lowly. Indeed, this is how Christ describes himself in the only place where Christ speaks of his own heart: Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls (Matthew 11:29).In just over 200 pages, Ortlund employs 23 chapters to take us straight to the heart of Jesus. He gives us the original Greek language to show exactly what the text means. You can see his love for the Puritans as he discusses the words of Goodwin, Sibbes, Bunyan, and Owen. He stands on the shoulders of Edwards, Spurgeon, and Warfield and further expounds their findings. This is a well-researched and thought-out book.Serious ConsiderationI was moved in nearly every chapter. While I know Jesus is characterized as gentle and lowly, I have never considered it over the course of time it takes me to read through a book. And this book looks at these traits seriously. Christ is able to sympathize, he deals gently with us, he never casts out those who come to him, and he is a tender friend.Interestingly, many wrongly think that the God of the Old Testament was an angry and condemning type of God, and Jesus was the new model for the loving and forgiving God. Ortlund proves this theory wrong as he takes his readers to many passages in the Old Testament to prove his point. Skillfully, he helps us see that deep in the heart of God is a merciful and gracious God.Motivated and MovedIn all honesty, this book is making me rethink my own disposition. I do not believe that I am gentle and lowly. And if I want to be like Jesus, I must consider his character. I am motivated to see more of Christ in this way - and I am moved to better be like him.As I am writing this review, the state of California is on mandatory social distancing. I must admit that I have been easily prone to anger, sadness, and worry. I have talked about coming out of this crisis and wanting to be stronger than before. But I now have a new goal to be more like my Savior when this is all over. To be gentle and lowly is to have the heart of Christ.I received a media copy of Gentle and Lowly and this is my honest review."
"Dane Ortlund‚Äôs new book, Gentle & Lowly, is one of those books. Since its release in March, the book has not only received more attention than any other work, but the interest is overwhelmingly positive. The list of notable names lending their endorsement to the book is also exceptionally long. Does the hype match the quality of the work, though? Or is it merely that the timing of its release so precisely matched the need of the moment?Ortlund writes to those who are frustrated, disheartened, and empty . . . or sinners and sufferers. Most readers place themselves within that audience and are especially sensitive to that description right now. His writing to them pursues the task of showing them Jesus, emphasizing certain aspects so that they may know Him more intimately and relate to Him more significantly.Such a book must be cautious in not overemphasizing certain characteristics at the expense of diminishing other essential elements. The author acknowledges the difficulty in this. Because he sometimes gets closer to that line than I would prefer, readers could react in an antinomian manner (this was especially notable in chapter 7). Ortlund does not advance that mindset, but instead, it is a product of how readers sometimes interpret and apply what they read. Merely being aware of that inclination is sufficient enough to avoid it.Each of the 23 chapters selects and emphasizes a particular verse. As a result, this book works well as a daily devotional. Indeed, a danger of this is taking verses out of context, but the author does not seem to overreach. His analysis of the text is superb at relating who Christ is to who we are as believers. He combines exegesis with historical quotes that serve to reveal God‚Äôs truth in an understandable manner.There are so many truths that we take for granted about our relationship with Christ (i.e., Christ knows what our suffering is like, Christ is an advocate for us, etc.). Still, Ortlund‚Äôs masterful use of language profoundly projects the significance of those truths. The result is that he exposes the depths of our relationship with Christ and draws us to a closer confidence with Him.Disclaimer: I received a review copy of this book from the publisher. However, my review was not influenced in any way by the author, publisher, or any other person associated with the book."
"This book came out at just the right time. Ortland has written a book full of comfort and grace. At the end of the day he does a compelling job of showing just how much we need to adjust our thinking about who God is and how He has revealed His heart through Jesus. This is a fine work challenging incorrect thinking about the grace of God.This book is a great piece revealing to the reader hos God's heart is bent towards people with a desire to extend grace and compassion. Before you think this is all about unicorns and cotton candy fluff it is not. Dane never minimizes God's holiness or righteousness. He never portrays God as a soft old man willing to overlook any and everything. Instead he goes to show that even when God's disciplines and corrects, His hearts desire is mercy and grace.Ortland walks us through the Scripture as well as puritan writers revealing the true heart of God, and God that desires the best for His people and will go to the greatest lengths to make that happen. And even when there is discipline, there is always grace.The purity of God's heart causes Him to abhor evil, and he hates to see the evil in His people, but His deepest heart is their restorationYes, God's thought are higher than ours even when it comes to realizing how His heart yearns for our restoration.Fight those preconceived notions about what you may think you know about Christ's heart and realize the strength of His mercy and grace waiting for you. No matter how dark your world seems, God's heart turns toward you."
"This is a book that came to my attention on Twitter, and it came at a time in my life where the message was extremely needed.  I am a ‚Äúnormal Christian‚Äù, not an academic, not a theologian, just a stay at home mom trying to live my life for Jesus while raising 4 kids.  This book was a balm for my weary soul, and brought a huge encouragement at a time when my soul desperately needed it.  Every chapter is encouraging in reminding me of how much Christ loves me, is for me, and is actively working on my behalf.  It humbled me, encouraged me, and caused me to feel much joy that while I was still in my sin, my Savior died for me, and moved toward me in my sin, and hasn‚Äôt left me since then. This is a must read book, one I will come back to often, and one I can‚Äôt stop recommending."
"It's hard to know how best to write this review. This book is extraordinary in how Ortlund unpacks the heart of Jesus in his reflection on the wonderful verse Matthew 11:29: ""Take my yoke upon you for I am gentle and lowly in heart ...""Ortlund is clearly a disciple of the Puritans and builds this book upon the shoulders of these great writers: John Bunyan, Thomas Goodwin, John Flavel, Jonathan Edwards plus preachers like Spurgeon. Sometimes the way these writers of yesteryear write can be a bit difficult and so to have a tremendous translator like Dane Ortlund is invaluable.The chapters are small based on a verse that outlines the heart of Jesus, the Father and the role of the Holy Spirit. The chapters need to be short as they are packed with such great content which leaves the reader lingering.And so what do we do with this revelation of how much we are loved and the immeasurable riches of His grace that awaits us, Ortlund asks in conclusion. And his answer is a simple one: ""Go to Jesus."" Invite Jesus into every aspect of our lives and let Him love us.I so look forward to Dane Ortlund's next book. This is one I will read often, share with others and I'd suggest now sits alongside such classics as Tozer's 'Pursuit of God', Lewis's ""Mere Christianity', and Manning's 'The Furious Longing of God.'Go grab a copy for yourself."
"Gentle and Lowly is about the heart of Jesus, what naturally flows out of Him. The title comes from Jesus‚Äô own description of His heart in Matthew 11:28-30, which says, ‚ÄúCome to me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.‚ÄùA. W. Tozer famously said, ‚Äúwhat comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us.‚Äù For many Christians, what comes to our mind when we think about Jesus is His work on the cross. We are well acquainted with His deeds but not His heart; what moved Him to love and rescue miserable sinners and wash them clean with His blood.Ortlund attempts to fill this gap with a treaty on the nature of Jesus, and His feelings toward us. He says, ‚ÄúIt is one thing to describe what your husband says and does and looks like. It is something else, something deeper and more real, to describe his heart for you. So with Christ. It is one thing to know the doctrines of the incarnation and the atonement and a hundred other vital doctrines. It is another, more searching matter to know his heart for you.‚ÄùOrtlund wrote this book for ordinary Christians like you and me who struggle with sin and suffer from its effects. He wrote it so we may ‚Äúknow what the Bible says about the heart of Christ and consider the glory of His heart for our own up-and-down lives.‚ÄùGentle and Lowly has 23 brief chapters that delve into select Scriptures to provides us with a glimpse of Jesus‚Äô heart. For instance, ‚ÄúThe Happiness of Christ,‚Äù ‚ÄúI will never Cast Out,‚Äù ‚ÄúA tender Friend,‚Äù and ‚ÄúRich in Mercy.‚ÄùOrtlund thoroughly explained what Jesus meant when He said He was gentle and lowly using the original Greek language and cross-references. He used God‚Äôs Word to expound the nature of Christ and His heart towards us faithfully. Ortlund also relied on the wisdom of the puritans like John Owens, Thomas Goodwin, John Bunyan, Richard Sibbes, and other theologians like Charles Spurgeon and Jonathan Edwards. The inputs of these seasoned saints provided more in-depth insights into the heart of Jesus.I loved that Gentle and Lowly didn‚Äôt focus solely on the New Testament or Christ only. Ortlund included several passages from the Old Testament that described Jesus‚Äô nature and explained how the Father and the Spirit relate to the heart of Christ.There are several things I learned from this book that made me marvel at the beauty and magnificent heart of our Lord. For example, when Ortlund explained how God‚Äôs anger needs to be provoked, whereas His mercy is always bubbling at the surface, ready to gush out on us. I grew up terrified of God‚Äôs wrath and falsely believed He was more prone to anger than anything else. A few years of Bible study changed that belief to equally likely to be angry and merciful. But as Ortlund said, God needs only to be provoked to anger, never to love or show mercy.Every chapter in the book had similar precious gems of truths to warm your soul with Jesus‚Äô love and to delight in the surpassing worth of knowing His heart.Gentle and lowly left me in awe of Jesus and provided me with a much better understanding of Jesus‚Äô character. I highly recommend this book to everyone who follows Christ. It‚Äôs a blessing to the Church."
"Recently, I wrote on the usefulness of studying the Puritans for the Christian life, and made this remark:‚ÄúToday, some of the Puritans are forgotten. Ohers are little-known. Most are largely ignored. The Puritans and their writings are often waved off, accused of being too archaic or too tough to relate to. But what it boils down to for most people, I believe, is an unwillingness to put in the work to engage Puritan works firsthand.‚ÄùAs I‚Äôve brought up these works in sermons and conversations, I have found that the riches of their writings have gone mostly undiscovered, to my dismay. I‚Äôm not so much disappointed that people do not know who John Bunyan is, for example. I‚Äôm more disappointed that they haven‚Äôt yet seen what John Bunyan (and his contemporaries) shows us about Christ.In his new book Gentle and Lowly, Dane Ortlund has unlocked the treasure chest and not only exposed us to those wonderful Puritan writers, but has himself invited us to look upon the glory of our present Christ for all that he is. Right out of the gate, Ortlund helps us see that this is a book we all need:‚ÄúThis book is written for the discouraged, the frustrated, the weary, the disenchanted, the cynical the empty. Those running on fumes. Those whose Christian lives feel like constantly running up a descending escalator. This of us who find ourselves thinking, ‚ÄúHow could I mess up that bad‚Äîagain?‚Äù It is for that increasing suspicion that God‚Äôs patience with us is wearing thin. For those of us who know God loves us but suspect we have deeply disappointed him. Who have told others of the love of Christ yet wonder is‚Äîas for us‚Äîhe harbors mild resentment. Who wonder if we have shipwrecked our lives beyond what can be repaired. Who are convinced we‚Äôve permanently diminished our usefulness to the Lord. Who have been swept off our feet by perplexing pain and are wondering how we can keep living under such numbing darkness. Who look at our lives and know how to interpret the data only by concluding that God is fundamentally parsimonious. (15)If none of that resonates with you, maybe you don‚Äôt need this one. But my hunch is that it does, or that you‚Äôll soon be able to.In short, we all carry our unique yoke, but most of us find it heavy and burdensome. Thankfully, Jesus offers us a yoke that is easy and light. He answers our weariness with an invitation to rest. And he argues, in Matthew 11:28-30, that he is that rest.Taking Jesus‚Äôs own famous words in Matthew, Ortlund wrings dry the ‚Äúgentle and lowly‚Äù nature of Christ and helps us meditate deeply on that truth. Ortlund gives us a commentary not on what Christ has done so much as who he is. A friend. An advocate. An intercessor. A man of sympathy.There are plenty of healthy, solid churches today that have decided with Paul to know nothing except Jesus Christ and him crucified (1 Cor. 2:2), and to let this be the central force of their ministry. God be praised that, in a day and age of shallow, underwhelming preaching, that there are churches laboring to point us to the work of Christ.But oftentimes, it seems that this pointing is oriented to the past and not as much to the present. In other words, we are often trying to be roused to Christ‚Äôs beauty by looking only backwards. But the Christ we worship is a risen Christ today. He remains the same yesterday, today, and forever (Heb. 13:8). And there are glorious truths and riches about Him that affect our day-to-day lives, that usher into further intimacy with Him. This is where Gentle and Lowly really succeeds, as it presents to us a Christ for our today.One of the aspects of Gentle and Lowly that I love most is its pace. The chapters are fairly short, making for an easy, devotional read. Ortlund is obviously well-steeped in the original languages and historical theology, but this book is not intimidating or daunting. It is written with precision and care. Every sentence matters, and is worth pondering. Ortlund argues forcefully that ‚Äúit is impossible for the affectionate heart of Christ to be over celebrated, made too much of, exaggerated. It cannot be plumbed. But it is easily neglected, forgotten. We draw too little strength from it‚Äù (29).Though the book is theologically strong, Gentle and Lowly is not written for our heads. It is written for our hearts. It is 100 proof doxology. It draws us into right relationship and worship of our Maker and helps us gaze into His beauty.I know I will be recommending this tremendous work for a long time to come. I consider Gentle and Lowly to be an excellent introduction into the writings of Puritan authors, most especially the likes of Thomas Goodwin, John Bunyan, Jonathan Edwards, and more. If you have never taken the time to read their works, this is a great place to start.It is the refreshing drink that many parched souls, like my own, needs to take in. It has strengthened my prayer life, and opened my eyes to the beauty of Christ. It has not only helped me better love my Savior, but to better grasp my Savior‚Äôs love for me. Could we ask for more from a book?"
"I saw that Dane Ortlund‚Äôs book Gentle and Lowly was already drawing a lot of attention and praise even before it was officially released for sale. It will likely sell well and receive multiple awards this year because it is simply an amazing book. It explores the heart of Christ for us, who he is at the core of his being, which Matthew 11:29 describes as ‚Äúgentle and lowly.‚ÄùI experienced a sense of joy and gratefulness as I read this book. It is easy to let my sense of God‚Äôs love rise and fall depending on my feelings, what I‚Äôve accomplished, or how I‚Äôve failed. Ortlund reminds us that Christ‚Äôs heart is specifically for sinners ‚Äî nothing we do can make him love us any more or any less. He loved us at our worst. It was a corrective I needed that was done in such a way as to lift me up and help me see and experience Christ‚Äôs compassion for me.Ortlund‚Äôs book is so powerful and inspiring because he draws from often-overlooked sources ‚Äî the Puritans. Much to the surprise of modern audiences, the Puritans are not perpetually grumpy folks living in fear that somebody somewhere is having fun. Rather, their writings are rich treasures full of passion, joy, and wonder at the loveliness and goodness of God. The writings he pulls from have endured for generations, and I am sure they will help this book endure as well. Get it into your hands and on your shelf!Some of my favorite quotes (I had many more):  Maybe we think of God and Christ in terms of truth, not beauty. But the whole reason we care about sound doctrine is for the sake of preserving God‚Äôs beauty, just as the whole reason we care about effective focal lenses on a camera is to capture with precision the beauty we photograph.  Though the crowds call him the friend of sinners as an indictment, the label is one of unspeakable comfort for those who know themselves to be sinners. That Jesus is friend to sinners is only contemptible to those who feel themselves not to be in that category.  [T]he evidence of Christ‚Äôs mercy toward you is not your life. The evidence of his mercy toward you is his‚Äîmistreated, misunderstood, betrayed, abandoned.  Christ died to confound our intuitive assumptions that divine love has an expiration date.  If his grace in kindness is ‚Äúimmeasurable,‚Äù then our failures can never outstrip his grace.Note:  I received a free copy of this book from the publisher.  I requested it myself and was not required to write a positive review."
"""This book is written for the discouraged, the frustrated, the weary, the disenchanted, the cynical, the empty. Those running on fumes. Those whose Christian lives feel like constantly running up a descending escalator...For those of us who know God loves us but suspect we have deeply disappointed him...Who wonder if we have shipwrecked our lives beyond what can be repaired...Who have been swept off our feet by perplexing pain and are wondering how we can keep living under such numbing darkness. Who look at our lives and know how to interpret data only by concluding that God is fundamentally parsimonious.""I think that about covers it. I'm guessing you, like me, fit into one of those categories. And so, this book is for you. Even if you don't fall into any of the above and you feel pretty good about everything, I would venture that you might just land here somewhere further down the road. Or maybe someone close to you could really use you speaking the truths from this book (and ultimately Scripture) into their life. I think you will find this book to be a true comfort and refreshment wherever you are.It is actually pretty incredible everything he fits into such a short, quick read. It's one I know I will revisit. There is much to ponder from each chapter and I know I didn't do it justice without giving more time for introspection. I've grown up in the church. I read a lot of Christian living books, and yet this concept of Jesus' deep heart for us  feels like a truth I've never really internalized. Throughout the book, as soon as I started feeling like, Oh I know this already, he would ask a question  or make a statement and I would find myself startled- 'Oh yeah... that's a good question!' or 'I guess I do think that way...' Dane Ortlund dissects the original language and intent of the Scriptures and explains the profound Puritan teachings with beautiful and accessible writing. The time and care spent to compile these pages is very evident.Ortlund focuses on one main Scripture passage or Puritan writing per chapter to flesh out what we know to be true about the heart of God and what that means for us, lowly sinners. He lays the foundation for this book (per the title) in Matthew 11.  ""The heart is a matter of life. It is what makes us the human being each of us is; the heart drives all we do. It is who we are. And when Jesus tells us what animates him most deeply, what is most true of him‚Äîwhen he exposes the innermost recesses of his being‚Äîwhat we find there is: gentle and lowly...What Jesus is, he does. He cannot act any other way. His life proves his heart.""Over and over again, Ortlund reminds us that there is nothing about our sins, failures, or sufferings that keeps Jesus away. He is drawn to us and desires for us to come to him, take his yoke, and find rest for our souls.""For it is a yoke of kindness. Who could resist this? It‚Äôs like telling a drowning man that he must put on the burden of a life preserver only to hear him shout back sputtering, ‚ÄúNo way! Not me! This is hard enough, drowning here in these stormy waters. The last thing I need is the added burden of a life preserver around my body!‚Äù That‚Äôs what we all are like, confessing Christ with our lips but generally avoiding deep fellowship with him, out of a muted understanding of his heart.""I was confronted throughout the book with the realization that we, as fallen human beings, can't help but try to control everything- even determining the terms and conditions in which God can love us (or not love us.) We are a pendulum swinging between our self-justifying pride, not feeling the true weight of our sin, and our self-deprecating despair, believing God doesn't love us because we are too messed up or too far gone. This book positions us right where we need to be: Attempting to understand just how evil we are and in NEED of a perfect Savior, and accepting that Jesus already paid the immense cost of our sin, willingly, out of LOVE, before we could ever do anything to deserve it. ""With Christ, our sins and weaknesses are the very resume items that qualify us to approach him. Nothing but coming to him is required‚Äî first at conversion and a thousand times thereafter until we are with him upon death.""I could go on and on about everything that impacted me, but I think you need to encounter these truths for yourself. To offer a little more information on what he discusses in his book, here are some questions you may be thinking that will be answered within.- Isn't Jesus too holy to be approached by me, a filthy sinner?- Do we neglect his wrath if we talk too much about his heart?- Shouldn't we be careful not to lean too much on him, taking advantage of his mercy?- Does he really understand what I'm dealing with?- If I come to him now, will he turn me away later when I REALLY do something bad?- Does Jesus ever hate me?- How do our imperfect feelings compare to the emotions of Christ?- Why does Jesus continue to intercede for us if he already paid for our sins?- What does it mean for Jesus to be my advocate?- If Jesus will never cast me out, and his heart finds joy in healing my sin, should I even care to stop sinning?- Does God reveal his glory more by his wrath and power or by his kindness and mercy?- Is it okay for Jesus to be angry?- What does the Holy Spirit have to do with the heart of Jesus?- The Father judges and required justice; Jesus loves and sacrificed himself for me- so does the Father and Jesus have differing dispositions towards me?- How can God still love me if he afflicts me or allows bad things to happen to me?- Where can we see evidence of his mercy in a life full of suffering?- What am I supposed to do with all of this?I truly believe this book will change your perception of God and the way he thinks about you. I will conclude this review with this quote from the book. And then, per my custom, a whole host of other quotes to whet your appetite until your book comes in the mail.""The world is starving for a yearning love, a love that remembers instead of forsakes. A love that isn‚Äôt tied to our loveliness. A love that gets down underneath our messiness. A love that is bigger than the enveloping darkness we might be walking through even today. A love of which even the very best human romance is the faintest of whispers‚Ä¶ On the cross, we see what God did to satisfy his yearning for us. He went that far‚Ä¶ Repent of your small thoughts of God‚Äôs heart. Repent and let him love you.""More quotes:""The dominant note left ringing in our ears after reading the Gospels, the most vivid and arresting element of the portrait, is the way the Holy Son of God moves toward, touches, heals, embraces, and forgives those who least deserve it yet truly desire it.""""A compassionate doctor has traveled deep into the jungle to provide medical care to a primitive tribe afflicted with a contagious disease...But as he seems to provide care. The afflicted refuse, they want to take care of themselves. They want to heal on their own terms. Finally, a few brave young men step forward to receive the care being freely provided. What does the doctor feel? Joy. His joy increases to the degree that the sick come to him for help and healing. It‚Äôs the whole reason he came.""""What is it about God‚Äôs glory that draws us in and causes us to conquer our sins and makes us radiant people? Is it the sheer size of God, a consideration of the immensity of the universe and thus of the Creator, a sense of God‚Äôs transcendent greatness, that pulls us toward him? No, Jonathan Edwards would say; it is the loveliness of his heart... ‚ÄúA sight of the greatness of God in his attributes, may overwhelm men.‚Äù...Seeing only his greatness, ‚Äúthe enmity and opposition of the heart, may remain in its full strength, and the will remain inflexible; whereas, one glimpse of the moral and spiritual glory of God, and supreme amiableness of Jesus Christ, shining into the heart, overcomes and abolishes this opposition, and inclines the soul to Christ, as it were, by an omnipotent power.‚Äù "" ""A correct understanding of the triune God is not that of a Father whose central disposition is judgment and a Son whose central disposition is love. The heart of both is one and the same; this is, after all, one God, not two. Theirs is a heart of redeeming love, not compromising justice and wrath but beautifully satisfying justice and wrath.""‚ÄúIf your heart be hard, his mercies are tender.If your heart be dead he has mercy to liven it.If you be sick, he has mercy to heal you.If you be sinful, he has mercies to sanctify and cleanse you.As large and as various as are our wants, so large and various are his mercies. So we may come boldly to find grace and mercy to help us in time of need, a mercy for every need. All the mercies that are in his own heart he has transplanted into several beds in the garden of the the promises, where they grow, and he has abundance of variety of them, suited to all the variety of the diseases of the soul.‚Äù -Thomas Goodwin""All of God‚Äôs attributes are nonnegotiable‚Ä¶ God is not the sum total of a number of attributes, like pieces of a pie making a whole pie; rather, God is every attribute perfectly. God does not have parts. He is just. He is wrathful. He is good.. and so on, each in endless perfection.""‚Äú'Slow to anger'...Unlike us, who are often emotional dams ready to break, God can put up with a lot. This is why the OT speaks of God being ‚Äúprovoked to anger‚Äù by his people dozens of times. But not once are we told that God is ‚Äúprovoked to love‚Äù or ‚Äúprovoked to mercy.‚Äù His anger requires provocation; his mercy is pent up, ready to gush forth.""""Perhaps Satan‚Äôs greatest victory in your life today is not the sin in which you regularly indulge but the dark thoughts of God‚Äôs heart that cause you to go there in the first place and keep you cool toward him in the wake of it.""""Our naturally decaffeinated views of God‚Äôs heart might feel right because we‚Äôre being stern with ourselves, not letting ourselves off the hook too easily. Such sternness feels appropriately morally serious. But deflecting of God‚Äôs yearning heart does not reflect Scripture‚Äôs testimony about how God feels toward his own. God is of course morally serious, far more than we are. But the Bible takes us by the hand and leads us out from under the feeling that his heart for us wavers according to our loveliness. God‚Äôs heart confounds our intuitions of who he is.""""It is the sun of Christ‚Äôs heart, not the clouds of my sins, that now defines me."""
"One of my favorite C. S. Lewis quotes comes from the preface to his book The Problem of Pain: ‚Äú‚Ä¶when pain is to be borne, a little courage helps more than much knowledge, a little human sympathy more than much courage, and the least tincture of the love of God more than all.‚Äù The newest offering by Dane Ortlund, Gentle and Lowly: The Heart of Christ for Sinners and Sufferers (Crossway, 2020), offers more than a little courage, profound human sympathy, and an overflowing abundance of the love of God. It is the soul medicine God knew we needed to rest in Him in these tumultuous and Homesick times. This is a book for ragamuffins, black sheep, and dutiful disciples in desperate need of fresh wonder at the glorious grace of God in Christ. In short, it is my favorite book of 2020 to this point.Ortlund‚Äôs thinking has clearly been steeped in the Puritans‚Äô writings as well as the Scriptures. He often quotes their work, especially Thomas Goodwin and Richard Sibbes, but not in an intimidating or academic way. Instead, it‚Äôs like sharing a meal with a well-read friend who is so captivated by these books that he can‚Äôt help himself from sharing the joy of his favorite passages.The writing is beautiful, companionable, sometimes funny, and often moving. The last non-fiction book that brought tears to my eyes the way this one did was F. B. Meyer‚Äôs The Shepherd Psalm. As soon as I finished,  I wanted to read it over again. Truly, it is that good and well-timed.Here are a few of my favorite passages:‚ÄúThis book is written for the discouraged, the frustrated, the weary, the disenchanted, the cynical, the empty. Those running on fumes. Those whose Christian lives feel like constantly running up a descending escalator. Those of us who find ourselves thinking: ‚ÄòHow could I mess up that bad‚Äîagain?‚Äô It is for that increasing suspicion that God‚Äôs patience with us is wearing thin. For those of us who know God loves us but suspect we have deeply disappointed him. Who have told others of the love of Christ yet wonder if‚Äîas for us‚Äîhe harbors mild resentment. Who wonder if we have shipwrecked our lives beyond what can be repaired. Who are convinced we‚Äôve permanently diminished our usefulness to the Lord. Who have been swept off our feet by perplexing pain and are wondering how we can keep living under such numbing darkness. Who look at our lives and know how to interpret the data only by concluding that God is fundamentally parsimonious. It is written, in other words, for normal Christians. In short, it is for sinners and sufferers‚Äù (Kindle location 146).‚ÄúHave we considered the loveliness of the heart of Christ? Perhaps beauty is not a category that comes naturally to mind when we think about Christ. Maybe we think of God and Christ in terms of truth, not beauty. But the whole reason we care about sound doctrine is for the sake of preserving God‚Äôs beauty, just as the whole reason we care about effective focal lenses on a camera is to capture with precision the beauty we photograph. Let Jesus draw you in through the loveliness of his heart. This is a heart that upbraids the impenitent with all the harshness that is appropriate, yet embraces the penitent with more openness than we are able to feel. It is a heart that walks us into the bright meadow of the felt love of God. It is a heart that drew the despised and forsaken to his feet in self-abandoning hope. It is a heart of perfect balance and proportion, never overreacting, never excusing, never lashing out. It is a heart that throbs with desire for the destitute. It is a heart that floods the suffering with the deep solace of shared solidarity in that suffering. It is a heart that is gentle and lowly. So let the heart of Jesus be something that is not only gentle toward you but lovely to you. If I may put it this way: romance the heart of Jesus. All I mean is, ponder him through his heart. Allow yourself to be allured. Why not build in to your life unhurried quiet, where, among other disciplines, you consider the radiance of who he actually is, what animates him, what his deepest delight is? Why not give your soul room to be reenchanted with Christ time and again? When you look at the glorious older saints in your church, how do you think they got there? Sound doctrine, yes. Resolute obedience, without a doubt. Suffering without becoming cynical, for sure. But maybe another reason, maybe the deepest reason, is that they have, over time, been won over in their deepest affections to a gentle Savior. Perhaps they have simply tasted, over many years, the surprise of a Christ for whom their very sins draw him in rather than push him away. Maybe they have not only known that Jesus loved them but felt it‚Äù (Kindle location 1222).‚ÄúChrist‚Äôs heart for us means that he will be our never-failing friend no matter what friends we do or do not enjoy on earth. He offers us a friendship that gets underneath the pain of our loneliness. While that pain does not go away, its sting is made fully bearable by the far deeper friendship of Jesus. He walks with us through every moment. He knows the pain of being betrayed by a friend, but he will never betray us. He will not even so much as coolly welcome us. That is not who he is. That is not his heart.‚Äù (Kindle location 1493).‚ÄúTo you I say, do you know what Jesus does with those who squander his mercy? He pours out more mercy. God is rich in mercy. That‚Äôs the whole point. Whether we have been sinned against or have sinned ourselves into misery, the Bible says God is not tightfisted with mercy but openhanded, not frugal but lavish, not poor but rich. That God is rich in mercy means that your regions of deepest shame and regret are not hotels through which divine mercy passes but homes in which divine mercy abides. It means the things about you that make you cringe most, make him hug hardest. It means his mercy is not calculating and cautious, like ours. It is unrestrained, flood-like, sweeping, magnanimous. It means our haunting shame is not a problem for him, but the very thing he loves most to work with. It means our sins do not cause his love to take a hit. Our sins cause his love to surge forward all the more. It means on that day when we stand before him, quietly, unhurriedly, we will weep with relief, shocked at how impoverished a view of his mercy-rich heart we had.‚Äù (Kindle location 2290).‚ÄúThis is a book about the heart of Christ and of God. But what are we to do with this? The main answer is, nothing. To ask, ‚ÄòNow how do I apply this to my life?‚Äô would be a trivialization of the point of this study. If an Eskimo wins a vacation to a sunny place, he doesn‚Äôt arrive in his hotel room, step out onto the balcony, and wonder how to apply that to his life. He just enjoys it. He just basks. But there is one thing for us to do. Jesus says it in Matthew 11:28. ‚ÄòCome to me‚Ä¶.‚ÄôGo to him. All that means is, open yourself up to him. Let him love you. The Christian life boils down to two steps: 1.‚ÄÇGo to Jesus. 2.‚ÄÇSee #1.‚Äù (Kindle location  2739, 2749)"
"Robert Randolph and the Family Band have a song called ‚ÄòSoul Refreshing‚Äô. That‚Äôs really an apt description of Dane Ortlund‚Äôs book, ‚ÄòGentle and Lowly: The Heart of Christ for Sinners and Sufferers‚Äô. With a heavy reliance upon the Puritans, thorough exegesis of Scripture passages, and very appropriate illustrations, this book is extremely Christ-centered. The subtitle however, really points to the unique thrust of the book: What is Christ‚Äôs heart? How does Christ feel about us? The answers this book point us to change everything for the believer. This book is really a healing and soothing spiritual balm for sinners, sufferers, the weary and the discouraged, because it shows reorients our thinking about the nature and practice of God‚Äôs love for us. Easily one of the best and most enjoyable books I‚Äôve read this year, and I think you‚Äôll feel the same way!"
"This book was Christology with a pastoral heart. With each chapter Ortlund reflects on a different aspect of the love of God, what he calls his ""deepest heart"" for us. Throughout the book, Ortlund emphasizes that love is not merely something God has, but love is who he is.If you feel exhausted by reading books and articles on the latest controversy or argument, this book is a helpful change of pace that will likely have lasting influence. It is not an easy read compared to many Christian life books, but rewards with insights. Ortlund follows Puritan guides as he reflects on scripture. At times his language takes a more formal Reformed/Puritan-esque tone and vocabulary (which may feel odd to you if you're not in that world, but may not even be noticed if you are). There are also moments when it's clear that Ortlund has tried to make his work more accessible without dumbing down. It might have been nice for him to discuss more of the possible tension his thesis has with the doctrine of God's simplicity, but that also would not have fit as well with the style of the book.Each chapter is short enough that it can used as a type of daily devotional if you want to read it that way."
"This book came out at such a perfect time this year. With many people feeling uneasy, anxious about what will happen tomorrow, and with heavy burdens, we are more than qualified to bring all of these things to the feet of our Savior. For he is gentle & lowly. Dane Ortlund has done a phenomenal job drawing our focus to the heart of Jesus. Dane Ortlund goes through a variety of scripture passages in each chapter that all draw us back to the books primary focus, Jesus Christ heart towards his people. Scripture passages such as Matthew 11:29, Hebrews 4:15, John 11:33, and other great passages are the root for every chapter. For all who might be feeling heavy laden, and feel low this book is a perfect reminder of how Jesus is the only one who can give you rest."
"After a long hike there is nothing like a cold drink of water to refresh. It is something to be savored. Ortlund‚Äôs Gentle and Lowly is the equivalent for the soul. The deep well he draws from have names like Flavel, Warfield, Sibbes, Melanchton, and Goodwin to name a few.The book examines the heart of Christ rather than His work. In doing so, Ortlund paints a portrait that is compelling and convicting. I found the book, like a cold drink of water, refreshing, invigorating, and nourishing."
"Honestly, just read the title or page 18 to understand what the author wants to convey in this book. The author mentions that he wrote the book for christians who feel like they are running on fumes or frustrated, but what was more frustrating what the lack of depth and cringeworthy writing that this book presents.Some examples:""Jesus is not Zeus. He was a sinless man, not a sinless Superman""""If Jesus hosted his own personal website, the most prominent line...would read: Gentle and Lowly in Heart""""His friends abandoned him when he needed them most; had he lived today, every last Twitter follower and Facebook friend would have un-friended him...""I also find the analogy used in Chapter 3 to be very troublesome. The author compares Jesus to ""a doctor who travels deep into the jungle to provide care to a primitive tribe afflicted with a contagious disease."" I'm sorry but what?!  For crying out loud Jesus was born in a manger himself and would be the LAST person to have his ego boosted with ""joy"" upon treating his patients. Jesus is much more complex in life and character than and to reduce Him to such a terribly example of a colonizer is lacking.Skip and just read the bible ."
"This book is like salve to the soul of a struggler. And none of it is too good to be true, because robust exegesis undergirds each point. Hence the title of this review. When I read Manning I want him to be right but the Scriptural support is light. Ortlund shines in removing any doubt that He is presenting the biblically attested heart of Christ toward sinners, strugglers, and sufferers. I‚Äôve been through over a decade of theological education, and had scarcely paid attention to some of these passages and certainly hadn‚Äôt considered their import for Christ‚Äôs view of us. Historical theology can give you those blind spot texts in HD. Such is the value of Ortlund‚Äôs methodology: Puritan exposition in conversation with his own exegesis applied to existential questions every Christian asks but for which few receive healing answers. As one reviewer on TGC observed, the reception of this book speaks to the void in practical theology. This is a best seller for all the right reasons."
"Mr. Ortlund has given us a gift with this book. Chapter after chapter he shows us through scripture and the writers of old Jesus' heart. It is precious and convicting and powerful. I especially have benefited from chpt 6, I will never cast out, and the chapters on Jesus being our intercessor and advocate, two truths I've been eager to learn more about and this book as really helped with. It's not a difficult read, but there is a lot to ponder. I appreciate Mr. Ortlund's illustrations as well. They're well-placed and pack a punch. My husband is doing the audiobook version, and it's actually Mr. Ortlund reading it, and he's a great reader! Speaking of hearts, you can really ""hear"" his heart's passion for his own writing and what he shares on this subject.  I've gifted this to a handful of friends as its one of those books that I can see rereading year after year.  So grateful for the Ortlund family and all the ways they've blessed me with using the gifts God's given them."
"""Gentle And Lowly"" is a great read who is either seeking a new or deeper relationship with Jesus Christ.  Indeed, in a world that values busyness, aggressiveness, and selfishness, God is often either left out of the picture or is an afterthought.  The title is around 220 pages and covers topics such as:-  God is gentle, however, He is not weak.-  God listens to our prayers and supplications and can sympathize with what we are going through.-  The power of the Holy Spirit working in and through us for His glory.-  Our sins grieve God and He longs for us to be restored to Him.-  Jesus Christ is the best friend we will ever have.The book is well-written, encouraging, challenging, and is a good read for anyone needing insight on who they are in Jesus Christ.  Recommended."
"Gentle and Lowly is one of the most beautiful books I‚Äôve read on the heart of Christ toward the people He came to save. Time and time again, Ortlund takes the reader into a deeper understanding of Christ‚Äôs heart as seen in the Scripture. Layer by layer, bit by bit, we are left feeling more affection and awe for Jesus.Each chapter is summarized to help remind the reader of what he/she just read. What‚Äôs more, there is practical application throughout  of how to continue moving toward a deeper intimacy once the reading is complete. It overflows with theological and devotional riches.Gentle and Lowly is the most impactful book I‚Äôve read on this beautiful facet of Jesus Christ. My heart toward Christ is softer, more eager, and deeply grateful after having read this work."
"Before reading this book, had I been asked to describe God, the words ""gentle and"" lowly"" would not have been on my radar. But there they are, right in the Word of God, straight from the mouth of God in the flesh.That's the beauty of this book. It takes our instinctual view of God as constantly angry or at best mildly disappointed with His children and attacks it with the voracious truth of who He actually is, who He describes Himself to be all throughout His word, not just in gospels.The end result of replacing my human understanding of God in Christ with God's own heart for His elect is astonishing and paradigm-shifting. I found myself pausing to breathe a sigh of relief and a prayer of thanks nearly every time I read it. So will you."
"Imagine messing up so badly you curl up naked in the fetal position in a the cold empty bathtub behind the shower curtain to bawl your eyes out. But then, your dad comes in, wraps you in a warm fuzzy blanket, puts you in a warm bed by the fire, brings you your favorite hot beverage and a big slice of chocolate cake. You eat it and snuggle in with your eyes closed while your dad strokes your hair and softly tells you that he has been waiting your whole life for this moment in time to tell you how much he loves you and that he will not ever leave you to suffer alone and there is nothing you could ever do bad enough to make him not want to be your daddy. You doze off listening to his gentle, reassuring voice and rest peacefully.  Then he does again the next time you mess up...even though you didn't have to mess up...you were actually selfish and ugly....then he does again when you were wronged...and when you were just sick...and when you were afraid....every day for the rest of your life. That's how this book was for me. I will read it again with friends and every year."
"There are books that one can honestly read over and over again. Perhaps, some of those books could be passed on from generation to generation. Few books reach this point. But I can assure you that this is perhaps one of those books.Why? I will be very brief, this book shows us the heart of Christ in a simple, biblical, theological and doxological way. Throughout each episode it is almost impossible not to stop and reflect on each and every time we have failed to see Christ through the right lens.This book helps us to break down all the abstract, incorrect, and unbiblical ideas about our Savior. It takes us back to the sources (Ad Fontes) to correctly understand who Jesus is. To help us reflect on Christ's love and disposition toward suffering sinners.Gentle and Lowly is a book that will lead us to reflect deeply on all that we have come to believe about Jesus. I have no hesitation in recommending this book because in addition to being a fuel for worship it is a book that takes you back to the Bible. The foundation under which the love and heart of Christ is examined is not volatile feelings or moods. Rather, it is a reminder that the true love of Christ is known through the Word of God,In addition to this, Gentle and Lowly opened my eyes and led me to understand the great need to love the local church as he does. He has challenged my understanding of communion, friendship, marriage, and parenthood. To love is not simply to say some pretty words, it is a constant disposition and availability, open arms, assured forgiveness, abundant grace and a sincere love for those who perhaps like me, also deserve absolutely nothing but he still gives us everything.In the same way, Ray Ortlund makes us reflect on the work of the Triune God. While it is a book that tells us about Jesus, we cannot overlook the essence and nature of the Triune God's love. For this reason, I believe Ortlund has made this book a perfect combination of doxology, devotional, biblical doctrine, and the simplicity with which we can come to understand the love of God through the very nature of the Trinity. Talking about the Trinity is complicated. But through this book and the bond of love through Christ, it has been less complex to understand at least some of it.Finally, this book has served to appeal to my need to go to Christ at all times. The Puritan testimonies remind us of the essence of our Christian life, Christ. As absurd or obvious as this may seem, it is sometimes what we need to remember every single second, we need Christ.Crossway has provided a complimentary copy of this book through the Blog Review Program."
"A pastor friend of mine gifted me this book and it has been a blessing to read.  If you're a Christian who longs for assurance you can't get any better than this author's beautiful, thought-provoking, passage-underlining prose about our precious Savior's mercy.  I didn't want it to end because every chapter was jaw-dropping in its consistent inspiration.  I'm a big fan of the late, great Brennan Manning due to his unwavering emphasis on the love Jesus has for His own.  I didn't think any writer could match him.  I was wrong.  Ortlund has penned a masterpiece of hope.  Highly recommended."
"Upon reading the title¬†Gentle and Lowly, I was filled with anticipation of the peace and calm that would come with the words of this book. The heart of Jesus and his true, genuine love for all people no matter their background or sin-filled nature is very clearly portrayed in each chapter. Ortlund uses an extensive collection of books and writings through which he quotes often with a clear study of the Puritans. The overall message of this book is beautiful and necessary in a world that struggles to understand the extreme and powerful love of Jesus, however, there were a few chapters where the use of a single verse did lend toward questionable conclusions. If you are struggling to grasp Jesus‚Äô love for you because of your sin, your past, or your life, read¬†Gentle and Lowly¬†and bask in the true love that Jesus is wanting to pour over you.¬†Please Note: I did receive this book as a review copy and was not required or requested to give it a positive review."
"In the year 1645, the Puritan pastor Thomas Goodwin answered the following question: What is the heart of Jesus towards sinners today? For doing so, he published a treatise entitled 'The Heart of Christ in Heaven.' Inspired by this Puritan work, the author of Gentle and Lowly revisits the subject and achieves a unique work worthy of being read on its own.One of the most common accusations against Calvinism is that it is highly intellectual and not warm enough. This book proves the opposite. Dr. Ortlund has succeeded in bringing the Puritans' wisdom and passion while considering the most relevant theological issues to answer that question. And yet he does so while writing in a clear tone and addressing the entire congregation and not just pastors. Furthermore, the way the author defends his thesis is deeply rooted in the Word of God.This book reminds us that Christ's heart for his people today is exactly the same as the one that led him to take our nature. It is the same that led him to obey the Father in everything and ultimately die on a cross. This book reminds us that we can find as much love and compassion in Jesus today as we would have if we had walked with him while he was with us. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to reclaim Christ as their first love or fall more deeply in love with Him.I want to thank Crossway for providing me with a review copy of this book."
"This book won many awards in 2020, and I am not sure why. It wasn‚Äôt a book that had main points I disagreed on or unbiblical ideas, as some suggest. I just believe there are better books on suffering and grief than this one. The book attempts to make Jesus more relatable to the sufferer, as One who has suffered. It is a book showing the heart of Jesus for the one in need of relief. I found the book to be generally helpful and will find occasion to give it away to someone looking to find comfort in the Great Shepherd."
"I've always approached my Christian walk from a standpoint of legalism. Chalk it up to the flawed theology I was exposed to growing up, but my relationship with Christ has always been perceived as transactional; ""Jesus loves you......BUT you have to follow every levitical law, never ever commit a sin again, etc."" Reading this book was like putting down a heavy weight that I've held for a long time. Knowing that as a child of God adopted through the atoning work of Christ, my sins and troubles only provoke compassion and cause Him to draw CLOSER to me rather than further away is the most comforting thing in the world to me right now. Like the quote on the back sleeve from Dr. Michael Reeves; if you're feeling tired, burdened and just burnt out this is the balm for you. Buy it!"
"Gentle and Lowly is a look into the heart of Christ. It is based on Christ‚Äôs only description of his heart. I thought it was simply an updated version of the Puritan Thomas Goodwin‚Äô classic The Heart of Christ. Although Ortlund relies heavily on Goodwin, it is much more than that. The chapters are short making it great for study and discussion or meditation on the revealed truth. It def leaves you wanting more hoping the next section reveals deeper insight into Christ‚Äôs compassion."
"I Loved this book. I do not throw this phrase around lightly, but this book is a ‚Äúmust read,‚Äù particularly for those of us in the evangelical tradition. Ortlund expounds, describes, and biblical proves that the very heart of Christ (as well as what he has done) is the ‚Äúwonderful extra good news‚Äù we sang about so many years ago in Sunday school.Some books make you want to change yourself or change your world. This book makes me want to kneel in adoration and worship Christ."
"In today's society, we talk so much about God's wrath and judgment feeling so overwhelmed by doing the right thing and doing enough making it an entirely works-based relationship. This is not the Gospel and this is not what God wants from you and with you, he wants so much more. He wants your heart and for you to love him. This book drastically impacted the way I see and feel God's love and grace. The scripture that is used is deep and rich and the stories to help illustrate are powerful and really helped me connect it to real-life... My life and personal walk. Please read this book!!!"
"I can't recommend this book highly enough!  This book is a much-needed corrective to our faulty views of God.  God loves us, and Ortlund shows us this truth from Scripture over and over again.  As a pastor in the reformed tradition, I find this book to be timely and essential reading for pastors like me.  We must not only preach the truth of God; we must also know firsthand and preach the heart of God!  Buy this book for everyone you know!  The chapters are reasonably short, so this book works great as a daily devotional."
"Dane is a combination of conviction, kindness, devotion, and contagious joy. And in this book all of that comes out, but more importantly the heart of Christ comes out. This seriously may be my new favorite book. Many pages moved me to tears, and every page stirred me to greater love and affection for Christ, and more importantly every page helped me understand how great the love and affection Christ has for me is (as well as for all His people). This book focuses on the heart of Christ for sinners and sufferers, and since we are all sinners and sufferers it is incredibly relevant for us all. Read this book and be amazed by the love and grace of God in Christ."
"Depending on what theological tradition or family background you grew up with, it is possible that you might struggle greatly with understanding the depth of God's love and mercy for us. Mr. Ortlund's book is a helpful guide to leading us towards mercy from the heart of God. The judgement of God towards sinners is real, but it is a ""strange"" work of God. God's true heart is towards mercy for sinners like you and me and I'm very grateful. Very encouraging book for personal or group study."
"Part of the challenges of walking by faith is losing sight of Christ's heart for his sheep. It's easy to sentimentalize Jesus, making him a thin melody of a Beatle's song with no doctrinal substance. It's also easy to harden Jesus into one who reflects our sense of shame and the reality of how we fall short of what God calls us to. Ortlund does a great job simply meditating on scriptures (with some help from believers who have looked at the same passages before us) that remind us of and refresh us with the heart of Christ. Very helpful devotionally, not the kind of book you should rush through. Take your time, read it slowly and let it's truth marinate on your soul. You'll see Jesus with greater clarity and find yourself resting afresh in the everlasting arms."
"So many reviews have already been written. I only add mine for my personal record.This book is going in my library. It will be read and used time and time again.It is strong, deep, and an excellent exaltation of God. The sentences and words are heavy and some times heady. Many sentences, paragraphs, and chapters have to be read several times to get the full gist.This book is Spirit covered."
Amazing. Helped me better understand the heart of Christ toward me.
"Far too few books concentrate on the Lord Jesus' attributes and His work on behalf of His people. Mining many gems from the Puritans, brother Ortlund offers a lucidly written and up to date book on our Lord's beauties and glories. He writes from a Reformed perspective, so I wouldn't personally endorse all of his teaching; nonetheless, I appreciate his labor in explaining the Lord's great offices and character. All in all, a worthwhile devotional work on an important subject."
I bought this book for my Kindle and really took my time reading it. I often would just read one or two chapters at a time and sit with them. It also often led me to Scripture. I'm very thankful I found this book. I didn't know it existed -- I found it randomly. I was looking for a book that highlighted God's gentle heart... It exceeded my expectations. I recommend taking your time with this one. There's a lot to it ‚ò∫Ô∏è absolutely recommend.I've struggled with having a critical voice and projecting that on Christ. This book has helped me see His voice is so much kinder than I thought. It's beautiful. God has most certainly spoken to me through this one.Many thanks to the author ‚ù§Ô∏è your work has touched my heart. Thank you.
"This is a truly wonderful book, and one of the best I've read over the past few years. It was hyped so much within certain corners of evangelicalism that I was confident it could not meet expectations, but, alas, it exceeded them.Ortlund wrote a book that shows, from the Bible, the heart of Christ for sinners. The book shows Christ to be gentle and lowly. Along the way Ortlund interacts with many voices from the Reformed tradition, and particularly the Puritans (this would serve well as 'first taste' of Puritanism). The chapters are all relatively brief, and yet they contain many amazing exegetical jewels.I hope this book finds an ever-growing readership (which would grow in their understanding of the Saviour's heart), and I personally hope to revisit the book soon."
"Ortlund has provided Christians an incredibly helpful and encouraging resource. This is a book I plan to read again and again. It was a balm for my soul in difficult times, and it is a welcomed correction to the dryness in my theology. ‚ÄúGentle and Lowly‚Äù is both exegetically sound and theologically rich, yet it is anything but stale. The use of language was clear and yet profound, such that it felt as if every word weighed a pound. The heart of Christ toward sinners and sufferers is unchanging and ever-full of love and compassion. I am forever grateful to Ortlund for writing this book, and I think I am forever changed by its content. Every Christian should read this book."
"Ortlund explores the characteristics of Jesus Christ as described in the gospels and Puritan writing. The content is surprising, encouraging, and comforting. It is exactly what I needed to help me get through caring for my family when the virus hit our house. It centered me each morning on Christ‚Äôs heart for me and encouraged me to care for others with the same attitude."
"This book is about the heart of Christ. In other words : what makes Him tick.As for the Bible having scientific accuracy the following:1. Round Earth hanging on nothing2., Man from soil3. Jet streams4. Location of first civ (Mesopotamia5. Head growing bodyMuch more!"
"I would love more than anything to write a review of this book that would adequately convey how beatiful it is, however I feel that any attempt to describe it will simply fall short. It is the greatest book I have ever read about the heart of Jesus for his people. In fact, it may be one of the greatest books I have ever read period."
"Through the Lords good Providence, this book came into my hands at just the right time.A beautiful look at the heart of Christ. A celebration of His love for His own and the glorious grace of His gospel.Broken up into short chapters, it would make an excellent short daily morning read.I cannot recommend this book more."
"This book has been on my radar for awhile as I‚Äôve seen and heard many rave about it.I love the dissection of Ortlund here in scripture and pulling in the Sibbes, Owens and others to speak to deep hearted truths.I am grateful for authors who speak to what others have taught them through their writings.The gift of this book is how it helps me grow in my capacity to understand my identity in Christ and also use it for the personal ministry to others."
"There's a reason this book came out nine months ago and already has almost 2,500 reviews. It's destined to be a classic. Using his knowledge of the original language and citing a solid list of other writers (including Puritan insight), Ortlund explains the gospel message we find in Matthew 11:29. It's good news that our Savior is gentle and lowly in heart."
"This book is about the heart of Jesus Christ.What the author (Dane C. Ortlund) looks to do and does rather well is give the reader a sneak peak into the heart of Jesus. This is a colossal task as he looks to explain something one can‚Äôt fully explain, but can only experience.In all of the four gospels Jesus makes direct reference to his heart in only one occasion; in Matthew 11:19 when he says ‚Äú‚Ä¶for I am gentle and lowly in heart.‚ÄùThis is interesting because, when it comes to Jesus we tend to think he is everything except who Jesus himself says he is (in heart) ‚Ä¶gentle and lowly."
"This is one of the most paradigm-shifting books I have ever read. I think it's message, taken to heart, has the power to revolutionize our lives and fill us with joy and a deep love of our Blessed Savior. The heart of Jesus is presented to us in a way that irresistibly pulls us in and sets us free."
I was given this book at a men's group I recently started attending. In fact it was my first visit and they had just started reading the book.It has been a breath of fresh air in a market saturated with quick fixes and mans doctrine. The simple truths we have and the pure heart of Jesus come through in a way as to leave you panting with joy after every page and feeling the faithfulness of a loving father.  It will be one of my favorites for sometime I imagine.
"I used to force myself to finish books, but I have learned to let things go when it isn't holding my interest or teaching me something.This book, for me, wasn't worth keeping on reading. I abandoned it mid-read and passed on to someone else."
"Excellent detailing of Christ's character and His prejudice toward us. Author presents deep theological truths in an easy to understand and comprehensible way. I found it very helpful in better grasping what it means to find my  ""rest"" in Jesus."
"Other than the Bible, few books I've read so consistently, passionately, aggressively, and joyfully challenge my meager, harsh, unbelieving thoughts of God's mercy towards me in Christ. Do yourself a favor and read this as soon as you can."
"This book will point you to the Lord Jesus Christ, clothed in his humility. It will bless and encourage you. To read this book is to personally and intimately gaze upon the treasure of Jesus. Highly recommend."
"I very much appreciated the way the author used Scripture to show what Christ's heart towards us is. I recommend it to those who need an encouragement, need to be reassured that God does care for them."
"I agree with every glowing review of this book. It's everything everyone is saying about it.If you need a fresh encounter with Jesus, read this book."
Love this book. I wish I had read it sooner in life. It‚Äôs a beautiful and thorough explain action of who Christ is to us and how He sees us.
"Biblical, thoughtful, encouraging, and life-giving. This is one to meditate on daily, and to live daily.  As he says, how do you live the Christian life? 1. Go to Jesus.  2.  See #1."
With every page my love for Jesus is growing. Thoroughly biblical themes of Christ's compassion with great insights from Puritan writers.
A well written look at a side of Jesus that is not commonly written about. Dane pulls many of the gems he writes on about Jesus from the Puritans. Very encouraging and helpful.
"I know people love this book and for a different sort of reader, I'm sure it's helpful. For me, it was just too affective."
"The message may be good but it is the slowest and dullest book I've ever tried to read. The author, in this book at least, doesn't know how to get his point across without dragging on."
Received this as a gift and found it to be the best book I've read. I'm about to purchase it for a friend
This book has shown me something I have not understood about Jesus love for me. I really want to live in this unending no bottom love. Ortland has consistently revealed the boundless caring love of Christ for me. There is nothing that I have done or thought that has dimmed or dampened His love. In fact His love is something I have never known. I want to live peacefully and contentedly in this love
"Must read for all believers. I rarely read a book twice. As soon as I finished this book, I started it over again."
Very good audiobook. Great teachings and reminders. The narrator did a good job too!
I‚Äôm an LPC. The wisdom inside this book is the opportunity refresh and revitalize your heart!A must read for anyone wanting to be a child after the Father‚Äôs own heart.
The most profound book I have read in a long time. Yet it is simple. Quit thinking you know what God is Like and starting believing His self revelation.
"What a wonderfully written and heartfelt book.  As you read it you are torn with the choice of wanting to enthusiastically move on to the next chapter, or pause and re-read the chapter you just finished so you can better absorb the message Ortlund is passing on.  An genuinely exceptional book.  Inspiring!"
"Accessible, biblical, and encouraging. Many, many take aways and I cannot recommend it enough."
This is a must-read book. Do yourself a favor and buy it ASAP.
Trust me: read it.
Excellent  perspective on what the heart of Jesus really looks like.  Thank you for this book!
"I love this book. Gentle and Lowly is beautifully written, and the author takes the reader to a deeper understanding of the heart of Christ.  I am reading it for the second time."
"I really loved this book! I was gifted it by a friend and highly recommend it. It helped me understand the Character of who God is to us as Christians. It is a great read, not cheesy like some Christian books."
"This book will help you do just that. With rich insights from Goodwin, Sibbes, Bunyan, Edwards, as well as modern pastoral theologians, Ortland helps us experience the warm, strong covenant embrace of Jesus"
Chapter 9 alone is worth more than you will pay for this book.
It is the most profound book I have ever read second only to The Bible. It truly explains the scope of Gods love for His people. It has blessed me so much I bought 4 copies so far to give to others so they can be blessed by it.
The author provides in each chapter some of the most encouraging thoughts about the person and work of Jesus the Messiah from one older Christian author. My wife and I have already recommended this book to many people.
I've gone to church my whole life and never read about the heart of Christ.  Stunning and life changing -- allows you to feel and accept God's lavish love.
"This book changed my life. Next to scripture, I would say this book is the book that moved my spirit the most. Highly recommend to anyone: new, old, or questioning Christian alike."
"This is most important book that you will read this year, or next. Ortlund helps us to see the love of Christ for His people even now in heaven. This is a wonderful book and one that will be reread often."
Loved every page of it. So rich and edifying. It'll help your heart to love Jesus more.
I agree with another reviewer this book is a feast for the soul!
"So accessible, but so sweet and biblical view of the heart of our Savior!Take it a chapter at a time.  Take your time.  Think deeply about how good and kind is the Son."
"Made Christ more personal and relational, highly recommend it!"
"This book is medicine to a heart that is sick with fear, doubt and despair. Each chapter encourages the reader to come wholeheartedly and embrace the love that is in Christ JESUS for them."
The most important book I'll read in 2021 - a beautiful display of Christ's heart for his creation. I will read it again and again.
This book is my generation‚Äôs ‚ÄúKnowing God‚Äù. I believe people will still be reading and discussing this book in 100 years.
"I love how simply and deeply the writer invites us to discover Christ's heart. Beyond His actions, to seek to know and imitate His heart."
"Biblically sound, beautiful explanation of how Jesus draws near to us in our sin and brokenness.  Highly recommend."
Absolutely loved this book. Simple and clear reminding me each day of Christ's deep love
Unbelievable read and highly recommend to all who desire the true character of Christ.
It helped me understand the love of Christ in a much more personal way.
This is a book I will read and recommend again and again. A new Christian classic.
Thankful for the precious truths this book expounds.
"This book is amazing, a must read!"
This book so clearly shows us the heart of Christ! So thankful for this read during this very unsure season!
read it
This is a great book to understand the heart of the Father. I'm eternally grateful for finding this gem. My whole perspective has changed about God. I struggled badly with thinking I had to perform to get God to accept me and in my mind I thought God was so tired of my many mistakes. I literally thought He was sitting in Heaven waiting to whoop me every time I messed up. Some of my thoughts were like that because of the way I was raised and how I was introduced to God by the church. Everyday I'm working on believing God at his word and truly understanding the heart of Jesus is truly dripping in love and compassion for me. This book is definitely a game changer in my journey with God. If you struggle with believing Jesus loves you and that God is a good good Father or maybe you think you have to perform to gain acceptance from Him or maybe you have wrong perceptions about who He is and maybe you've been explaining him wrong I highly recommend this book even if you don't struggle with anything I mentioned above. Chapter 6 was definitely the one that wrecked me the most. I felt so overwhelmed with the love of God. You will not regret getting this book!!
Amazing book!!!!  Captures the heart of Jesus!
"This rich book takes the depth and insight of great Puritan teachers and repackages their insights for a modern audience.  Adding his own zeal-full commentary, Ortlund makes the case that at the core of Jesus‚Äô heart is gentleness and lowliness towards his people‚Äîtoward you! Best if read meditatively as a devotional."
"I am encouraged, humbled and blessed. I‚Äôm not yet done and already gifting it to others."
Such a good book!
Really changes the typical depiction of a wrathful Father. Highlighting the rich love and mercy of God and just how much the redemptive power of Christ should mean. Great read for both mature and younger christians.
"Gentle and Lowly, the Heart of Christ For Sinners and Sufferersby Dane Ortlund (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2020) 224 pp., hard $14.85.Using the Puritans, especially Thomas Goodwin, as his guiding interpretive model (p. 14), Dane Ortlund sets out to write a book about the heart of Christ‚Äîwho He really is (p. 13). The target audience is:‚Äú. . . The discouraged, the frustrated, the weary, the disenchanted, the cynical, the empty. Those running on fumes. Those whose Christian lives feel like constantly running up a descending escalator‚Äù (p. 13).The strategy being employed is to ‚Äútake either a Bible passage or a bit of teaching from the Puritans or others and consider what is being said about the heart of God and of Christ‚Äù (p. 15). The controlling text, however, is Matthew 11:28-30 in which Jesus describes Himself as gentle and lowly.‚Äù This is the one place, the author writes, where Jesus tells us His heart‚Äîwhat He truly is (pp. 17-19). The essence of Jesus is gentle, meek, humble and lowly, accessible, approachable (pp. 19-23). ‚ÄúGentleness is who He is,‚Äù Ortlund claims (p. 21). As a result, we can approach Jesus with all our burdens and sins and find welcome, compassion and relief, for compassion is the emotion most frequently attributed to Jesus (p. 105).The author does not deny the wrath and anger of Christ as related to sin and sinners, and he does not find God‚Äôs wrath and mercy at odds (pp. 29, 108). Still, Ortlund leans toward Christ‚Äôs mercy claiming it is what most naturally pours out of Him (pp. 29, 108). Recognizing the danger of over-balancing toward mercy he states, ‚ÄúThen let us be accordingly disproportionate.  Better to be biblical than artificially ‚Äòbalanced‚Äô‚Äù (p. 29).  This statement represents a serious weakness in the book, but more on that later.The rich takeaway from Gentle and Lowly is that the believer must fully comprehend the mercy of Jesus for He is tender and compassionate (pp. 43-44), deals gently with sinners (p. 54), is the friend of sinners (p. 114), invites us to approach Him, and in Him we will find rest from our burdens.  This is a powerful and much needed message for many Christians today who fear approaching Christ thinking that He will reject them.  To know that one has a faithful, gracious, loving, understanding, and forgiving High Priest in Jesus is one of the most needed messages for the people of God today.  ‚ÄúWhen life is a mess go to Jesus for He is gentle and lowly‚Äù would summarize the central idea of the book.  And when we appreciate Jesus‚Äô mercy it redefines who we are as believers: ‚ÄúIt is the sun of Christ‚Äôs heart, not the clouds of my sins, that now define me‚Äù (p. 187).  And ‚Äúwe are pieces of art, designed to be beautiful and thus draw attention to our artist‚Äù (p. 208).  When we understand ourselves in these ways changes how we navigate through life.  We still sin, but when we do ‚Äúwe forsake our true identity as a child of God, we invite misery into our lives, and we displease our heavenly Father‚Äù (p. 92).  Nevertheless, even at our lowest moments of sin, Jesus invites us to come to Him where we will find compassion and mercy.  While in many ways this is Christianity 101, far too few believers have ever grasped these marvelous truths.  Ortlund winsomely and skillfully showcases the loving nature of our Savior for all to marvel.Sadly, all is not well.  As we view the message of Gentle and Lowly‚Äîthat Christ is compassionate, kind, longs to forgive our sin and be our friend (pp. 114-118), in light of the target audience, normal Christians, sinners and sufferers (p. 14), we deeply appreciate the overall theme. But in attempting to press home this truth the author often overreaches in ways that are theologically problematic. As was mentioned earlier in this review, Ortlund wants to be biblical rather than artificially balanced (p. 29).  Unfortunately, he falls into his own trap by artificially balancing toward mercy and compassion at the expense of a true, comprehensive portrait of God as found in Scripture.  For example:‚Ä¢ God‚Äôs greatness suffers when we are told ‚Äúseeing God‚Äôs greatness is not our deepest need, but seeing His goodness‚Äù (p. 97).  While the emphasis of the book is on Jesus‚Äô goodness, in no sense should it be separated from His greatness, His majesty, His sovereignty, or His magnificence.  This is an artificial division of divine attributes.‚Ä¢ There is ‚Äúno such thing as grace,‚Äù only Christ (p. 69).  Ortlund rightly wants to take his reader to a Person, not a thing, but to dismiss grace as nonexistent is to ignore the clear teaching of Scripture‚Äî‚ÄúFor by grace you have been saved‚Äù (Eph 2:8).  This is an artificial division between the person and work of Christ.‚Ä¢ Quoting from Thomas Goodwin concerning God‚Äôs pity upon sinners he writes, ‚ÄúIf true of God, how much more of Christ‚Äù (p. 167).  Such a statement is wrong on many fronts, not the least of which is the fact that Christ is God.  The quote, as it stands, contrasts the compassion of God with that of Jesus and gives Jesus the nod.  This is an artificial distinction between the love of the Father and the love of the Son.‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúThere are two ways to live the Christian life.  You can live it either for the heart of Christ or from the heart of Christ.  You can live for the smile of God or from it‚Äù (p. 181).  While Ortlund is correctly attempting to explain in this context that our obedience does not strengthen the love of God (p. 182), the detachment between for and from cannot be maintained biblically.  Paul writes that it was his ambition to be pleasing to Christ (2 Cor 5:9), and to do all for the glory of God (1 Cor 10:31).  The author‚Äôs emphasis is important but this distinction is artificial.‚Ä¢ In attempting to express the immensity of God‚Äôs love, Ortlund writes, ‚ÄúHis heart is an avalanche, gathering momentum with time; a wildfire, growing in intensity as it spreads‚Äù (p. 203).  This comment comes dangerously close to a denial of God‚Äôs immutability.  The Lord does not change or grow.  His love is constant; it is not gathering momentum.  This is an artificial understanding of the outworking of God‚Äôs love and His very nature.‚Ä¢ The deepest concern with Ortlund‚Äôs theology is not his denial of any of the Lord‚Äôs attributes, or even the above artificial distinctions, but his elevation of some of God‚Äôs attributes above others.  There is essentially a rating scale upon which the attributes of God are weighed and mercy comes out the winner (pp. 129-141; 147-149).  The author admits the Father is just and righteous, ‚ÄúBut what is His heart?  What flows out from His deepest being?  What does He beget?  Mercies‚Äù (p. 129).  ‚ÄúWhat should come into our minds when we think of God‚Ä¶ [He is] a fountain of endless mercies‚Äù (p. 132).  As He wrestles with the severity and judgment of God, Ortlund is forced to conclude that ‚ÄúGod is in conflict with Himself when He sends affliction‚Äù (p. 138).  Judgment is ‚Äúsomething contrary to Him, there is always something in His heart against it‚Äù (p. 139).  But when it comes to mercy ‚Äúthere is no reluctance in Him‚Äù (p. 139).  Again, ‚Äúmercy is natural to Him, punishment is unnatural‚Äù (p. 140).At this point Ortlund seems to realize that he is dangerously close to pitting God against God so he states his agreement with the doctrine of simplicity‚Äîthat ‚ÄúGod is not the sum total of a number of attributes, like pieces of a pie making a whole pie; rather God is every attribute perfectly.  God does not have parts‚Äù (p. 14).  But he cannot resist returning to his denials of simplicity by cherry picking texts and over emphasizing his central theme: ‚ÄúYet‚Ä¶there are some things that pour out of God more naturally than others.  God is unswervingly just.  But what is His disposition?... If you catch God off guard [an impossibility, by the way] what leaps out most freely is blessing‚Äù (pp. 140-141). In response to his own question, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt the glory of God a matter of His greatness, not His goodness?‚Äù he writes, ‚Äúapparently not‚Äù (p. 147).  Goodness trumps greatness.  To slice and dice God into parts and then elevate one part above all the others is not merely artificially out of balance, it is dangerous.  It is reducing the essence of God and in the process de-Goding God.Ortlund so wants to emphasize the goodness, compassion, and mercy of God that he misuses and takes out of context many biblical passages such as Hebrews 5:2 (p. 53), Revelation 1:16 (p. 54), Hosea 11 (p. 75), John 14:26 (p. 24), Mark 6:48 (p. 153), even as he exegetes numerous texts accurately and with clarity.Gentle and Lowly contains marvelous insights into the merciful heart of God and its application to the life of the believer.  Multitudes of Christians need and will be enriched by this teaching.  However, careful theologians will be bothered by the doctrinal imbalances and the reductionistic view of God presented in places.  Most who read this book will skip quickly past the doctrinal concerns and zero in on the Lord‚Äôs mercy.  But the truncated view of God found in the book cannot be ignored.Ortlund too easily wants to dismiss the righteous wrath of God, exhibited abundantly throughout Scripture (and even in the life of Jesus) and focus exclusively on mercy and tenderness.  But this does not yield a true picture of God.  Most conservative theologians, if they had to choose a dominant attribute of God would choose holiness.  After all, both in Isaiah 6 and Revelation 4 the angels proclaim His holiness three times, no other attribute receives such honor.  Yet, Ortlund devotes only two pages to the Lord‚Äôs holiness (pp. 69-70).  He does not deny it, but even holiness is apparently not the heart of God, according to the author.  The attributes of God, however, are not rivals. They cannot be parceled into pieces and weighted for importance.  The attributes are who He is in total.  That means, in the context of this book, that God is both holy and just, as well as loving and merciful, and neither should be neglected or pushed aside to over-emphasize the other.  It is not either/or but both/and.Reviewed by Gary E. Gilley, Pastor/teacher at Southern View Chapel."
"I cannot remember when a book made me contemplate, ponder, and think more than this book. The combination of Scripture, Puritan writers, and the authors own insight into the heart of Christ made for excellent reading. Although the book is not particularly long (a scant 224 pages), the truth contained therein absolutely captivated me. How could the heart of Christ not captivate the mind of a true believer?Twenty-three chapters on the heart, love, mercy, and gentleness of Christ toward me, a sinner, encouraged me greatly. The following excerpt from the author's introduction immediately drew me in:""This book is written for the discouraged, the frustrated, the weary, the disenchanted, the cynical, the empty. Those running on fumes. Those whose Christian lives feel like constantly running up a descending escalator. Those of us who find ourselves thinking: 'How could I mess up that bad-again?' It is for that increasing suspicion that God's patience with us is wearing thin. For those of us who know God loves us but suspect we have deeply disappointed him. Who have told others of the love of Christ yet wonder if - as for us - he harbors mild resentment. Who wonder if we have shipwrecked our lives beyond what can be repaired. Who are convinced we've permanently diminished our usefulness to the Lord. Who have been swept off our feet by perplexing pain and are wondering how we can keep living under such numbing darkness. Who look at our lives and know how to interpret the data only by concluding that God is fundamentally parsimonious. It is written, in other words, for normal Christians. In short, it is for sinners and sufferers.""I love that Ortlund approaches the book's subject with a humble heart regarding those who have gone before us. ""We are neither the first nor the smartest to read the Bible."" However, he then follows up with a paramount truth - the truth that the Bible reigns supreme. ""Goodwin and the others raised in this book such as Sibbes and Bunyan are channels, not sources. The Bible is the source.""Before ending the introduction, the author asks a question that I believe resonates with any believer (especially ministers). ""Do you live with an awareness not only of his atoning work for your sinfulness but also of his longing heart amid your sinfulness?"" Ahhh, we who teach and preach the unsearchable riches of Christ know and love Christ's atoning work FOR our sinfulness, but are often uninformed, unequipped, or ignorant of Christ's longing heart in the MIDST of our sinfulness.The very first chapter grabbed me in a profound way. The author shares that his dad pointed out something to him that Spurgeon had pointed out to him. Namely that in the four Gospel accounts given to us in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John - eighty-nine chapters of Biblical text - there's only one place where Jesus tells us about His own heart. And that is found in Matthew 11:29. The author springboards from that to formulate the truth that the MO of Jesus' heart is that of ""gentle and lowly.""There is nary a chapter in which I did not underline sentences, write notes, or sit back and mull over the truths being conveyed by the author. I highly recommend this book to every Christian...especially to every minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ!Here are a few of my favorite excerpts:""The cumulative testimony of the four Gospels is that when Jesus Christ sees the fallenness of the world all about him, his deepest impulse, his most natural instinct, is to move toward that sin and suffering, not away from it."" p. 30""Our trouble is that we do not take the Scripture seriously when it speaks of us as Christ's body. Christ is the head; we are his own body parts. How does a head feel about his own flesh? The apostle Paul tells us: 'He nourisheth and cherisheth it' (Ephesians 5:29)."" p. 40""Our tendency is to feel intuitively that the more difficult life gets, the more alone we are. As we sink further into pain, we sink further into felt isolation. The Bible corrects us. Our pain never outstrips what he himself shares in. We are never alone. That sorrow that feels so isolating, so unique, was endured by him in the past and is now shouldered by him in the present."" p. 48""If you are in Christ, you have a Friend who, in your sorrow, will never lob down a pep talk from heaven. He cannot bear to hold himself at a distance. Nothing can hold him back. His heart is too bound up with yours."" p. 50""Look to Christ. He deals gently with you. It's the only way he knows how to be. He is the high priest to end all high priests. As long as you fix your attention on your sin, you will fail to see how you can be safe. But as long as you look to this high priest, you will fail to see how you can be in danger. Looking inside ourselves, we can anticipate only harshness from heaven. Looking out to Christ, we can anticipate only gentleness."" p. 57""Fallen, anxious sinners are limitless in their capacity to perceive reasons for Jesus to cast them out. We are factories of fresh resistances to Christ's love."" p. 63""He sides with you against your sin, not against you because of your sin. He hates sin. But he loves you."" p. 71""The sins of those who belong to God open the floodgates of his heart of compassion for us. The dam breaks. It is not our loveliness that wins his love. It is our unloveliness."" (musings on Hosea 11:7-9) p. 75""The fall is manifested not only in our sinning but in our response to our sinning. We minimize, we excuse, we explain away. In short, we speak, even if only in our hearts, in our defense. We advocate for ourselves. What if we never needed to advocate for ourselves because another had undertaken to do so? What if that advocate knew exhaustively just how fallen we are, and yet at the same time was able to make a better defense for us than we ever could? No blame shifting or excuses, the way our self-advocacies tend to operate, but perfectly just, pointing to his all-sufficient sacrifice and sufferings on the cross in our place? We would be free."" p. 93""Do not minimize your sin or excuse it away. Raise no defense. Simply take it to the one who is already at the right hand of the Father, advocating for you on the basis of his own wounds. Let your own unrighteousness, in all your darkness and despair, drive you to Jesus Christ, the righteous, in all his brightness and sufficiency."" p. 94""Let Jesus draw you in through the loveliness of his heart. This is a heart that upbraids the impenitent with all the harshness that is appropriate, yet embraces the penitent with more openness than we are able to feel."" p. 99""Nowhere else in the Bible is God described as rich in anything. The only thing he is called rich in is: mercy."" p. 172""Christ was sent not to mend wounded people or wake sleepy people or advise confused people or inspire bored people or spur on lazy people or educate ignorant people, but to raise dead people."" p. 175""To you I say, the evidence of Christ's mercy toward you is not your life. The evidence of his mercy toward you is his - mistreated, misunderstood, betrayed, abandoned."" p. 179""Our sins darken our feelings of his gracious heart, but his heart cannot be diminished for his own people due to their sins any more than the sun's existence can be threated due to the passing of few wispy clouds or even an extended thunderstorm. The sun is shining. It cannot stop. Clouds, no clouds - sin, no sin - the tender heart of the Son of God is shining on me. This is an unflappable affection. And the sweep of New Testament teaching is that it is the sun of Christ's heart, not the clouds of my sins, that now defines me."" pp.186-187""When you sin, do a thorough job of repenting. Re-hate sin all over again. Consecrate yourself afresh to the Holy Spirit and his pure ways. But reject the devil's whisper that God's tender heart for you has grown a little colder, a little stiffer. He is not flustered by your sinfulness. His deepest disappointment is with your tepid thoughts of his heart. Christ died, placarding before you the love of God."" p.194""He is called God, the King of glory. But the persons of him beloved, are called transgressors, sinners, enemies, dust and ashes, fleas, worms, shadows, vapors, vile, filthy, sinful, unclean, ungodly fools, madmen. And now is it not to be wondered at, and are we not to be affected herewith, saying, And will you set your eye upon such a one? But how much more when He will set his heart upon us?"" p. 203"
"content/substance: greatintended audience: white peopleSo basically, this is a great book trying to persuade white people that God in Christ is actually merciful and gracious, compassionate and abounding in steadfast love. Why do I say that? Three pages of ""blurbs"" in the front and on the back cover of the book -- every single one of them a white person. A hundred (? I didn't count them up) quotes in the book -- every single one of them a white person: John Stott, Donald Macleod, J.I. Packer, Herman Bavinck, B. B. Warfield, C. S. Lewis, John Calvin, Louis Berkhof; Puritans like John Flavel, Thomas Goodwin, John Owen, John Bunyan, Richard Sibbes, and of course, extended quotes from Jonathan Edwards. And look, if that list of white people can't convince other white people that God in Christ is fundamentally merciful and gracious and gentle, then I'm not sure anyone can.So for what it is, it's great. But it is what it is."
"Good theology, but so dry and wordy.  Hard to muddle through at times."
This book helped me to draw closer to Jesus and know more about his heart. We had a group Bible Study and studied a chapter for each week. Each chapter had a ton of meat in it and lead to amazing group conversations. This book is worth every penny and more.
This book will be read for years. Such a great book.
"I know God loves me, but somehow this opens a window to see Jesus loves me more than I conceive. If you suffer emotionally or physically, you need this book!"
"This book is the easiest 5 star review I've ever given. The writing is first easy to read. It's not too heavy or academic. Yet it is scripturally based and not in ways that a lot of modern non-academic Christian books are (in that the scripture only exists to prove the author's point). In this book, the author uses his words to merely expound on and explain scripture. I loved it.No fancy, fluffy stories either, which add lots of pages to a lot of books but no substance. This book simply tells the story of God as he seeks out humans. It's amazing.I nearly cried several times and actually cried at least twice. At so many points the author gets right to the heart of the matter, that being Christ's heart. I felt closer to my Lord after reading this book.Again, easiest five start review I've ever given."
"The Puritans undoubtedly left a legacy of bringing the errant Church back to Biblical Truth along with the Apostles‚Äô doctrine and were the foundation stone for the challenge of the great Reformers. So it is very helpful when an author seeks to bring back that ancient path of truth by condensing much of those early Christian writings and arranging them into an easily digestible format for the layman. The works of Thomas Goodwin is our main protagonist and is much quoted in this book; along with other prominent players such as Sibbs, Owen, Flavel and Bunyan. Combine their thoughts with the backing of scripture and you have a very good antidote to much of the heresy and bumbling error in the modern Church today. For this reason alone, Dane Ortland‚Äôs book is certainly worth the read.However, the author does something more. He simplifies those Puritanical musings with an almost contemplative study of an incredible attribute as declared by Christ Himself (Matthew 11:29) that of His Heart of gentleness and humility. An important fact the Christian Church has overlooked for centuries. Yet at the same time this astonishing statement by Christ is balanced with the necessity for God‚Äôs anger and punishment of Sin. All is beautifully brought together by the undeniable proof of scripture tying in with the gleanings of those early Christian thinkers. There‚Äôs lots of nutritious ‚Äòsoul food‚Äô to muse and meditate upon in here and it‚Äôs a book I will read time and again.One dropped star because it can feel a little repetitive at times, but there is much that is still worth chewing over which will be of great benefit to every Christian."
"This book makes one discover the very heart of God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ.It shows us the level of bounteous love which God has for us and that we do not need to strive for this love, yet merely go to Christ and it will be given to us.  He is waiting for us.  All sins will be forgiven as they were when Christ died upon the cross at Calvary.You will be moved to tears of joy and relief as you read of the immense love which Christ holds ready for you, should you just offer yourself to Him with an open heart."
"I am really enjoying reading this book. Its like a really good meal - something you just want to savour. I'm in no rush to finish it. On every page I feel the wind of the Spirit blowing through and drawing me deep into greater glimpses of this Wonderful King who so freely and happily pours Himself out for us all. The author has done his research and pulls in authors from many hundreds of years ago to help paint his mesmerizing picture of the kindness and humility of God. Someone in one of the reviews mentioned that this could easily become a classic. The more I read the more I am inclined to agree with them. It really is a great journey, and likely one I will read again and again in the years to come.There have been times reading this book when I've found myself wondering if I really dare to believe that God is this good. And yet I have been deep-diving into the love of God for the past ten years, reading many a great book, hearing many an inspiring speaker. Yet that's how good this book is - it takes many of us beyond even the high places of our familiar understanding of God's love and challenges us to a different way of seeing Him that is well beyond what we might have imagined. Even if we've heard it all before, Dane Ortland nevertheless presents it in such a fresh way that it really is a pleasure to read. And gazing again upon Him can only be good for us.Some of the author's phrasing is quite delightful too. I don't have any quotes to hand but I've been impressed with his great command of the English language, and the imaginative imagery he uses. He cites an old author Thomas Goodwin on many occasions, who clearly had a great understanding of the amazing humble and selfless love of Jesus. Yet Dane's ability to summarize these inspired texts in punchy and catchy sentences make's his commentary of these inspired writers significantly inspired in itself.I'm going to enjoy reading the rest this book, and enjoy the ride with Jesus. And I really hope it never ends, I'm enjoying the journey too much."
"To say that this book is an instant classic is to trivialize it. Just read it and bask in what it opens up. It is rare to find profundity, sound doctrine, rigorous exegesis and heart-stirring eloquence blended together like this. Read it. It can actually change your life."
"If you do not know Jesus - this book will show you something of His heart of love for you and you will want to know Him. If you already know Him it will further help your faith in the One who is humble and gentle. Lovely book. Easy to read - not heavy going, and highly recommended."
This book is superb and you won't regret reading it. So uplifting and Christ-exalting. A must-read!
This book opens up in a way that I have never considered of the heart of the Trinity to and for His people. Incredibly heartwarming.
concise but thought provoking - one that I will need to read a second time at least!
"This book starts off beautifully, by drawing the reader towards Jesus as a human individual, not just as Almighty God. But it fails as soon as it starts comparing its own teaching with Roman Catholic teaching. It misunderstands and mis-states Catholic doctrine and adopts a dismissive attitude towards it. The truth is that Catholic teaching is not just accepting but embracing and promoting of the biblical revelations of Jesus.The author is too hung up on the fact that he has found some old puritan books, on which this book is based. In importing their anti-Catholic content into his book, he has failed to cut the gristle, fat and bone off the steak before serving it. No Christian purpose is served by regurgitating the misunderstandings and enmities of the late medieval and ""reformation"" periods."
"My one-star review is coming from a Christian, and is based on the fact that this book is marketed and sold as a Christian book, but the focus has little to do with Christ and everything to do with self.This book is full of flowery, feel-good words that have little meaning, and what little meaning they have is often hard to decipher. Lysa‚Äôs writing style is very artistic, using lots of repetitive words in different forms, and so many alliterations. SO MANY ALLITERATIONS. It‚Äôs not a bad thing. She‚Äôs a good writer. But, there is so much flowery language it‚Äôs often hard to grasp what she‚Äôs actually saying.In addition, I believe there is misinterpreted scripture throughout. One example is her use of Genesis 2:25. She writes:‚ÄúOne of my favorite verses in the Bible is, ‚ÄúAdam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame‚Äù (Genesis 2:25). They were vulnerable... not at risk of being exposed but so very open to being loved. They didn‚Äôt feel ashamed of themselves. They didn‚Äôt shame each other. They didn‚Äôt act shamefully in any way. I‚Äôve often said this was because ‚Äúthey had no other opinions to contend with but the absolute love of God.‚Äù(1) This is true.‚ÄùAdam and Eve didn‚Äôt feel shame because there was no sin in Genesis 2:25. That verse comes before the fall. It has nothing to do with being vulnerable with one another (as she goes on to suggest), or being ‚Äúopen to being loved,‚Äù and everything to do with the perfect (literally), sinless world they lived in.  This is just one example of how Lysa pulls scripture to fit her writing rather than fit her writing to what scripture says.Besides that, and my biggest reason for the one star, is that this is a self-help book. Not a Christ centered, gospel driven Christian book, but one that over and over again focuses on what YOU need to do for YOURSELF in order to forgive others, and not the power of what Christ has done on the cross for you."
"The sample consisted only of sources for the book, chapter info, not one page of the actual book. So I stupidly ordered it paying more than I normally would for a book. By page 2 I deleted the book. What a bunch of crap. Yes, she talked about being hurt, but her main topic was to ‚Äúthink about all the good times‚Äù.  Seriously? The people who hurt me so much that I can‚Äôt forgive them destroyed any good memory I might have had. Garbage. Wish I had my $14 back"
"I knew this book would a be a good resource to me. I came across it by accident, and I am so happy I did. A year and a half ago I found out my husband was having an affair shortly after my mom passed. A death of a parent and a marriage back to back was too much to bare. I didn‚Äôt think I was going to make it, but I refused to give up. With constant prayer, support from family and friends and staying adamant that I would make it through hard work, I am in a better place. I still have a lot of work to do, but I am thankful I am not where I was a year ago. This book came right on time and I am excited about this book."
"Many of Lysa's life experiences have mirrored my own, so I hoped that I would find this book just as timely and applicable to my life as I did her last one, ""It's Not Supposed to Be This Way: Finding Unexpected Strength When Disappointments Leave You Shattered.""I did. I downloaded it and read it through (i.e., devoured it) in one sitting. The book just happened to be released on a day that was a rather hard one for me, so I am even more grateful for the wisdom, grace, and hope contained within. I know that I will be returning to this book regularly in the days to come.I am so very, very grateful that Lysa has allowed God to bring beauty out of her devastation. This book is so very timely and necessary now, in a world full of deeply wounded and badly hurting people.If you have ever been deeply wounded, then I strongly recommend that you grab two copies - one to read, and one to share."
"If possible, this book is even more powerful than her last. It is helped me come to terms with deep feelings of anger and resentment that have plagued me for years. As I deal with cancer and marital woes in the midst of a pandemic, I have ironcially found the most peace I have felt in years. I savored each chapter of this book at it helped me peel back the layers on all the many emotions I was experiencing and make important steps towards healing. I highly recommend."
"I was honored to participate in a focus group in 2019 for this book.  I read much of the material in process and if you have ever struggled with forgiveness of any kind - hurt from marriage, physical or emotional abuse, lies, family members other than spouses, other ""church"" folks, any kind of hurt at all.  This book will help you work through that hurt so you can heal and have JOY again.  God wants us to live joyful lives and you can, it is possible."
"We've all been hurt; no one makes it through life unscathed. Whether it's friends or family, we all have to forgive someone for hurting us. Some of us have been hurt more than others, but in the process of healing, we all need to follow the same path.And forgiving people is probably the very most important thing we can learn, not for the person who hurt us, but for ourselves. We can heal when we leave the hatred, hurt, and anger behind. And the more quickly we forgive, the less that hurt affects us and our relationships with our family, friends, God, etc. We are free to keep growing, to let the past stay in the past and not to bring it with us into our future and poison us there.I love that Lysa TerKeurst knows that you don't get amnesia just because you forgive someone; it's a process. (I've actually had someone told me that if I was a good Christian, I would have amnesia of the events. But in reality, it doesn't work that way.TerKeurst is careful not to downplay anyone's pain while she reminds us that we all have hurts that need to be h healed by forgiving others. She's also careful to warn us that we will have relationships that we'll need to walk away from to protect ourselves.All in all, this is a practical book that I feel even non-Christians could use if they weren't offended by the spiritual content, because this is a very comprehensive book on forgiveness and the difference real forgiveness for others makes in our lives."
"I read though a lot of the reviews. My review is a response to some of the other reviews I read.Lysa is openly coming from a Christian perspective. I share her faith, so that was essential to me, and encouraging to me. I think some people were put off by the theme of her faith through the book- but again- she is openly Christian.Others said it wasn‚Äôt ‚ÄúBible based‚Äù or Christian enough. I have really thought about this response too. Lysa isn‚Äôt claiming this is a theological expose on forgiveness.She is giving a personal testimony and sharing how God brought her through the specific pain and trauma she suffered.I would say that her vulnerability and love for her readers IS Christ-like. She reminds us that we can‚Äôt do this in our own power. Sometimes the pain and hurt is just too deep.One more thing I‚Äôd add... if you are coming to this book because you‚Äôre hurting in pain because of unforgiveness in your heart- spend some serious time devoted to prayer as you read through this book. There is nothing magical or mighty about the book.But we do have a mighty God who can heal all our wounds. Ask him to help you. He helped me.All that to say- I loved it! Thanks, Lysa for writing it!"
"First of all, a confession. I went into my reading of Lysa TerKeurst's ""Forgiving What You Can't Forget"" fully realizing that I have a hit-and-miss relationship with TerKeurst's writings.I appreciate TerKeurst's writing, but I don't always resonate with it. In fact, however, much of what has always bothered me about TerKeurst's writing is somewhat explained in this book in a mostly indirect way as TerKeurst spends a good amount of ""Forgiving What You Can't Forget"" collecting and connecting the dots of her life in a way that has often been absent from her writing.There's an irony in a way. Truthfully, one of the greatest weaknesses of ""Forgiving What You Can't Forget"" isn't fully effective unless you've actually read TerKeurst's other works - especially her last book, ""It's Not Supposed to Be This Way,"" a book which I'm guessing (having not read it) delved deeper into marital trauma caused by her husband's infidelity and her own subsequent challenges with significant medical illness.These pieces are vital to fully appreciating ""Forgiving What You Can't Forget,"" a book largely written from TerKeurst's own experiences with healing from and living with that trauma and, in her case, making the intentional choice to maintain her relationship with her husband.TerKeurst has always written in a very compartmentalized way. It likely makes sense for her, because she's lived it and understands the different pieces of her story. For those of us, however, who've not lived it and who haven't read her every writing it can require a tremendous amount of work to assemble the different pieces while also trying to immerse ourselves in her work. For example, throughout ""Forgiving What You Can't Forget"" she regularly mentions other people who added to her trauma but she never explains these people. Were they covered in her last book? Were they Art's (her husband) affairs? Did they hide his infidelity? In the absence of understanding their roles, which she never explains in this book, it's difficult to appreciate this cornerstone of her discussion.Additionally, there's Art himself. She regularly implies that he saw nothing wrong with his behavior. Yet, at some point, there seemed to be an understanding or a closing of this gap. It's never explained. ""Forgiving What You Can't Forget"" seems, at times, to indicate that because Lysa also had issues that exacerbated marital discord that somehow this justified Art's infidelity. I'm not sure this is what she means to imply, but it feels like there are missing pieces that, again, may have been covered in the previous book. They aren't present here and Art never comes off as much more than a self-centered jerk.Lysa is quick to imply toward the end that self-forgiveness isn't really scriptural but it seems as if this doesn't apply to self-blame - of which she seems very good at owning Art's behavior.While it may seem as if I'm overly criticizing ""Forgiving What You Can't Forget,"" the simple truth is this is the kind of book that needs to be wrestled with and analyzed.And the truth is I wrestled with this book mightily and I did, in fact, find much to value in it. I found myself convicted more than once, particularly of choosing my identity as a victim of trauma over my identity as a child of God.Ouch.It's important to realize that TerKeurst, President of Proverbs 31 Ministries, writes from a primarily evangelical place and points toward forgiveness through an evangelical lens. She writes that forgiveness is required of our faith and also empowered by our faith. If you are not a Christian specifically, you will likely struggle with a good majority of the material in ""Forgiving What You Can't Forget."" While many of the discussions contained within the book are valuable for all survivors of trauma, TerKeurst's solutions almost absolutely require one to be of Christian faith.TerKeurst does a nice job of deconstructing those pieces that can keep us stuck in our victimhood and she creates a strong scriptural argument for working through this deconstruction. She writes from a ""we,"" building a relational connection with her readers, mostly women as she clearly does not write for men, and fully intending to create a journey with her readers while also acknowledging that she continues to be on a healing journey herself.There are little things that bother me. While I consider it wonderful to mention one's own therapy, actually naming that therapist (which she does at least twice) to me is a violation of the therapeutic relationship and a commercialization of it. While I'm certain he likely signed off on it, to me doing so damages the therapeutic relationship.While TerKeurst also acknowledges there are a myriad of different forms of trauma, the vast majority of ""Forgiving What You Can't Forget"" is based within the foundations of her own trauma - especially that of the marital infidelity. Thus, many of the ideas, exercises, and processes she utilizes were developed in dealing with that trauma. Different traumas require different approaches - while she does a wonderful job of making it perfectly clear that abuse is never to be tolerated (and even more impressively creates a scriptural argument for this), there's simply too much ""me"" in her exercises and not enough broadening of the spectrum to include other traumas.Of course, on some level this does make sense. TerKeurst is not a therapist and never pretends to be one. She is, instead, a survivor of trauma who is sharing what has worked for her. She does occasionally go back into her early traumas with men, but it seems like it ultimately always then ties back to the marital concerns.TerKeurst also offers a myriad of resources, especially at book's end. There's an entire chapter of scriptures related to forgiveness and trauma. There's listings of exercises and worksheets that, I believe, she's mostly utilized herself. While she tends to emphasize utilizing a Christian counselor (a point of privilege that goes unchecked), she also offers resources to find one - the American Association of Christian Counselors. She also mentions Focus on the Family, though fails to mention that organization's own controversies.There is much to appreciate here. There is much I take away from this book that will inform my own continued journey, while there are also those pieces I can set aside and say ""That's not for me!"" There are also those pieces that clearly reveal TerKeurst to still be on her own journey and writing from a place of vulnerability and searching. There's a connectedness that I've often found lacking from her writing and it's refreshing. Even when I disagreed with TerKeurst, I appreciated her journey and her willingness to share it on such a raw, honest level. There's less compartmentalizing here and much more connecting the dots.I wrestled, to be honest, with whether or not this should be a 3-star or 4-star effort. In a very definite way, I would consider this to be my favorite of TerKeurst's books even if I don't ultimately rate it the highest. I undoubtedly think it's her most valuable and lasting effort. However, I'm deferring to a 3-star precisely because this subtitle ""Discover How to Move On, Make Peace with Painful Memories, and Create a Life That's Beautiful Again"" feels like a lofty slogan.By the end of ""Forgiving What You Can't Forget,"" it didn't honestly feel like TerKeurst had truly moved on. It didn't feel like she herself had made peace with her painful memories. While she had, it seemed, reconciled with Art there's no sense of the beauty that her title promises.There's a journey. Perhaps that's enough. Perhaps that's what's actually needed, but that's not what the book's title offers up and it certainly seems inconsistent with the journey we've experienced with her and that she's invited us into. At one point, TerKeurst talks about a counselor confronting her on her hyper-spiritualization and, in fact, that's ultimately what I came away from ""Forgiving What You Can't Forget"" seeing. The title makes a promise that TerKeurst herself hasn't lived into, at least not yet, and there's nothing wrong with that. Trauma impacts our faith journey and learning how to live with that on a daily basis is valuable and necessary. In some ways, I wish TerKeurst had simply dialed it down a bit and worried less about becoming the Christian she's supposed to be and focused more on learning how forgiveness ties into the Christian that she actually is in her daily life.All the challenges aside, please know that ""Forgiving What You Can't Forget"" is a valuable and important addition to the discussion of forgiveness that is so incredibly vital to the faith journey. You may agree with TerKeurst and you may disagree with TerKeurst, but the fact that she's so vulnerably and honestly having these discussions is refreshing and necessary."
"Catchy title, nicely formatted and quite artistic on the inside in terms of the design of chapter headings and so-on. Also, the author seems like an honest person if that matters. That‚Äôs what I liked.What I didn‚Äôt like is that it was too religious.The author states she has spent over 1,000 hours researching the topic of forgiveness in the Bible, yet her questions regarding how to forgive haven‚Äôt all been answered.  You could probably read the Bible fifty times if you spent a thousand hours reading it. If she spent 1,000 hours solely on reading about forgiveness and still hadn‚Äôt gotten it pretty well figured out...well then...Lots of the pages were fluff- advertisements for other books and references to things that didn‚Äôt have much to do with forgiving what I can‚Äôt forget. Things like ‚Äúgive it to God‚Äù aren‚Äôt helpful.The real meat of the book could‚Äôve been written in thirty pages or less."
I don‚Äôt care for the religious stuff if she had stuck to cognitive behavior solutions I might have gotten past page 7. Its my fault for not researching the author. Sorry jesus and the Bible tell me nothing.  I‚Äôm an agnostic go figure. Cognitive behavior therapy is a great tool tool bad it got religion might as well through politics in. Meh
"I did not buy this to participate in a book club activity, to analyze and purchase study guides etc. I expected this to be a standalone book. I keep returning and trying to finish, but am finding it impossible to get through. I have appreciated Lysa's devotional writings on Bible Gateway, but this book rambles on and on and doesn't seem to quite get to the point.  The marketing wording presented this as if it might apply to a wide range of forgiveness issues, and that's what drew me to the book.  This is so hard to read, as it is written more like she is spilling out a stream of consciousness. I kept searching for a strong line of connection to how her faith helped her in this life crisis, but it is bits and pieces and not much guidance or enlightenment. The descriptions of the book allude to the reader discovering their own personal way to forgive what they can't forget. Most of the book seems to painfully retell over and over the many facets of how the author looked upon her own trials.  For my expectations, I was expecting more about the author's faith rather than so much of the book dedicated to explaining the hurt and depression. I hope it helps many other readers, but I'm not sharing this book with my sister for inspiration, as I had hoped to based on the write up and cover descriptions."
"I had high expectations for this book based off of all the reviews I read. This book truly is awful. It felt like it took me forever to get through it. It‚Äôs revolving around her divorce... every part of this book goes back to her divorce. Which would be fine if there was some meat to the book but there isn‚Äôt. I found it kinda of whinny with no true relation to heartbreak that was profound. Disappointed to say the least. If you‚Äôre going through a divorce this might be helpful for you. But if you‚Äôre working through a deeper hurt that positive words and ‚Äòlove everyone no matter what‚Äô doesn‚Äôt help, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend."
"I usually like Lysa‚Äôs books; they‚Äôre usually right on the mark.  As someone with a long history of trauma and unresolved pain, though, I thought this book was somewhat shallow and simplistic.  At times, it even came across as childish.  Maybe not enough time has passed for her to have gained the wisdom of perspective through time.  Whatever it is, this book missed the Mark on forgiveness."
This book is horrible. Dont waste your time! Basically her version of how her husband had an affair and how she her faith got her through it. Doesnt actually give you helpful tips or anything useful for yourself to use.
This author was incredibly confusing. She never got to the point or told the story of her husband‚Äôs infidelity. All she keep writing about was her pain tears and emotions. She wrote in circles. I am an avid reader but I finally gave up on this book when she was writing about canaries and miners - I threw the book in the trash. My husband agreed with me that she was pointless. The title of this book is ‚ÄúForgiving What You Can‚Äôt Forget‚Äù - well I think this ‚Äúauthor‚Äù FORGOT the main point which is to write about the infidelity that happened in her marriage rather than just describing her endless hurt feelings. This is a horrible book a complete waste of money I can‚Äôt believe this garbage got published.
I cannot recommend this book enough!! I am to chapter 8 and it‚Äôs life changing!! We have to make a decision to forgive devoid of the offenders ability to be sorry for the action....no matter what the offense!!!
"I've really been put through the ringer the past 2 years.  I lost all of my hair due to alopecia universalis in 2019.  Part of me blamed myself for my hair loss.  I thought maybe if I had eaten better, tried to destress better, etc.  I became bitter and angry about everything in life.  Then, my husband and I had extreme marital problems, including 2 affairs over the past 2 years.  My MIL has treated me terrible for over a decade, including encouraging and rewarding my husband for his most recent affair.  I was at rock bottom.  I was able to forgive my husband and we are currently reconciling but I really struggle with forgiving my MIL, the affair partner and most importantly, myself.  This book has helped me to realize that my forgiveness is for me and not others.  It has showed me that you can forgive and not reconcile.  Lysa uses scripture behind every point she makes and because she has gone through an affair herself she truly understands that pain that causes.  Unless you have been through it yourself, you truly don't understand.  What I love about this book is that it doesn't bash the people that have hurt you.  She reiterates time and time again that they are hurt people and hurt people hurt others.  When you look at life through that lens, it is easier to forgive others.  Reading her book has given me a sense of peace I haven't felt in a long time and I do believe that I will be able to forgive those that have hurt me so that I can move forward with my life."
"This book approached forgiveness in a totally different way than I'm used to seeing from other authors, speakers and theologians.  Lisa wasn't afraid to ""go there""--to go to the hard questions about how you handle people in your life who may still be toxic--you forgive them, but how do you exist ""safely"" with them?  I don't think there was an aspect of forgiveness that she didn't cover!  This book truly spoke to my heart and brought me to tears more than once.  She cares so much for the reader citing that healing IS indeed possible when we have been hurt, rejected, judged, etc.  This has been a hard year for so many and relationships have often felt the stress of the year too.  Give yourself the best gift to end the year on so you can start 2021 fresh and with a heart open to healing...all through forgiveness.  Don't pass up this book!"
"Lots of insights and revelations! I cannot recommend this DVD/study, the book, and the journal highly enough! As someone that‚Äôs walked through a lot of pain in childhood, and in my marriage, it‚Äôs a resource so incredibly valuable to me. I‚Äôve walked this healing journey for a while, and have sought the Lord throughout my whole journey, and I believe this book and resources are perfectly timed. I‚Äôve never read and studied anything about forgiveness like this! We, at some point, all wrestle through how to forgive. We KNOW we are called to...but HOW?! When your heart is so completely shattered, how do you forgive? What does it look like? What is it not? There‚Äôs no shaming here. No finger pointing at your wrestling. It‚Äôs so refreshing, coupling grace AND truth! Truly walking you through the process...guiding you on a journey. There are so many one liner takeaways that are so powerful. It‚Äôs like talking with a trusted friend that loves you enough to lovingly tell you the truth, but with SO much understanding, grace, and compassion. A me-too. I believe this is quite possibly my favorite book and study...and as a book fanatic, that‚Äôs saying A LOT! So incredibly thankful for this resource!!"
Not one of her best books.  Repeats the thoughts again and again.  Lost interest
"Only on page six..this is whaty heart - soul have been craving for over 2 years. My heart has been hardened by pain & deception. No pills, no prayers, no counseling has been able to give my heart what it needs... Lysa is that friend I have been searching for, the words I couldn't find, the voice I don't have..this has brought me clarity in 6 pages. I just want peace in my soul again, I want to unpack forgiveness and understand it & be able to cooperate with it. I think I am finally on the right path.."
"I have not bought any self help books prior to this and bought it after catching part of a TV interview and the title of the book appealed to me. I ordered it not reading the reviews.I do not believe in God and do not plan to start now. It is a real shame as some of the opening chapters I really related to until she started quoted Bible verses and God.I am halfway though, I am trying to perservere but I feel like this is almost a book that although she says she has forgiven her husband as she focusses heavily on his affair, that this is to punish him further in print.I hope that I can get through this and skim over the religious aspects that for me are completely unhelpful, I was hoping for pratical real life ways to deal with forgiving and praying and refering to scripture is not doing it for me.She seems a nice lady that has been through a lot and I hope her marriage works out but I feel like this is quite focussed on her own experiences which is fine if this book made it clear that she is trying to help you overcome your husband cheating which wasn't my issue so again hard to relate to."
Great book for those who need help after experiencing something similar or something on the same level. However this just doesn't work for me personally as someone who is a suicide survivor. It's a bit a hard to take advice from someone who hasn't been through it or is a professional I feel. Honestly I couldn't even read more than half the book.
"Being able to forgive (let go of, not obsess over, not be controlled by, not shrivel up from bitterness because of) is a must for true heart healing. How one does this when the effects of the hurt are so very deep and/or the person still in their life can often seem nearly impossible. Lisa provides great biblical, practical & clinical truth, advice, and steps to take in order to find or walk alongside those devastated by the actions of others. Because her wounds came mainly from marital infidelity, the illustrations come from this topic, but the truths can cross over to any wounds or hurts suffered."
"This book found me at the right time in life. Lysa addressed and answered all of the questions I had. It is a great biblical guide on forgiveness, what it means, what it doesn‚Äôt mean, she also addresses trust and reconciliation. She offers empathy, sympathy, understanding along with a nonjudgmental atmosphere. She is real in her words, in helping the reader heal, collect, correct, connect the dots in becoming a person that doesn‚Äôt suffer because of the wrongs of other people. This book is helping me heal from the pain that other people have so wrongly caused me."
"No one has been able to articulate what I have felt like Lysa has in her book. Lysa articulated so many feelings that I have had, but also gave helpful healing steps to forgive and not stay in the hurt places. It is so hard for me to forgive people who do not think they‚Äôve done anything wrong and when I can‚Äôt see any conviction or remorse over the destruction that they‚Äôve caused. But I‚Äôm learning how. I want to be free from any poison of bitterness or in forgiveness. I‚Äôm so grateful that Lysa allowed the Lord to use her pain to help others like me. Her last two books are incredible. She has a gift with storytelling. I wish I could tell her in person how much her words have meant to me. I haven‚Äôt found anything else like them and I have read a great deal. And the journal that goes with this is great too!"
I could not read more than a few pages at a time. It is SO depressing. I never got past third chapter.
"I wanted to like this book, because I enjoyed her other book, ""It's Not Supposed To Be This Way."" This one seems scatterbrained, written all over the place, like someone who spiderwebs when they talk. Basically all I got from it is ""decide to forgive because God already did."" I had hoped it would be more helpful. I'm going to reread Total Forgiveness instead."
"I followed this book along with the weekly videos by Lysa TerKeurst, over six weeks. Thank you, Faith Gateway, for making this possible. It was truly a wonderful experience, as always.I liked to watch the author as she talks from the heart about what God has opened to her regarding forgiveness. She deposited small nuggets of wisdom across the pages to which I could relate. It helped me to receive perspective on my hurt and pain, where I was not willing to let go. Through her teachings from the Word, I was convinced that I too must forgive completely to receive my healing. I was tired of being in a rut. Thinking and waiting for others to tell me how sorry they were for hurting me. Through this bible study, I realized God is waiting on me. The moment I forgive, I receive freedom.It is so simple but so difficult to reach. And through reading and journaling, I found peace in certain areas of my life. I had to let go of past hurts and resentments to receive not only peace but God's blessings in my life. Unforgiveness stole a lot from me - a fact I had to face and forgive myself as well.The biggest revelation of it all was to forgive me. I really had to become still to receive understanding and insight and then to let go. Once it was done, it felt so easy, and I felt clean.I praise God that I could find this online Bible study and work through it.This is a book I can recommend to each person who faces difficulties and unforgiveness. Through the author's honesty, you too will find what you are looking for."
"The author does a very good job at documenting her pain and suffering. Something that we should do and understand. But, she left out one HUGE part of reconciling her own forgiveness. When her husband had violated their marriage vows we must all remember that it takes two to have marriage difficulties. The author never takes responsibility for her failures in the marriage; either she knew about her husband's behavior or she didn't.If she knew then she should have acted sooner and helped in her recovery. If she did not know then she is quite naive and must learn to pay more attention. She played a part in this tragedy.I disagree that forgiving yourself is not in the bible. Repentance is all about forgiving yourself and moving in the right direction and forget what others say or do.Yes, we all have choices, unless addiction or compulsiveness takes over. You need time to grieve and recover. When your addicted or mindlessly compulsive to act, your ability to reason is impaired, the addiction and compulsion makes the decision for you. This is important!The author highlighted a situation where she was involved in a prayer group in the Middle East. The women got to vent but no peace was decided. When your addiction to violence becomes ancient and historical you can rest assured that you will be mashing your teeth for eternity.  UNLESS YOU FORGIVE-YOU WILL NOT BE FORGIVEN!"
"Lysa Terkeurst walked through years of pain and came out on the other side able to offer help to those who need to learn how to forgive and where to start. It's harder than we think. Especially when the pain is deep or it comes from someone very close to us. Forgiveness is not in words, like most of us think. It's hard work. This book is written for those who have been hurt by wrongful firing, the suicide, wrongful death, divorce, breakup, the hateful conversation, the person who should have protected you and they didn't, the day your friend walked away and many more of our life situations.The book, which is bibically based, teaches us that forgiveness does not always go hand in hand with reconciliation: that sometimes reconciliation is not possible. One thing that Lysa offers: ""Unhealed hurt often becomes unleashed hurt spewed out on others"". By moving through the forgiveness process we can heal ourselves and not hurt others.It is beautifully written and offers insightful thought into the process of forgiveness. It specifically spells out one exercise that is very powerful in hope that it will help the reader to forgive and move forward to a beautiful life."
"All Bible/Christian.It‚Äôs frustrating because she never tells you the details or circumstances.  Her husband cheated on her.  Ok.  Who with?  What did he do?  Why?  When?  What for?  Other instances of abortion,  early childhood molestation are similarly unexplained.  Why did you get the abortion?  Incest?  Rape?  Aren‚Äôt these important questions?If you‚Äôre like me who has problems with the forgiveness question,  this will not help you unless you‚Äôre seeking religious guidance.  It‚Äôs all about her; w/o case studies, research . . . .  No psychology or philosophy is mentioned.Reading level: 3d grade."
"I'm coming from a conservative Christian viewpoint of a wife dealing with betrayal & childhood trauma.Let me start out by saying, after reading It's Not Supposed to Be This Way, I did not consider myself a Lysa Terkheurst fan. While that book was good, I found her to be rather whiny through the whole thing. That being said, I am 100% a Lysa Terkheurst fan now!While forgiveness is something I feel I've worked thru these past few months, being able to grieve and fully process information & accept ""reality"" has been a struggle for me. Everyone tells you to grieve but nobody tells you how to do it!  This literally walks you through grieving, processing & coming to a place of acceptance. Furthermore, my husband started reading this to support me, but now he's reading it for his own healing!This book is VERY CHRIST CENTERED. Don't judge it by the first 2 chapters...you have to get to the 3rd chapter to really start getting into the ""process"".  Also, this is saving me SO MUCH in therapy, lol."
"This book has allowed me to step back and identity initial hurts that I have just tucked away, but that have caused damage in my marriage.  Lysa T has provided some great information that has starting a journey of freedom for me.  I thrive to be better not bitter.  I have now recommended this book and the ladies at my church are even starting to order and read.  Thank you for sharing without reservation."
"Wow, this book is amazing, and so true to the core. As someone who has been dealing with extreme betrayal from church people, I found this book to be incredibly helpful. It is hard to let go and let GOD handle it. As a Christian, it has been a very praying journey, with a lot of unnecessary tears, but I‚Äôve come along greatly with the tools in this book. Thanks to Lysa for sharing her story, so that I can move past the bitterness in mine."
The (digital) book is good but kinda stressful trying to figure out the words that have the strange characters. üòï
"I just finished yesterday...and wow. This book is a must read!! Forgiveness is something I‚Äôve always struggled with, and I‚Äôve been in a really bad place lately after being hurt. I knew as a Christian I had to forgive, but I didn‚Äôt know where to start. I read the ‚ÄúForgiving What You Can‚Äôt Forget‚Äù 5 day devotion on The Bible App and each day I was moved to tears. After finishing that I immediately bought the book (so read the free devotion first if you‚Äôre unsure if you should buy it or not)! Lysa was so open and honest about her struggles in her personal life. She never tried to seem perfect, she was real and relatable. I believe she covered all aspects of forgiveness and how we as humans can feel about it/those who hurt us. Everything she said were thoughts I was having. I‚Äôve been so angry, bitter, and hurt, but she gave me such a different perspective about my hurt and the ones who have hurt me. It‚Äôs tough to get through because it‚Äôs heavy, but everyone needs to push through. Even if you don‚Äôt believe what she‚Äôs saying at that time, it will resonate with your heart, and the more you read, the more your perspective will change. Get this book and have an open mind, trust me.However, if you‚Äôre going to get this book, you seriously need to invest in ‚ÄúThe Forgiveness Journal‚Äù as well. I‚Äôm not much of a writer/journaler, but it helped me beyond measures in this scenario. I believe reading this book is not going to be anywhere near as effective unless you‚Äôre willing to take a step back and write out what you‚Äôve learned to process everything. Lysa provides Bible verses and guided questions to help you sort out your thoughts after each chapter. The beauty of this journal is that you get to write what you want, unfiltered, and it will only be yours to see.If you‚Äôve suffered any type of heartbreak, past or present, please get these two books. It‚Äôs worth it, I promise. It‚Äôs not going to change you overnight, but it will change your perspective and help you begin the process of forgiving, which is Lysa‚Äôs goal. Get it, please, trust me."
Lysa is a great author. Her books have helped me through some tough times. This one is no different. It will help you get over some hard issues. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who needs help learning how to forgive. It doesn‚Äôt matter how long ago it was. This book helps!
It wasn‚Äôt helpful
"In her book Forgiving What You Can‚Äôt Forget, Lysa Terkeurst takes her readers on a journey toward discovering how they can let go of the pain of what others have done to them and learn how to forgive. While not diminishing the pain and suffering they have been through, Lysa walks through many facets of forgiveness, bitterness, and the pain caused by conflicts with others. Instead of offering platitudes of instant solutions, she instead offers hope that with time, diligence, and support, you can make peace with the past and live life again. Speaking with honesty and vulnerability from the pain of her husband having an affair, Lysa shares her personal journey of her husband having an affair, sharing it in a way that makes it relatable, regardless of what you may need to forgive. If you have ever struggled with forgiveness, this is a book you need to read."
"I‚Äôm having a hard time getting through this book it talks about the Bible and god a lot and I‚Äôm not saying that I‚Äôm not a believer, but it just doesn‚Äôt work for me. It does have some good advice to go by. But I‚Äôll have to look for something else that works for me..."
"A book for someone who hasn‚Äôt already heard what she said 15,000 times. It‚Äôs basically her saying the same thing a million times and not really saying anything except forgive if you can but if you can‚Äôt it‚Äôs ok except it isn‚Äôt because then your life will suck. This is definitely a book for someone who likes pretty words and sayings and I‚Äôm sure a Christian person who needs to know more about forgiveness would love it too. Just not for me."
"I gave this book to my niece who recently lost her husband suddenly.  She is suffering and grieving so much that it breaks my heart.  This book speaks honestly and lovingly about the journey of grief and suffering and incorporates the kindness and goodness of God in the midst of the journey.  The author acknowledges the many questions that believers have during times of suffering and validates feelings of despair, loneliness, and anger.  I would recommend this book."
"This book was very helpful for me. I now understand that by not forgiving those who hurt me I was actually hurting myself. We may never forget the hurtful things done to us but we must forgive in order to move ahead. It helped for the author to share her story and to make me aware of how God has instructed us in scripture.Although not a must, but I would highly suggest having the study guide to go along with your reading."
"A lot of helpful advice on a difficult subject. I especially appreciated examining the various facets of forgiveness especially that just because you forgive someone doesn't mean you can give them access to your life again. And how forgiving someone who doesn't acknowledge their offense is far more freeing for you than waiting for them to acknowledge what they did was wrong. Rehashing what happened, even just in your thoughts, to reassure yourself they harmed you is opening the wound over and over again. Her Biblical advice on how to heal and move forward to enjoy life again was greatly appreciated. I recommend reading ""It's Not Supposed to Be This Way"" before reading this book."

  ¬†Unless I overlooked all 3 in 1 deal. Kinda disappointed I had to buy individually, costing me about $50.00. I also didn't realize that it's better to have all three items for complete understanding of the book as well. I ordered just the book and my friend accidentally ordered the study guide. When I looked at what she bought, it was clear you need the DVD. Already having the book, I ordered the guide a few days later. While I was waiting for the study guide, I then had to get the DVD. Took at least 2 or 3 weeks to get all three. Can't really read the book without the other 2 items."
"Great Book!!!!My wife bought me this book as birthday gift.  I was pleasantly surprised, in good way.  I looked around, and read some of the reviews.  One person stated, she writes for female readers.  I would to say, she is great writer.  A lot of men could truly learn from her work.  The point I would like to make, the Lady can write.  Her books will stand the test of Time,"
"This is a wonderful book about forgiveness.  Mrs. TerKeurst weaves biblical truth with real realities so seamlessly in this book.  It is often as if we are truly sitting at her gray table and having a conversation because as I was reading my mind was raising questions and soon there would be the answers to my questions.  This is not a preachy book but one that looks at real life and walks you through  the process of forgiving so that you can truly live the life God intended for you to live.  It is not an easy journey and Mrs. TerKeurst doesn't pretend that it is, but it is a possible journey.  Well done, Mrs. TerKeurst!"
"For as young as she is, Terkeurst shares wisdom and guidance like a seasoned veteran. One might think, ‚Äúthis chic has been through a lot!‚Äù In reality, haven‚Äôt we all been through a lot. I think I highlighted nearly the whole book. Some chapters I related to better than others.Bottom line, give it to God. Let him heal, help you forgive, intercede. Forgive and forgive again! Use your faults as testimony to Gods graciousness, don‚Äôt let the devil beat you up by constantly reminding you of your sin. Help is on the way and completely within your grasp. Take hold of it and don‚Äôt look back."
"Forgiving What You Can't Forget is a most wonderful book.  Lysa is very open with her story of person betrayal and hardships. Looking deeper into how God forgives us and in turn we forgive others is a powerful message.  And even more powerful are her messages of struggling through it.  She has helped me to know that it's OK to not be ok. The journey through the struggle is where God is.I've been reading this in a book group that has really been helpful. Everyone has hurt, and sharing the struggle makes it become less of a struggle."
"I honestly felt like I was reading a book about me. We didn't have the exact same experiences, but everyone has had their share of hurt from  childhood and throughout their adult lives.  This book helped me to walk through those hurts in a meaningful and healing way.  I appreciate Lysa so much for her bravery and obedience to write these words.  I will keep revisiting this book over and over to give me the strength to get through beginning another year waiting for my husband to come home..."
"I‚Äôve been through a lot in my past and have been really trying to let go of the negativity so I can find peace. As I was reading this, I felt like she was taking the thoughts right out of my head. It‚Äôs amazing how a book can apply to so many different experiences. While I saw some negative reviews that it isn‚Äôt more God-centered, I personally liked that it was geared towards a wider audience. I‚Äôm not very religious and hesitated purchasing since it‚Äôs listed under Christian books and loved that it stayed pretty neutral. I bought this in the kindle version and wrote down points from the book in a journal, which I‚Äôve never done. Highly recommend!"
I am so thankful my daughter gifted me the journal to this book and I decided I wanted this book to read. I am going to re-read it starting tomorrow and use the journal. I picked it up and could not put it down to start the journal but I am committed to reading snd whole heartedly applying it to my life. I have learned so much about myself and I want to live a life of forgiveness for however long God allows me to be on earth and I promise to share this message with others. This should be a lifelong share thru a book study/bible study. It is powerful and I could relate to so much of it. Thank you Lysa Terkeurst.
"It wasn‚Äôt what I expected and took me a little longer to read. I really feel Lysa‚Äôs book could help someone in the midst of forgiveness battles. I‚Äôve been there, especially with forgiving myself and I can see through her words some of the truths I, myself, learned. I can also see how this book with be helpful in the future, to use as a reference. I love the section at the back where she specifically shows the Scriptures and what God says about forgiveness. Thankful for her open heart to share."
"This book is a great follow-up to her previous book ""It's Not Meant To Be This Way"" or as a stand alone. Lysa presents very practical advise on how to move beyond a troubling situation, especially when the other is not ready for reconciliation. There are practical applications, encouragement for the struggles along the way, and examples drawn from her own experiences. The book is saturated in scripture and research. This is one of those books I will be returning to over and over again, as soon as I get my own copy back. I would honestly recommend that anyone read this book and would like to have a box so I can give them away."
"This book doesn't contain as much scripture as she usually uses in her books but the insight, ability to sit in the readers mind,  ability to touch your heart and take you to a place where healing and forgiveness is doable, possible, and leaving you with much hope and realizing it all goes back to our ability and desire to put God in the place He deserves in our hearts and minds is the key to healing.  His love for us and care for us goes beyond anything we can think or imagine!  REST!"
"Hmmm, I do read the description carefully enough. I wasn't expecting a biblical self-help text."
"I have read nearly every book on the topic of forgiving others, and thoroughly enjoyed Lysa's new book. She is a fabulous writer and has been through a lot of heartache. Even more than she discloses in the book (I've heard her interviewed in a podcast). If you are looking for a ""how to"" book, this probably isn't it. But if you want to find fresh motivation to let go of serious personal offenses, there are plenty of ""gems"" in this book!"
"Lysa has been very open about her struggles and triumphs.  She is painfully honest with the hope that others will related and find skills to cope with the past as well as their present. She is a shining example of how God can us the pain of one to give guidance to others who are having similiar or related challenges.  You are encouraged to use some of the techniques that God gave to her, and know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel."
"If you are a fan of Lisa Geekiest then you already appreciate what she's gone through and how she writes TO you. I promise this book will change your life and your opinion of forgiveness. This book has changed everything. I'm going to forgive absolutely EVERYTHING that has held me back since childhood. I never believed that was possible before, but now, it is and I can't wait to be free of old feelings that have held me back my entire life."
"I did not want to read this book.  The topic itself brought up pain I wanted to forget.  Through the process of reading I realized that forgiving is the only way to bring peace to my heart.  Not only forgiveness of the person that hurt and continues to hurt my girls and I, but forgiveness for me for allowing it to happen.  It‚Äôs not better yet but with God‚Äôs help I pray for grace and guidance as I take steps to reach a place of peace."
"This book has made me rethink forgiveness in a good way. It‚Äôs also reassured me that forgiveness is hard, it‚Äôs a process, it may take a long time depending on what triggers come my way. If you struggle with forgiving someone from the past, someone currently in your life, yourself, while also learning how much God loves you, this book is worth the time. Underlined, journaled, chapters read more than once. The author speaks from real life experience and doesn‚Äôt sugarcoat anything. The best and hardest book I‚Äôve read in a long time."
An amazing book. I‚Äôve bought 3 more to give as gifts because it is that good. Lysa did a great job writing this book and giving us the tools that we need and what exactly it means to forgive.
"Very well written book about really learning from our deepest hurts how to really forgive as followers of Christ. Honest & forthright in identifying the hurts, our human tendencies, our need to gain new perspectives to release those who have hurt us or for us to make amends to those we have hurt. Excellent advice to challenge us to ""let go"" of hurt, in healthy & appropriate ways in all kinds of circumstances."
Way too much of the author lamenting over her own story and not nearly enough information on how to work on forgiveness.
Very thought provoking and soul searching book
"Let me just start by saying that Lysa has not written a book yet that didn‚Äôt speak to me.  This book is no different.  Forgiving can be one of the hardest things, especially when you can forget it. Lysa gives you these tools and scripture to be able to help you move past the hurt in your life and forgive those you didn‚Äôt think you ever could.  I‚Äôll read this book numerous times."
Lysa writes as if she truly is your beat friend helping you through your darkest times.  I can‚Äôt even put into words how this book (and her others) have helped me through the toughest season of my life.  Thank you thank you Lusa for sharing your experience so that your words and Gods love through His word can shine light into the lives of others who have been devastated in their marriage.  It made me feel like someone truly understood what I have gone through.  Thank you.
"When I first picked this book up and read the first three chapters I thought ""I like her style but I don't think this book is for me"" was I ever wrong. I stuck it out for another half of a chapter before I felt as though she had looked directly into my heart. I LOVE her and her perspective. Beautiful woman of God. I love you my sister in Christ and you are blessed. Read this book in it's entirety.. You will be blessed!"
As the title says.
"I picked up this book, with pretty low expectations thinking ‚Äúhere we go, another book on ‚Äòforgiveness‚Äô let‚Äôs see what are the 10 steps I‚Äôm missing; however, I was blown away by the intricate way in which the book was written, the author broke the process to bite sizes, and not only served it, but took the time to explain how she was still walking through the process herself. Highly recommend, even if you feel you have nothing to forgive, trust me, you will walk away from this book with a whole new perspective!"
"Disappointed that the cover is torn, but still excited to read this book."
This book was boring it didn‚Äôt offer anything we haven‚Äôt heard before. I was greatly disappointed
"By definition, a difficult thing to do!  We don‚Äôt need to forgive those who treat us well, but those are the only ones who need forgiveness.I heard someone say, ‚ÄúHolding onto bitterness and refusing to forgive is like drinking poison and hoping the other person will die.‚Äù  It doesn‚Äôt work that way."
"I read this book with  a friend and it opened my eyes to a lot of things I didn't notice were hurting me and how much I've healed/grown from my past hurts. I learned so much and would recommend this book to anyone who is dealing with hurt that they can't get past or any anxiety, fear, anger you can't let go. I love how honest she is and how normal she made me feel. It's a must read that can truly humble you."
"I really loved this book. I had gotten it hoping I could get some tips on forgiving but I got the added bonus of reading the ""other"" side and getting a better understanding of the one I hurt."
"This book was much more than I could ever imagine.  It's been difficult to locate a therapist lately with COVID running rampant, but this book was able to fill in the gap for me.  Even if you think that you don't have a problem with forgiveness (ME), you should get this book AND journal and I promise it will help you heal from things you didn't even realize you were hurt from."
"EXCELLENT book!! If your marriage is in trouble, but you both are committed to moving forward together, READ this book!! It has helped me!! My husband & I almost lost each other after 36 yrs. Thanks to God we are even better than we were when we first married!! This book helps you begin the forgiveness process. It‚Äôs a process!! But it‚Äôs worth walking through!!"
"This book is so bad, I attempted to contact the publisher, without success. It is unprofessional from academic and clinical perspectives. I question how van der Kolk's name can be associated with this publication. Do not buy this ""book""!"
"She never disappoints. Here writing reaches my soul and comforts it. I like many are still healing from things I don‚Äôt talk about. Forgiveness is hard. This book helps. I cried with it, highlighted parts my soul felt. Will read again and again"
"Her writing is so specific, raw, and the heart wrenching truth of why we should forgive. She uses the word to ""process"" forgiveness. What better way than from our father that demonstrated it to us. She shares her story, her honesty in what she went through. I commend her courage. Thank Mrs. Lysa Terkeurst."
"During life‚Äôs ups and downs, forgiveness can be an issue. I loved the author‚Äôs approach to this subject. A lot of aha moments that I need to read again and again."
"It‚Äôs as if the book was written directly to me. Was recommended by my Pastor and Im highly glad she did Struggling with family betrayal & this is just what I needed for the bad moments, which are many. I‚Äôm sure I will read it more than once & want to get the workbook. (Money is tight)"
"As someone who experienced needing to forgive, this book was a great reminder that forgiveness helps the forgiver walk away from bitterness and that forgiveness is a process.  A great read for anyone who has been done wrong by others or who simply wants to live in love and not regret."
"This book is wonderful! Opens up so much and really speaks! Many perspectives, if you‚Äôve been carrying baggage of offense this will help you to see where god stands in relation to you and your offender! Of course ultimately the blood of Jesus saves, and with his power it helps us to forgive, but it‚Äôs also important to understand and know how to work on yourself, forgiveness is an everyday decision! Highly recommend!"
"Wow!!  Painful memories have haunted me for years.  Lysa's book has opened so many wonderful avenues to forgiveness.  We all go through times in our lives when we have been hurt.  The hurt can be from a disagreement with a friend to a husband's betrayal.  This is a book that everyone should read.  She offers such insight to pain and the hard work associated with forgiveness.  She reminds us that forgiveness is not for the other person, it is for you and me."
"I love the writer's honesty and insight.  At one point she said that she wondered if her pain was even survivable and I wept at that point because I wondered the same thing about my situation.  Thank God for people that can find the words to express what some of us just can't seem to do.  You will not be disappointed in this frank, honest and helpful book!"
Great study book. I belong to a small study group and we used this book and Lisa‚Äùs teaching lessons to learn about forgiveness.  The series was great and our group learned a lot about forgiveness both from the Bible and life‚Äôs lessons. Great purchase price and fast shipping!
"I recently led a group study on this book. It was incredibly written, and from a place of sincere understanding of what it means to truly forgive as Christ does. This book was also so helpful to me as i am walking through a very difficult personal journey. The study guide is in depth, thought provoking,  and leads you straight to scripture.  This is a book where almost every line is highlighted,  its that good!"
"I have several friends who just love this book. I loved the intro, but I think I have moved past a lot of forgiveness issues. The writing is good. She‚Äôs a great writer, but the topic can be a bit emotionally congested. This is for someone beginning a forgiveness journey"
"The second page of the introduction had me tearing up. Not out of sadness, but out of relief that someone could put in to words what I have been going through since going through a difficult divorce 3 yrs ago.It feels as though you are sitting with an old friend who is allowing you to feel all the things you've been pushing to the back of your brain. I am finding this book extremely comforting in dealing with my loss and imagine someone with similar experiences would too."
"I thought the best review I could give this book would be from a text I sent to my best friends: Ladies. LADIES. You know how good my forgiveness book is. But the chapter I read this morning??? BLEW. ME. AWAY. It is as if she knows my inner thoughts and all that is keeping me from peace. I cannot highly recommend this book enough. The chapter was on bitterness and I related to it so much. And the title of the next chapter is ‚Äúliving the practice of forgiveness everyday.‚Äù I am SO GRATEFUL for this book. It is helping my hurting and confused heart to find clarity, healing and peace. I am finding a way forward."
"Honestly, I just started reading it and it is a PAGE TURNER!!! A friendship of mine recently ended unexpectedly and I‚Äôve been praying on how to proceed and accept this new reality and this book is straight from God himself. I just know it. Thank you for writing this and being obedient to your call!!! I am truly grateful for the impact this book is having on me."
She did a lot of whining and complaining. I didn‚Äôt get anything from this book. I was expecting more based on the YouTube channel.
"You think no one gets it, know one can possibly understand the depth of total pain you‚Äôre feeling? I felt like  Lysa was in my head and heart. I took so much away from this book. It gives you comfort, insight (even when it‚Äôs not pretty),  and perspective. I think I will refer to my many highlighted sections during the  forgetting process, as Lysa says, it‚Äôs a long journey. Be prepared to understand that you can do nothing without Godüíúüíú"
"OMG!!!!! Okay I‚Äôm not a big reader, if at all. You‚Äôll never catch me sitting outside in the summer reading a book, or any time of year. But this book sounded interesting to me, and I‚Äôm trying to do more self care and part of that is reading. This book put life into perspective and made me thankful for past relationships, even with the circumstances those may have faced. This is a MUST read. It‚Äôs a lot about God, so I‚Äôd you don‚Äôt believe about that, then I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. But for those who believe and want to see a better version of yourself, this is YOUR BOOK!!!!"
I was not familiar with author but title seemed to fit the situation to help a neighbor. Reading intro and a few pages I realize this book can also help me in some of my life struggles at 72 years young. I will try to see if I can find a couple of her previous works. Thanks Lisa
"Lysa is an exceptional writer!  Her honesty, openness and spiritual guidance is evident in each book I‚Äôve read.  I‚Äôve been influenced greatly by this book, and I‚Äôm just so grateful to have found it.  Thank you Lysa!!"
"Lisa does it again...she reminds us that we have to cultivate a relationship with God, and work that relationship as we would a great friend...learning lessons along the way that allow us to change some thinking and look at people through a different lens."
Better in a group or with a counselor. Don‚Äôt attempt to read this on your own without support. It can stir up very strong emotions which are difficult to deal with alone.
I have been using this along with the available workbook.  It has helped me through the betrayal of those who were closest during the loss of my Mom.  Forgiveness is easy forgetting is not.  I have d discovered not forgetting is my shield for not getting hurt again.
"This book has helped me let go of past hurts and anger. The author walks us through her personal experience with forgiveness and shows us that forgiveness is for us to let go of our bitterness and hurts from others. Then we can be free from the destruction that comes when we don't forgive. The more we forgive , even though we remember the hurt lessens."
"This book is full of helpful, biblically-based insight. She‚Äôs been through some really tough things in close relationships and has encouraging and practical advice for working toward forgiveness. I‚Äôve underlined a bunch of her points and I‚Äôll be keeping this book in my collection to reread as a reminder."
Once again a God inspired book written with a practical application. Lysa‚Äôs heartache make the information presented more real to the reader. I know she truly understands what I am feeling and has already applied the principles to her own life.
Hope this will help with my life i have read other books by this author and so I am excited to learn
"I ordered this book at a time when my life was in chaos & I was full of anger, hurt, & everything in between. It gave me the peace to move forward with forgiveness & find myself again. It‚Äôs a must read if you need to move past something hard & life altering. Your future self will thank you."
"This book is very well written, and easy to understand.  The author writes from first-hand experience, and makes this applicable to most every situation where that has been offense, abuse, rejection, bullying, etc, and where forgiveness needs to be extended.  I recommend this book and this author."
"The author talks to you as if you are right there. It doesn't have all the answers but instead gives you a new angle to look at things. It's not your fault, give the pain to God and heal yourself from it. Helps you to pull yourself up and move on."
I want to highlight every sentence of this book - that's how good it is.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND
This book speaks the words of your hurting heart and gently guides you toward the freedom that forgives brings.
I bought and presented the book as a gift. The book title was an easy sell because the act of forgiving is universal and so emotional. The book is a connection to inner person to work on ways to forgive what you can't forget.
"I have learned about forgiveness all my life.. but putting it in action is the hardest thing we are commanded to do.When we hurt or are humiliated,  it sits deep inside waiting for us to explode on the next poke that comes our way.Lysa gives us practical and real examples of what hurts us, why it hurts us and what is the process to recognize, face, and process that hurt... to the process point of Freedom thru forgiveness.Life was never promised to be without struggles,  but we can find freedom from what hurts us deep and not allow  the struggles to continue the hurt."
"Lysa talks about her experience.  Situations might be different for each reader, but the basics of forgiveness can be applied to all. I thought it was a great book. Forgiveness isn't always easy, but it isn't ours to keep."
This book was great. It really opened my eyes to parts of me and my life i hadn't noticed. This book has really helped me understand how i can forgive when it just seems impossible. I have already shared it to my mom. üòÉ
I'm disappointed because I did not expect t to read biblical quoted I agree with thast review as well because I grew up Catholic and  attended cathloic school anyway I disliked her quoting the bible to her beliefs or bible with her belief.it was overall too much religion for me.
Read and expect to be triggered to change not just to be triggered regarding the past. I love the author's transparency and simple presentation of what forgiveness is and what it takes to forgive as a Christian. The reality is something many can relate to but do not talk about. Love her for writing this!
This book is just amazing. You truly connect with the writer as she explains exactly what you are experiencing with unforgiveness. She has great tips and scriptures to help you along. I totally recommend this book!
This book was nothing like I expected it to be. It was autobiographical and I was not looking for that.
"This book is a must read for those who are struggling to forgive someone past or present. You don‚Äôt need to face the person when you forgive, God will be there to do the rest for you. Any religion can‚Äôt benefit from this book."
"It is very Christ-Centered and helps put words and understanding of the pain.  Only read the first two chapters, but it is an excellent read. I also purchased the study guide, which is a great compliment."
Lysa has done it once again...written a book that speaks directly to my heart. I feel as if she is truly speaking directly to me...like we are in a room having an actual conversation. She reaches into the heart and deeply touches your soul. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is walking through the fire and wanting to get through it!
"Through the author's own experience, honesty, maturity in her faith, and gift of teaching, she totally delivers on giving the readers insight and tools on how to be free of the pain of unforgiveness"
"That‚Äôs it and that‚Äôs all. It‚Äôs a great read. I believe there‚Äôs something for everyone to take away. Also, if you are currently going through a difficult time with forgiveness, I highly recommend this book for understanding, direction, and comfort."
"The Women's Book Club at my church is reading this together, month by month. It's not always easy but very good. We all have issues and the lessons are gentle. We are really enjoying the process."
"There is so much division, even within our own families. And Lisa's experiences have qualified her to understand what it feels like when you are devastated by a family issue. I am still reading it, but will go back and underline and write things down. It is so helpful."
This book is amazing. Absolutely brilliant. I have read probably a hundred books about similar topics. This one is the best. It can actually change your life. With a little help of yours:) Truly highly recommended!
"Probably helpful for the wife struggling with marital unfaithfulness. Not the issue I struggle to forgive,so I‚Äôm having trouble applying the principles. Wish the description had been more precise"
"God is surely speaking on a way or another, and for me He was speaking through this Book. I greatly recommend it for every Christian. Lysa was sharing her experiences with her own struggle and it make the Book more Real like a sincere talk with a Friend . Forgiveness is a hard topic and yes this book doesn't cover everything because as she said this is a process, but she cover what need to be Said for us to go deeper and gives so much encouragement to begin . Love it !"
"This book changed everything for me. It walked me through gaining closure, and assisted me in moving forward, after a very hurtful time in my life. Like every book, the book itself cannot fix your life, your willingness and intention to apply it does. But without this book I would still be in a very dark and angry place. Excellent read, and Amazon did a great job delivering it. Did I mention that it‚Äôs got a beautiful cover? I‚Äôd recommend buying this in a heartbeat."
"I was contacted by the author to buy this for $4.99, then I had a $1 coupon in Kindle.  I am on Chapter 5 and learning a lot.  I use my pads highlight feature to capture meaningful sentences."
This book helped me a lot with forgiving those that have wronged me I also bought the audio book. It has been a great resource as I mourn the loss of my son due to a intoxicated motorist.
This book is simply outstanding. I read it after reading her book that came before this one.  There are so many helpful insights and nuggets of wisdom in this book.  Profoundly helpful.
It was filled with religious faith based answers that were preachy at best silly and simplistic at worst.
Down-to-earth resource for how to think about how you have suffered some setbacks/disappointments in life and how to handle them in a positive manner to come out a more content person.
"Lysa TerKuerst never fails to deliver!  She is very ‚Äúreal‚Äù with her writings and speaks to those hard things in life that we all experience.  She has a way of relating that makes you feel like she‚Äôs sitting right with you.  Wise, amazing woman!"
"What a GREAT BOOK so far. Lisa B has hit it out the park again!So many ah ha moments, and feeling better I‚Äôm not the only one who has felt that ‚Äúway‚ÄùVery inspiring."
"Gives a new perspective on the topic of forgiveness, and a few new thoughts to consider as you move forward in this christian life"
It‚Äôs a book what more is there
"If you‚Äôve been hurt by someone in your life and you‚Äôre having a hard time forgiving them or having ill feelings towards them then, this is the book for you! It definitely was for me!"
This is such a fantastic book. Once I started reading I couldn‚Äôt put it down. A well written book to help deal forgiveness and how to realistically corporate into your life.
I love how relatable & raw Lysa presents herself & the ideas she shares. God has used her mightily in sharing the challenges & hopes that come with forgiving from devastating loss.
Book was well written and had good information. I read read several parts and took notes. I would recommend this to anyone who has been through a painful divorce.
Excellent book to help process the lingering hurt from broken trust in relationships. Lysa Terkeurst has incredible insight and godly wisdom as well as person experience to share. This book is authentic and practical.
I think the headline says it all. This book is amazing. I've read several of Lysa Terkheurst's book and they have all been incredible. I've read alot of books about this topic and this is just so good.
Fantastic book and needed so much in our world!! We need people writing down their own stories and publishing them so others can read and grow from them. This book is so important and shines so much light on the complicated word of forgiveness. We needed this clarity and insight.
It helps you to understand that forgiveness is for your own healing and dose not mean you have to continue to allow the other person to be in your life.
"I am happy with the book but the jacket cover was sticky, had pieces of sucker on it along with hair. I‚Äôm not happy that the jacket was was ruined."
Absolutely love this book! I recommend to anyone who wonders if they really have forgiven. You don‚Äôt get to choose what you forget but this book can help the process of truly forgiving.
Lysa opens up in a very raw way about her own journey with forgiveness and gently invites the reader to join her. Beautifully insightful. Encouraging. Practical.
"This is amazing book & the journal I wrote about before is wonderful to read with this book or just alone. But this book is amazing! If you need to forgiveness you need to read this book. If you are struggling with forgiveness with family or life in general, read this book!! It‚Äôs helped me more than I could ever imagine!!"
I‚Äôm reading this now and it‚Äôs a very inspirational message and definitely gets you to thinking about forgiveness and moving forward with your best life.
Seems to be for show and not authentic or genuine about helping others. Just talks about herself
Some helpful information
Love love this book! My first time reading Lysa‚Äôs work and I love how personal it seems. I feel like I‚Äôm just sitting next to a friend and chatting. If you have experienced hurt or love someone who has this can give you amazing perspective and advice. Would highly recommend!
"Like the kindle, bought a book and it‚Äôs hard to read, every word that has an apostrophe has some wired character that is unreadable, had to guess ."
Whole book was on author personal divorce  experience. Not what I was looking for
I really didn‚Äôt like this book. The author was too wordy and spent too much time talking about her issues. I only bought this for a Bible study
I enjoyed the book. No a-ha moments but helpful. Spiritual. Only negative is the the print is very light making it hard to read.
Too focused on religion
I have read so many different things that tell me to forgive but this book gives practical tangible advice on how to actually do it. I LOVE this book and will probably read it again!
This product was used in a Women‚Äôs Group Bible Study. It‚Äôs a GREAT subject to deal with and the writer‚Äôs points were on target. Thanks Amazon for providing it for us.
Such a great book. literally taking this book chapter by chapter. It's very deep and heavy. But just what my soul needs.
If you are trying to understand what forgiveness truly is and how to get there ; this is your book. Extremely well written
"This book is so, so, so good! I would highly recommend it. The process of forgiveness is hard, but so worth the effort."
If you're hurting from lain pick this book up and don't put it down until you've finished it in its entirety!
Very thoughtful. Had the moment of realization of how I over spiritualize certain things. Good book about forgiveness.
"I find this book full of ways to heal from many life experiences and hurts.  Whether they happened yesterday or 40 years ago, you can change how to react to them, how they affect you and how you move forward in life with this book.  Highly recommend it!"
This book is amazing for everyone! We‚Äôve all been hurt and it truly provides all kinds of deep feelings and helpful ways to get through it. The study guide pushes you through places you had no idea were even possible!!
Very beneficial for personal benefit in working through your own agenda for forgiving others as well as yourself!
"breaks your heart in the best ways. for those without hope, all may enter here. Healing and joy is found in these pages."
Amazing Amazing Book of Healing that will truly help you cope with hurts and unforgiveness that you may not know how to get o on your own. Ive never read authors books who clearly described my own emotions. Crazy crazy Good
"I'm an older guy, I think this would be excellent for a younger female, but still worthwhile for me."
"I'm only half way thru the book, but she has validated everything I've struggled with in the area of forgiveness for a Christian."
"This book is exactly what you need if you‚Äôre looking for relatable content and reliable help as you walk through the process of forgiving deep hurts. Lysa is a real human and writes with deep conviction and minimal fluff. The balance of seriousness and humor will carry you through to the end with hope that with Jesus, nothing can ruin your life forever. Nothing!"
Great book. I read it all and we will be doing a 6 week class in church . Looking forward to it.
This is a book that I will re-read every year there‚Äôs so much good stuff in it.  Relationships are hard and forgiveness is hard so I know I will need it every year.
Very good book! It help me with my own personal life. I recommend anyone who seek forgiveness and healing.
"Got this book and study guide for my small group. It‚Äôs amazing, should be required reading!"
"This book did not disappoint. Lysa did a beautiful job of being transparent in her teachings. I was looking for some methodology of  how to move forward, so my expectations were slightly mis-aligned with the purpose of this book. It was  a great read filled with the word of God. Inspiring.  I plan to look at the devotional offered alongside the reading."
Lysa Terkeurst never disappoints!! I have read pretty much all of her books and anxiously awaited the release of this one as well. It is awesome. I got a copy for me and a copy for a friend who recently went through a bad divorce and this book came at the perfect time for her. The book came in the mail without damage.
Only 5% into this book and there are so many errors. Some make it hard to read
"If you are in this circumstance and need an outside voice, this is the book for you."
"This book is so compelling, just like all of Lysa's books!! Once you start reading , you can't stop. It's as if she is including part of your story into her book. It's raw, vulnerable, honest, heart breaking, encouraging, and so helpful. I cried, prayed, sympathized, understood, and gained precious knowledge from this book. Thank you for sharing Lysa! With much gratitude , Ren√©e"
"Love the insights this book has to offer , will be purchasing for family and friends"
So needed in my life. I‚Äôve suffered a lifetime of abandonment and Lysa‚Äôs words are often a balm to my spirit. One of the few Christian authors who I can read because she doesn‚Äôt speak ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù theology but words of truth from experience.
well within the estimated time of arrival and in pristine shape. Thanks so much!
This helped me with a lot of unresolved issues from my childhood and aduthood . Great read .
I could have saved thousands of dollars in counseling if I had this book.  I love Lysa!  Thank you friend for sharing your story with us.
"Did a woman‚Äôs book study. We also had the workbook. I feel like everyone learned some helpful ways to deal with forgiveness. It‚Äôs a powerful rewarding feeling, forgiving others and being happy with life. Highly recommend for a group study"
Doing this bible study with some ladies at my baptist church and we love it!
Such a good book to read. Great information on how to set goals and bring down walls.
Read this book with a Women's Bible Study group and then discussed.  It is painful work but it's very rewarding!!
This is a safe and gentle approach to healing and forgiveness. This book helps normalize intense feelings and reactions while working through them instead of trying to suppress them. Loved it and will likely read again!
Very good book. I really needed to read this. It made me look at forgiveness in a whole new light.
Already on chapter 3! It's a good book. Understanding and thoughtful.
Lysa does it again! She cleared up misconceptions I had around forgiveness and helped me to understand what forgiveness really entails.  I know I will be referencing this book throughout my life. So grateful for this blessing!!
This book is great for helping with matters of forgiveness. Lots of wisdom‚Ä¶ Biblical wisdom.
"This book was therapy and it aided me in my attempt to be a better person. It acknowledges that I am human, but still makes me accountable."
Loaned to some of my patients and they benefitted from reading it.
Many pages were omitted or repeated in this book. Page174 was followed by pages 47-78 then resumed at page 207. Very disappointing. Be wary of purchasing from this publisher.
"This book was so engaging and easy to follow. I laughed at her stories, cried through some of the hard moments, but it was so wonderful! It was my first book by this author and I have already purchased more."
Just went through this with my Bible Study group because they chose it.  Didn‚Äôt think it really related to me but I got SO much out of it!  What Lysa has gone through and has been able to learn and make teachable is wonderful!!  Read it now!!!!
Church conducted on line class. Emotional roller coaster!!!!!! Prepare yourself for the ride.
If you are struggling with deep wounds this is a great read! Practical views from a women who struggled with deep hurt and found way to forgive and overcome in spite of it all. She makes it easy to follow and challenges you without judgement.
Both my book and study guide are in great condition! I can't wait to dive into them both!
Life is hard- great resource to help process big stuff!
Great resource to guide you through your pain and provide insights about forgiveness that you‚Äôve never been exposed to before.  The accompanying journal is the perfect compliment along with her videos.
This book has helped me with the process of forgiveness in my life. Lysa makes scripture come alive through her own experiences with heartbreak and healing.This book is therapy!
Great read. I needed this more than I thought I did. Lots of highlighting and note taking! Really thoughtful read.
"Listened to this on Audible and loved it. While listening, I hopped on and ordered the actual book."
"This has been the most helpful resource I‚Äôve found on this very painful road of forgiveness. During a time where it‚Äôs hard to hear anything above the screaming pain, it has been invaluable to have some exercises & steps to take toward forgiveness."
One of the best books I have ever read. Anyone and everyone can relate.
This book is good and is getting through a tough time
This is such a good book! Very needed in today's society
This is a very helpful book. I got the journal with it and I HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND that if you purchase this book- do yourself a favor and grab the journal as well.
Fantastic book but hard to work through forgiveness!
One of the best books I have ever read. It is truly inspiring and therapeutic for anyone who needs to work on forgiveness.
I thought it was a good read with helpful insights
Everyone needs forgiveness... blessed to be able to read this book.
"I‚Äôm going through a lot in marriage. This book has helped me through the times of emotional rollercoaster. In God‚Äôs unfailing love, grace, and mercy he has shown me that I get go through this and He is still by my side. I pray that my marriage holds true even through, this what it seems an endless storm. Thank you so much"
Personal heart and soul instruction book that fits the bill for finding and fulfilling forgiveness.  Great book.
"A great learning tool. Forgiveness is a process, and this book is one way to learn how to forgive. Lysa TerKeurst is not preachy and does not point fingers.  She guides the reader through her own processes and experiences."
Good read.  plain talk about forgiveness.
slow so far.  Cant get past page 20 or so.
"the print on this book not very dark, print is very lite"
We used this as a Bible study for a large group
Very helpful for those coping in any way.
The best book I have read in yearsüòâ
Very helpful.  Makes perfect sense
found comfort in this book... a must read as you are growing as a person.
Excited to read but discouraged the cover was damaged.
I love this so much! Everyone should read this!
Purchased a second time for my youngest daughter.  She loves self help books and her Big Sister loves the material in her book.
"Lysa is down to earth and real, she gets deep, she is relatable and totally human! She doesn‚Äôt mind sharing the hard stuff and showing you can love God too! This book is a great way to process emotions that deal with the need to forgive and practical ways for doing so!"
Lysa Terkeurst does a great job of sharing her story with Truth of Scripture. This book is loaded with truths that can help anyone that needs to forgive or is grieving loss.
Such a great book. Came fast.
Lysa truly has a writer‚Äôs heart. Love it!
Lysa frames forgiveness in a way that makes understanding and application come much easier without diminishing its importance. This book and study have been very impactful to me and have helped free me from the anchor of hurt and anger that I had been holding onto and did not know how to let go.
"First time reader of the Lysa and loving her book, using it with a Women's Bible Study Group and loving it."
Very helpful to get over past hurts great book
"Great book, a very good read"
"Great book, great study!"
This book really helped me work through so past hurts
We have all been hurt in the past. This book helps you realize that it‚Äôs not your fault.
$15 and was the best therapy I‚Äôve ever gotten. So many times I said ‚Äúoh my gosh!!!! I get it now!‚Äù Love Lysa. She is an amazing writer and I will read whatever she writes.
Received as an
Excellent read

If you‚Äôre working on yourself‚Ä¶.This is a great book a must read to heal YOU!!!
"We used this book for our women‚Äôs Bible study group. Along with the study guide, it helped the women talk about things they couldn‚Äôt forget and was very therapeutic. It‚Äôs real life thoughts about real life situations that we all can relate to."
excellent
Life changer.
Great book.
Perfect
Amazing read. Very helpful for anyone in toxic relationships
Love Lysa & this is another good book she wrote. I also did the Bible Study. Lysa is very real & shares a really rough time in her life.
this book is helping me heal. i have never connected with a book as much as this one. i have underlined so many sentences that have strong impact and say exactly what i am feeling. life changing.
It was ok
Ok
"This book, read along with video, for each section is an excellent tool to help you to understand how to forgive. Where it‚Äôs hard teaching but being free is wonderful."
The book was delivered quickly but was not handed to a resident as stated.  So far it is a good book. She is a very good writer and has a way of making you feel she is talking directly to you.
Great info
About to start this bible study. The book is a topic I am struggling with. I pray it will help.
The best heart felt book out there..::must read!
Gift of encouragement!
Gifted this and it was perfect!
This book was very helpful in moving towards forgiveness from a biblical stand.  Lysa is very transparent in sharing her personal journey and pain.  The book also helps draw healthy Loving boundaries for those of us who didn‚Äôt grow up knowing how to do that.
"I love this author. She‚Äôs down to Earth and can relate. Reading this book....I‚Äôm learning what forgiveness is and isn‚Äôt, and HOW to forgive. I highly recommend this book"
"Brought me to tears many times. Anyone struggling with forgiveness and bitterness, this is the best book you could pick up other than the Bible."
One of my favorites so far. I highly recommend this book to almost everyone. I‚Äôm already reading it again for a second time. I‚Äôve even sent as gifts to people who are going through some tuff life situations.
"Currently struggling with forgiveness so this book was right on time and quite helpful. I really like that there are practical methods offered for achieving forgiveness, on addition to supporting scripture."
I returned this product with 4 study guides and I was charged for the book that was returned....... ??????????
Good book
"This book is so powerful  and unties so many strongholds. Ive have to read it in doses to allow the words to sink in, and have the Holy Spirit help me process the information. A must read if you are ready to start the journey of forgiveness and true healing. I pray you order it."
Just what I wanted
Excellent book.
"Lisa is amazing!!! What a fabulous book, 11/10 recommend."
I like how the author makes a connection with the reader.
Excellent read!
It is very well written. I love her books! She is real and true and honest about life.
"Loved this book. The first book I read by Lysa Terkeurst was When Women Walk With Faith. I absolutely loved that book, so I had to read another book of hers. It did not disappoint. Just ordered 2 more books by her."
To forgive someone
very helpful book
I'm really enjoying this probably the best one!!
"One of the best books I have read and I'm just over 1/2 way through the book!  I have already recommended it to several Christian and non Christian friends and family.  I'm not huge into book studies, but this one is great for a small group!"
"i am still reading this book, taking my time and rereading as i go...much wisdom contained in it's pages...thoughts that often run contrary to what we normally hear.  VERY thankful for lysa's honesty and God-given voice."
If you are walking the road of divorce and betrayal then this is a must read.
highly recommend
Great book on forgiveness. This has a lean towards women but all men should read! Great biblical perspectives on grace and forgiveness!
"Love this book By Lysa Terkherst! As expected, No disappointment!"
Beautiful book. I truly enjoyed it.
"Very good book.  Insightful,comforting, and helpful."
Wonderfully written
Would recommend this book
Things that I had been holding on for 40 years seem to just disappear.Now I can move on.
So far love this
This is a must read for someone struggling with forgiveness.
"I was not even 5 pages into this book before i started crying because I felt like someone understood me. I haven‚Äôt even finished it yet, but it has already made such a positive impact on my life!  Get it and read it and you‚Äôll see!"
"I enjoyed this book, because the author really open up and shared her process of forgiveness. It was an eye opener, to help me understand where I am. I realize that God is with me, as I go through any hurts, as well as healing me."
Received on time and exactly as ordered.
Amazong
"Such good information! I needed to.forgive family members, and this book helped begin the process!  Can't wait to.read more of her books!"
I never right reviews. But this book... No words. I bought this book for about 3 people. She is real but gracious. Love it.
The book was written from a ‚Äúgut honest‚Äù approach to the feelings of being hurt and betrayed makes you feel. It doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúsugar coat‚Äù the deep feelings but gives help in dealing with them and healing from hurtful things.
"SO, SO, SO good!!!!"
This book is great.  I have to read and then go back and read again.  Love the Book.
She is so transparent and takes you to another level of understanding Gods word.
I absolutely recommend it! Provides amazing perspectives and truly changes the way you look at things. The title says it all.
Life changing and altering. She literally said everything that‚Äôs been on my heart for years. I am no longer hurting in silence and alone.
This is by far one of the best books I have ever read in my life!
Excellent book very meaningful information. A great blessing. Lysa is a gifted writer
Excellent presentation of a difficult topic presented with deep  insights and humor.
Love the book great read!
"This was probably the best book I've read in years! It helped me open my eyes, not to what I thought others needed to fix/do for me to heal, but what I needed to fix, and how I could start to heal myself."
I really like this book but I can see it‚Äôs not for some and it drags in some parts.
Lysa will forever be an inspiration to me.  Highly recommend this book.
Practical advise on forgiveness.
You need this book. It is life changing.
"Great Item, Great condition, Super fast shipping!"
Needed for church
I gave this to a friend navigating divorce. This book blessed her so she recommended  it to her pastor friend who immediately started a reading group at her church.
"I can‚Äôt explain how helpful this book has been for me.  This book is about so much more than forgiveness. I‚Äôm recommending this to everyone, male and female. 10/10 recommend!!"
100% recommend this book! Definitely am looking forward to reading other books written by her
A great book for anyone who can not forgive someone who has hurt you.
Something really gross was on the cover of the book. Shocked they would even send something like this to a customer
It‚Äôs worth reading for. I learned a lot from this book.
Just the first pages i read was good i have to keep on reading it
Reading this book helped me to heal from a deep seated emotional pain .I would recommend this book / author to anyone who might be in that place too.
This book honestly is a seller! Love it!
Very insightful with helpful scriptural references
Definitely a good Christian-based read.
Lysa knocks it out of the park once again! I felt like it was a love letter God asked her to write for me.
This book is life changing!!! I highly recommend this book to anyone who is struggling with unforgiveness. I truly thank God for the writer and her transparency.
I‚Äôm only 50 pages in and it‚Äôs already so good. Not a super fun read but a necessary read. It connects the dots of how forgiveness is a work we can do with ourselves and Jesus.
She takes you through steps on how to forgive and not let bitterness control your life and trusting God.
Loved this book! Helped me with my relationship issues.
Love this book and study
Wonderful book on forgiveness.  Really helps you to gain a new perspective on your pain and how to get past it and move on with your life again.
The book has been very inspiring to read with lots of insight and detail.  I will probably read it again because there is so much information.
Easy read
"I love this book! Thank you so much for telling your story. You have conveyed every emotion, thought, hurt and pain I was feeling.  I pray to one day to meet you...."
Still reading but it is definitely helping me work through some painful issues.
Great story
ONE OF MY FAVORITE AUTHORS. GREAT VALUE ON THE ITEM.
Helping me to understand that forgiveness if so different from forgetting.
Loved it! You can relate it to whatever you are going thru.
"I love her honesty, vulnerability, and way to deal with forgiveness with God's word. I love you for writing this! You are a beautiful soul!"
We used it as a Women‚Äôs Bible StudyExcellent choice.
"I learned so much about myself, way of thinking and why."
Must read for anyone!
Scriptural truths and practical application join together to make this a powerful tool God can use to walk us through our path to healing from the hurt and pain of past and present circumstances.
"Talks a lot of God and Jesus, didn't know it was religious like that."
great study book
Bought as a gift for my mother and she loves it!
"Amazing book, I can‚Äôt put it down! Definitely worth the read if you feel like giving up in life or have dealt with people who have wronged you"
Horrible! This is the worst piece of garbage. What a waste of money. I want a refund.
After a broken engagement led to feeling rejected this book helped me overcome bitterness and enter into a place of humility and forgiveness.
I think it was divine intervention that this book landed in my lap. I‚Äôm calmer now.  Well worth reading!
I enjoyed reading the book and it helped me to forgive the ppl that hurt me.
This book really helped me get my spiritual walk with Jesus Christ back on track. Have shared this book with others.
Definitely a book that you need to read if you needing healing from forgiving someone that in reality you wished you could forget.

  ¬†the book could have came better shipped, but it‚Äôs okay!!"
I‚Äôve been a therapist for 25 years. Forgiveness is like grieving. You have to re-do it every morning.
Lysa never disappoints.
Amazing book with great insight.  So helpful!
Great book!! Have tissues ready!
Absolutely the best book I‚Äôve ever read!!!
"Well written, honest, touching!"

I love Lysa and she puts it simply how we must forgive!!! Definitely recommend this book.
Excellent
Excellent read. Highly recommend.
"Real help, step by biblical step for the hurting heart from Lysa's own experience.  Highly recommend!"
I loved the book it was so great we read it in a book club.
This study was one by f the most needed studies in my life.
This is so good!  It touches my hurting heart and is helping my healing!
Really helps me on my journey!
The book was just not exciting! It didn‚Äôt grab my attention. Was a bit disappointed.
Just started reading this book and it is wonderful and very helpful. I would highly recommend it
"Great intentions behind the book, but it is struggles to keep the reader engaged."
One awesome book and was relieved quick.
Haven‚Äôt read it yet but very excited to get started
"Amazing book that will help people needing help to heal deep, hurtful wounds."
I am so grateful Lysa wrote this book and shared her heart.  It has helped me tremendously.
Personal Encouragement

Amazing!
Great book!
Absolutely love this book!
Amazing! So pure & so raw.
"Damaged, torn hardcover"
Amazing!!!
thank you
"I got this book from the county library after reading rave reviews. The book misses an important point.Men and women cope with Grievances, stress, pain in a much different fashion.  The person is not a doctor or psychiatrist but an excellent writer. This is a self-help book and just like any other self-help book, this also has nice sentences, motivational paragraphs, etc.This could be a game-changer book for women (I do not know). But if you are a man, you are better off flipping channels on a TV or go for a walk in silence."
"I'm so excited to get this book. It seems I have a tendency to hold on to things that need to be let go of and I can already tell from the first few pages that this book will help me on my journey. Get it, read it and pass it on. It's not for any one type of situation. It's for any and all things we find hard to forgive, both big and small.'"
"I received the book as a gift.  Read it in February while following along the 6-week Proverbs 31 Ministry‚Äôs Online Bible Study based on this book.I can empathize how tragic and painful it would be for a public figure in an international Christian ministry to discover her husband‚Äôs marital infidelity.  Severe trials reveal the true character of a person.  How Lysa TerKeurst handled her husband‚Äôs betrayal is shocking and even more tragic. Her four 'hellish"" years were due to her vindictive spirit and hanging on to an erroneous view of God based on her feelings/personal past experience rather than based on basic biblical truth.God in his mercy ultimately redeemed her marriage.  At the end of the ordeal, she is humbled but not humble enough to publicly apologize to those who supported her ministry or publicly confess her sin against God.  She betrayed God and her ‚Äúfollowers‚Äù for not living the biblical truth she taught for years. Her own organization‚Äôs motto has been ‚ÄúKnow the truth. Live the truth.  It changes everything.‚ÄùThe author white-washed her faith meltdown during her four 'hellish"" years.  She attributed it to being ‚Äúwork in progress‚Äù. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm both satisfied by my progress and scared by it.‚Äù (page 206)  ‚ÄúThe sign of progress is to let the pain work for you instead of against you.‚Äù  (page 207)If we want to learn how to truly forgive, it would be better to read a book written by professional counselors, like the book ""Forgiving What You‚Äôll Never Forget"" written by the late Dr. Dave Stoop (published in 2017).Lysa TerKeurst lost my respect as a Bible teacher.  I would not read another book by her.  I am unsubscribing myself from Proverbs 31 Ministry‚Äôs mailing list."
"This book is mostly a memoir of the author working through the end of her marriage after her husband cheated on her. It doesn‚Äôt seem to touch on any other subject than her divorce, which is hard to relate to when the trauma you‚Äôre working through isn‚Äôt coming from a broken relationship. Like most religious self-help books, it‚Äôs very wishy washy and comes from a place of extreme privilege when she talks about going to Jerusalem 8 times before having a revelation, and going to group therapy while basically putting her entire life on pause. If you come from a place of great privilege where the worst thing you will experience is a cheating spouse, this book is just the thing for you; for the rest of us who have experienced unspeakable horrors in our lives, keep looking. This isn‚Äôt the book for you"
"The simple fact that many of the negative reviews by people who call themselves agnostic as it being ""too much about God"", confirms exactly what I felt about this book as I read it: encouraging people to forgive through the lens of pitty-pat, watered down, evangelical embracement of humanistic therapy methods regarding forgiveness. I personally felt that this book was a way the author dealt with her own therapy as she grappled with how to reconcile with her husband, and we paid for her intensive therapy by buying the book. So for the agnostic or non-believing reader, it felt shallow because Lysa Teurkerst is NOT a licensed psychiatrist, I am not even certain she is a qualified theologian for this book to be considered anything but a personal memoir and testimony that might encourage another person who is or has endured similar experiences. The fact that a non-believer doesn't walk away wanting to know this God who offers eternal forgiveness to all tells me Jesus is NOT the center of the form of forgiveness spoken most prevalently of in this book.  In Christian forgiveness, we are NOT the center. Jesus is the Center. God extends forgiveness to us to reconcile us to Himself and nothing else. He doesn't offer it to us so we can live lives feeling good about ourselves - can that be a symptom of a relationship with Jesus, you bet, but people still deal with hurting, and bitterness, and frustration,  and personal issues, and blaming others for their personal issues, all the while being reconciled to Jesus. Some have already mentioned inaccuracies in scripture so I will not belabor those points. Either way,  I'm glad Lysa found a sense of peace in her journey, and I hope others do too, but as a leader of a major ministry, I would like to see her focus WAY more on Jesus."
While this author professes to be a Christian... she misses the mark in this book.There can be no forgiveness without a focus on Christ himself and this book doesn't focus on HIM. Her focus was more of explaining her past hurts thru faith but she never really delves into her faith.I forgave him because of my faith.... ueah... that isn't gonna help other people unless you delve into that faith... THIS is where she fails... she doesn't dive into that and explain
"I listened to half a minute of the ""preview"" of junk. Oh my God,  she was upset about her marriage breaking up. How about a alcoholic mother, I was either depressed or manic ~ thought it would go away as I aged ~ you die with it; I had Breast Cancer a radical mastectomy, ""oh so, you decided to take it all?"" No chemo with no visits with an oncologist. I remember everything. The cancer came back 10/11 years later ~ Stage 4 Breast Cancer that had metastasized to my Bones. The more painful of any cancer are your Bones. Good oncologist now, hell no! And then a brief call with a sister who has created her life of messes, told me our Dad is in the hospital too far away to drive. So NO this author does not know anything about pain, crying. I have no support system. Her books ~ do not waste your time or your money.  It's junk therapy"
"Whether or not you're religious, you may apply or gloss over sections that don't resonate with you.  If you enjoy self-improvement books, this will leave lasting memories in your heart and mind and shine like a diamond in your library.  If you desire a heavy impact on your inability to forgive, the pages contained within may serve as tools in your arsenal of thought-provoking, necessary changes you can make to bring yourself inner peace.This is no ordinary read.  Prepare for emotional responses to Lysa's ability to connect the dots of the effects of being unforgiving that often lead to insomnia, depression, eating disorders, even suicide.  This is a gifted author/communicator who has the talent to describe scenarios that many of us have experienced and felt trapped by.  Using any of her suggested remedies to forgive and move forward can be invigorating, liberating, and aid you in becoming more self-aware of your perceptions so they can be redirected to avoid humiliation - provide a safe haven for your heart.You'll stop feeling crazy or alone in your bouts of guardedness, defeat, anger, fear, frustration and confusion.  ""Everyone says forgiveness is a lovely idea, until they have something they need to forgive.""  Her suggestions and alternate routes that lead to forgiveness are practical, logical and include coping with unresolved pain and triggers.There have been times I thought forgiveness wasn't possible.  The process is a journey and you need not struggle or suffer any longer than you have already in order to begin healing, as healing is a choice.  Own it, be accountable.  Fault and blame don't have to be paralyzing.  Things that happen to us don't just tell a story, they inform us of the story we tell ourselves!  It's not about getting everything right, it's more about getting it all out.  The resentment, the bitterness, the feelings of wanting to retaliate....  It's necessary and can be messy but invaluable; forgiving the IMPACT that has destroyed and exhausted us. Forgiving betrayals we've encountered may lead to an unpaved road of eventual freedom.  Forgiveness doesn't mean that trust is immediately (or ever) restored.  Whether your childhood was brutal, you've suffered infidelity, there's been loss of life that you're mourning, grief finds us all.  If we can't escape something, why wrestle with it our whole lives when there's comfort ahead?Your choices, whether they're devastating emotions, mental angst, financial ruin, physical impairment have not brought you to a powerless place.  While forgiveness can be complicated, the choice and process should be on your radar.  Take a stand against the madness of being unforgiving!  This book is timely, given the division and pain that exists in our world and is timeless in that it can help you sort out what's true from all that's deceiving.I urge you to stop making your counselors and clergy work harder on resolving your issues than you.  This book outlines ways to remain loving and vulnerable while setting boundaries that must not be overstepped without consequences.  Be your own hero by ending your pain & dysfunction by sharing the wisdom this book can provide you by validating what needs to be forgiven, not necessarily whom.I've found beauty in forgiving and my investment in buying and reading this book to be an answered prayer.If you like my review, please mark it ""helpful."" Should you have any questions about the book, feel free to ask me."
"I preordered Forgiving What You Can‚Äôt Forget, received it 5 days ago, and finished today. As a Christian, as a Counselor, and as a plain old friend I‚Äôve often told people that the world would be a better place if everyone would read Boundaries by Cloud and Townsend. Let‚Äôs add this one to the list. Yes. It‚Äôs that good. The world would be a better place. We all need more Jesus. Read. The. Book.  ~Ree"
"I hope this does not get lost in the tons of 5 star ratings but encourages those who are pessimistic either about what this book is, quotes, or if it can make a difference.  I have hosted multiple Widow and Divorce weekend workshops through Beginning Experience and have seen the pain so many people go through.  This book was an interesting perspective that I incorporated the following with:1) We don't grieve the past as much as we do what the future was supposed to have in store.2) The past good memories appear poisoned by the bad when in reality they were some of the best memories we cherish and simply remind us of the quantity of current pain we feel.3) Regrets are wishes, nothing more.4) The future has not been realized yet and remains ours to embrace and activate.5) You have to grieve; live out all 5 stages.6) The 5 stages can happen in any order.7) Forgiveness may be a daily activity and may need you to do it over and over again as feelings require.8) You cannot control your feelings.9) God is great.  Pray out loud.  Cry it out.10) Finally, be thankful.  Say thanks. Act out your thanks by volunteering to let the spirit live in action.I really recommend this book.  It was well written and while others may be tripped up by the author's interpretation of either gospel, her thoughts, her life experience, or any deviation from your own thought...this book works."
"If you are not religious or openly use Jesus for everything, this book is not for you or me. Jesus and Bible verses brought up too many times throughout the book. It is one thing to guide readers how to heal and another to use religion as healing. Everyone heals differently. Not all healing consists of a Bible or ‚ÄúJesus.‚ÄùThe book was a good read, but kept skipping through pages and paragraphs when the author started with ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù or reading from the Bible.I understand the author is a Christian and most likely the book will do well with other Christians. However, if you want for everyone to read your books avoid being selective on a particular group or trying to influence religion onto others."
"I can't think of anything I did not like about this! Just like always, Lysa seems to be a friend across the kitchen table, and she speaks things that just resonate with my heart.‚ÄúI'm not asking you to sign up for forgiveness. Not yet. I couldn't start there, so I won't ask you to either. All I'm asking is that you'd be willing to consider taking power away from the person who hurt you.‚Äù (p. 29)Lysa mixes heartbreaking personal stories, convicting Bible truths, and practical exercises and quotes to hold on to. And she mixed it all with sweet grace breathing out of every word, no condemnation or judging. Lysa has been there, so she embraced us with our pain and bitterness, too.I especially loved the exercises by her Christian counselor Jim. I will be using this book over and over not only in continuing the process of forgiveness for things in my past but also for upcoming hurts. I love how she encourages us to make forgiveness and confession a daily thing like Jesus meant it to be in the Lord's Prayer.Favorite quotes:‚Äú...never confuse redemption with reunion. Reunion, or reconciliation, requires two people who are willing to do the hard work to come back together. Redemption is just between you and God.‚Äù (p. 9)‚ÄúThose who cooperate most fully with forgiveness are those who dance most freely in the beauty of redemption.‚Äù (p. 9)‚ÄúOthers didn't really have epic hard things, but anything painful that we keep revisiting in our thoughts over and over again is worth addressing. Sometimes things just collect‚Äù (p. 14). This was me.‚ÄúGod's Word offers forgiveness with skin on. Sinless Jesus.‚Äù (p. 18)‚ÄúForgiveness is a command. But it is not cruel. It is God's divine mercy for human hearts that are so prone to turn hurt into hate.‚Äù (p. 18)‚Äú...evil is arrested, heaven touches earth... forgiveness is the greatest evidence that the Truth of God lives in us.‚Äù (p. 24)‚ÄúAnd all the people around me who didn't deserve to catch the brunt of my chaos felt the completely unsettled state of my heart.‚Äù (p. 28)‚ÄúI had to separate my healing from their choices. My ability to heal cannot depend on anyone's choices but my own.‚Äù (p. 38)‚ÄúThe secret is, we can help each other remember who we really are. But we can't fix each other. We can't control each other. We can't keep each other healthy.‚Äù (p. 79)‚ÄúWhole, healthy people are capable of giving and receiving love. Giving and receiving forgiveness. Giving and receiving hope. Giving and receiving constructive feedback. Giving and receiving life lessons tucked within the harder things we've been through. We have to get to the place where the pain we've experienced is a gateway ‚Ä¶ [not] a brick wall ‚Ä¶‚Äù (p. 92)‚ÄúIt truly is one of the most heartbreaking moments of anyone's life when they have to release a loved one to the consequences of their own choices. But it's also the only chance that either of you has to get any better.‚Äù (p. 124)‚ÄúI want them saved, but I am not their Savior ‚Ä¶ So, I shift from efforts of control to efforts of compassion.‚Äù (p. 126)‚ÄúI can't always immediately determine exactly what I'm feeling. It's either an up feeling or a down feeling, but exactly what I'm feeling is hard to identify. And even when I figure out from all the available emotions which one I'm feeling, then I have to work to figure out the right issue to attach as the cause.‚Äù (p. 142) Me, too!‚ÄúWhat makes faith fall apart isn't doubt. It's becoming too certain of the wrong things.‚Äù (p. 146)‚ÄúIn the words of my counselor Jim Cress, 'Hope is the melody of the future. Faith is dancing to that melody right now.'‚Äù (p. 150)‚ÄúHe [Jesus in John 16:20-22] didn't promise their grief would be taken away and replaced with joy. He promised the grief would turn into joy. The grief would produce the joy. The grief was a part of the journey.‚Äù (p. 153)‚ÄúWe see destruction. God sees construction.‚Äù (p. 163)‚ÄúBitterness doesn't just want to room with you; it wants to completely consume everything about you.‚Äù (p. 174)‚ÄúUsually the bitter heart is the heart with the greatest ability to love deeply. But when you love deeply, you are at the greatest risk of being hurt deeply. And when that deep hurt comes, it seems to cage the love that once ran wild and free. Caged love often has a bitter cry.‚Äù (p. 178)‚ÄúWhat if bitterness is actually a seed of beautiful potential not yet planted in the rich soil of forgiveness?‚Äù (p. 184)‚ÄúI really wish it was called 'the prodigal sons.' Both were rebellious. One was just more obvious than the other. One was wayward. The other resentful. But it was the one with resentment who wound up being most resistant to the father in the end.‚Äù (p. 194)‚ÄúBitterness is a bad deal that makes big promises on the front end but delivers nothing you really want on the back end ‚Ä¶ Turning my heart over to bitterness is turning away from God.‚Äù (p. 195)‚ÄúHe [Jesus] wasn't teaching it so we'd just apply it to all the big heartbreaks and hurts of our lives. He meant it as a daily practice.‚Äù (p. 208)‚Äú'As it is more blessed to give than to receive, so to forgive rises a stage higher in experience than to be forgiven.'‚Äù (quoting Charles Spurgeon on p. 226)I received a copy for free as a Proverbs31 volunteer. I was not compensated for this review. All opinions are my own, as was the decision to write this review.)"
"I have read many of Lysa Terkeurst' books and I love her style of writing, transparency, and authentic understanding for her readers.  Lysa's message on Forgiveness is biblical.  The act of forgiveness is a command.  During a recovery program at our church called Regeneration, this concept was taught and learned, and Lysa's book completely lines up with that program, and scripture.  The freedom that comes when you understand the art of Forgiveness, freeing yourself from the bondage of someone else's sin or harms done to you, is when you will truly find Joy and Peace, that can only come from Christ.  I highly recommend this book to anyone, whether you have dealt with adultery, abuse, harms against you in any format, or just have a hard time forgiving small day to day areas, this book is for you.  Peace comes when we release our burdens to God.  He redeems it all.  And He provides us with His love, peace, security, and hope!"
"Most books that take view their subject with a religious angle advertise that on the cover.This book does not.Its title sounds secular: ""Forgiving What You Can't Forget: Discover How to Move On, Make Peace with Painful Memories, and Create a Life That‚Äôs Beautiful Again.""Even the book's description doesn't mention Jesus Christ or God.Yes, it mentions the Bible, and I'm guilty of missing that.In some ways, this is fair advertising because the book isn't HEAVILY religious.How would you feel reading a book about forgiveness and every few pages I tell you how Zeus is watching you, that Zeus loves you, and that Zeus wants you to get over this.You'd probably find it annoying and distracting since you don't believe in Zeus.The same goes if the book mentioned Muhammad and the Quran every few pages (assuming you're not a Muslim).That's how atheists like me feel whenever we read books that have a religious angle.That's why it's important to clearly signal inform the potential reader that your book is going to talk about one or more gods.However, the book is still valuable and useful even to an atheist or someone who believes in another god besides the Christian one."
"I love Lysa TerKeurst. Her testimonials are always raw and heartfelt, with the humanity necessary to reach out to others. Her books resonate with me in more ways than one. The book UNINVITED opened a gateway towards healing from rejection wounds that go way back to childhood, while UNGLUED and MADE TO CRAVE explored the sides of me I struggled throughout my life. IT‚ÄôS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THIS WAY helped me through some rough disappointments, and now I get a comprehensive lesson with FORGIVING WHAT YOU CAN‚ÄôT FORGET. In this wonderful book, TerKeurst shares her struggles with forgiveness, and how difficult it was for her to process her anger about her husband‚Äôs infidelity. As she shares her darkest moments, she also reiterates on the importance of forgiveness, and how vital discernment is during the process. Here are some key things about this book:FORGIVENESS DOES NOT MEAN REPEATING TOXIC PATTERNS. Many people believe forgiveness means taking someone back, or accepting someone‚Äôs unapologetic flaws, or to put your needs below someone else‚Äôs. To some people, to forgive is to become a pushover who forgives multiple acts of infidelity and other forms of betrayal. This belief is misleading and toxic in and of itself. To forgive someone is to let go of the hurt, resentment, and bitterness. It does not mean that you welcome back an unchanged abusive, criminal, or damaged individual back into your life. There‚Äôs an excellent chapter in this book that discusses the difference between forgiving someone and enabling them. This chapter alone will provide you with all the information you need to help discern your situation. WE MUST PROCESS OUR ANGER. The Bible discusses forgiveness a lot. Jesus reiterates the importance of forgiveness many times. Matthew 18:21-22 springs to mind. But does that mean you‚Äôre able to forgive on the spot? No. We must process our anger, come to terms with our emotions, and discuss it with others. If we don‚Äôt do that, then those hurt feelings will fester and grow into bitterness. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to address it as soon and as often as possible. The more you talk about it, the more the pain subsides, and then forgiveness blooms. You‚Äôve let go. It‚Äôs over. God knows it isn‚Äôt easy for us to forgive people, that‚Äôs why He wants us to do it. An unforgiving heart is like an old abandoned house, rotting from the inside out.WE MUSTN‚ÄôT FORGET! ‚ÄúThose who forget their history are bound to repeat it.‚Äù Forgetting someone else‚Äôs misdeeds is a major mistake. You will repeat past patterns, and then wonder why it keeps happening. Never forget the event ‚Äî and the things you go through ‚Äî for it will strengthen you and be more resilient. ‚ÄúAbove all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.‚Äù Proverbs 4:23I enjoyed this audiobook. Lysa TerKeurst narrates her book, and she does it with the amount of rawness and emotion that you would except from her. She has a beautiful soul, and I always enjoy her books. This one‚Äôs no exception. I can‚Äôt think of any downsides. I recommend this. Five solid Berry and Banana smoothies!"
"Well, I didn't throw it across the room, so that is progress in my forgiveness journey. I have struggled with forgiveness since childhood and harbor grudges. I was honestly resistant to read it because I am familiar with Lysa's story and how she forgave her husband, and I didn't want to hear someone tell me I had to forgive someone. But I gave it a shot anyway, and I am glad I did. I appreciated her honesty and vulnerability. She also taught me some things about myself and new ways to think about forgiveness. Overall, it is a good choice."
"I've read a few other books from Lisa Terkeurst and found a lot of empathy in it. It was for that reason that I selected ""Forgiving What You Can't Forget."" The author is honest and gentle even when discussing difficult issues with uneasy options. It isn't that she holds back; it is that she doesn't. It is a gift to be able to do that and find balance needed to advise and comfort. A very good read that was very worthwhile."
"""We can't change what we have experienced, but we can choose how the experiences change us.""Lysa Terkeurst delves deep into the subject of forgiveness; something very close to her heart.With practical step-by-step processes to help the reader navigate survival, bitterness, boundaries, and so many other aspects of forgiveness, Lysa points to the Word of God for wisdom and strength even in the most painful of scenarios.With her usual honest, come-sit-with-me-over-coffee approach, and Bible verses peppered throughout, the reader will feel seen and heard and loved.Honestly, I originally bought this book as research for a character in my current novel manuscript(!), but I have learned so much I can apply in my own life. I've already been able to recommend this book to several friends and will continue to do so. It's a wonderful resource!"
"Lysa's writing style is amazing; she makes you feel like she is talking directly to you, an old and dear friend. Recommended for anyone who is having struggles with forgiveness, obviously, but also for those of us who perhaps don't have such obvious issues in this particular area This may help us to understand our loved ones better who do, but really every single one of us, whether we ""struggle"" to forgive others or not needs to be reminded of the precious gift forgiveness is (and the ultimate display of it on the cross.)"
"Life is full of loss and grief and every manner of the unexpected. Whether you are the cause of harm or the one who has been harmed, Lysa Terkeurst will help you through the pain to a place of peace. Forgiveness is the key. This is a beautiful book."
"I genuinely loved this book. It was like she was telling the story of my hurt and knew exactly what it felt like. I always felt there was a before and after in my life and this book walks you thru all of your hurt. The best part is, it also teaches you the things you need to forgive. The only person who you are truly hurting is yourself and moving on is necessary. I always felt that I was doing something wrong if I forgave him, that I was letting him get away with it. She really understood this and takes you on a path of true forgiveness. This book is relatable to all kinds of hurt and trauma. Whether you are ready to forgive or not it's a great book. I'd love to sit at her table! I am going to order the first one now!"
"This book is written by a woman who has known immense grief. She explains forgiveness in ways even the people in the most pain will be willing to hear out. There's no sense of condemnation thrown at the reader. Just empathy and an approach of great love and so much care toward the hurting person seeking the right avenues.As someone who struggles with unforgiveness due to great pain, I decided to listen to the audio of this book as a way to help unfold why I am having such a hard time forgiving and letting something go that the people I am upset with already let go and moved on from forgetting I even exist while they live off of using others to keep themselves above water and constantly leave people worse off than when they found them, but are happy while I'm sobbing. At least this was the view I had going into it. I have realized more than ever that it wasn't so much what was done to me, but what emotional triggers that were already there inside me from early childhood traumas that the actions from these two brought to the surface (feelings of inadequacy and rejection, feeling that I don't matter, etc.). I learned that in order for people to do this to others, however, they have to be experiencing their own sort of emotional hell, and may not fully realize what they're leaving in their wake. Broken people are selfish sometimes due to wanting to prevent what hurt them before from happening again. They take from others to feel better, but are too tired or distracted by grief to give back in return. I realized from this book too that those people are loved by God more than I will ever fully understand in this life, and they need prayer for healing. They need the love of Christ. They need God to fill their voids. I realize it may be for that very reason I met them, so I could see the extent to their detriment, see past their emotional projections stemming from their internal emotional hell, and pray for whatever it is causing them to act out in such a way to be brought to the surface and for them to seek healing from it. This book allows you to see different perspectives like this. It's worth about 10 more listens. I can't give anything word for word after the first read, but I can say how much better I feel and how softened my heart is in comparison to before I started. My Holy Spirit heard every word which is evidence to my softened heart and my determination to forgive and to pray for those who hurt me to heal and to turn to God for their affirmation and to stop using and then hurting others."
"This book reminds me of Eat, Pray, Love.  If you‚Äôre looking for a Christ centered book, this is not it.  The first 7 chapters are about past reflection which doesn‚Äôt seem to go anywhere.  The overly emotionally charged and flowery language was a bit dramatic and confusing at times."
"If I could rate this book 10 stars, I would. I've always been a huge lover of Lysa's book. She speaks with God given perspectives. Her previous two books, It's Not Supposed to be this Way"" and ""Uninvited"" completely changed my life.  But this book. Ooft. God uses Lysa to speak about His heart of what forgiveness, processing through trauma/hardships, and healing look like. With her personal experience, Lysa gentely guides and challenges the reader to process through lives experiences until the life giving freedom forgiveness offers. I cannot recommend this book enough."
"Ok. This book is a must freaking have! She beautifully describes how her own personal hurts and abuse with family connected deeply to the way she perceived and was effected by an affair and drug use of her spouse of 20+ years. She‚Äôs so humbly vulnerable to show that yes, even Christian couples experience affairs, abuse, drug use - yet there‚Äôs still freedom from it all! God can use this pain to launch you into a future that only he can prepare. If you‚Äôve experienced any level of life hurt and aren‚Äôt sure if you‚Äôve worked the process of forgiveness (which is basically anyone) this book is for you!"
This is a great topic. I wanted to like this book more than I did. I hadn‚Äôt realized it would have a strong religious perspective. That‚Äôs not a negative but I didn‚Äôt  find it helpful either. I had trouble getting through the whole book. It feels more like an auto-biography than a self help book.
"I was able to download the first three chapters as a bonus for preordering the book and absolutely could not wait to get the book in the mail.  I receive my copy this week and cannot put it down.  Lysa‚Äôs (&Art‚Äôs) willingness to share their story is incredible.  The book is not only about marriage relationships but any relationship where hurt and pain may have occurred.  The book is packed with great wisdom and insight, God‚Äôs promises and truths, and hope for moving past pain and hurt."
"This is an excellent resource for those who need help moving on from something unforgettable. Too many of us are bound by trauma against us and are unable to see past the offense. Forgiveness is freeing to us, not to the offender. There's a big difference. Lysa shares from her own experiences and teaches in a loving way from a Christian perspective. A lot of this book is autobiographical and it doesn't read like a Bible study, more a memoir, but there is a lot of wisdom to be gleaned from it. She writes with honesty and isn't afraid to reveal the raw emotion and situations that left her feeling empty."
"My husband unexpectedly left me and in the most painful way imaginable. He took me down and used our church family and counselors as his weapon of choice. This book and her other book It Shouldn't Be This Way have changed my life, given me freedom,  and drew me into a deep relationship with the Lord. I needed this book and it was published in the mist of my trauma. GOD knew I needed what Lysa had already learned in her own pain and grief. I'm very thankful."
"Forgiving What You Can't Forget is a Bible-driven ""how to"" guide to reclaiming the beautiful, abundant life God plans for each of us. Lysa Terkeurst takes readers on a step-by-step tour of healing so ""not one bit of the hurt done to us is multiplied by us."" She advises surrendering our pain to God, releasing our need to see the one who wronged us punished, releasing our needs for apology, and to be right, and for the situation to feel fair. She suggests that we ask God to show us what we need to learn from our hurtful experience and to give us peace in place of our anger. I've decided that someone's ""offense will not define me or confine me by the smallness of bitterness."" I will no longer ""be stunted by anger, haunted by resentment, or held back by fear."" Sound like a book you might want to read?Lee Reinecke, author of Peeling Away the Facade: The Long Shadow of Child Abuse"
"As usual Lysa TerKeurst puts beautiful words to our pain and gives hope to our healing yet again in this book. In fact, her story and her writing captivated me so much that I flew through the book. I didn't realize until the second to last chapter that I hadn't highlighted or bookmarked or taken notes. I will have to revisit so many portions of this book. I just kept a constant rally cry of, ""Yes, that's me"" ""That's exactly how it feels"" and ""Thank God there is hope in this pain."""
"I liked the fact that the author was so vulnerable In writing her latest.  She talks candidly about the tough times she had with her husband's addiction and how they eventually worked through it all to stay married.I think she could've done a better job without some of the clich√©s of writing.. ""Good morning, beautiful you"" for example.Would make a good Bible study book."
This was such a healing book to read. I am forever grateful to have read this book. If you are someone who struggles with forgiving a loved one for something- this is the book for you.It was a rollercoaster of emotions reading through this. It definitely helped me open my eyes to forgiveness. It made me realize so much in life and that I can finally move on.
"Have you ever been told that you just need to ‚Äúlet it go‚Äù or ‚Äúget over it‚Äù and you thought you had, but at times, the offense just spins around in your head and in your heart and you just don‚Äôt know what to do with it all? Have you ever thought I want to forgive, but I just don‚Äôt know how? This book is the road map, the instruction manual, the how to guide on every angle of forgiveness. Lysa shows why forgiveness, while many times being the harder path to take, is the one that leads to peace. The extensive time and research she put into this book from a Biblical perspective is apparent in every chapter. Put it on your must read list. In fact, put it at the very top. If everyone read it, our families, our communities, our country and our world would be a better place."
I‚Äôve only read the first two chapters so far and I have been so deeply touched. I feel like Lysa is speaking for me and sharing deep emotions I haven‚Äôt had the courage to visit in a long time. My pain has felt validated and I am eager to slowly continue reading and allow God to move in my life. Thank you Lysa for sharing yourself so openly so that we can drink from your tears and be encouraged.
The sample only goes as far as the table of contents. Can someone fix it so we can read a few pages of chapter one?
"This book was awesome.  My resentment at my ex husband‚Äôs destruction of our marriage and the structure of our family was more than I could put behind me.  For the first time, the author met me where I was and validated that wrenching sick feeling I have carried for several years. It turned my heart around. My first step was willingness.  I can forgive and not condone what happened.  I feel more at peace now than I have in many years."
"This is quite an easy read for me. If you need some encouragement, motivation, positive optimism, and some encouragement because of something that may have occurred to you in your life, then this is truly a book to read. It will lift you up - it helped me, truly. I applied and allowed most of the book to help me with aspects in my life that are hurting me and making me feel depressed."
I am the type of person who holds grudges and remembers everything. This book is helping me to see how and why that is toxic. It is making me realize that it can affect my health even.  This is a great read if you're like me.  It is heeling me be more at peace and learn to get over things
"It was as if Lysa Terkeurst was reading the pages of my journal, reading the thoughts in my head and overheard my cries out to God....this book was so healing and really ministered to my soul. This book validated so much in my heart and has soooo many deep truths that have only come by way of going through the fire ....I am aware of Lysa's personal story and she has truly gone through the fire.....so I know that this book is an example of how God can use painful experiences for good. I literally almost highlighted every page in this book....If I could give this book 10 stars - I would!  A must read for anyone who has experienced being deeply hurt, wounded, abused, betrayed and is struggling to forgive..."
"Powerful. This book. This journal. Powerful. Just like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Not Supposed to be This Way‚Äù forever changed me and deepened my relationship with Him, this book has forever emptied all the ‚Äústuff‚Äù in me ans has given me a place to sift through it, find what needs forgiven, destroy any bitterness and live free from any shackles I have allowed to be."
Now and then you'll find a writer than gets it and can write in a fashion that resonates and keeps your attention.  That nails exactly what you are in the middle of and you actually are amazed there's more just like you apparently.  This is a great read I got a lot of value out of it.  A good choice.
"An absolutely necessity for all of us as we navigate the inevitable hurt that comes with being in relationship with others. Lysa's words and vulnerability have changed my life, and this book provides very practical steps to move forward in forgiveness and healing. Cannot recommend enough!"
Lisa‚Äôs book ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Not Suppose To Be This Way‚Äù was the best support I received during a difficult time. I didn‚Äôt hesitate to purchase new book because I hear God speaks through her in all her other books. This book offers better help than councilors I‚Äôve seen.
"Excellent guide for Christians on forgiveness. Lysa explains how forgiveness is really about healing for us. She lays out a simple, but not easy, journey to moving past life‚Äôs deep hurts in a way that leads to wholeness and healing."
"You don't have to get very far into this book before the tears start flowing and you start aching with and for Lysa. Her pain can be felt through the pages, and yet you know she has come out on the other side, in the process of healing and being restored. I'm so thankful for this book. Forgiveness has got to be one of the hardest issues we as humans face. I'm so grateful that Lysa has been so honest and open about her struggles and processes!"
"Lysa's writing is always honest, raw, inspiring, and helpful. This is no exception. She gives hope, even while she opens her life up. This will be helpful for anyone struggling to forgive and move on--no matter how long it's been since a tragedy, triumph, or betrayal happened."
"I was happily  surprised at how well this book handles forgiveness, and usually it's glossed over and over simplified in Christian books. I loved the honesty, and appreciate the rawness. It's a bookshelf keeper!"
WOW!! This book is the reason I signed up for audible! I‚Äôve listened to it several times now!Really struggling with finding that place of boundaries with people in my life. This book has helped me SO much!!
"This book is powerful, raw, real and with no doubt Christian-centered. These are real experiences of someone who‚Äôs suffered pain, grief, and loss like many of us have. Our walk with the Lord has swayed and we‚Äôve been angry at him but always come back to him. Never forgetting that he is who guides us.I am a licensed therapist who believes we NEED Jesus and therapy and this is a great combination of the two AND I just realized there is more to follow up on in Psalms 31 of her ministry. I‚Äôve recommended this book to all my close friends and clients."
the breathless narration was unbearable.
I am a Biblical counselor. This book focuses on forgiving hurts and offenses. So many people refuse to obey Gods command that their suffering is magnified over and over. The author is authentic and transparent revealing through personal experiences how she applied this principle in her own valleys. Great book.
A raw and honest look at forgiveness from a Christian!! Such a freeing journey from the pain of being hurt. Therapy and Biblical perspective! So thankful to this author!!!
"This book will rock your world. Lysa is raw and real.  She has experienced first hand gut wrenching heartbreak. She knows how difficult forgiveness can be and she doesn't sugar coat things with pat Christian answers. She helps guide you through the real feelings of grief and hurt, using the Bible as a guide."
"I bought , the book , workbook , journal and kit and I cannot tell you how amazing it is !! Whatever your struggling with , an affair , abandonment , friendship , anywhere forgiveness is needed , this is the book for you !!"
"This is another solid piece from Lysa. She writes about forgiveness and ties it from a biblical perspective. If you enjoy this author, you will enjoy this book."
Give this a read if you are having a hard time letting go of past traumas - Lysa has a way with words and always speaks to me.
"Geared toward the Christian, but very helpful for all.  This book is beautifully written, includes personal stories and helpful questions to ask yourself. Her research and inclusion of Bible passages and interpretation takes the hard work out of looking for grounding in faith to support this very personal process."
"Amazing book about learning about true forgiveness. Beautifully written to help you heal. No promises of reconciliation with who you need to forgive, but helping you learn to forgive for your own self. Forgiving even if the other person never ask for it."
Lysa does a great job showing us the importance of forgiving other and moving on even it it means we revisit the hurt later.
Must read for I fear that one day every one will have their hearts broken.  I hope every one comes to the gray table with Lyse.  Thank you!  I hope one day I can smile again.
Learning to forgive yourself is one of the hardest things we have to do. This book teaches us lessons yet gives us the tools andknowledge to deal. Great book
Reads like an inspirational plaque found at Home Goods.  No REAL strategies for resolve---avoid!
I‚Äôm still learning from this book. I apply all the principles that I learn to my life
"This was an okay book, more religious then I thought it would be."
A little slow in the intro and first chapter but full of great truths.
I loved this book. Really helpful.
"Such an eloquent writer, Lysa was introduced into our Family Bible Study Zoom Calls, we started during Pandemic, with this book! Now we have completed all her books!"
This book is so good. Forgiveness has so many layers. I love how she breaks down our feelings and what forgiveness means biblically. And just helps us truly work through what God is desiring of us. This works for any hurts in my life.  Thanks so much for this book
Great learning !
Really great book!!
Great audible
"I would give this book 100 stars if I could. I had been struggling with forgiving some serious hurt in my life and this book offered an amazing, Christ centered approach to forgiving and healing. I couldn‚Äôt put the book down! I could not recommend this book enough."
"I purchased this book as my morning devotional for 2019 after hearing so many great things about it. Immediately I found it disturbing that the book is written in the first person, as if God was speaking. I told myself it was just different than other devotional books I‚Äôd used and I would get used to it. But I have not become accustomed to the format, rather the more I read, the more unsettling it is. It feels as if the author is putting words into God‚Äôs mouth, which in my opinion, should not be done as the Bible is truly the only words of God. Furthermore, the Bible references given with each entry are often  just a single verse taken out of context to support what is written. Definitely not my style and not inspirational for me. I do not understand all of the accolades this book and its companion, ‚ÄúJesus Always,‚Äù have received."
This book is full of mysticism. This is not for Christians to read. I caution all Christians to beware. Research and you will see or you will be lead astray into the devils grasp.
"Jesus Calling continues to be popular as people search for peace in this broken world. But I am dumbfounded that many Christians are relying on this devotional given the contents of Sarah Young's writings. Young writes as if she is Jesus, which is a glaring problem with this book. If she had simply used ""I"" instead of ""He"" to make clear these words are hers and not those of Jesus, then the devotional and her thoughts might be seen as a comfort to readers. Even so, I would like to have seen all versions of Jesus Calling include full scripture verses rather than just the references. Those two things could have combined to make this an effective devotional rather than the bizarre read that it is. As I seek a deeper presence of God in my life, I will rely on His true word in the Bible and not an author who presumes to speak for Jesus."
"When a friend told me about this book and that it was such an inspiration to her, I had my doubts. How could any author know what Jesus had to say to us? Well, I gave it a try. With the accompanying scripture, Sarah was surely led by the Holy Spirit when writing this book. I feel that God has given me great growth through the words He gave her that were just for me. I could write a book telling how God has gone before me with the subtitle I have given this book. My life was saved from a death by hypothermia because the words from Jesus that morning told me that He is my strength. I am 73 years old and have mobility issues.. One of our horses got out of the pasture and I thought I could get her back to the barn. We had 12 inches of snow during the night, but she was just outside the door, so I slipped my bare feet into a pair of shoes, grabbed a lightweight jacket, a lead rope, two canes and a carrot. She munched on the carrot as I attempted to get the rope on her. Well, she figured out what I was doing, grabbed the carrrot and ran for the corn field and I was sure I could catch up with her and coax her back to the barn. I stumbled and fell. My canes just slipped on the snow and I couldn't get up. I started crawling and as I tired, belly crawling to a  house that was closer than mine.  I was getting so tired, I just wanted to lay my head down and rest for a bit. As I layed my head down, I heard  a voice telling me not to lay my head down,  not to close my eyes, just look for the next spot you're going to. You have the strength. Every time I wanted to lay my head down, I heard the same voice and felt revived enough to go on. I made it to the other house; my neighbor called 911 and medical help arrived. Even though I was in shock and my temperature was just below 95 degrees, I was totally lucid. I give thanks to God for urging me on. At my age,He must still have things for me to do in His service. My only injury was slightly bruised kidneys from the fall that healed quickly without any complications. My husband came to emergency and was able to take me home. Before we left for the hospital,  the horse came to the ambulance and bumped her head on it until the sheriffs tried to catch her. She ran to the barn door and waited for them to open the door and let her into her stall. I had traveled between 1/4 and 1/2 a mile. This is just one example of how knowing that Jesus is calling and always with us, leading us into His will and keeping us safe, holding me with His right hand and keeping me in His everlasting arms."
New Age garbage
"I used this every morning for some time but it irritated me being written as the voice of God , when she started calling me foolish with a degrading attitude I stopped reading it , if you want something close to truth , this IS NOT it !"
"If you know Jesus Christ through the Scriptures, you will know that this is NOT the way He speaks.  This is a Jesus that Sarah Young created"
"I realized that we should be seeking the Lord in his word, the Bible, instead of trying to hear his voice through others. We are told to test the spirits to discern who is actually speaking. I know a lot of people who purchase these books (including myself and now regretting) are looking to hear from God maybe the easy way. But sometimes the easy way isn't the right way. Who knows where this woman got this word from. I want to be sure that any word I get is from the Lord and from him alone from me building a relationship with him"
"I went through this book with a group and we all agreed that it is very weirdly written in the first person of God.Furthermore the Author has replaced pwoerful biblical words with NAR nonsense like ""presence"" and ""experience"".The church needs Repentence, santification, and discipleship, NOT fluffy feel goods ""experiences"" or fasle ""presence"".The ""presence"" of God comes from walking with God and His word. ""Experiences"" come seeing God move in the world we live in, NOT loud music, fog machines, and emotionalism. SMH"
"My all-time favorite daily devotional.  I have told LOADS of people about this book and have given this book to a few of them.  This year is my third year of reading it.  I'm not new to deepening my spirituality; but this book certainly was a surprise in that area.  It has profoundly affected me, enlarging my faith!"
"I love this book!  It is a daily encouragement to me and reminds me daily that He really does love me and care!  Each day is only a page or even half a page, then there are scriptures at the bottom on which the day's devotion are based.  I look up those scriptures and read the verses ahead of it and after it, to get the whole picture.  I've always struggled with ""feeling"" or believing He loves me.  I know it is just faith that is needed to believe what the Word says, but still this is such a daily help to me.  It is also a real encouragement and it seems that often that days devotion is just what I need when going through a hard time.  It feels like the Lord has planned it out that I receive the words that I need for that day and the scriptures that are the most fitting.  Super book for any Christian!"
"I should like this and wanted to like this, but I found the first person wording‚Äî everything written as though Jesus is speaking‚Äîa bit unsettling, since he didn‚Äôt actually say everything that‚Äôs written in the lessons. I know it‚Äôs supposed to be capturing the gist of Jesus‚Äô teachings, but it felt a little misleading and uncomfortable to me. Maybe if it had highlighted his actual words from the Bible separate from the writer‚Äôs?‚Ä¶"
"The product I expected was not what I received.  I need to book with the original unedited introduction.  This book has a re-edit of the introduction that takes out a lot of Young‚Äôs inspiration behind the book.  Such as a mystic book called God Calling was mentioned in the first print is just one of a few examples of what the publishing company Thomas Nelson talked Sarah Young into omitting.  Again, I needed the original and this wasn‚Äôt it."
This is someones interpretation of scripture but then all they did was list chapter & verseyou have to go look it up yourselfNot convenient if you just want to read for pleasure & there is plenty of room for the verse to be includedI think its just a sloppy jobvery disappointed
"I gave up on devotionals years ago because they were always asking you to DO something or too expository. This one pretty much tells those born of God's Spirit to chill and be lead by the Spirit.  It affirms what the Bible about being loved and lead by God. I don't understand the people who complain about this book being written as if God/Jesus is speaking to you personally. Isn't that how we're supposed to feel when He ""has got our number"" when we're reading the Bible? We believers often say that God spoke to us through x-scripture and then proceed to explain how and how we applied it. This book just removes some of the work of meditating on the Scriptures that are going to speak to us anyway.  If real Christianity is a ""personal relationship with Jesus Christ"", this book shouldn't be an issue. It speaks to your heart just like scripture and you don't have to sit there and ponder why God chose a particular metaphor or analogy when He inspired the prophets and apostles for example. Jesus didn't always quote the OT verbatim. However the truth of what He said can be backed by the OT.  The same can be said for 99% of this book's ideas being backed by both OT and NT. I've only had a problem with maybe 3 passages of this devotional. I can't find them at the moment. I've also found at least one problem with every English translation of the Bible I've read, because I sometimes compare them to the original languages. You should get familiar with the entire Bible too. This should not be a substitute."
"The print on the pink imitation leather looks so pretty! The only thing I can see that may be a problem for others is how the verses aren't written out in the devotional. I like to use this alongside my bible during my daily ""quiet times"" so it's not a big deal for myself."
"Recently, I started attending a mom's group at a local church and one day they were giving away some different Christian books. ""Jesus Calling"" by Sarah Young was one of the books they were giving away and unfortunately, I wasn't a lucky winner of it but I decided to purchase it anyway because my friends told me good things about it and I was very interested in it. I ended up purchasing¬†

  
DaySpring Sarah Young's Jesus Calling, DayBrightener Perpetual Flip Calendar, 366 Days of Scripture (75621)









  
  
    
  ¬†by accident but am giving it to my mom so I bought this hardcover version for myself.Sarah Young and her husband are missionaries who spent years in Japan and Australia sharing the love of Jesus with others. During her time spent teaching others about Christ, she kept a journal and wrote down thoughts and words she felt coming from Jesus as well as Bible verses that spoke to her. It was through this writing that ""Jesus Calling"" came about and she was able to turn it into a devotional for everyone to use.The devotions included in this book are written from the perspective of Jesus speaking to the reader. There is one page for each day of the year, including February 29th. Each page contains a couple of paragraphs with devotions for that day and some Bible verses pertaining to that day's devotion which you can look up in your Bible. She has also included some Scripture references within the devotions that are indicated in italics. This book measures 4 1/4 inches by 6 1/4 inches by 1 inch and is a nice hardcover. It contains 384 glossy pages, including some introductory pages which I recommend reading. There is also an attached ribbon bookmark so you can easily mark your spot. Unless indicated, the Scripture references are taken from the New International Version of the Holy Bible.I love Jesus Calling and am so glad I was introduced to it! Most of the time I find myself reaching for it when I'm having a rough day and it helps me to relax and feel peaceful. I strive to read it everyday, whether I'm having a good or bad day, because the words in this book make me feel more positive no matter what. Since each page only takes about a minute to read, this book would be great to read in the morning while enjoying a cup of coffee and a few minutes of solitude, since many of us lead busy lives. I have friends who love these books as well and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase these as gifts for anyone who I think would enjoy them. If you, or someone you know, are looking for a daily devotional, I highly recommend this one. I also purchased¬†

  ¬†because I love these devotionals. I love the devotions in it and feel it is well-worth the money to spend on it!"
"I am so disappointed ! I ordered this devotional because the reviews that I read states the scriptures are printed out at the bottom of the page .  That is what I wanted and needed.  Imagine my excitement to finally get the devotional and open the book to find the scriptures are NOT printed out.  Wonderful devotional but If you want the version with scriptures printed out , do research bedore ordering.  That version DOES exhist just not sure how to get it."
"I cannot recommend this book at all. It is deceptive and shady.Sadly, it is everywhere. I was given it twice as a gift. My sister, whose son is undergoing medical treatments was given FIVE. She keeps a copy at-hand, ready to go. But, it is not the Bible, it is just a book. It makes me sad to think so many women are accessing this book to assuage their pain. I have been told it is ""easy to read"" and that it ""makes God accessible"". And the Bible doesn't?I think my biggest issue is that each message is very self- focused and gratifying. It plays straight into human vanity. It's weird, coming from Jesus. If Jesus is truly saying these things, then this book is on-par with scripture. So, who is calling? Jesus, or the author? I""m confused who the author is, and that's kind of important.  There's no mention of sin, repentance, mercy, biblical obedience, or sacrificial service. There's no mention of the gospel or the cross. There's no great commission, either, in this book. According to this Jesus, the lost can just go to hell. Oh well, maybe in the course of 365 days He just forgot to mention it! Maybe Jesus has just decided that the great commission, the persecuted church, and the gospel isn't that important any more, or that it isn't relative to our culture. There is, however, lots and lots of information about His Presence and His peace and how to best experience it. Lots of information about how to best enjoy all the sweet pleasures and compliments He exudes upon us during the course of a day. Whether or not you are a believer or have Him as your Lord and Savior, it doesn't matter. This Jesus is perfect for naive readers who don't want to hear anything negative, critical, gripping, informative, or specific.This Jesus, I'm tossing to the curb. Give me the True One that died for my transgressions, PLEASE. Ugh, throw this book away!"
"I absolutely love this devotional. I‚Äôve read so many negative reviews and couldn‚Äôt believe that people didn‚Äôt understand that these are not the authors words nor is she claiming that, she‚Äôs not acting as if she‚Äôs Jesus,  she‚Äôs putting Bible verses into love letters from God. I believe it‚Äôs God breathed from her. I read it daily, I highlight ones I want to go back to. I have bought one for my mom and one for my sister and now I‚Äôm getting one for a friend. Please ignore the negative reviews and understand this is from God, she puts the actual Bible verses on each love letter. Everyone should have a copy, you won‚Äôt be sorry."
"I have completed my 10th year using Jesus Calling as one if my daily devotionals.  Never should a devotional replace the Bible itself.  Anything that is not scripture should not be taken as such and should be carefully examined for anything that would dilute or misrepresent it.  I have never found anything that does either of these things.  Instead, it has drawn me closer to the Lord and increased my love for Him.I have given cases of this volume to many who attend a Bible Study I am part of and others who have difficulties drawing near to the Lord or letting  Christ draw near to them.  Not once has anyone who has read it complained or found it wanting.  A few never realized the jewel and opportunity they held in their hands.  Two of these women didn‚Äôt remember receiving it.  So they got a second which they also didn‚Äôt read.I am grateful to Sara Young for this and her other works.  I also thank her for helping me to identify a few scriptures that have become life verses which guide and uplift me year in and year out.  God is good and loving and this devotional attests to that in every page."
"My MIL sent me a picture of one of the pages from this book for inspiration and I loved it.  I felt it was speaking to me and about me.  I went ahead and ordered the book.  Although, after much consideration, I felt this book isn't for me.  While I wish I could turn the page and God is speaking directly to me like so, it is not that simple.  I can't pretend that these words are from God when another human like myself penned it.  Although there are quotes from the bible, the words are not his.  I will stick with the bible, the true words of God."
"I LOVE this book!!!  One morning while on Facebook, I saw one of the day's devotions, and it immediately spoke to me, so I bought the book that day. Work had been draining me and I was continually angry and I knew I needed to bring my focus back, and this book has done it. I will admit, there are times when I get behind and don't read the day's devotion, but I always make sure to catch up. Just the other day I did just that, and I cannot tell you the peace it brought me. There are days that I read the devotion multiple times and it just makes me smile. There have been multiple times that I want to read ahead as I cannot wait to see what the next day's reading will bring me. This book is great for anyone - from those questioning their faith to those that are 100% devote. It brings you back to where you need to be with God & Jesus, and is utterly amazing. I cannot tell you how many days I read the devotion and it is 1000% spot on to what I've been going through. It makes me smile, and I tip my head to Heaven and say ""yep - you've got this!"". This book brings God & Jesus to life for the readers in a very practical and real way. I HIGHLY recommend this for everyone!"
"I honestly don't know how I have lived wtihout this amazing book. The woman who wrote this is a scholar - but, more importantly, she is intimately connected to the Lord.  I love it that this is written in first person point of view - which is ambitious, and could be construed as hubris - but, it isn't.The more I read it - and I don't read it as a day by day devotional - I read it as a page by page - book.This also complements my Brennan Manning readings - Abba's Child; Ragamuffin Gospel; The Signature of Jesus.I have a smaller edition/hand held/that does not flesh out the Scriptures. I also have a larger one that does.I keep the smaller one for my bag- and use the larger one at home.Honestly, I even have with me when I go to sleep. It's comforting just holding onto it.Really love and respect this work -"
"I got this from my daughter-in-law for her birthday, she‚Äôs a very strong Christian and I knew she would love it and I wasn‚Äôt wrong. I bought one for myself a few years back, I kept it in my room next to my bible. One day, my granddaughter started telling me about this wonderful Devotional book series She‚Äôd just read about called, Jesus calling, that she wanted start getting. I said, I think I know exactly what you‚Äôre talking about, I have one in my room. She couldn‚Äôt believe it, she said no grandma, it‚Äôs not a romance novel it‚Äôs a Christian daily devotional. I smiled, got up and went in my room and brought out my Jesus Calling devotional and my daughter could not believe her eyes. Hahaha! I have not seen my devotional since that day, I need to buy myself another one."
I got turned on to the devotional enjoying it I ordered the books to share but the difference is that there are no Bible verses in that devotional I like to see in the Bible verses with the devotion instead of having the chapter in the verses but thank you and thank God that he is still who he says he is
Ok I have the leather book that was bought at a Christian book store. Sadly those stores are no more. I found this one and thought great! Came with a MAJOR flaw on a page. It was bound this way. I love this book and the color is gorgeous. Don‚Äôt think I should use it as the Christmas gift it was intended to be. Considering it is obvious the page is bound and wrinkled. Really bummed and disappointed that I paid for a defective book. Ugh
"I know that everyone loves this book. I see it quoted on social media and sitting in the homes of many friends. I actually purchased this book back in 2010. I tried to read it and love it as much as I was ""supposed"" to but it seemed very odd to me so I got rid of it. I'm so thankful that I did now. This is unfortunately, the kind of mystical new age Christianity that is proliferating even in conservative, evangelical, and reformed circles. Avoid this book and read respected opinions of it (such as Tim Challies) to fully understand the new age mysticism peddled by this author. If you own this book read Jesus' words in the Bible and contrast them to the words in Jesus Calling. The author's claim that these words are a direct revelation from God are so concerning."
"Very encouraging and uplifting. I've had this book for almost four years now and I've read it over and over. It has brought me such comfort on days when things seemed to be going all wrong. To be reminded that God knows my name, He's with me and carrying me through all the turmoil of life. The reminder that He loves us and will walk with us though life, never leaving us, is a much needed reminder even daily. I know that this book is a bit controversial, with some saying that Ms. Young added to scripture and is talking out of her own self and not the Holy Spirit. I myself don't get any of that vibe from this book. I feel/hear the Holy Spirit's voice in this book because it ALWAYS points back to Christ. That's the important thing. I bought this as a gift for a family member and I will buy it again for others in the future. This would make a great gift to send to someone who has had loss in their life and may be asking ""Where is God?"" . This book lets the reader know that He is there with you and you're not alone. To trust Him even when things don't make sense. That all things work out for the good of those who love Him."
"This devotional is unsettling to me in that the writer channels the words she thinks Christ would want you to hear. I agree that Christ may very well be thinking that and want you to know it, but reading it through a book written by as if it were actually thoughts of Christ was very creepy to me.  The Bible is more than adequate!"
"Although I originally bought it as a gift for a friend ~ I have scanned it and read some of its entries.  I think I got this well over a year ago.  Anyway, it's OK.  What I didn't like about it is that she writes in the 1st person as if she were God.  I know she's just relaying what God might say ~ and it's all fine.  I just don't like her saying what she imagines God to have said (but with no Scriptural evidence of her words verbatim).  I have a daily devotional by Max Lucado that I truly love and greatly recommend."
"I have my own Jesus Calling book and have bought several as gifts. I've gotten Jesus Calling for friends who were either non believers or ""weren't sure if God was real, but knew 'something' was out there,"" and these books have helped me show them that Jesus is real and have become true believers and gotten them into church. AMEN! These books also prompt you to look things up in the Bible. My favorite part is that my daily reading almost always parallels with what is going on in my life, gives me hope, redirects me, or reminds me of things that I can tell others when they are going through hard times. It is a great reminder that He is always with us and to spend time in His presence not only when things are going well but even when they aren't. I would highly recommend this book to anyone- believers, non believers, people who are on the fence, etc. What better gift than to give someone something that could led them to salvation."
"I have read many devotionals but none are as personal as Jesus Calling.  Each day you will think the devotion was written especially for YOU!  There are also either two or three scriptures for each devotion.  Very powerful!  I actually give this book as gifts to my friends and acquaintances.  I highly recommend Jesus Calling to bring you closer to God.  Remember the scripture:John 14:5-7 Jesus the Way to the Father5Thomas said to him, ‚ÄúLord, we don‚Äôt know where you are going, so how can we know the way?‚Äù6Jesus answered, ‚ÄúI am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. 7If you really know me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.‚Äù"
"My husband and I started with the readings and, at first, enjoyed them.  Some of them seemed kind of off-key in the sense that the advice seemed almost silly and superficial; to each his own.  But as we continued, the part that really became annoying was the readings are very repetitive.  It got to the point where we just read the Bible passages until we finished the book.  This book may be great for some people, but we needed more depth in the discussion."
"The use of the first person (Jesus speaking to me) is very effective at personalizing the messages, each of which is heavily drawn from/inspired by multiple scriptures. All of them focus on Jesus's constant presence in the life of the reader and what that means in terms of everyday living. A wonderful help.I just had this book sent as a gift to a friend. I, however, switched to the Kindle edition. The author cites relevant scripture references after each selection, but in the Kindle version she includes the actual verses so I don't have to look them up. They are reminders that she is writing not her own opinions but the actual messages from the Bible, written as Christ's own thoughts and words. Very powerful!"
Amazing book!
"I finished reading the bible in one year, and I wanted something to be my daily devotional.  These are the first pages I read, before my bible study.  I don't care whether or not it's true that these are truly the words of Jesus. By that, I find each devotional is so positive and encouraging.  I love the few scriptures at the end of each daily devotional-- many I dive deeper into.  I'm really enjoying this book and it would make a great gift to someone who is seeking a deeper relationship with Christ."
"I bought this as a gift for my sister but I also have one, myself. I love that there is a short, simple devotion for every day of the year! I feel that this helps set a structure for me, though I can read more if I choose to do so. It's truly amazing how some of the scriptures I choose to read on specific days just so happen to speak to something I am truly going through or provide a relatable message that I've been needing to hear.  Though an experience like this is not guaranteed for every day, every devotion, or even every person, you may just be surprised by the ability it has to speak to what you may be going through from time to time."
"I absolutely LOVE this book! The author definitely had an anointing when authoring it. I feel uplifted and encouraged every time I read it. It's changed my life for the better. I take away something new and inspiring each day/year that I read it. You can literally READ it every day for the rest of your life b/c the messages and scriptures attached at the bottom are omnipotentI've bought several copies to give as gifts to others. And there's a Spanish version tooI'm 100% sure the 1-star reviews are being deceived by the enemy. There's no other way to explain their disgruntlement, criticism and trying to confuse others. That's a sure sign of the enemyI will mention that you definitely need to READ THE INTRODUCTION. The author explains how and why she wrote the book the way she did ‚ù§Good bless her work!!üôè"
"I bought the Kindle version as well.  It is different than the print version in that it has one of the scripture verses written out, but the print version (Oct 2004) has no verses written out."
"I love this little book, recommended by a friend. The daily reflection is short and to the point, with bible references for further reflection. I read it in the morning, keep the main thought uppermost in my mind throughout my day, then re-read it at bedtime.  It's been a great anti-anxiety ""medicine"" for coping during Covid, reminding me to trust in God's love and His plan for my life. I honestly feel it has enhanced my relationship with Jesus."
"This is the best written book to grow your faith on a daily basis.  Within a year, your faith will be transformed and your life changed for the better showing you how to walk in love.  I was given this book by my Christian counselor and still enjoy reading it some fifteen years later.  I‚Äôve lost count of how many people I have gifted it to, but all unanimously love it.  I highly recommend this book."
"This Book is AMAZING!!  My Husband and I begin each day by reading the Devotion for the day and we‚Äôve been doing this for many years.  Amazing the way Susan Young has written this Book or should I say the way God uses this Book to speak to you directly and how it applies to your situation.  I also have given Jesus Calling to Co-Workers, my Boss, and Gym acquaintances as Gifts.  YOU WILL.NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!"
"I like this book but then daily devotionals feel repetitive. I kind of thought with 365 days of devotionals, you‚Äôd have plenty of room to talk about various issues. But with this book, every devotional pretty much has the same theme of ‚Äúgive Your problems to God, listen to God, lean on God, trust God.‚Äù This is great advice, of course, but too repetitive. I guess I was anticipating having devotionals pertaining towards dealing with specific issues such as anxiety, loss, temptations, loving others, sharing the gospel with others, dealing with family issues, etc."
"This is a simple, beautiful daily devotional. I was introduced to it years ago after being saved. It is a part of my daily routine, as is My Utmost for His Highest and Streams in the Desert (Morning and Evening). I am not sure I would put it on par with the two aforementioned, but it is a tender way to hear Jesus. I‚Äôve shared it as a gift several times. It may speak to new believers, as it did to me."
What do I like - 1. Jesus talking to me personally with encouraging words that are supported by scripture selections from the Holy Bible.  2.Organized well.  It's easy to read every day by date of the day. 3. It is a wonderful gift to family and friends. Now we all pray together every day. 4. Every day I learn more and feel more loved by the Creator of The Universe. This list is just the beginning of a long book.  I have it on Kindle on my phone so it is easy to access anywhere - anytime. What do I dislike - Grieving the sudden loss of my son.  This book brings me into that reality everyday - the reality of our humanness.
"After finding lots of ""perfect-moment"" devotions in the e-book version of this book for myself, I decided to purchase a copy for a co-worker that seemed to be going through a series of tough mental, physical, and emotional setbacks.  So far, he has really seemed to enjoy the book. He has shown so much gratitude for this book and says that he reads the daily devotion each morning now to start his day on a positive note.  The devotions are short and sweet, so that they offer a good message in a compact version, and Bible verses are included to compliment the message.  I have found in my personal readings that somehow, the day that I most need the devotions are the days that the message is exactly what I need to read.The book itself is hardback and has a very sturdy cover.  The pages are easy to read and the quality of the book will help it hold up over a long time.  I would recommend this either for personal use or as a gift to someone else who may need an extra dose of inspiration."
"I purchased my 1st Jesus Calling book in 2013 at Amazon. Oh my! How it did ever impact my my entire life. I would however, warn all not to put this devotional book, ahead of Jesus Christ and His Word, the Bible, to do so would be most dangerous.  Commandment #1.Thou shalt Not Have Any Other God's before Me! This little treasure will take you into the deeper things of God. If you want a closer relationship with our Father God,next to the Bible being number one, this one ranks #2. Two. By the way, I'm an ordained minister. God bless!"
This devotional is written in first person as if Jesus is talking to me.  The author paraphrases from scripture and provides the scripture references that I can read when I choose to do so.  The devotional is uplifting and reminds me of how relevance of the bible no matter what is happening in life.  I have had this same devotional for a number of years now and it never gets old.  I keep purchasing more as gifts:  the most recent ones as graduation gifts.
"What an absolutely amazing book! A cancer survivor friend gifted me with this book when I was diagnosed and getting ready to start treatment. Shortly afterwards out of the blue, ""Jesus Calling"" was recommended by 3 other people. With so much confirmation, I paid attention! I'm not a big fan of devotionals. My friend who gifted me the book said she wasn't either, yet was on her third year of working with ""Jesus Calling."" That impressed me. She bought me the large format with the leather-like cover. The paper quality isn't as nice in the large format. The quality probably went into the cover, rather than the pages. The smaller edition has nicer pages I think. I ended up buying the smaller edition too, so I could carry it around for my use and to show others the caliber of the writing. One other difference between the large and small editions -- the large format has the bible passages included on the page. In the smaller edition, you have to be diligent in looking up the bible passages referred to, where they are not included, if you want to fully receive the best of the day's devotion. For me, when I'm stressed, I like everything in one place. Both large and small editions contain a sewn-in ribbon to mark the page. I started an index of special pages that I can return to favorite passages or pages as needed. This book is a private devotional. As such, I can make of it what I read. If it doesn't absolutely comport with church or bible teaching, I know the difference. The benefits of ""Jesus Calling"" far outweighs rigid fundamentalism. If you're in need of a deeper relationship with Jesus, or you need comfort, solace and healing, and especially the reminder that there are things much bigger than your challenge du jour, definitely check out ""Jesus Calling."""
I have the original book but needed larger print because of failing eye sight. This book is smaller inn size almost half the size of the original with print that could not in any way be considered large. This is the 3rd time I've ordered large print books from Amazon and received only disappointment. I love this devotional so instead of returning it I will gift it. WARNING IF YOU NEED LARGE PRINT THIS IS NOT FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!
"I reread this book every year.  Since the author wrote this devotional in the 1st person, I often feel like Jesus is speaking to me, personally.  I like how she gives scriptures that backup the words in her daily devotions.  I would recommend this book to Everyone (Even as a gift to an unbeliever, who is struggling and needs to find comfort). For the Christian, this book is great in addition to daily bible reading; however, it is not meant to take the place of it.  I pray that all who read this devotional will be greatly blessed and will find a more personal relationship with the Lord."
I absolutely love this devotional!! I feel so inspired and refreshed each time I finish my reading for the day. Almost everyday I‚Äôm underlining things or highlighting things or/ and writing notes from it in my Bible. I adore how Sarah Young wrote it as if Jesus is speaking DIRECTLY to you. I feel my spirit lift when I read the words that Jesus tells us (as found in the Bible) in order to encourage us. Can‚Äôt wait to see all that I learn through this lovely devotional! This is my favorite devotional to date!
"I came here to order a copy of this book for a grieving friend. What a surprise to me to find that there are actually people who are offended by it. I have been so blessed by this book. As I found myself in a place of anxiety, uncertainty and distress, I chose this book because of its title: Jesus Calling: Finding Peace in His Presence. Written as if Jesus is speaking in first person, the book bothers some. Please read the forward. This sweet, humble woman wrote in her journal the things that she felt God was speaking to her heart during her prayer time. She is sharing that journal with us. She is not claiming to be a prophet, nor making the claim that this is anything other than what she says: her journal‚Ä¶not a substitute for the Word, nor an addition to the Word, and certainly not divinely inspired. I have found these entries to be comforting at a time when I needed that comfort and reassurance. I am not relying on this as my spiritual ‚Äúfood‚Äù. I read the Word daily for that. But as I read each entry, it helps me focus on the One Who is my Peace; it encourages me to have my own conversations with my Prince of Peace, and to listen for the voice of my Shepherd, who said ‚ÄúMy sheep know my voice‚Äù. This is something we Christians call ‚ÄúPrayer‚Äù (usually, considered by most a good thing.) This book is indeed helping me ‚Äúfind peace in His Presence‚Äù. It‚Äôs not the book that gives peace, nor her specific words, but truly trusting in God and resting in His sweet Presence, something this book has encouraged me to do."
"Sarah Young's book, Jesus Calling has received both positive and negative reviews.  I for one, feel it isthe perfect book for anyone at any level.  She has written the book as if Jesus is speaking to the reader.I have purchased many copies to give as gifts and use many of the devotional pages for scripture referencewhen working with people seeking help with specific issues.  I have a copy with me at all times."
"I thought all daily devotionals were basically the same: dry, covering the same old material in the same old way.  This one is very different.  It may be the same old material (God and the Bible do not change, after all) but presented as if Jesus is speaking to me every day.  New ideas, and new ways of looking at my relationship with Jesus, come at me every day.  I wish I'd found this devotional sooner."
"Someone close to me gave me this book at a particularly low time in my life. I struggled reading it sometimes wondering if anyone was listening. Soon, I began to start my day by placing a hand on the book and praying to God for the areas in my life I needed guidance and strength and then I'd randomly open to any page. Before long, I felt like the book was speaking to me. I grew up Catholic and struggle a little bit with the way Sarah Young, for lack of a better word, ""paraphrases Gods word"" but the end result was still the same....a positive, loving, reassuring relationship with God. It guess it doesn't really matter what road you take, as long as you reach your spiritual destination, right?"
"As the author shares with her what she heard Jesus say to her, so you too, feel that He might be saying the same to you. I've been a Christian for decades, and this devotional came at just the right time when I wanted a woman's point of view in my desire to have a warmer, sweeter relationship with my Lord. It takes a little while to adjust to the first person, but when you understand that she is sharing what she heard Him say to her, then you ""get it."" It's a wonderful discovery."
A friend recommended this book for my son. We have many of the children‚Äôs versions and also many devotional books in general but this one seems to have all the right answers. If you a have a problem with something it is likely you can find a study in here useful to your situation. Had the book a couple of months for my sons use then was recommended to me for myself by a completely separate friend. Applies to any age.
"Someone gave me this book years ago when I was going through a crisis. The daily messages gave me such hope and peace that I started to give them to others.  The response was always the same. No matter who was reading the messages, they felt like they had been written just for them at that particular time.  I have since given probably 100 away. I keep several in my car and share with anyone in need of encouragement or hope. A GREAT GIFT!"
"This is such an amazing and enriching devotional! One of my favorite IG influencers would post this to her stories daily and when I inboxed her to ask which book was it  she sent Me the link and it has blessed my life ever sense. Its written as if Yeshua, Himself carefully took the time to write you a love letter each morning. Its so thought provoking and filled with so much love, you will feel as if you are in His presence. I love this devotional and may put it in my homegirls Christmas stocking this year to bless them too!"
"This was such an encouraging, quick, easy devotional. So relevant and hopeful. I'll keep rereading it every year. This was so helpful and exactly what I needed to hear many times. Every Christian should own and read this book."
I've been using this wonderful book for years.  At first I used the printed book. Most recently I used it on an iPhone with an app I bought from the Apple store. Recently I switched to an Android phone so I purchased the book again for the Kindle App. I could not believe my eyes when I used it for the first time -- the scripture texts at the end of each day's devotion are not shown. The chapter and verse is listed but the text itself is not shown.  This is not the case with the printed book or the Apple store version.This significantly reduces the quality of experience.  Disappointing!
"This little book is a blessing. I feel that Jesus is truly calling me, offering encouragement and sometimes even pointing to areas in my life that need attention that may be keeping me away from Him and a peaceful life. I get goosebumps when reading some of the pages as they seem to address situations that happened to me on precisely those days! Buy it. You won't be disappointed. I plan to buy a few more to give out as Christmas gifts."
You couldn‚Äôt have a better book to help you navigate through this world and God. This book has been my go to book for the last five years! It‚Äôs fabulous and will help you very much! I can‚Äôt explain how much strength and calmness I have received from each page - one page a day. Written in English come to so we can understand it better get that you can look up the books in the Bible by the references at the bottom of each page!
"I love this devotional and have purchased several copies as gifts for others. Many of the devotional messages seem to speak directly to me, the only thing missing is my name! Thank you Sarah Young for your inspiration!"
A friend told me about this book years ago & I've been reading it ever since. I've even bought it for others. Its a good way to quickly get The Word into your Spirit every day. This book has been such a blessing in my life. It gives me exactly what I need to hear when I need to hear it. A good investment for your spiritual growth!
"I'm a caregiver for my mother.  This job is lonely and stressful.  Anyone who is a caregiver will tell you that they are at times overwhelmed.  I've found enormous comfort in this little book and most highly recommend it for those who are going through a hard time.  Some of the unkind reviews here have made an observation that the book fails to give chastisement over sin.  You know, I haven't seen that at all.  Instead I see the chastisement for sin is there, but presented with the overwhelming love of God just as someone would do for a cherished family member or friend who they see is in overwhelming circumstances.  Caregivers deal with a daily dose of false responsibility and guilt always hanging over our shoulders.  We aren't in need of heavy handed chastisement for sin right now.  Instead we are in desperate need of encouragement and support and that is offered here.  More than once my breath has almost been taken away by the words when I flipped open this little book.  You know, it was things God was already trying to whisper to me, but the stress had been drowning them out.  And I am enormously thankful a friend steered me toward this devotional.  And that is what it is.....a devotional....it is not presented as THE SACRED WORD of God on equal footing with the scriptures.  And anyone who would take it as such most likely would also make the mistake of taking every word that drops from a pastor/teacher/authors words as being straight from God's lips.  That's not the fault of the pastor/teacher/author!  It is not one bit different than any Christian song that has been written as if God were speaking the words to His children.  God does still speak today individually to His children in numerous ways through the ministry of the Holy Spirit.  And I am being blessed through this little tool that is helping me experience and KNOW God's nearness."
The Jesus Calling devotionals are so very unique in a category that is deluged. There are just SO very many great devotionals to choose from! I just love these because the viewpoint they are written from is as if Jesus is speaking directly to you ‚ù§Ô∏èI have purchased many of these as gifts because they truly enrich my life every day. You will not regret this devotional üôèüèº
"Absolutely the best book of Christian non fiction. The text is the easiest to read out of the 10 or 20 versions I have tried. That is what makes this publication so good, in my opinion.Very destressing and a comfort. Start with this in her collection first. I do not read the ""daily devotionals"" scattered throughout so I cannot speak to them. It is the font, size and color of the ink and paper that very good."
Buy this book. Very few other books have taught me about God as much as this one. This devotional is short yet powerful. Currently using one of its messages as my Lock Screen. Can‚Äôt overstate how great this book is.
"This book of 365 devotions is one of the most popular devotional books ever written.  While it has been around for more than a decade, those who haven't yet discovered it will find it always new and inspiring.  Shortly after I suffered a significant loss in my life, I was given this book.  In its pages I found an enormous amount of peace and comfort.  It was a major factor in the healing of my broken heart.  I cannot recommend anything more highly for those with Christian beliefs.This book had so much for me that I read it for three years before I felt ready to move on.  Jesus Calling also contributed to a significant deepening of my faith, which led me to a very positive recovery from my grief.Throughout this small book, Ms. Young suggests that we place our trust in God to meet our needs today and in the future.  This message provided in so many ways can't fail to sink into the subconscious where it becomes a way of life that brings the reader into a peaceful space amid the chaos of mourning.Since I have discovered this book, it is the first thing I give to friends when they experience a loss.By Paul McCright, Author of ""Heaven Talks"""
Great gift for someone dealing with heartache. I got a smaller one as a gift and loved  the positive messages while I had months of chemotherapy. Ordered this one for a friend who lost her son to a Drunk driver. She was so grateful to receive this book. The color is great. Plan on ordering more to have on hand for gifts. Would make a great graduation gift as well.
"Sarah Young's ""Jesus Calling"" is a transformative daily reminder of Jesus' presence. It is the most encouraging on-going tangible influence in my life beyond the Bible and Spirit of God Himself. Perhaps that's because the Word and the Spirit permeate its pages.Many of us in this generation struggle to feel the love that God has for us. We confess that He is ""for us"" (there is, after all, that Bible verse in Romans). God did ""so love the world"", after all (John 3). But how can He, of all who know me, delight in me, given the disloyal choices He knows I make to varying degrees every day? And without a sense of His acceptance, I ultimately do not trust or feel safe to act, and the cycle repeats itself. Even Jesus needed to minister out of a sense of being God's Beloved.Sarah Young's meditations are rooted in the peace that comes from enjoying God's Presence. These daily reminders during a season of repudiation trained my heart to accept and embrace that even I could be loved, sparing me from despair. The measure of freedom I have gained to love God and love people is largely the product of this little book's daily training in God's comforting embrace.When you operate with the assurance that God delights in your closeness, rather than questioning whether He can tolerate you today, the peace that passes understanding becomes available to others as you walk His Presence into your world."
"When I read Jesus Calling (I try to daily) it is like God is having a personal conversation with me, letting me know or affirming He gets me and the reading for the day puts me in a mood to handle whatever comes my way. Even when I miss days of reading, I feel guilty and when I read the message for the day, God let's me know it's ok, to just remember to walk closely with him and trust whatever it is I am going through good or bad, He wants to know about it all and he is there for me. In fact he already knows what we go through, he just loves it when we bring everything to him. Need that extra boost of confidence that living a Christ life is best, read Jesus Calling daily. I am going to start it again for my 3rd year. 1.1.19. Be blessed and if your reading this review, God does want us to bring everything to him and trust he will show you how to work through it all. You just have to open your heart to God, he'll do the rest."
"I purchased this book for my niece who is completing a registered nurse degree and will graduate this May, my family and I are so very proud of her.  She and I are Believers in Jesus Christ and I wanted her to know how special the book is and how it outlines each Gregorian calendar day.  It is so on point and relates to our Spirits.  We are both encouraged by Sarah Young's ""Jesus Calling, Enjoying Peace in His Presence."" I would recommend this book for anyone and everyone that needs encouragement in this troublesome life journey at times, we do not have to go it alone, Jesus is always present with us through every trial, every victory!  It was given to me as a gift 5 years ago, I still read it daily and it seems to parallel to what I may be feeling or going through on that particular date day even now 5 years later.  This book keeps me strengthened and encouraged to keep pressing on.  I now witness the fruits of my niece's hard work, her character, her beauty both inside and out.  We are both fortunate and blessed to have this book at our hands and in our hearts.  Thank you JESUS for empowering Sarah Young to write this book and share with the world!!"
"Such a beautiful devotional.My favorite color of course and so soft.I am in love with this.The size is perfect enough to carry in my purse with me everywhere.Update: So amazing!!!!!! I cant believe how this book has helped me everyday.Of course my bible is always first!!!! For people complaining about there aren‚Äôt any scriptures there that they need to look them up,stop being lazy and actually open your bible!!!! Get to know Jesus üòä"
"This is the perfect little inspirational book for anyone who believes, or even for someone who doesn't and is curious about what Jesus was telling us in the Bible.  It's just what I needed as the author interprets passages into real-life, practical language that can be applied to one's life immediately, each and every day.  It's THE perfect way to start your day!"
"Summer, here in the Northern Hemisphere, is often a time for more casual reading--but I've discovered that others use the slower pace as a springboard for investing more concentrated time on their spiritual disciplines. Others use the change of pace to make modest or even dramatic changes in how they hear from God.Back in 2007, I reviewed John Ortberg's book,¬†

  
The Life You've Always Wanted: Spiritual Disciplines for Ordinary People (Expanded and Adapted for Small Groups)









  
  
    
  . He wrote that ""following Jesus simply means learning from him how to arrange my life around activities that enable me to live in the fruit of the Spirit.""  He added, ""The traditional term for such activities is `spiritual disciplines.' But for many people, that term carries associations of legalism, or attempting to earn God's goodwill, or something like New Year's resolutions--good intentions that are neither practical nor world-changing.""In the footsteps of Richard Foster (Celebration of Discipline) and Dallas Willard (The Spirit of the Disciplines), Ortberg wrote this gem in 1998.  His humor and his plain-spoken practical theology shine through and it remains one of my favorite books. (He joked about calling it ""Dallas for Dummies."")Read the third chapter for his core message, ""There is an immense difference between training to do something and trying to do something.""  He adds, ""Spiritual transformation is not a matter of trying harder, but of training wisely.""  Example: A New Year's resolution to pray more every day may accomplish little if it doesn't lead to being a more God-honoring person.He warns do-gooders that God is not impressed with the activity of training.  ""Spiritual disciplines are to life what calisthenics are to a game. Once the game starts, basketball players get no bonus points based on how many free throws they shot in practice.  The only reason to practice them is to be able to make them in a game.""As you prepare to inspire your team for the rest of this year, help them focus on results not activity.  As you pray and practice spiritual disciplines this summer, remember that those activities are not ways to get extra credit from God.  If you're not becoming more loving, you're wasting your practice time.You have your favorite spiritual tools and I have mine. My favorite daily devotional is ""

  
A Diary of Private Prayer









  
  
    
  ,"" John Baillie's devotional classic with 31 morning prayers and 31 evening prayers. This past year, a client recommended a new tool: ""Jesus Calling: Enjoying Peace in His Presence,"" by Sarah Young.""Jesus Calling"" is remarkable. In the first 10 pages, Missionary Sarah Young describes her journaling journey and how she began to experience the Presence of God. (Don't skip this.) The 365-day format features two to three paragraphs per day--Jesus talking to me--followed by several Scripture references.Here's an excerpt from August 6: ""When things seem to be going all wrong, stop and affirm your trust in Me. Calmly bring these matters to Me, and leave them in My capable hands. Then, simply do the next thing.""Reminder: you may already have an abundance of helpful spiritual tools. If you're ready for a change of pace, ""Jesus Calling"" is a stunning option. But it's not the practice of the spiritual discipline that matters--it's the living it out. Am I becoming more like Jesus?Jesus is calling. Answer the phone!"
"There is no doubt in my mind that God has used this book to draw me closer to him, to open my eyes to his faithfulness, and to remind me of his great love for me, no matter what life may bring."
Reading Gods word is always amazing.  Starting my devotions with this first helps me to remember to truly personalize His word.  To remember the reality and personal emphasis of Gods words and history to man kind.  I can easily get caught up in 'its history' and forget to personalize it for me today.  But this brings a helpful reminder to the truly personal relationship God intended to have with us.
"I was given this book by a friend several years ago after my beloved husband died & I really didn't want to go on. The daily readings resonated right away & helped me realize God was with me & would help me to keep going on. The readings weren't standard Bible Speak. They were like having a nice short pep talk with your best friend...and essentially He's your total best friend!!  Paying it forward, I've bought many copies over the years for friends who were going through difficult situations. All have found much solace in the beautiful daily readings. A perfect way to start the day."
"I have started my day reading Jesus Calling for many years .  It is a source of spiritual encouragement and helps to direct my thoughts on a way that keeps.me centered.on the.path of discipleship.  It has been an important.part of my daily commitment to grow closer in.my relationship with Jesus.  It strengthens my awareness of the presence of the Holy Spirit living within me.  Even having read this.book in its entirety more than dozen times, I find it always seems to speak directly to me about my challenge of that day.  I also read a set of Scritural passages that allow me to read the Bible in its entirety each year.  This.practice of reading Jesus Calling and the Bible every day has been a source.oh great blessing for.me"
This is a great Bible study. I bought two so a friend and I can read and discuss what we have read. And sometimes one needs to be accountable to someone else so we don't neglect the study so we can grow closer to God.
I love this devotional!  It has been a wonderful source of comfort in difficult times.  It includes Bible scriptures so you can see where the devotional message is drawn from.  I gave away each of my first two copies to others who benefitted from it and got the 3rd on kindle.
"This small devotional book takes you through an entire year with short thoughts, written as though from Jesus to you. There are Scriptures for you to read along with each day as well. it is beautifully bound and soft and pretty! I love it, bought it for myself, but it would make a lovely gift."
"This book is a very meaningful part of my morning devotional.  I love that the author is able to convey her thoughts as to what Jesus would say to me each day.  I believe God touched Sarah Young in an incredible way, to allow her to share with me what she feels He would have to say each day.  I was particularly touched when I read the devotional on my birthday and it was the absolute wake-up call I needed."
"I have purchased theses for all my friends after getting one for myself long ago. It is the best devotional I‚Äôve ever had! It is beautifully written, easy to read and so life applicable! Seems to speak to my situation almost every day! Definitely would recommend to absolutely everyone! It‚Äôs my favorite gift to give everyone!!"
This devotional book is excellent.  Jesus speaks to you everyday through the words of Sara Young.  It is amazing how relevant it is for each day.  I would highly recommend it.
"This little book has changed my life.  Each day is written as if it applies to my specific situation at that time.  I read it everyday and it has been so uplifting and helpful.  I'm a Christian but I don't like the messaging shoved in my face, if you know what I mean.  This is a gentle, loving guide with thought-provoking messages that truly ease you through your day.  I love it."
This is almost an icon for Christian reading. Many many times it it spot on for what I‚Äôm going through that day and is so lifting. Fabulous book and fabulous service.  It arrived within a couple of days.  I believe it was listed as ‚Äúgood‚Äù condition but it very well could have been sold as ‚Äúnew‚Äù.  I am very impressed.
"Sarah Young has written a devotional book that's not like any other devotional book I have ever used or tried to use in my entire lifetime.  It is as though the loving Heavenly Father,  God Himself,  sat down with Sarah and said, "" Write this for Me today.  This is what _______  (fill in your name here) needs to hear from Me today.""  During 10 months of chemo and a stem cell transplant and recovery time for a blood cancer,  the daily readings in this book brought me a sustaining comfort and encouragement from God that truly ""passed all understanding .""  Each page gives two or three Bible quotations that support the wording in the daily writing.  It was unreal how each day's reading spoke directly to my specific concern or need for that day.  It has even hit  specific needs of several other people who had their own prayer requests for  certain days when I shared the daily writing with them.  . I have bought several copies of the book and given to others who have been blessed and touched in similar ways.  It is truly an amazing  unique approach to a daily devotional book in the form of short encouraging notes from God."
I just wrapped up reading this devotional for the third year in a row.  I love how it is written as if Jesus is talking to me personally.  It is very comforting.  Every day has a timely and relevant message that I can apply to current and future circumstances.  The accompanying bible verses reinforce the timeless relevance of God's Word.  This devotional is perfect for anyone interested in developing and strengthening their relationship with Jesus.
"A friend of mine mentioned this book to me when I was going through a terrible situation at work. I was at my wits end and I didn't want to continue working there. Although, I didn't have a choice because I need to work in order to survive. I started reading this book even though I was so depressed and I doubted it would bring me out of my brooding.  But Jesus Calling is just what Jesus ordered for me. It's so amazing because everyday I read it it was/is exactly what I needed/need. Everyday, it still blows my mind how each reading is exactly what I need. I bought this book for my son and I have recommended it to many of my family members. I've bought it 3 times. One on kindle and two books. This book along with my study Bible is all I need to stay in the presence of God, His Son and the Holy Spirit. Thank you Ms. Sarah Young, Thank You God for blessing us through Ms. Young with this mighty book filled with Your presence."
"I've used this daily devotional for a  year, and now I'm  planning to  use it for a second year. Each daily devotion is sweet, encouraging, and short.  Each  devotion is accompanied by several relevant Scripture verses.  Last year was a rough year in many respects, but this encouraging book really spoke to my circumstances in a way that built up my Christian walk."
I received one of their book after my husband passed a few months ago. It was so very helpful for me going though the grief process. I think anyone who is going though troubled times would benefit from the message that it gives you each day. I have ordered some to have on hand to be able to pass to others. it has helped me immensely.
"I am starting my third or fourth year going through this wonderful little book. It continues to remind me of all the blessings the Lord keeps giving. I haven't felt it necessary to get the next version or whatever else is available because in a year I don't remember the previous reading and there are new blessings all the time. I think Sarah Young has been anointed writer, and her heart is right with God as she writes, so it keeps on blessing me."
"I use biblegateway website to pull up the suggested verses to fully enjoy the devotion. I have been able to grow deeper in love with Jesus through this book. This is excellent because of its length, depth and focus. It does not focus on your character or YOUR journey as much as it focuses on bringing you closer to GOD. Love God and then the fruit (forgiveness, community,..) pops out like on any other fruit tree. HIS love in you is peace, strength, purpose, energy, wisdom and direction.  I am going through it a 2nd year. Her word pictures are great. What a great investment under $10.00!! This book is life changing because it helps you to be personal with HIM and that is LIFE changing. Shame on the reverent who wrote against this book, was John from the New Testament ever criticized for not writing like the weeping prophet Jeremiah? Or not including the writings of Mathew? Has this reverent forgotten Luke 9:50 (whoever is not against you is for you)? I encourage you to buy this book. When I check out reviews I look at the % of 5stars to 1 stars, that will tell you something. Finally, Remember John 21:22 we are not to worry about what others may do YOU must follow HIM."
This devotional is rich in thought and guidance.  It touches the soul on days when it may seem like all else is failing.  It‚Äôs just the right size booklet to carry in a pocketbook to take out when there is time to spend with The LORD and His Word.  Highly recommend purchasing one or more to share.  Great gift!
My husband has this book and i found myself reading it. Then I decided to get my own copy. I actually own it in book form and kindle. I have the larger book with the full scriptures in it plus it allows me space to write if I so desire. The kindle version allows me to take it when I travel without bringing a book. I love it because it really speaks to me each day. I'm always awed by how God speaks to what I need in that very moment. I plan to give as gifts in my ministry.
"My oldest and dearest friend purchased this book for me a few years ago when I was going through a particularly trying time in my life.  It has saved me from ""going crazy"" at times, kind of like hanging onto a life preserver.  I have purchased two of these books for friends who were also going through tough times.  This book is amazing.  Thank you for having written it."
"This devotional is the best I've ever read. It is so inspiring, uplifting and truly delivers the words of Christ in a beautiful, comprehensive way. I highly recommend this to those who are early in their walks with Christ, as well as to seasoned Christians. This makes a wonderful gift -- and everyone I've given it to has said the same thing upon buying it for others themselves. Everyone should have this book and receive the glorious words that Sarah Young so humbly and beautifully expresses with each day's entry. I look forward to reading this every day, and unlike most other devotionals I own, I actually do read it every day -- and have done so year after year upon receiving it 3 years ago. This is truly the gift that keeps giving and is the perfect pillar of inspiration for any situation. Buy this for everyone you know!!! It has changed lives and will continue to do so for years to come. I recommend this book highly!!!"
"I know this is a very popular book and it came highly recommended to me, but I simply could not get past the fact that the author wrote as though she were God. If this is not a problem for you, then you might enjoy it. I read it for a couple of days thinking I could get used to it, but I just cannot justify a person thinking that they are capable of speaking for God."
"I wonder if Sarah Young has any idea how many hearts she has touched and helped direct in a positive way with this book. There is no better inspiration to start and end your day. If you are searching for a way to develop a deeper relationship with God, this is the book for you. Written as if Jesus is speaking directly to the reader in first person, the daily readings are positive, love-based affirmations of God's continuous presence in our daily lives. An incredible assist in building a closer personal relationship with God. can't recommend this highly enough."
This small devotional book is written from the aspect of Jesus talking to you. It is all scripture based but retold as if Jesus is speaking. I like it because it personalizes some passages and brings out nuances that I may have missed (or ignored...). The devotions are very short but some of them have stuck with me all day.
"I bought this book many times to send to people as a gift.  Yes, it is written as though God is speaking to you in His voice and honestly that is what I love so much about it.  I have read those who criticized using this kind of narrative.  So I did my research on the author.  Her heart is in the right place, and I am so thankful God has given her the gift of writing.  So bottom line, you will be blessed when you read these devotions."
"This is a daily devotional book written as if Jesus is talking to you.  All I can say is that it is right on with everything that I am going through every day since I got it.  Almost too specifically, but isn't that what we would want from God.  It is as if God is talking to you about what you are going through today.  It provides daily Bible verses for additional reading and inspiration.  Just today I shared what today's devotion was to someone who just lost her sister. I explained how it was really talking to me and my situation.  She felt it speak to her, too.  I went to a local Hallmark store praying that there would be one copy there.  There was so I bought it to give to her.  I would have been willing to give mine up if it wasn't there since I also have the Kindle version that I bought after getting this book from my friend who had an extra copy.I bought another one today to send to my daughter.  It is a great book for yourself or to give as a gift!"
"I prayed before ordering, and pray before reading the daily devotional, I  ask ,Lord let me know  if  this word is from you, God is love I've been ready for almost a month now,  and each day reading it has been his loving comfort in the word,  scriptures that confirms are at the bottom of each pageGods loves us each time we are reminded of His love it is a very beautiful bless good thing! If ever anything contradicts his Love for us we know its not of him, Im being bless to include this beautiful writings  a reminder  of his word during my time with Him,"
"There are not enough words to describe the wealth of help, comfort, wisdom, peace, and strength that is available in this small but powerful devotional.  She wrote it as Christ is speaking directly to you.  At the bottom is the references of the scriptures that she used and I always look those up to.  I keep a journal and it is amazing, even after years of using this, just how much of what is said is truly relevant to what I am experiencing that day.  I love it so I have gifted it to many people.The meaning of scripture is not changed at all.  Sarah has only rearranged it so that it is a conversation between yourself and Jesus."
"Love this book of Sarah's transcribed meditations on what she hears Jesus speaking to her within the depths of her heart. I try to read these words every day, especially in the morning. They strengthen me and guide me. Today I was rushing to leave the house and realized I hadn't read any, so I just opened the book quickly as I was putting my shoes on. I read someting like, ""It's all right to be human"" and that blessings would come through the holes of my weakness. I was anxious because my bank account was almost empty, and I needed gas (just poor management on my part). I tried to buy some on my way to work but my card was declined. I ended up having to take a company vehicle to a meeting at the end of the date, and got back to work much later than I would normally be there. As I got out of the car, a coworker came up and asked me if I had jumper cables in my car. It was 15 degrees! I was able to help him jump his car. By that time I had deposited my paycheck and was able to get my car, drive to the station, and fill up my tank! I was so glad I was able to be a blessing to him. And I was thinking the whole time - this is what Jesus has done with my poor money management! Turned it into a blessing!"
Amazing book written in a relatable way. Almost like God is speaking to you. Some people have an issue with that but I dont think the author is actually trying to be God.
"""Jesus Calling"" is a devotional gift book containing 365 devotions written from Jesus' point of view. Though each daily message is short, they are consistently relevant and personal for people of all ages and from all walks of life. Each page contains the very promises and blessings found Jesus.From the day I opened Jesus Calling, I have enjoyed it. I  have it on my nightstand, and every morning, I begin my day by reading about the blessings God has for me. Sarah Young did an amazing job in writing each devotional; it truly feels as if God is speaking to me through each page. I honestly can't think of anyone this devotional wouldn't be perfect for! The devotions are short enough to be read in just a few spare minutes, but are powerful enough that they stay on your mind throughout the day.I can't say enough about how much it has blessed me in the short time I have been reading it. If you are looking for a way to make the scriptural promises of the Bible more personal, this book is perfect for you."
Awesome daily devotional book! I was given my original one as a kind gift from a dear  couple who are close friends! I have others from years ago which I like but the very personal daily message is so inspiring ! Of course I went to Amazon and bought three ti give as gifts to ‚ÄòPass it on‚Äù great life changing gift!
"Now I know the reason why this book is well loved by many. Some people hate it that the book is in first person and seems to put words in God's mouth. Maybe this book is not for them that they are already in a certain level of their walk with God that this not what they are looking for or not what they need. But in my personal experience, I like the format because Jesus is personal. If the verses are not enough, you can always read the Bible. I have ESV Study Bible and go back to it for deeper understanding of the context. Overall, I like that it is personal, inspiring, easily understood and makes me feel Jesus' love enough for me to carry on through the day. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I have re-read this book at least 4 years in a row now. Each day, there is fresh anointing on the words even though my circumstances change. With new years of reading come perspective on the years prior and how God walked with me through them. I absolutely believe Sara Young was divinely inspired to write each line as they drip with Holy Spirit purpose."
"This is an exceptional daily devotional.  While I am a Christian and a woman of Faith, I am not great at recalling the vast amount of lessons in the Bible.  The beauty about this wonderful little book is that it refers to a passage, one per day, and it deciphers the message of the scripture and how you could implement that message on that particular day.It is incredibly uplifting and such an easy and efficient way to put something right in your head and heart on the daily and that keeps your awareness alive...It is also suitable for people who are not necessarily religious or that follow other faiths outside of the belief in Jesus.  The daily readings and principles apply to anyone who believes in a higher power and seek spiritual guidance."
"I was prepared not to like JESUS CALLING by Sarah Young. I didn't trust the title. I felt that it might be a little soft or fluffy. I was wrong.JESUS CALLING reveals a hard-hitting, honest, approachable, in-your-face, let's-get-real Jesus who is constantly calling to us. The daily lessons are straight from the throne of grace. This is no soft-pedaled, watered-down, pat on the head. This book challenges believers at every turn to draw closer to God. It has spoken to me about some of the deepest issues of my heart and life.Towering above every daily reflection is the Lord Himself, gracious, kind, loving and powerful. The presence of anointing of the Spirit of God is unmistakable. The teaching from the Father is unequivocal. The embrace of savior and Lord, irresistable and irrefutable. An outstanding work along side Wigglesworth and Tozer from an author who knows the Lord."
Feels like God is talking to me through this book!! Many days it‚Äôs His word in the exact moment that I needed to hear it! Thank you!!
I really have a great story as to why I purchased this book. I am really trusting God to turn around a situation in my life. About a year ago a good friend of mind told me to purchase this book. She forgot to email me the name of this book and who it was by. One day she and I pass in the hallway and she remembered to send me the title. So I took awhile to look for it. This year another friend mind told me about his book. So I went back to my desk and looked it look to order it. I said to myself I should look up the title of the book my first told me about . So I did it turned out to be the same book and I knew God was trying to tell me something. This book allows me a personally relationship daily with God before my day starts. It is encouraging and let me know I am not alone. This is a must have. I just ordered another one because I want to have one at home and one at work. I can't take a chance on not read this book each and every morning. What a friend I have in Jesus. To God be the glory.It's a must have get connected.Love it
"I really love this book. Each day's passage offers encouraging words, written from the perspective of Jesus talking to you. The author, Sarah Young, provides biblical references related to each day's passage. She does also interject some of her own interpretations, which in my opinion help to make the passages relevant to our current time. Another thing I like about this is that the passages are just a paragraph or two. It's perfect for starting your busy day off because it allows you  some quiet time with Jesus, but is not overwhelming the way some study aids can be and so you're more likely to stick with it than you might otherwise. If you want to do further reading, she provides passages on which the reading is based so you haave the option of taking your study to another level if you want. Another thing I like about this is that it is not arranged for a specific day of the week or year. The book begins at January 1st and ends with December 31st. That allows you to just pick up the book at any point in time and not have to ""catch up."" Plus you can reread it for years to come."
"Instead of starting your day watching any of the news channels and getting mad, why not start your day with a meditation about the real truth in life.  Has helped me walk a little more like how I should walk."
"I was given this little book as a Christmas gift.  Little did I know what a BIG affect this little book would have on my life.  I look forward to reading it every morning after pouring my first cup of coffee.  It has not only brought me into a closer relationship with Jesus, but had caused me to want to share his love and grace with others to whom I have given the little book.  I wish everyone would read it and feel the peace and calm it brings to one's daily life IF one truly takes it to heart.  I have a friend who has a very aggressive form of Lou Gehrig's disease, who also received it as a gift.  He has also received the same peace and calm from JESUS CALLING.  Not knowing how long he will be able to read, he reads up to twenty pages a day.  He rereads  the book over and over.  It has been his comfort throughout his trying days.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone - especially those who are depressed, ill, or those seeking a closer walk with The Lord. Each daily devotional is very short, but should be read slowly and in a quiet area.  I read each at least twice through to be certain I have totally comprehended what Jesus is telling me.  What a way to start the day!!!"
"I have been reading JESUS CALLING for some time.  I recently was diagnosed w/ a very very rare and dreadful disease.  This book has brought me such peace .. always at the 'right time,' w/ the right thought and the right Scripture.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book for anyone who is going through a difficult time.PS:  I look up each of the Scriptures listed at end and copy/paste them into a google doc so I can read through them as a whole at any time."
"I purchased this Kindle book, not realizing that I had already purchased the 'Pink Cover' edition, same book.Now, I realize that 'Buyer beware', but such monetizing tactics have little to do with the teachings of Jesus.I'm deleting both copies from my Kindle reader."
"My mom is 84 yrs old and a very devoted Catholic and very spiritual! She prayers all of the time for everyone! My daughter got her this book for Thanksgiving Day and she said it has changed her life! She lives by his word daily! I try to do the same bc she inspires me and if she can continue growing in Faith at 84 after losing 2 of my siblings, then I certainly want to continue to grow closer to him. This book helps us to do just that! I wouldn't live without it! My grandchildren even love the youth version of Jesus is Calling!"
"This whole series is WONDERFUL AND gives us HOPE.  We read Sarah Young's books every night.  Such a ""breath of fresh air"" and HOPE in this crazy busy world.  Her book ""JESUS ALWAYS"" is so inspiring to us as we get older.  So many times we have opened the book and read her ""thought for that day"" and it is AMAZING how accurate and calming this is for us.  THIS WOMAN IS AMAZING AND OBVIOUSLY INSPIRED.  You won't be sorry getting this wonderful book."
"I love, love , love this devotional book!!! It has became my daily guide to living a more spiritual life.  The daily inspiration and scriptures are very instrumental in helping me study GOD'S biblical instructions before leaving earth. ""THE BIBLE""!!!!! Sarah Young  you are amazing!!! Keep inspiring your readers and God bless you!!!!!"
"""Jesus Calling"" is one of the best morning devotional books I've ever found.  The readings are short, pertinent, and thought-provoking.  Each morning, I am eager to read the day's entry.  I keep a pen nearby, to underline significant messages that I feel I need.Most devotional books, I go through and then never touch again.  I know this is a book that I will keep and use year after year.  Such a huge blessing in a small book!"
"I know that God has many ways to communicate to us, and He is not limited in how He speaks to us. I am thankful to Sarah Young for being brave enough to write this book in the format she chose. I know this book found me! I picked it up in a book store and on the first page was one of my favorite scripture verses, ""For I know the plans I have for you,"" declares the Lord, ""plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."" Jeremiah 29:11.  Jesus Calling is part of my daily devotions. It has been a great encourager for me during a difficult marriage that ended in divorce, a cross country move, and having to learn to live as a single person in my 50's. This devotional is a personal reminder of God's investment in each one of our lives. It is filled with hope. Every day the message seems to be amazingly relevant in whatever life situation you are facing! I have given this book to many people, with the hope and prayer that it helps them as much as it has helped me!"
"My mother has had one of these books for years now and loves it. She bought me one for my birthday, and I have to say, I truly love this book. The daily readings are not too long but so powerful! It is a great way to start your day. I have since bought at least 10 more for friends and family, and acquaintances whom I feel would enjoy it. I was over my neighbors house a few months ago, and she had one! She also loves the book! I highly recommend this book to anyone. It is fantastic!"
"I have ordered several of these to gift.  I am on my 15th or so year of re-reading my copy of it!!  It is a wonderful daily devotional!  I call it my ""horoscope"" for the day, and read it every day to help me get through it.  Great insights from God's word and wonderfully written!!"
A must read for all.  It is well written and I started reading it when I was very depressed and at my wit's end.  This book will encourage you and it constantly reminds you not to worry and how you are never alone.  I really felt a lot of strength from reading it.
"Was given to me by my Cousin, as she was given one by our Aunt.Daily reading from Jesus with words of encouragement.LOVE THIS BOOK!It has helped me through some very dark days, as my Dad just passed.Thank you Cousin Kim for this wonderful book!I in turn got one for my mom!"
Nice devotional to start your daily Bible reading with. I say start as for the actual devotional there are just 3 or 4 verses. At first I thought it wasn't that great but after awhile I find I really like it. Please read each one several times on the day you;re doing it. Helps to get the message in. Think about what you're reading and what the Lord would have you to do. His ways are always the very best.
"This book, devotional, has opened up numerous hearts to the Lord Christ Jesus.  I awoke an hour after going to sleep one night thinking, I must order this book as a wedding gift for a beautiful young couple that joined their destinies together, on April 19th 2014, At the Towers in Narragansett, R.I.  The sun shown through, the mother of the Bride gave a beautiful Devotional to the Bride & Groom's life together, and this is a devotional that she reads every day.  This message gives hope to the hopeless, understanding, encouragement and love.  This book teaches you how to spend time with the Lord Jesus Christ.2014 is a year of miracles and growth.  This book shows you how to and why you should Believe.  This book changes lives, I am a witness to that.  Is Jesus calling you?  Are you putting him on hold?  Slow down!  Think about all of that growth that you can get out of the challenges that you face every day.  Jesus Calling for Kids is from their perspective.To sum it up:  Love it, read daily!  J"
A very New Age book clothed in Christian terminology. Someone is calling in this book but it is NOT Jesus.
"BUY THIS BOOK!  I start everyday with this book.  It orders my thoughts and action each day.  It is the most uplifting and supportive piece of spiritual literature that I've every had...and I have lots.  I love that it provides the scriptures that support the days inspiration.  I have given it as gifts and the feedback from each person I've given it to has been the same.  IT'S WONDERFUL!  Each day, the written word is specific to me...I think you will have the same experience if you purchase this book!  Simply said, IT IS BLESSING!!!  If I could give MORE THAN 5 STARS I would."
"This is one of those devotionals that you can read every year and find something new. No matter where you are in life, if you open your heart to Jesus, He will speak to you from these pages. Sarah, God bless you and your ministry and your commitment to help others see Jesus, our Savior, in a whole new personal way."
"Accessible is the first word that comes to mind. I am a Christian who goes through waves of more and less intensive prayer and ""practice"". During those very busy times in my life when I drift further from my prayer and regular practice, I will recognize the need to reconnect. I find reading helps me do this, and this book helped me quickly re-establish my connection to prayer and God's presence. It I offers brief and compelling interpretations of bible verses and the first person voice is particularly warming and personal. The writer makes it clear that she is offering her own take of bible passages as she hears them in her mind, so the reader must decide for themselves whether or not to interpret it as God's voice or simply a follower's voice. In either case (in my opinion), the book is a very good set of ways to apply the bible's lessons to our lives."
"I was first given a hard book as a gift. I enjoyed it but with the RA in my hands, I decided to by the Kindle version. II like that it is written in the first person, as if Jesus is giving me a little pep talk every morning. It is the first thi g I read."
"If you are seeking a deeper and more intimate relationship with our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, this book is one you should be reading regularly. The concerns of my heart are amazingly addressed each and every day as if Jesus Himself is leading me to a comforting knowledge of His Presence in my life."
"A great way to start your day. Takes about 15-30 minutes to do each reading, my husband and I do this together and discuss the devotional and verses, so it takes us a little longer. I look forward to our time to do this very light devotional and praying together"
This spiritually guided book is great for daily nutrition of your soul understandingWhat is your spiritual Holy Ghost needs for that day she is very insightful get a chance to look at the word in another light.... This book was given to me and I shared it with others who gets daily nutrition as well as well as I do
"This book is amazing!  It's not ""overly"" spiritual; if there is such a thing.  It's the perfect book to pick up in the morning ...to remind us that we need not worry or stress.......need to put our faith in whichever ""Higher Power"" we believe.  It lends itself to making me much more peaceful.  Perfect book for senior citizens as well as young people who need so much help these days with ""de-stressing"" from all the social media in which they're involved.  Love it!!!!!"
"Disappointed that this was not the version described. I wanted version with full scriptures printed,  not just references."
"Sarah Young has produced a great inspirational book, with one page for each day of the year.  Each page is a personal meditation, based upon various bible readings.  I have faith, but not in books.  I believe that bibles are inherently evil, since they divide people into separate religions and are responsible for many atrocities throughout the ages.  Jesus Calling is not a bible!  It is particularly non-secular.  No wars will be fought over this book, except by the orthodox believers, some of whom actually view this book as heresy.  Religion!  Go hypothesize!  My wife received this book as a gift two years ago.  Since then, she has purchased and given many copies of Jesus Calling to her friends.  They have all been very grateful and have expressed their delight with this book."
"I keep this book in the car, and read it with my husband while he is driving.  Then I look up the scripture on my smart phone, and we read those as well.  It's an easy read (yet often profound), and leaves us with something to think about for the entire day.  This author definitely knows what going on in our lives on a day to day basis, and speaks to that as well as other things.  I support four girls in Uganda or their children, while they are being educated, following a crisis pregnancy.  Once a year, we are allowed to put a small bag together, and it is taken to Uganda and given to the girls and/or their children.  I bought this book for each of the mom's this year.  I looked up bookstores in town and online and Amazon had the cheapest ones.  I'm a prime member, so shipping was free, but would have been anyway, as the order was over $25.00.  Shipping with Amazon is always a good experience - even in the hectic arena of Christmas."
"I have a copy of Jesus Calling in full leather & LOVE that volume, but purchased this Kindle version for travel.  To my delight, i found the 2004 Kindle version has the Bible VERSES written out at the end of each day's reading, rather than just the references.  What a bonus!  I highly recommend this 2004 Kindle edition¬†

  
Jesus Calling: Deluxe Edition









  
  
    
  , as well as the full leather version--though it doesn't have the full verse written out the way the Kindle edition does.NOTE:  I also  purchased the full leather version referred to above on Amazon. I got it from ""LionandLambOhio"" for just a little more than the imitation leather version.  The book summary states that the imitation leather one replaces the full leather (ISBN-12# ""9781404114098"") because it is out of print.  But lionandlambohio, with whom I have no financial connection, did have some available. So check with them if interested. Both versions are highly recommended."
"This is my 'go to' book for right now inspiration...and it never fails to deliver. I keep it at bedside so it's readily available to start my day when I awaken. The pages never fail to inspire and motivate me...as if Jesus is actually speaking to me directly on topics or issues that resonate in my life. I love this book, and gift it to others who appear might also need Jesus' voice to help overcome the day's hurdles. Thank you Sarah Young for writing this devotional and making it available to all the rest of us."
Friends of mine have this prayer journal and I was wanting to check it out.  I can only say how totally surprised I am daily that the daily readings are so accurate for this year of pandemic though this book was written years ago.  It has comforted me a lot and I look forward to using it.  Shipping on this one took almost 3 weeks..
As I prepare to purchase another copy 15 in total of Jesus is Calling  as gifts  I thought I would read the reviews out of curiosityDisappointed so many were negative. I hope these reviews do not keep you from ordering and reading it daily. I promise you will find God is speaking to you.  Read it along with your Bible if you like. Have faith you will be grateful you purchased this book and others Sarah Young has written.God Bless.Amen
"seriously people those of you that wrote the bad reviews, she clearly states in the beginning that these are her personal revelations of what she thinks God said to her. Having read that,I went into it with my eyes open knowing that it was her perception and always if it's somebody's else's  perception I will not take it as a biblical truth just suggestions or a new ideas for new things to contemplate.I did not take it as the Express Word of God even though she wrote it that way I read what she had to say it gave me some things to think about and then I read the Bible verses and i  read the previous verses so I it inwas in context in the Bible study and I would use the Bible verses themselves as my devotion not what she had to say what she says and just as new ways to think about the Bible."
Words can not describe the power of this book and the many blessing this book has opened up for me. Reading this journal everyday gave me a new appreciation in life and understanding of many spiritual aspects. I am so very grateful for this book to have come in to my life and will always be.Please buy this for yourself or a friend and I swear you will not be disappointed!
"The book itself and the content are fantastic and on point.  The book itself should be 5 starsMy three star rating is the disappointing formatting of the kindle version of this book.  In our printed version of the book each day has all three of the supporting versus provided in full.  In this kindle version, only the first verse is provided, and the other two are provided as references to be looked up independently.I'm not sure why shortcut was taken with the Kindle version of the book, but it is very disappointing."
"What a lovely way to start my day... I really connect to the readings in this amazing little book. I also purchased Sarah Young's other book ""Jesus Today,"" and it is equally inspiring. Both books are only  6 ¬º X 4 ¬º ""  so they are perfect for this type of book.  They also have thick, high quality pages, and the covers are slightly padded. They are truly lovely books for yourself for for a gift. Geez, I sound like a infomercial! LOL!  To continue on:  I am not a religious person, but I have a deep spiritual connection, and I am able to connect to these two books because ""Jesus"" in my mine is love. This book strengthens my belief in a power greater than myself. I highly recommend both books!"
"This is one of four books I read as part of my morning meditation. The others are Daily Reflections, Grapevine Daily Quote and A New Day. Each gives me something a little different to start my day. When I told someone I didn't have time for such as this, a friend responded, ""Get up earlier."" Still works."
I read this daily to get my day started! I need to start my day with Jesus! I highly recommend this reading!
Jesus Calling is my favorite devotion of all time. I use it daily as part of my prayer-meditation time. I have recommended it to many others. I use it as part of my hospice ministry.  I plan to purchase a copy for each of my sons if I can find one more masculine in appearance. I will look on Amazon. The devotion for each day speaks to me personally in an inspiring manner. God‚Äôs word is timeless and uplifting.
"My sister had just finished reading this book daily for one year and lent it to me. From the first page, I added it to my daily devotions. I downloaded it into my Kindle and returned hers as it was a gift from her daughter. We decided to add it to our daily devotions, again. Since that day one year ago, I have purchased approximately twelve copies and gave them to friends and family members.Today is New Year's Eve and I finished the first year. However, I am choosing to add it to my 2019 devotions with the inclusion of ""40 Days with Jesus"".Each daily reading coincided with my other readings as though it had been planned that way.  Yes, I feel His presence."
"I always chuckle when I see this title because I remember the Avon commercials from a hundred years ago.  The door bell at a house rings and and a voice proclaims ""Avon calling!"" and there is a nice looking woman ready to share her wares at your doorstep.  Maybe Jesus is essentially doing the same thing, which is still a good reason to chuckle and smile and find something good in the day. I originally received my copy from a relative when my mate of forty years decided we needed to travel separate paths.  I had walked my entire life with the Christ, but this book was a good reminder of the Eternal Doorknocker and I kept opening the door.  I later bought a copy for a friend who was dealing with addiction issues. He later convinced the manager of a monastery to carry the book in their gift shop. So, the doorbells continue to ring, Jesus continues to call and we keep answering the door. For those who take issue with Sarah's theology, get your life taken away and see who comes acallin' on you. You will be hoping it is Jesus!"
I‚Äôm going through a difficult time and this is the first thing I read every morning and it helps in correcting my perspective for the day. It‚Äôs supposed to be interpreted as if Jesus is talking directly to you but I think it could also be God. Love it and I recommended it highly!
"My husband suffered a severe stroke Aug 2018, and has been recovering in a nursing home ever since.  I journal and do devotions every morning before leaving to see my husband.  As you might imagine it has been a very emotional 16 months.  Every time I read the devotion from Jesus Calling, the devotion was exactly what I needed to hear for the day.  I recommend it highly."
"Jesus Calling literally 'called' me via another person's Instagram account! The entries for various days kept popping up and they always 'spoke' to something I was going through or thinking that day. I finally found out the name and author of this devotion, that kept getting 'in my Kool-Aid"", so I could buy it! Lol!This devotion has, and continues to be, a blessing! You can clearly discern Young's time spent in God's presence and her heart for transferring God's loving messages to us in a way that is real, connected, and intimate--something that is desperately needed in today's society!If you are seeking Him, He is always available and this devotion certainly can help you quiet the clutter in your minds and hearts to focus and get in His presence. Great read and study tool!!"
"I have thought much about the criticism of this book's narrowness, and here is my response. To put it simply, I agree that this book is not complete in and of itself. It cannot, and should not, replace regular Bible reading. If you rely on a personal devotional book to give you the totality of God's Word, then you will be disappointed. However, taken for what it is -- an encouragement to take time each day to hear the voice of God for yourself -- then this book is excellent. It has helped me to hear what God is saying to me each day. Sometimes that is through the words that Sarah Young wrote. Often it is through one of the scriptures she lists at the bottom. Frequently it is through other Bible reading that I do.We humans are so forgetful. I am grateful to be reminded each day to return again to the place of peace, dependence, and listening. I have bought many copies of this book for my friends and family and will continue to do so."
"Jesus Calling is a sure-fire way of me acknowledging the Presence of Him in all areas and aspects of my life.  These daily readings started off as a guide for me then turned into a way of actually hearing His voice many times and many hours, days, and months later.  The readings simply led me to realize that Jesus is ever present in my life. Even when I missed a day or two I could hear His voice gently instructing me to think ""holy thoughts"", do good things for my family and others, clean up my mouth and thoughts, and be grateful to be living and saved in His Grace. This book of daily devotions has bolstered my faith in so many ways and given me courage to share freely the promises of the Bible, especially those that are fulfilled in my life.  Thank God, I remain open to His Word and His Presence."
An encouraging way to start your day. The message always feels very personal. It feels like Jesus has this message just for you.
"I am not sure how long Jesus Calling sat on top of the chest next to my bed.  Stuff, chores and other clutter of life simply kept pushing it aside as I juggled being a husband, father, lawyer and friend.  Toward the end of 2013 when my wife and I heeded God's calling to uproot from the place where both of us had lived our entire lives to a different place for a reason or reasons not entirely clear to either of us, I also experienced the urging to pick up this long neglected book.I had no expectations but only a quiet assurance that Jesus Calling held something important for this time of displacement and uncertainty of purpose.  Little did I know how drastic this change of place and purpose would be or how much we would need to depend on Jesus to see us through it.  There was no way I could  have handled the surprise, disappointment, heart break and anger we encountered in the situation we were brought into without the deeper relationship with Jesus that this book facilitated.  It doesn't matter where you are, or are not, in your personal journey through life, working through the daily meditations in Jesus Calling will bring you, as us, to a place of unbelievable joy, trust and gratitude while growing deeper relationship with a God who is indeed personal and accessible."
"This devotion is amazing. I‚Äôm in awe in how every daily devotion is right on time. I was given this book as a gift a few years ago. Once I moved I couldn‚Äôt find it anymore so I bought one. It was literally that good,  I felt compelled to buy one. It‚Äôs a beautiful and well written devotion that takes 2-3 minutes to read each day. My life has been impacted positively because of this book."
"I love this devotional! It's a beautiful way to start your day with reading words from God. The messages are pure, truth and touches the heart. I have gifted this book many times and will continue to share this special book with others."
"Most encouraging every AM for me to start my day along with my Bible. Especially during this time of many needs out there.  Lean on Jesus we are not alone.  I purchased extra books to send to my GrandDaughters, they are nurses and really a lift up as only Jesus can do."
"I use this beautiful written book for my morning devotions as I start my day with coffee time with God.  This book has been my counselor through a very tough time in my life.  It came into my hands quite accidentally, so I really believe God brought the messages to me to make me recall how simple living with Him day by day is all I need to do."
I received this book as a milestone birthday gift in 2019...I've related and enjoyed this book so much that I have in turn given several as a gift and I keep one on hand to gift!  Wonderful tool!Great book that I continue to gift to friends & family ~
"This book has been a great blessing to my wife and I.  It speaks so clearly to our hearts and the needs of our hearts.  As we went through the daily meetings with our Lord a wonderful thing happened...we started sharing with each other what the day's reading meant to us.  This practice gave us a common language we used to calm each other down and build us up so that we could refocus on the presence of God and Jesus and the Holy Spirit.  We are disciple-makers and have several people and groups of people we are helping to hear God calling them closer to HIMSELF.  THANK YOU, SARAH, for sharing what God has shared with you.  We are free to have this constant, powerful, intimate relationship you speak of because God has chosen to take away man kinds sin through His Son Jesus Christ and give us His Spirit to live within us.  THANK YOU FOR HELPING GOD TO DRAW US CLOSER TO HIM...HE IS THE GREATEST!!!!!"
Recommended for all Christians ! Inspired way to start your day in His word! Great encouraging words for all to read and ponder!
"This was recommended to me by a friend when I was having some problems earlier this year.  I downloaded it on May 3rd and read the devotional for that day.  It was just what I needed, the words brought tears to my eyes and peace to my heart.  Everyday it has lessons and verses for me to think about, pray about, and some I pass on to others.  This devotional has helped in so many ways, what a blessing!!"
"Excellent material.  However, common questions can arise, like:1.  Are these attempted additions to the Bible?  Actually, they sample fulfillments of Jesus saying He would lead us.  If the Bible were a DVD, then the Spirit shines the laser accenting a precise part -- without adding chapters -- simply unpacking the disc.2.  Does the author claim to be Jesus?  Prophets (Biblical or modern) never say they are the actual Jesus; but they act as stained glass that the Christ light can arrives through.3.  Why don‚Äôt the messages cover all the teachings in the Gospel?  This peculiar misunderstanding assumes God must completely replicate doctrine, rather than just being with and loving the person, like Father to child.4.  If Christ customizes his speaking, then does each person color the messages?  Any light from Christ will arrive through us like a uniquely, artistically, tinted window for God‚Äôs glory.  Some windows are brighter, some are darker; so some prophets emphasize the cross and others the resurrection.  We need both.5.  Do all these words apply to me?  No, they were given to a particular person, with a particular personality type, in a particular season.  Some parts will apply and others won‚Äôt.  Read (as with anything) listening for what the Spirit encourages for us at the time.6.  Do these words have authority over me because they are in first-person?  No.  Each person has a unique, unrepeatable private encrypted line with God.  And we can all unpack our ability to hear more.For an in-depth treatment of this encouraging topic, including many more outstanding messages, see:Surrendering to Abundanceby Dave NevinsThere is a magnificent storehouse of wealth to enjoy!---------"
"A close friend strongly recommended this book but I was reluctant to try it; I had been using ""God Calling"" for years as my devotional book and companion to the Bible.  However, my respect for her initiated the purchase and consequently ""Jesus Caling"" became as dear to me as ""God Calling"".  It is not possible, for any seeking to more intimately know the Lord,  to remain unmoved by the words contained in these books.The Scriptures included with each day's readings will draw you deeper into the verses themselves and the chapters where they are found.  You will gain more understanding of God's great love for His creation. Day by day you will desire to know Him more intimately and He will become even more precious to you than you ever thought possible.  You will discover the ""shelter of His wings"", wisdom, comfort, joy, peace, contentment, and rest in His love.  (""Be still and know that I AM God."")Give these two books a try but as companions to the best Bible translation you can find....the best translation of the Bible is the one that you will read.  You will never be the same!"
"Jesus Calling has been one of the most powerful things to happen  in my life. I read it every morning before I do anything. After losing my husband a year ago I have continued to lose almost everything I had including my house, my car my two cats and my litter yorkie, who was like my child.  This book was a gift to me and I know it was the reason I was able to make it through with a stronger belief in Christ and a reason to go on.  Now I try to order one book month from Amazon and give it to someone I meet that I feel it can help."
The sentiments are good but I found it to be too repetitive for my taste. I did find some of it helpful though.
"If you are a fan of this devotional, you will know what I mean. So reassuring and a great way to start your day.This edition is fine for your desk or travel.I prefer the large print edition as it has the entire bible verse at the end of the page, not just a verse to refer to--who does that? I want it right there, or forget to do it!Still, I have given this to three friends! Great, compact size."
Love the quality of the book and contents. The only thing I hadn't noticed before I purchased it was that the scripture references aren't written out.  You will need your Bible or Bible App to look up the Scripture reading posted at the end of each day's entry.
"I love this book.  I can't even tell you how much.  Every day the devotion speaks to something in my life.  One oddity I've noticed follows.  I have two of these books with the same copyright date. (One at the office, one at the house)  They are slightly different.  Each day's devotional is slightly different and the daily Biblical verses are not the same between the two books.  One book usually has 3 and the other is usually missing one of those.  Do you suppose I have 2 different printings or editions with the same date or maybe the one is a knock off?"
"No matter what is troubling you on any given day this little Devotional will address the issue at hand.  How she does it, I don't know, but Sarah managed to cover almost everything we all go through on a daily basis.  Cudos to her!!!"
"This little book full of wonderful & inspirational daily thoughts was recommended to me when I started cancer treatments a few weeks back.  Every date in the book has a short message from Jesus talking directly to you!  More often than not, when I read the message for the specific date, it touches me & gives me strength!  Highly recommend for everyone, especially those going through a very hard time in their lives!"
I really enjoy reading my daily devotions. I always go back 1 or 2 days and read all the devotions going forward and they all fit together and make me feel really good inside. Thank you God for all of your help!
"I have to admit, I was very skeptical about reading a daily devotional, especially one purported to be from Jesus Himself.  First, I have never read a devotional and felt uncomfortable when offered the book as a gift. However, I was seeking answers looking for healing from a crushing divorce, so I warily accepted the gift.Boy am I glad I did! Not only do I read this little daily devotional every morning, but I also re-read passages throughout the day when I notice God working in my life. It is amazing how relevant the daily passages seem to fit my circumstances.Sidenote: I usually read the hardcopy book but I also have the Kindle version of Jesus Calling loaded on my Smartphone so I always have it with me.  A useful feature of the Kindle version is the scripture passages are included after each reading. This gives the reader the convenience of reading the reference scripture right away. The hardcopy book only has room to indicate the passage as a reference, which is less convenient.Another reason I was skeptical was I had doubts that a human could or should speak behalf of Jesus or voice. Initially, I was put off by the apparent arrogance until I read the introduction where Sarah Young explains the story of how the book came to be.  She explains how these writing are from messages she received, but not inspired as the Scriptures, but her messages are very timely and clear and inspiring.After reading daily for a few weeks, my perspective started shifting towards one of gratitude. I shared my observations with friends and family and began giving them as gifts.I gave a copy to my mother and now we talk frequently about the daily message and its impact and the meaning it holds for us in our own lives. My mother is a doctor of physical medicine who regularly meets patients who have had life-altering injuries and could use a little perspective lifter. She gives them Jesus Calling as a gift. So far, her patients are thankful for the gift of hope.I recommend this book to anyone who wants to build a closer relationship with Jesus and strengthen their faith. It could change your life, as it has changed mine. At minimum, reading Jesus Calling could change your perspective about your faith and your relationship with God."
"I've had my own copy of this for years, and now I gift it to friends who could use a spiritual lift. The daily messages emind me to make my relationship with Jesus the focus in my life. I love to follow through and read the Bible references as well, so that I stay grounded in the word."
"This is my favorite daily read. Sarah Young uses scripture to remind us of His constant presence and His love and faithfulness.  Each day is a new focus on how we need to respond to our amazing Creator, with thankfulness, trust and praise.  The book reads as if Jesus is speaking directly to the reader.  I highly recommend this book to Christians just learning from holy scripture and to those who are very familiar.  Jesus Calling is one of the best ways to begin each new day!"
I find this reading to be quite  enlightening. The words written in each day's passages seem to hold a lot of meaning. Also meaning too and in a small way even some small answers to a happening of that day. I find reading each day's passage in the evening to be helpful to a peaceful closure to the day.i have also read the days passage at the beginning of the day if the day is to be one of stress and trial.
"Translation of every day scripture in accordance to every day life. Recommended by a family member as a daily devotional. I start my morning reading the daily reflection and sometimes I re-read in the evening.  This has gotten me through some challenging times in the past year, with the passing of both my parents. And now with the challenges of the pandemic and our beloved USA in turmoil.  We all need the power of prayer. Thank you for your dedication to your talents in writing and translation of the good news."
My husband has read this several times since it has been published. We have also purchased for friends and family. I recommend this devotional for someone new to Jesus as well as those who have walked with him for years.
"My husband and I love this book.  We had a copy given to us by one of our children, then one of his children was going through some turmoil so we gave it to him and went to the local book store and bought another copy.  Then recently a family member was diagnosed with breast cancer so we had this sent to her.  We are just simple folk and not preaching to anyone but we do get pleasure and peace from reading this."
"Can‚Äôt tell you how many of these I have bought and given to people. I‚Äôve been reading the same one of mine for over seven years. It is absolutely excellent, just a little breath of fresh air you need with your morning coffee before you go out for the day. I know God loves me and this little book makes me feel better about it every day"
"It always amazes me when a person writes something from God and it HITS me right where I'm at.  This is what this book did for me.  I recently was laid off from my job, then had my unemployment pulled b/c of something stupid.  I had no money coming in and started to panic.  My friend shared several of the posts in the book and WOW!! The posts were written directly to ME, not others as if God looked into the future and saw me in 2013.  (Which He did.) God gave me such grace and peace.  I now KNOW that HE is my provider!!! I've grown so closer to Him.  I just wish I had found this sooner and it now sits on my phone's Kindle.  Please don't listen to the nonsense that this book isn't from God.  It is, trust me, it is.  This book will draw you closer to God as Sarah also includes verses for you to meditate on throughout the day."
"AWESOME! I treasure this devotional. I had been reading excerpts online and decided I wanted a copy. After it arrived, I decided to order six more copies as stocking stuffers for my daughters & daughter-in-laws. Sarah Young's personal style of writing goes straight to your heart. She inspires, encourages, comforts, corrects and challenges, all inspired from Biblical writings."
One of the best devotional books ever printed. The reader will want to read it each morning to start his/her day as Jesus talks to the reader providing excellent advice and insight to be connected to Jesus. The reader will realize that God knows all as he/she reads the devotions each day. The reader will want a copy of Jesus Calling for himself/herself and will want to purchase additional copies to give as gifts. The is truly one of the most personal inspirational devotional books I've ever read.
ABSOLUTELY UNCANNY HOW EACH DAILY ENTRY READS RIGHT FOR THE MOMENT I'M GOING THROUGH.  It's like God is talking to me thru this little book and the hand on the cover I lay my hand over and grab on.  I look forward to each new day to read that new passage and the walk that God is taking me on with the words he inspired this author to write.
I got one of these as a gift for my daughter. I got one for me. My mother already had one. We all want to study together out of the same book. The book is so inspirational. We enjoy every concept of it. It lifts us up daily. Great Arthur. This is a little book that every Christian should have. It does not matter what religion you are. This book speaks to the heart of everyone who knows and serves our Lord Jesus Christ.
"I have this book for a few years now.  I read and meditate with this book every day. Even though the message doesn‚Äôt change from year to year, I change. It is definitely a faith strengthening book."
"Great daily devotional, repetitive in that it really reminds you daily of God's presence and love!  Great gift for friends and family to encourage them of the presence of the Lord in our lives if we but ask Him in."
"I was at a place in my life where I had been hurt by the church. I loved Jesus, but was not so fond of His followers! This book has touched my heart. The Holy Spirit gently, lovingly, speaks to me each and every time I read a devotion from this book. Very frequently, I find that the day's reading touches on exactly what I need for my current situation.  I cannot recommend it enough, especially as a gift for someone who might be struggling with their faith or in need of loving support and guidance."
"This is one of my all-time favorite devotional guides. And this small,soft cover one is wonderful."
"LOVE this little devotional book! It's short and sweet and always seems to hit home with every message. It's small enough to take with you when traveling, or just to set on the nightstand. I love starting out my days with faith and always gives inspiration and strength to start my day! Recommend for everyone!"
"I didn't realize I was ordering a small-print little book.  A magnifying glass or very young eyes is what is required for this.  If you want to carry it around with you, it would be easy to do though."
It‚Äôs All about our Saviour! King of Kings! Immanuel! Helper! Wonderful Couseleur!He came to take on our humanity and share our humanity so in this He can relate. Relationship with our Saviour! How lovely!
I love the daily scriptures and the large print.....I read it everday
"Jesus Calling by Sarah Young is an amazing book of her walk with God and his messages to her of daily living, having faith and trust in Him, she made it into a daily devotional book, I typed all of it and have been sending it every day for over 2 yrs,  to whomever wants it, so delightful and fits every problem one can have, truly amazing. Thank you Sarah for this marvelous book that through the Holy Spirit you put together several years ago, also amazing is no matter how old, years gone by, it still fits our daily walk with the Lord, I just love it, Jesus Calling is right below the Bible for me.Anyone that wants a daily guide in living righteously, well this is the book, try it, you won't be disappointed."
I purchased this book ‚ÄúJesus Calling.‚Äù It has a day to day inspirational reading. The readings are exactly what one goes through with daily crosses to bear and tells you how to overcome them. How to trust in God and build a closeness with him. My sister lost her only son a year ago and was given this book by someone else who lost hers. This book has helped her get through her loss and to find hope in Her life again and move forward. I bought this book and it‚Äôs helped me so much too.
Reading God‚Äôs Word is so important for our daily nourishment. Jesus Calling is perfect as an after-meal mint (or appetizer üòä)
This was everything it said it would be and more!!! I love it and recommend it!!! It has a reading for each day but doesn't have a year on it so you can use it for the rest of your life!!! The author also makes it relatable for everyday life situations as well!!!
"A friend sent me this ebook when I was going through an especially challenging event in my life. I'm not usually impressed with devotionals (a notable exception is My Utmost for His Highest, by Oswald Chambers) and quickly move from going through the motions of reading daily to just giving up. This one is different. Written from God's point of view, it has helped me keep my eyes and heart pointed in the right direction so I could avoid being overwhelmed by the current circumstances. Each day's devotional digs into the heart of our faith by taking a closer look at one attribute of God's personality and uses it to reassure us that he is with us to help us face the daily temptation to feel alone and abandoned.I would strongly recommend this work for anyone facing difficult times or faced with a challenging growth opportunity. Jesus Calling is a daily reminder that God is in control and that he wants you to rest in his provision and love."
There is no other way to day your day than with Jesus.  I enjoy reading reading the Lord's words in this book each morning.  Each day there is a new perspective of God's love for us as He reminds us that He is our Good Shepherd.
This is a great daily devotional. It seems to tell you just what you need to hear each and every day. I have used it for years and bought this one for a friend. I highly recommend this devotional
"I purchased this book to give as a Christmas gift this year. A friend has this book and showed it to me, I was impressed enough to purchase one and now I want one for myself. This isn't the typical devotional book, (I have many of those) this one is different in that it addresses issues we face every single day and explains how the Lord wants us to handle them in a simple straight forward format. It is written as if we are actually sitting there talking with the Lord and He is responding. It's very nice and wonderful fun read. I will be ordering more of these as the author has several different ones to choose from. I want them all! Highly recommend this book!!"
"If you want some positivity and spirituality and do not have much time to devote, this books stays by my bed and reminds my husband and night that we need to read it and it takes only a few minutes. This is our second year. It has these half page readings every day that reminds you what is important."
"This is my 2nd year completing this devotional book and I  always find the daily readings exactly what I need to keep myself tuned in to God, no matter what circumstances I find myself in. It is truly holy and Spirit-breathed."
"I started this year reading every day starting with my YouBible app, then the Our Daily Bread app, and followed by one daily devotional from this book and I‚Äôm ready to face anything with a smile throughout my day. Look forward to checking out her other inspirational books."
"This beautiful book is as if Jesus Himself is talking directly to you. I love how it‚Äôs written in first-person because it depicts Christ on a more personable level, with Scripture provided for each daily devotion. This is a phenomenal, spiritual book and it reminds you every day how much Jesus loves you, how He is with you, and is guiding you down the right path in life."
I have wanted this daily reader for years. It is definitely my absolute favorite. I look forward to reading it each day. Definitely makes me feel closer and more connected to God every time I read it.
"This is a lovely book.  However, it does NOT contain the scripture, only the reference.  Consequently, I returned it (to Whole Foods, a very easy process) and bought the version that has the scriptures, and I think is a much better book."
I love this devotional. It‚Äôs filled with scripture references and daily messages to start your day with. I‚Äôd recommend to others.
"This is one of the most wonderful devotional books I have ever read.  I've had one for myself for about four years and I read it every morning.  The messages for each day and the scriptures that follow are written as though God wrote them just to help me for MY need for that very day.  Even though I've read them all before, each time, these messages and scriptures give me new insight and better understanding of the problem and the answers.  A great gift for someone who needs time alone with God every day - and don't we all?!"
"This book was loaned to me by a friend.  I fell in love with it the moment I started reading it.  The first thing I do in the morning is read Today's word.  The book is written in first-person, so as I read it, I feel like God is talking directly to me - an intimate time between God and myself.  I like that.Secondly, I bought five of these books this year to hand out as Christmas gifts.  My aunt, who received one, cried when she read her starter page.  The messages are clear with simple instructions that help keep you on your daily path.  The tiniest things that put a wrench in my way helps me to stay focused and reminds me how Jesus loved and forgave us sinners and how Jesus helps us respond to apathy with soft kindness.This book fits right into my purse (my feed bag as my family/friends put it), and I take it with me when I travel."
"A friend's post on facebook led me to this book.  I have faithfully read each day's devotional since I purchased it.  It has brought me peace, comfort and a closer walk with God ."
"This book opened the door to a complete outlook and change in my life that was badly needed.  SO awesome a book, I have ordered several copies for friends who, hopefully, will have the same experience.  I tried many many different books while I was grief stricken and struggling to find a way to cope and get back to life again.  THIS book (sent from a friend...  to me, not a coincidence) was the only book that helped.  When I delved into it, it changed not only my painful thoughts and struggle at the time, but also a new outlook in how I was perceiving things all through life thus far, and how much I needed to change.  AND how awesome God is!  Life changing!!!!"
I read it daily. I have gifted MANY of these & people always love them. Just buy it!! üíñ
I purchased two of the books as gifts.
"This is a great devotional to remind you daily of God's close presence in your everyday life.  It is not an in-depth bible study but instead, the sweetest reminder of Jesus' unconditional love for us all."
"I love starting my morning with prayer and reading this short devotional each day.  Then Sarah Young follows each daily reading with scriptural evidence, which I also read and meditate on (if time allows).  Although it is not always possible to sit down for long on my busy mornings, this devotional is the perfect way to get my heart focused on Jesus before going off to work or to whatever else the day may hold.  I can't tell you how many times her words, inspired by our maker, was exactly the words I needed to hear that day.  I also enjoy giving this book as a gift. This last purchase here on Amazon was a gift for my mom.  If you have been wanting to get closer to Jesus or just find time to be in his presence more, try this book!  I highly recommend it!"
"I was given this book by a friend and it is truly inspiring and a great boost to my daily life. My friend and I both read ours each morning. There have been countless times that one of us has contacted the other to marvel at the fact that the devotion for that day encompassed precisely what we were struggling with at that particular time. This book is a comfort, a guide and a great resource to renewing you strength in difficult periods.  This particular copy I ordered for a friend who is experiencing some challenges and I wanted her to have it for the comfort and support it has provided to me and others. This is absolutely the best daily devotion book I've ever owned."
I ordered four of these books and gave them to each of my friends they so enjoyed them there is no date at the top and no day of the week so the book can be read every year over and over each morning we start out with reading daily page and it really  gives you a positive perspective on how you go through the day so happy I got this and so are my friends
This book is more of a narrative than direct scripture. It references verses in the Bible but it's more narrative. Yet it's very inspiring and a great supplement to the Bible in your devotions. Some of the messages have content that really stays with you through the day this was a gift to me from a friend and I treasure it so now I'm giving it to another friend.
"Amazing book. Wonderful especially if you suffer from anxiety, worry or lack of control"
"So, this item stays in my ""Gifts"" wish list. I own one myself and enjoy it so much that I continuously buy it for others. It's a great way to spend little moments with the Lord, refocusing your mind on him.It can be a nice breather for the growing mature Christian and even more substantial for the newly growing Christian. Great for whatever stage your walk is in Him! I often use it to jump start my bible study on days I don't know where to began...it always leads me on a wonderful path with God.The topics seem to be in tune with the Holy Spirit and right on time. I am grateful for this find!"
"Fantastic book, I keep it at my desk at work.  I bought this for a good friend, but instead my sister saw it this weekend and grabbed it for herself.  I highly recommend this book it really helps me get through my day sometimes.  I love how this book seems to know exactly what I need to hear on any given day.  Just open it up to the date it is, and your ready to go!!!"
"I love this book! When I read it, it's like Jesus is speaking directly to me! The scriptures are always right on target!"
Bought this for a friend going through tough times.  Wasn‚Äôt sure if it would be too ‚Äúnew agey‚Äù based on some reviews criticizing the author for ‚Äúchanneling‚Äù Jesus to write this book.  Whatever her inspiration this book is filled with positive support and love.  My friend cried she felt so supported by her daily readings.  Highly recommended.  I plan to buy more copies.
"Little daily thoughts that could be from Jesus. Very inspiring. I have bought and given this book to at least 15 women. Each one has come back and said ""it is like it was written just for me."" And my response is always; that it was. But it isn't just for women. I listened to a man that was cured of cancer. He had been give less than a 10% chance of living. He said that one of the things that helped him get through was the Holy Spirit letting him know to trust and this book reminding him of God's love for him. (Of course he also read the bible.)"
"To be honest, didn't finish reading it. I lent it out...they liked it so much, I gave it to them. What I did read was inspiring and great for a puck up when feeling down."
Easy to carry with you anywhere
Since losing my mom to Covid I needed something  to get my faith  back. I look forward  to my morning  cup of coffee and my daily read  and reflection. Jesus is calling‚ù§
"This is an excellent devotion, but ONLY if you get the version with the scripture written out.  Very few of us will take the time to look up a verse when it is referenced.  Sarah Young's words are encouraging, but the words from the Bible are the ones that inspired her writing so those are the words to always read.I've given these to family and friends.  One friend going through cancer treatment while her daughter was away at college each had a copy.  Gave them encouragement to talk about!"
Such a great and easy way to reflect each day.  A short paragraph every day to cover the year.  A friend gave this too me and it has been part of my morning ever since.  I have given this book to a number of other friends as well.  Lifes hard and its nice to know we are never alone.  Thanks!
"I have read Jesus Calling daily for at least 5 years and am still inspiredby the Holy Spirit each time I sit down to read it. I have given it away to over 25people and almost all have remarked that they love this book too and that it is a staplein their lives spiritually. The book reminds me of a modern day version of Brother Lawrences' book""Practicing His Presence"", which was written a couple of centuries ago. It'salso like ""God Calling""  which reads like a narrative of God speaking directly to you.I highly recommend this book to anyone who would like practical ways to stay connectedto the peace of Christ and who would like to pass that peace along to others."
"This was a gift. I own this devotional and feel like it is a great one as compared to others. It simply gives a message then other verses to look at. I like this because there is backing to the author's words. The devotion itself is very well written and definitely makes you think about how you can apply the information to your life, which I like. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a devotional. It doesn't have a specific group that can only use it (e.g. only for Christians starting out, pastors, etc.). I think this devotional can be used by anybody and they can get something from it."
Every day this book inspires me tremendously. 365 pages/daily meditation. Each new page reads as if Jesus was actually talking to you/me. There is no doubt that Sarah Young (Writer) was spirit lead when she wrote this! ‚ÄúThis book saved my life!‚Äù Not kidding! Perfect for people that are struggling or just became a new Christian!
"I got the book for my wife, we bought at least 10 others for friends, and I have recommended it to many others who bought it.  Both of us love it so much that we also bought the Kindle versions for our Kindles, so that when we travel we can have it along.It is the best way to start a day, as Sarah Young has done much research, and speaks to us as though it is God and Christ actually speaking to us.  Most every day we can feel that the devotion is directly for us, and speaking to us about things for us for that day.  A friend from a grief support group said it helped her tremendously during that time, and continues to inspire her months later.If you only bought one devotional, to use for years to come, this could be it.  It will continue to speak to you personally from day to day, and year to year.  It has certainly been a blessing to my wife and I, and our many friends."
"Very fitting for every day situations. Instantly has brought me back to peace and the truth. Of course thats as long as I read it, that is. Lol. EXCELLENT book though!"
"I was in the middle of a ""trial"" and went to go see my pastor about it. He had a copy of this book that was quite worn out and was full of paperclips, papers, and highlighting. Every day I pick this book up and read it God is speaking to me! If you are a busy person like me, than this is a great devotional for you! You can read it on a train or bus or on your lunch break and it is small enough to put in a purse or briefcase and take up hardly any room! It even has a handy ribbon bookmark so you don't have to remember where you were. I have really been inspired by this book. Share it! Give it as a gift. Listen to it cause Jesus is Calling!"
"This self-standing version of Jesus Calling is wonderful.  Easy to keep on kitchen counter, or wherever you know you will not miss a day!  I mark the pages that ""speak"" to me especially with colored tabs so that they are easy to return to.  Have used this as a gift for many friends - it is loved by all!"
"I'm not sure how this book always seems to say exactly what I need for that day, but it does.  This is a great devotional book.  I look forward to waking up each morning and using it as a tool to guide the beginning of my morning quiet time.  I highly recommend this book."
"This is the most awesome devotional I have ever come across. We received one when our daughter was diagnosed with a rare cancer and later went safely into the arms of Jesus.  We have given over a hundred copies to friends and family and those suffering with cancer. We are going on our seventh year of reading this devotional and it is just like sitting down with Jesus over a cup of coffee and listening to all the awesome things He has to share with you.  My husband uses this devotional every day too for all these years.  It always speaks to you right at the depths of your neediness and teaches you how to say, ""I trust You, Jesus."""
"This is a lovely day devotional that points the reader to an intimate and down to earth relationship with Jesus.  Though the author is a bit fundamentalist in her understanding of the Bible (but not nearly as fundamentalist as some of her reviewers here!), she‚Äôs right on in her understanding of the enduring Presence of Christ in the heart, soul and life of the believer.  This book is a nice addition to other forms of prayer, meditation and spiritual practices that help to draw us closer to God."
"This book has changed my life. It is a daily meditation book that keeps your mind focused in the right direction. It is all to familiar in this life to let life rob you of God's truth, who you are in him. This is a gentle reminder to allow you to grow in who you are in him. I look forward to my new reading each morning and I reread before i go to bed. My meditation started as a few min. to start my day to wanting more."
"I rate Sarah Young's devotional book, JESUS CALLING, a 5 because it has helped me be aware of the heart of the LORD all year long.  I will repeat it in 2020, as there is no end to the richness of God's love."
"I LOVE this book!  I picked it up almost a year ago at a Christian bookstore for myself and loved it so much that this purchase was a second copy that I sent to my mother-in-law.  I love the way that this devotional always seems so in synch with what is going on in my life.  It is written from ""Jesus' perspective"", what He might say to you if He were sitting beside you.  The author also gives bible verses that are related to each day's reading so that you can get further into the subject for that day.  This reading takes about 3 minutes a day and is the best investment of my time.  Great for any Christian, but easy to read and understand, so I believe perfect for new followers.  I am considering the kids version for my 7 year old and will be looking into one of her other books when I am finished with this one.  Truly an uplifting start to my day and a regular reminder of God's love!"
My favorite devotional. It‚Äôs strengthened my walk with Christ and helps me walk through each day with strength and hope. I give give copies of this to many and they in turn have given it to many. Thank you Sara Young.
"I like the format of being a message, as if Jesus is literally talking.  I didn't take the title so literally until I read about a month; I slowly realized it's written like a daily pep talk...very loving and positive.  I can read it in about a minute while I wake up and even if I feel like I don't remember it throughout the day, I know it's still there in my heart.  Better start to the day than anything else I could do.  Many times I re-read the ""day"" before I go to bed, and sometimes I feel so good about what I read that I look ahead to the next day or two."
"I love, love this book.  This book presents the Word of God in such meaningful ways that touch the soul.  I love reading the daily prayer at the end of my day and am always able to connect the message with what is going on in my life.  God is great!"
"This devotional book has ministered to me more than any other devotional. I have been reading this since April 2012. This was one of the books I had to buy to have on my Kindle. I did by mistake get the teenage one. Do to a trigger finger. I did check the one at home and it's identical. Only difference in the one I have at home(Adult) vs the one on my Kindle (Teen) is the Teen one has the 1st scripture printed out. I did read the comments as to why it received one star. I believe they are making more out of it then need be. This devotional is to help us focus on the Lord Jesus Christ, work at trusting Him and not yourself or anyone else. I have more of a relationship with Jesus now because of this devotional. It causes me to be and stay in the Word of God. It's not Sarah Young's intention to put words in Jesus' mouth as though He said what she wrote. This is a helping tool."
"I can not say enough great things about this book! It is a good length for someone who wants to do a daily devotional, but does not have a lot of time. It is uplifting, calming, reassuring, and I often feel like the message is exactly what I needed to hear on that particular day. It does not get repetitive as some devotionals do.This book is perfect for any Christian religion and all ages. There is no need to start at the beginning of the year, you can pick this book up and read it on any day.I give book to friends who are experiencing a difficult time and people love it. It really can help someone get through a rough patch."
Gift for my daughter. She loves this.
This devotional is wonderful.  A must for every household.  During a very rough time in our family I turned to this devotional and it helpedto calm me and know that  Jesus was with me through my struggles.  An excellent book for everyone who needs encouragement and inspiration. The devotionals seem to fit every day that I needed to seek answers..kinda like God knew that devotion for that day was needed just for me.I have sent several friends and family this book.  One of the very best devotionals I read everyday. Thank you Sarah Young for your excellent writings.
This little devotional is uplifting and makes you stop and think about Gods presence more. I know it has helped me find Him more even in all the chaos of this world. Definitely recommend!
"I bought this book for my mom. I have not read it myself, but, her comment to me, frequently, is that this is the best devotional book she has used in her whole life. She loves it.I talk with her on the phone everyday. At least half of the days I talk to her, she mentions what the devotion that day was about. About a fifth of the time, I feel like we are in Sunday school and she is teaching. She has really gotten into this book.I have the feeling she is going to give it to me next year."
"I have found these little devotional books by Sara Young to be a wonderful help to me in my daily Bible study and they do make nice gifts to give to your friends, or to shut-ins, and especially to new Christians in my church. I like to keep one or two on hand at all times so I will have one available when I am with someone I think would use and enjoy it.  Those who are familiar with the Bible will love her books and those who are not familiar with the Bible will probably start reading it along with one of her books. Amazon has all of her writings.  Some are bound in leather if you want to give a really nice gift!"
"My grandmother recommended this book to me. I'm not really a devotional reader, so I was hesitant to purchase, but since she kept raving about it, I finally decided to bite the bullet and buy it. Each devotional is only a page or two long, so it's super-fast to read it. It really does feel like Jesus is talking directly to me, and the topics seem like they were written especially for me. Young always follows the short passage with scriptures so you can see how her words tie into the Bible. I've been reading this for about 6 months now, and I have a feeling it will be on my reading list for years to come. I recommend it to everyone I meet!"
Great book easy read.  It is so calming and became a must way to start by day.  Short paragraph daily with Bible references.
"Six years ago I found this book by accident.  I wanted to read to my beautiful sister-in-law who was in the hospital dying of cancer,  for over a month I read to her daily and the transformation I watched as I read to her was amazing.  We buried her on her 45th birthday but from her death and this book,  I found a renewed desire to follow Jesus.  I have given this book to so many people and have found just the mention of Jesus Calling often leads to witnessing of God‚Äôs incredible love."
Book is well made and is great reading
This is my most favorite devotional by far! I have had mine for a few years now. I bought this for my ex sister-in-law bc she has recently been diagnosed with breast cancer (she's 34) and I thought she could use it.  I thought the pink leather was perfect!  I rated it 3 stars bc my leather cover was dirty all over. Very disappointing to give as a gift.  It will be fine as it will get used.  I just wish it looked nice.
"this devotional is God sent in many amazing ways first it speaks from a first person perspective as if God is actually speaking the words himself to you.  secondly, you feel connected to knowing he understand the many perplexities and the many twist and turns down life's rocky roads; which, a person turn down each day, and thirdly, this devotional reiterate God's reasoning for you coming in his presence and how he will take control of your day if you allow him too  he is letting us know he can handle whatever we bring to him when we come into his presence. each day as I read the many promises he reveals to me through this devotional book I am becoming me confident, more reassured and definitely more faithful in knowing God will meet me wherever I am that day. I highly recommend ""Sarah Young Devotions for Every Day of the Year, Jesus is Calling"" for anyone who needs God to personally journey with them through his word.."
This is a wonderful devotional book. I have used it myself for many years and have given it as a gift many times.  Receivers are always impressed by the nice cover.
"For the past month, I have read the daily writings and found it to be a  brilliant, soothing, powerful book which touches my mind and heart and lifts my spirit  higher each day.  The writings are short in words and long in meaning and the author directs the words tothe reader which is lovely.  I am a professional who has a passion for reading and find this book to be one of the most important of my life.  So, if you are looking for a powerful source of increased joy and hope each day or working hard to survive a tragedy with some level of power, as I am, I give this book my highest recommendation.  Many thanks to Sarah Young for this gem."
Great devotional written as though Jesus is speaking directly to the reader. It‚Äôs inspirational and uplifting! It has a nice hardcover making it a nice gift!
"I absolutely adore this book! I read it in the morning then I post a picture of the devotional on my snap chat. So many people enjoy receiving these messages - sometimes I feel like a certain day was written for my current situation or emotional state.If you're looking for something to help keep you focused on Jesus, uplift your spirits, bring you closer to God, or to even give as a gift.....THIS IS IT! You will not be disappointed."
"I have a hard copy of Jesus Calling that I have used for multiple years, but that edition does not write out the verses, so I needed extra time each morning to look up the scriptures called for. This is great, and since I usually keep an iPad with me I don't have to remember to add the hard copy book when I leave home... this is simply on my iPad.  Great!!"
God was really as condescending and paternalistic as the voice in these devotionals? How lost would we be? Grateful today that the shaming condescending voice that shows up in every entry of this book isn‚Äôt the real voice of God.
Went to read my daily devotion only to find that it is missing Pages 147-162 (May 20th-June 3rd) Past the window to return it.  Amazon credited me $5 but that is not the cost to replace the book.  Very disappointed as I found a great deal of inspiration in my daily devotion.
"I know everyone seems to love this devotional but it's just not for me. I've tried reading it several times but to me it has a ""New Age"" feel."
"Sarah has taken my relationship with the Lord deeper and stronger than I ever expected from such simple daily entries.  I have it on my Kindle MacBook Pro so I can highlight and make notes.This is my third year so reading the notes shows me how much closer I am to God and Jesus.Oh and the scriptures are written out in the Kindle, unlike in the book.  I really like that as I can get kinda lazy :o/Thank you Sarah.  I look forward to meeting you in the Millennium!"
"I don't always agree with Ms Young's opinion, particularly her stance on 'choosing' happiness, not 'giving in' to depression, etc., which is a grossly simplistic outlook and a colossal insult to sufferers  of this mental disorder..."
"Although I bought for myself. I now want to give as gift. It is smaller in size, not that it matters. But maybe 4√ó6. It's the content that matters."
"I had been hearing friends talk about this devotional for months before I finally broke down and bought it. They were saying things like ""I swear it speaks directly to me and exactly what I needed at that moment!"" and I thought, ""Eh, they're exaggerating.""Boy, they were right.I was struck by the earnestness of Sarah Young's journey toward writing this book. Knowing that the daily tidbits came from her solitude with the Lord and just listening for Hos voice in times of reflective prayer, I am confident that while not Scripture, these notes and thoughts are truly from the Lord to her. While reading through, you can sense the seasons of life she was going through at the time, and most often, they mirror mine in a very meaningful way. Her reflections of what God was saying to her show exactly her own longings and God's constant reassurance of his love for his children. I sense, through her discoveries, how God is speaking to me right now.I've never stuck with a devotional faithfully for a year. Because of how easy these short tidbits are to keep up with, and because of how important and thought-provoking they are to me, I have stuck this one out with joy for almost a year now. I would highly recommend this to anyone seeking God's truths in a personal way."
I love this book so much! It‚Äôs part of my daily routine to start my day off right and remind me He is in charge! When I put my faith in Jesus everything seems peaceful and balanced! Highly recommend!
"I have had a hard copy of this book for five years, but I was exceedingly happy to know that I could download this to Kindle app.  I never ever want to be without this devotional book.  It serves as my source of strength everyday.  It's like the Lord is speaking directly to me.  I highly recommend this book, and I have even ordered a couple of them to give to friends as a Christmas gift."
"Every single message speaks to me in a unique way. I feel like Jesus himself wrote it just for me. The writer's ability to put together these words in this way that touches my soul tells me that she has spent consistent and intentional time in prayer, talking and listening to the Holy Spirit. This blessed me so much, I bought the kids version for my son when he was 7 and he loved reading each daily devotional. He would ask me to read his to him until he was old enough to read it on his own."
This  was a very inspiring book. I enjoyed reading it daily to start my day. There were days when it seemed the Lord was speaking directly to me through this book. I would highly recommend this book to everyone who needed a blessed way to start their day.
I love Sarah Young‚Äôs Jesus calling. The first one I got was a little paper back one I got as a gift. Since then I have bought lots to give to friends and upgraded myself to this one it is so nice and I enjoy reading it every day.
"This daily devotional refers to scriptures, but gives you encouraging narratives to think on. I have found it to be useful for my Bible study."
"If you have any part of your life that leaves you in disarray or creates a sense of unbalance....change it!I am going out on a limb here and sharing a bit about me and what brought me ""balance"" for half of 2013. Don't judge!I was raised Catholic, yet over the years, I drifted from believing the church had anything to offer me. Infact, I became angry with the thought of religion. Still to this day, I am not sold on any one belief. I will keep those thoughts to myself, as you can too.Last year, I was facing a particular situation that I had no choice but to hold myself together and I wasn't doing a good job at it. A friend of mine sent me photos of two pages from a book that she was reading. The words hit my heart with an intense punch. They were spot on what I needed to hear at a specific moment in time. I pretty much balled my eyes out, picked up my spirit, and regained the strength I needed to face a fairly challenging situation(one of too many it seems).The pages were from a book that gives daily devotions. Yes, it is religious based, but remember, I am NOT sold on being brainwashed. I believe we all have to find what we as individuals find to be as a higher power, an anchor if you will.I asked for the name of the book and was going to download it to read. I didn't find it in print version so I downloaded the audio version. Audio ended up being perfect for me!Every day there is a ""sentiment/challenge/thought type of devotional message which is then followed by a scripture number of where you can find it in the bible(if you so desire/I pass).Messages are only a few minutes and I can't believe how spot on they were for what I needed to hear on certain days. It's brought great balance to me with my health, work, parenting, personal relationships etc.Since the book is written as a daily inspiration and I started the book mid year, I am now beginning from the start.I am NOT trying to push a religion on you or myself as far as that goes. I take the words and use them as anchors for my own being/soul/spirit.You do not need to follow the book as the intended use. I have embraced a process of my own and can honestly say that I am more confused about ""religion"" as I've ever been. BUT....I am the most grounded and at peace with the plot twists that life throws at me!Go ahead and download it. After all, you are wasting your life away reading my crap. I have it on audio on my phone and listen every morning and sometimes throughout the day. The first day is less than 20 minutes to get through, but after that listening is only about a minute of your time. Remember, don't judge me....for you have not walked in my shoes. I'm simply trying to pay it forward for those who too have shoes that don't seem to fit!"
"This book always speaks to me - every day is a very good, comforting and easy-to-relate-to reading.  Recently, I gave my copy to my mom who was goign through a hard time, and that left me without a copy (which is fine, becasue I read it on my iphone app - this book has an app!).  So when my good friend miscarried, and I secretly ordered one for her to help her through her dark time, Amazon accidently sent ME two copies also!  I tried to return them but they said keep them, free of charge.  Really spoke to me that as I use it to bless others, God always makes sure I have plenty to share!  I'm reading through it now for the third time."
"This book was given to me for guidance and inspiration.  I found myself drawn to in the early mornings while the light was soft and inviting.  It‚Äôs pages spoke to me much like reading our Savior journal, thoughtful and indelible. I tried to use of the daily verses to journal In response, freely and spiritual soul searching. True love the intimacy the book provides."
"Shortly after I ordered this, we have a tragedy in our family. This devotional has helped us connect with God and has served as a reminder every day that He is in control, He is all powerful, and that we can put our trust in Him."
"Written as though Jesus is talking directly to your heart and soul, this devotional directs your attention to where it ought to be, assuming you are a Christian. Gets the focus off our own self and on to things as Jesus might think more important, or, soft but pointedly, what He thinks our focus ought to be. I also recommend 'God Calling' as a companion piece. Helps make real the balance between ""truth and grace,"" helping us to see things as we might imagine Jesus seeing them, including His love for us, and His seeking of our highest good."
"Food for the soul,mind regulator,a daily reminder that our Lord and savior Jesus Christ is present always and I have found so much peace in reading this book daily as a devotional reading and to reflect on my relationship with Christ,a great way to start the day"
I purchase these as gifts and get compliments on how they help people with insight. I also read it to help with perspective and find encouragement.
"I‚Äôm using the e-book version for travel, trying to limit the stuff I carry, and it‚Äôs great for that. I know I‚Äôll revert to hardback when I‚Äôm home.Either way, these meditations are a meaningful way to start the day with purpose and peace."
"This is an amazing book.  I find it comforting to begin my day with the daily passage, especially with the world in turmoil today.  I love gifting it to friends who needs a little spiritual uplift in troubled times."
Everyone should have and read this book!
I read the designated page every day.  It is as if Jesus is talking to you.  I also have ordered several for friends or aquaintances.
Arrived but looks as though it was just thrown in the box with no filler to keep the other items from damaging. I understand it didn‚Äôt cost much but that should negate proper shipping. Excited nonetheless to add this to my daily devotional.
"Of the many daily inspirational books i have, this is the one i reach for every morning--It makes my relationship with Jesus so much more personal--I bring Him into all the moments of my day--big and small--it has become more and more automatic. I gave this book as a gift--the woman's daughter is a minister and said she has the same book and lives by it--was so glad her mom had it now"
"This is a jewel. Every day, Jesus has a message that seems to be written just to you. It's almost unbelievable - whatever you're going through, just open the page on the day you are and you will find an answer. I have this in my iPhone, in my Kindle Fire, and also the real book.In a retreat I've done last year, as a Leader, I gave this book to the Retreatants. Most of them told me later they still read it everyday, which makes them remember the blessings received during the Retreat and all servants who worked for them.I strongly recommend it."
"Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a daily devotional!Make sure you know which version you're getting. Some have the full verses included at the bottom of the daily devotional (in the version they recommend) and others only have the verses listed (Book, chapter, verse). My aunt showed me the full size one with verses included. I bought the smaller version and it has the verses listed so I get to look up the verse myself. Sometimes it helps me understand the verse better to be able to read surrounding verses.I have bought this for other family members and would highly recommend it!"
"I feel like I'm listening to Jesus when I read this each morning. It was recommended to me by a pastor when I was looking for a gift for a new Christian friend. Our church now gives this book to each person that joins our church. I highly recommend this little ""Book of Love"" to anyone wanting to feel closer to Jesus. It warms my heart."
"Everyday this book's devotions via Sarah Young, speak to my soul and never fail to reach out to my days issues, worry, stress and faith!!  I dont think I could get by without it and especially not without Jesus!!"
I have been reading this devotional for almost 3 years now and  cannot imagine starting my day without it.  It has been remarkable at the way in which God speaks to me through the beautiful words of Sarah Young. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to fill that empty spot that we all have in our hearts until we fill it with the Truth! This book is especially good for new believer or followers of Jesus (or even for people who are still searching).  I have given out many copies of this devotional as gifts and have had nothing but great feedback.
"This was given to me as a gift, and it quickly became my favorite daily devotional to read, and favorite devotional to give as a gift too! The devotions are heartfelt, inspiring, and short in length, which is helpful on those mornings when you've over slept! Jesus Calling is the perfect way to start the day encouraged and uplifted by God's love!"
"Each new day brings a message that meets exactly my needs for that day.  I will be happy to let you all know that my Spiritual life has been enhanced 100 fold since I received this little book as a gift from my sainted Aunt and I have sent copies to my daughter-in-law and mean to send one to my son as well.When my Aunt told me that it was uncanny how each day's message was exactly what she needed I was enticed and when she sent me a copy I cherish it both as a gift from someone I love dearly and as a gift from my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.If you are experiencing any type of trial or trouble in your life and need to hear what God is doing on your behalf try to keep an open mind and let Him do His healing in your life.  He certainly is doing that for me.  Even if your life is great and going exactly as you would like it to be, this little devotional will still let you know the Power of God‚Äôs Spirit working within and around you as you yield yourself to Him.I highly recommend it to any and all that need strength and encouragement on a day-by-day basis and also to those who can offer praise and thanksgiving for blessings received.  This is just what you need to bring you closer to the source of healing power through the Holy Spirit and Jesus Christ."
"It should be a six or seven rating. My wife had a stroke in 2013 and starting reading this book. It was a great comfort to her. In six weeks she had another stroke, this time on the operating table where 4 vertebra were operated on for pain in her back and leg. She has not had any pain since but she had another stroke. She had no lingering effect from the strokes. Nothing in her face or anywhere.We feel so blessed and she went right back to this book and has given away 5 copies to friends, one of which is being operated on for Pancreas cancer as I type this. A great gift to anyone!"
This book is great and is very inspirational. It helps you get moving in the morning and lifts up your spirit.
"This book could not have been given a better title!  It is almost as if Jesus Himself were talking to you personally encouraging you daily!  The devotions are so on target to the world around us, and situations that everyone seems to be going through.  Some days it is almost as if Jesus were sending me instructions for the day relating to some personal issue in my life.  The person who told me about this devotional has experienced the same thing and she is going through totally different issues than I am.  My husband and I both love this book!!!"
I saw this book on my sister-in-laws end table and picked it up.  I instantly liked it. Since then I got one for myself and a couple for gifts.  It is written as if God is lovingly talking to you with suggestions on how to be more aware of God in our daily life.
"THIS DEVOTIONAL BOOK IS MY FAVORITE OF MANY BOOKS I READ WITH THE HOLY BIBLE.IN FACT, IT IS THE VERY FIRST BOOK I PICK UP IN THE MORNING TO START MY DEVOTIONALS.IF YOU PREPARE YOUR ""HEART"" WITH PRAYER BEFORE YOU BEGIN, YOU CAN FEEL THE HOLY SPIRITS PRESENCE AS YOU READ.  IT HELPED ME THROUGH SOME VERY DIFFICULT PHYSICAL AILMENTS THIS WINTER.  MY PRAYER WAS NOT TO BE HEALED BUT TO BE ABLE TO ENDURE.  GOD ANSWERED THAT PRAYER.  A FRIEND OF MINE GAVE IT TO ME FOR CHRISTMAS.  SINCE THAT TIME I GAVE IT TO  A HEALTH CARE FRIEND AND DOWN LOADED IT ON MY IPAD.  EVERYONE I TALK TO ABOUT IT HAS GIVEN AWAY MANY TIMES AND I INTEND TO GET SEVERAL COPIES AND DO THE SAME!WAHNITA BOOZER, TEXAS"
Super high quality paper and binding.It never fails that I will open it up to read and the message for that day strikes an uncannily coincidental tone.Only God!
"I love this book. I am so encouraged by the short, yet often deep, devotion every morning. The reading can take as few as 3 minutes or much longer, if you reflect and pray on it. Everyone can fit it somewhere in their day. You will be glad you did as I am. I have found the book so encouraging that I have begun giving it as gifts."
"I heard friends talk about this little gem and it piqued my curiosity.  I loved being able to get a substantial ""Look Inside"" at this small book to help me know that I definitely wanted to purchase.  I bought the Kindle version, in part for the portability, but also because the Scripture references are included on the pages, not just the citation or Scripture ""address.""  This is a short but very direct daily devotional, written as if Jesus was talking to you directly.  He does that, you know!  Although brief, the devotionals really get me thinking and reflecting on the truth of the daily message.  The Scripture references reinforce it from different parts of the Bible, which gives balance and also evidence that the Bible itself is a complete work. I highly recommend it to you; in fact, buy more than one because they are excellent gifts!"
I have given this book as a gift many times.  Has been such a source of peace for me personally and a wonderful devotional.
"I've purchased this book for myself and several others.  It is a perfect gift for people who need reassurance of God's presence and care during life's challenges.  God is always with us, the difficulty is in training ourselves to ask for the help we need (we are so self-reliant) and making time in our busy lives for him so he can bring his spirit to life within us.  Treat yourself to one of the most inspiring, daily devotionals you will ever find."
"This is my first devotion as an adult and I must say it is very different from all the others I have seen in the past. It is written in very simple English, in the words that Jesus would use while talking to you (taken from bible verses). I feel like every reading is speaking to me directly, and I get something out of it every time. There are references at the bottom of every page, letting you know where in the bible to go to read more on that day's message. I recommend it to all young adults that are looking for a fresh start with something new and different, that guides you back into a loving and healthy relationship with God. :)"
This book meets me where I am daily more often than not!  It provides such a guideline for peace that is unmatched.  The scripture with each note is always on point.  A truly awesome work.  Makes a great gift.
I am enjoying reading this book so much.  It also has large print and a nice soft but sturdy cover which is pleasing to the touch .
Gifted my friend with this and she‚Äôs been so blessed by it. I highly recommend this devotional. We love it! God is good!
"This book is written in letter/note form, so it feels like Christ is personally speaking to me in what I need to hear for that day.Its like a love note ..... and leaves you thinking.... that's just what I needed to hear today! Very encouraging!"
"I love this book...Sarah takes the Word of God and makes it personal. She does not change what God's word says, just brings it forth in a way that speaks to your heart through the Holy Spirit."
"My wife and I and everyone we have sent a copy to of Jesus Calling  has found it a great blessing.  They  also have sent out copies to their friends or told others of Jesus calling.  Jesus Calling, is written as if Jesus is right next to you and guiding you through your day and problems, moment by moment.  The book draws you back closer to the Lord and letting Him take back all control of all of your life.There is a great thirst out there for answers and  guidance for things we cannot control.  I believe you will enjoy this book as we, and so many others have."
This has been a mainstay in my life for five years.  It helps me stay centered and gives 'm e peace.  Over the years I have shared this book as a gift for friends ssh ten for more times. They have all so found peace and assurance.  I recently  bought a  second book by this author .  Daily time is easy to come by as I am the matriarch of a three generation household accustomed and to waking long before anyone else.  Serenity is a blessing that I receive each day.
"Recently read negative reviews (not on Amazon) calling this a feelgood book. Far from truth. They must not have read it. Judge not. Jesus has spoke to me from the pages, often times I was convicted of what I was doing wrong, how I wasn't going in right direction. Not a feelgood moment, but moments I have truly grown from in the past 5 months. It has spoke of the many issues currently in my life and helped me stay on the right path during this time. The book is really about getting to know Jesus better, relying on Him. I have found it a blessing. I have recommended it to many and those I know that own it, love it. Looking forward to more growth in the next 7 months."
"This is one of the best daily devotionals out there. I purchased this as a gift for someone I am mentoring who is a very busy career woman, with twins and helps her husband with his small business so she is short on time. The readings are an intimate daily walk with Christ, and the 2 to 3 brief scripture verses give an opportunity to be in His Word. I use this devotional everyday in my quiet time and I love it. I highly recommend this little treasure of a book to anyone who would like to have a closer walk with Jesus but is limited on time."
Bought these for my Bible Study friends. It‚Äôs a great daily devotional that can be used Year after year. I give it an A+
It is important for me to start each day with some words from my Lord and Savior and reading Jesus Calling is it for me.
"What a wonderful job the author has done in writing short, personal letters written to the read by God using scripture verses. The author truly understands the importance of resting in Jesus' arms and walking with Him daily. This is a wonderful devotional any Christian whether a baby Christian or one who has followed Christ for decades. It is both deep and simple."
Purchased this for my sister who has been through a year of Chemotherapy for Cancer.  She continues to tell me just how much this devotional has met her right where she is and has brought her through the storm over and over again to a peaceful state of presence.  She has been so touched by each devotion that she hopes to one day write the author and express her gratitude for accepting the call from God to write this inspiring compilation of prayers.
"This was a gift from a good friend and I love it. I have purchased 5 to bless my daughters, sister and friends from church that have been stuggling. Each day I read this book it is like a fresh anointing because most days I need the word for the current day. So many times I read the daily word and I have to get on the phone with my friends because the word is so relevant for the day. Once again let me say I LOVE THIS DEVOTIONAL."
"I really enjoy the daily reads and messages in this book.  It's uplifting, encouraging, and gives me that Christian hope and renewal necessary to deal with all the ups and downs in daily life.  This is very much a feel-good boost to anyone's self-esteem.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone with self-doubt, and particularly to those with chronic depression issues.  Cleanse yourself and your soul with a couple of passages from this book and you will walk away in a new light of positivity and hope."
I highly recommend the book Jesus Calling. It is short daily devotions that's written as if Jesus is talking to you. It's not dated as a calendar so it is useful for years. The best devotional book out there. The only drawback is after ordering the book on Amazon. I found it cheaper at Hobby Lobby with a leather like cover in different colors and it was cheaper.
Disappointed when I saw that the dates went from January 1 to May 19...then from  June 4 to December 31....WHY did pages get omitted? I thought they inspected stuff when it's printed.....OMG!
I bought this for My desk at work... I absolutely love it! In fact I love it so much that I bought 2 more for gifts
I have this book and I love it to much. So go this for my friend. The size is perfect because it‚Äôs smaller than the average book and easy to take for travel.
"Encouraging and uplifting. Challenges daily to read the Word, trust the love of God and growth who God made you."
"I cannot start my day until I read the daily entry in ""Jesus Calling."" The messages provided by Sarah Young in addition to the scripture at the end of each entry are always relevant.  I often find myself reflecting on the entry throughout my busy day, and I have told all of my co-workers about this gem of a book. I even have this on my Kindle!"
"You actually feel JESUS IS SPEAKING TO YOU  AND YOUR LIFE DAILY. I purchased her other book for 4 friends.  Then, I discovered this one."
It is like each day this is written for my life. I've been reading it for almost 14 years and I love it now more than the first time I was given a copy. I've shared with so many people I couldn't keep track!!!! God Bless Jesus Calling and Sarah Young!!
"The person I gave this to , she loved it .  I have given so many of these as gifts .  I have it and I love it ."
Such an inspiration to read daily. I've been reading this with my daughter and I'm noticing a change in her attitude.
"Sarah Young is a brilliant writer. The beauty of this book is not in its devotional, but in the style of the devotional. It is written from Jesus's perspective. So instead of reading a devotional *about* Jesus, you are essentially reading a letter *from* Jesus, and it makes a world's difference. You really connect easier with Christ, and you get to see exactly what your walk is all about. Times I have been ""on the rocks,"" this book has totally and I mean, really, really lifted me up; the perfect words, the perfect letter from Jesus; so beautifully written."
"With the Amazon ratings so high, I was looking forward to reading this book of devotionals. However, I was disappointed by the writing style and the overemphasis on emotions."
"I depend  hour by minute on God for direction  I have received the discipline of reading about, listening to,  acting on The guidance of my Tribune God. By Beginning each day reading  this book."
This is a wonderful book to start each day. If you think coffee is the start your fooling yourself I am a catholic and was given a hard cover copy with travel I found the tablet method never is forgotten. Get the book hard cover or electronic and treat yourself
Everyone should have this book - great way to start off my day especially with the current craziness going on in this country.
I love this devotion.  I recently bough the kid‚Äôs version for my grandson and I love that the devotions in his book parallel the devotions in mine.  I love this devotional because it simplifies Jesus‚Äôs love for me and I love reading it and feeling as if He is speaking directly to me.
"Beautifully packaged with a gorgeous pink leather cover. Plush. Great combining of verse to encourage each day. I love this book. Perfect gift for any woman. Sarah Young, I applaud you.Get this book. It's so very full of love and life affirming."
"I have been reading a daily meditation book for several years..I had it narrowed down to 3 for this year, this book being one of them.NOT, the type I would have normally ordered. By the grace of God, I did! not a single day goes by, that I don't think how much I LOVE this book!! It is written in a way (that sounds as tho its Jesus addressing me) with suggested scripture readings to read, study and meditate on that goes with that days reading. such a fabulous Book!, I seriously cant do it justice in this review."
It is written as God is talking to you.  It is a balm for the soul.  Daily I am reminded how God loves me.
"This is the greatest little book ever!  I've been reading over and over, every year for nine years.  Start my day with it.  I always keep extras to give to people.  Everyday reminder of THE most important things to remember!"
"I bought this book for myself several weeks ago, and started with the page dated on the day I received it. Some days‚Äô devotions hit closer to home than others, but more often than not I feel it‚Äôs the message I need in that moment. I like the book so much that I‚Äôve given two as gifts."
this is the best practical chrsitain devotional i've ever read..i really like especially that the kindel book has the scriptures written out at the end of each devotional..for me to take the time to do a review is a feat in itself..but this is important...in the paper book one has to look up the scriptures of which 'cause of how my brain is wired i probable wouldn't take the time to do so.and the scriptures that go with the words are just as vital to the message sarah's wanting us to get thru gods' leading as the message it self...enjoy..worth every penny!!!sending gods' blessings to all ~
"This devotional book has been mentioned so often by many with whom I communicate that I had to get one to see for myself if it lived up to my expectations. It is quite simple, straightforward, and biblical.  Sarah Young has done a great service to others by keeping notes from her own personal devotional life and her writing ministers to people who are often too ill to dig deeply themselves.  But this is not mere reflections of another person, but rather the words from Scripture presented as personal messages from the Lord Jesus Himself to the reader.  There is great power in God's Word and this is one way of accessing that power."
I have bought this book as a gift many times. Each time the recipient has thanked me profusely. Its short daily passages speak to people as they do to me. This book is especially helpful during times of grief or upheaval.
"I purchased this Kindle book after reading many, many wonderful reviews, and I agree that this is a book to always keep handy. It's set up as a daily devotional, but I take my Kindle with me when I know I'm going to be waiting somewhere for a while, and I read many days' selections at a time. It's so wonderfully written in a conversational way with appropriate scripture verses included at the end of each day's excerpt.Give it a try; you won't be disappointed."
I live with this book and have received a wonderful relationship with my God. He sustained me through every mood and thought that I have. I specially love the full scriptures at the end of each day. I often read it to my husband at night in bed.
"In the introduction, it is explained why it is written as though Jesus is doing the talking.  Sarah Young is a wonderful author.  This small book has been a blessing to me.  I received one as a gift from my mother and have given many as gifts to others.  It is a daily devotional and starts my day off in a peaceful sate of mind.  The ribbon page marker is a blessing, no flipping through to find the next day or bookmarks to lose.  I have given this book to non-believers , so-so believers and believers. Everyone has found help and guidance and it has helped to give or strengthen their faith."
"Jesus Calling was given to me for Christmas by my niece.  Each daily reading in this book is based on the appropriate 2-3 Scripture references given at the conclusion.  Many times there are both an OT and NT passage presented.  I personally read each verse listed in four parallel translations in Bible Gateway meditating on God's Word first and letting it speak to my heart before reading Sarah's devotional.  I love the personal way that she focuses my attention on Jesus and relates it to the daily routine of living.  She shows the deeper implications of each truth and directs my thoughts immediately to Jesus.  Keeping Jesus central, focusing on His attributes, and emphasizing the importance of thanking and praising Him at all times helps me to see beyond the present circumstances.  I seek the lesson that God is attempting to teach me in the daily situations and unplanned 'interruptions or interventions' throughout the hours of each day.  It's amazing how many times the passage given that morning has prepared me to meet an unexpected challenge or to give a word of encouragement to others.  Sarah's focus and application of Scripture helps me to see the eternal plan of God in a unique perspective in the midst of the activities of daily life.  It makes each day exciting and an adventure to be, do, and say what will bring glory to my Lord and Savior."
The. Best. Devotional! Beautiful messages that are a quick and easy way to draw closer to God each day.
There is nothing to dislike in Sarah Young‚Äôs devotional. I begin my day with a cup of coffee and the day‚Äôs reading. I particularly like the fact that the Scripture readings are included. This Jesus Calling book is for anyone who needs that special reminder of God‚Äôs peace and grace in any situation that pops up or tries to linger in our lives.
"Jesus Calling has been my favorite devotional for about 6 years now and I try to keep a supply on hand to give to others. Recently a friend of mine was sentenced to prison (long story, awaiting appeal hearing), and she is using Jesus Calling there to give copies to others on her ""involuntary mission trip"". What I love so much about the way this is written is that the love of Jesus Christ is shown, never faltering, never wavering, always steadfast and willing to meet me wherever I am. As the years have moved on and I am traveling through this devotional multiple times, it is amazing how every day speaks to where I am that day. Coincidence? I think not!"
"A blessing that was gifted to me and now I have sent several of these daily devotions to grateful recipients! A selection of bible verses accompanies each devotion and truly seems as if Jesus is ""talking "" to you!"
I got this book for my mother when she was diagnosed with cancer.  I bought it again for a friend who was recently diagnosed with Parkinson's.  The daily devotions are very reassuring and really do help to bring PEACE to a person.
"Nice paper version of a Devotional. Disappointed Bible verses are not included, but the verses are at least listed"
Love this üìñ book & have in 3 sizes.  This pink one is beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏èWas a must-have recommendation to me and I say get it and read it‚ÄºÔ∏èYou will be amazed at the daily reference to your life üôè
This is a great book!  Short and to the point with so much food for thought!  I got the Christmas version and pre-ordered the Easter version!
This is a wonderful daily devotional.  It was recommended to me by a friend and now I'm recommending it.  I like the Biblical verse references at the bottom of each page.  It seems as if each day the author has written on a subject that is pertinent to me that day.  Easy to read and thought provoking.
This book has been recommended yr o me several times but finally my girls got me on board and when I went to order I found the beautifully bound copy! I love it !
Reading the daily devotions is like taking a deep breath. This has really enhanced my faith journey. It refers to scriptures at the end of each reading and it has given me an entree into the Bible which I have always found a bit daunting.
"Every day, every meditation helps me focus on my connection with God. They always lift me up and encourage me to stop wanting to be in control of everything and just rest in God's love and perfect Will instead. This book is the perfect addition to your daily prayers and spiritual practices. My faith has grown a lot stronger in the past couple of years and this book has definitely helped me on this Journey."
Sarah Young has written this book in beautiful context to scripture. She takes God's Word and applies it to our lives so God can speak to us and guide our life journey.
Not one day goes by without my reading this book.  The author Sarah Mowery interprets passages from the Bible in simple everyday language that will lead you day by day into the presence of the Lord.  You will be blessed each time you read it.  I give it out as gifts to friends.
"Great book; is my 5th (or more) copy. Kept giving away my prior copies to encourage others, so bought it again for myself. The words are encouraging and strengthening - Scripture based (and referenced on each page).Received my book al little early (THANK YOU) & new condition (looked as though a label or pricing sticker had been removed; ""glue-like"" residue).Would recommend this to everyone!"
"I have been using this devotional for the last three years. At first I was using Jesus Today which has a focus on Hope, but a friend convinced me to change to this devotional - focused on His Peace. This devotional has guided me through some difficult life changes in my 50s. I have fallen in love with the Lord (again) and am so grateful to be in His loving care. The scriptures are life giving and healing. I need that on a daily basis."
Love this book. So inspirational. Everyday seems to fit the day you read. I have bought and given many as gifts.
I received this book from my neighbor. It has become one of my favorite books. I look forward to reading it every morning. It starts my day off in such a positive light. I have bought about eight more and have given them as gifts. Everyone that has gotten one has said the same thing. I highly recommend this book.
"Sarah Young's ""Jesus Calling"" is hands down the best daily devotional I've ever read. I've been working through it for the past two years, and it never gets old. The entries are short, sweet, and thought-provoking, and each one includes a few Bible verses to chew on as well. What amazes me most about the book is how well the messages line up with day-to-day life and the struggles I face. And I know it's not just me. I recommend this book to all my friends and they all love it too. Each devotion is written like a note from Jesus to you. It's encouraging and helpful. I can certainly say I've grown a lot from reading this book. I've become a much more optimistic, joyful person, and I've learned to trust God in all areas of my life. Definitely getting Sarah Young's other devotional books soon!"
Helps understand the Bible immensely.Good motivatorGets you in the habit of reading bible üôè‚ô•Ô∏è
"Jesus Calling is a well-written, well understandable devotional that takes the scriptures and puts them in practical ways to apply them.  I went through it last year and now am using its equal Jesus Calling morning and evening."
"This book is a beautiful reminder of our Lord's love for us. It is truly a daily blessing and is backed up with scripture. I love it so much I've given at many away as gifts and every person who has received one loves it too.I first learned of it from a friend on FaceBook who posted a few daily devotionals online. It is also available as an iPhone app. There is an iPhone app that gives a free 7 days of devotionals to try it out, then if you like it you can purchase the full book. I tried the free version and loved it so much, I gave Kindle versions to some friends and purchased the hard copy books to my older friends who prefer book form.I highly recommend this book!"
"This is an amazing book. It seems as if, every day, the passages speak to each person's unique situation that day. It helps me to begin my day with a personal moment with Christ. For me, it's with a daily message from the Lord; reminding me that He is walking with me through whatever happens."
This little daily devotional has helped me throu my moms illness and passing over the last 3 weeks.  Everyday has been sop on.  Highly suggest
Everyone should buy this book.  I'm on my second year reading this daily.  I bought this for someone else and it also has changed their life. it is short and sweet everyday to help you get through your life.  It's just like Jesus is sitting with you in conversation.  It's the best !!!
"Excellent daily reading for reminding me of who Jesus is and how I can find my strength in Him alone. Keeps me grounded in the here and now as well as the hope of eternity.I read it every day and it feels like He is talking to me exactly what I need to hear. It's comforting and calming, reminding me that I do not have to live so stressed and trying to control everything; for that is an illusion. Only God is in control.I brought several copies to give as gifts and everyone I gave it to has thoroughly enjoed it as well. I am thinking of buying more to give as gifts because it has been appreciated by others."
"A wonderfully inspiring book with a short devotional reading for every day of the year. It doesn't matter which day of the year you start it, just put the marker ribbon in and open it back up the next day. It is better to start your day with it, the earlier the better. I love the way ""Jesus Calling"" gets my attention when in the vicinity of the book."
"Either you are having a good day or a bad day, this book is for you!It opens you up to things that you really need to hear.It reinforces that God is with you at all times.Wonderful!Highly recommend!!!"
"I have made this part of my daily Bible reading for the past 7 months and it has become invaluable to me in my walk. I often refer back to previously read pages for guidance or reminders. What's nice is that there is a page for every calendar day of the year, but no year date meaning it can be re-read daily, year after year. A living sister-in-Christ turned me toward this devotional and I've shared or purchased copies for others. I highly recommend it, to all who seek to enhance their Biblical reading or studies."
"I am very disappointed because I got the audio book so I could put it in my car and listen to in the mornings on the way to work, which I can, except thwy do not read any of the scripture that they reference! They spit 2-4 bible verses so fast that even if I had a bible ready, I couldn't look it up fast enough. If you get this, know that you will need to be somewhere with a pen and paper ready to write down the scripture references and look them up yourself."
"This little book is a wonderful tool for cultivating daily prayer and meditation. Years ago a friend gave me a copy, which I read through a couple of times and eventually gave to another friend. After a while, I missed it so much I had to buy another copy for myself. Young's prose is creative yet reverential, and the Biblical references are a helpful tool for further reading."
Most inspiring and comforting devotional I have ever read. This devotional is one of the best devotionals out there to encourage people to deal with loss in their life or if they just want to grow close to God. It is like getting a personal message from Jesus each day. I absolutely recommend it to anyone who has not read it. It also makes a great gift to friends and loved ones. If they read it it will bring them great comfort and peace.
Daily Bible reading is a must for me to handle each day and this devotional book is second to my Bible. The daily readings are short and there are days that the words seem to be written with me in mind. I have given copies to several friends and acquaintances and they feel the same. Our church bought a copy for each member and some special friends of the church who aren't always able to make the longer drive to get to their church so they drop in and worship with us. Lovely gift for those you care about.
"I bought this for my wife and she's enjoyed reading it everyday before going to bed. She loves reading for multiple reasons: for self-improvement, strengthening her faith, or for daily devotional. So far, she's been faithfully keeping up with this one and that's a good sign. She's mentioned really enjoying the style in which it is written (as though from Jesus' perspective). Maybe she'll let me borrow it when she's done."
"This is what I call a ‚Äúsoothing‚Äù daily devotional in that the writings are from God‚Äôs speaking to us. This was a bit off putting initially but then it started to flow.Short daily devotional, no more than 1/2 a page with three accompanying Scriptures."
"Sarah Young has done much research and engaged in deep prayer prior to writing this awesome devotional.  It starts the day off well providing you also read and meditate on the scriptures at the end of each devotion.  Always remember that this is a devotional, not the Bible.  Only the Bible provides what we really need as we go through this life together.  The devotional points you to Jesus and is written from her heart.  Enjoy it because millions have found comfort and inspiration by this devotional.  I love it!"
This is my personal daily devotional & I love it. It‚Äôs very insightful and scriptural based. I highly recommend this book.
I started reading this daily devotional mid-January and I look forward to it everyday. It has helped me more than I ever expected. I was recommended it due to difficult times in my life and it definitely helps make the bad days not-as-bad-as-they-could-be. All you need is a little Faith to get started!
Beautiful devo!! Love the larger layout and print!! Beautiful as a gift!! Color is amazing too.
"Awesome word for the day. The book is of good quality, feels great in your hand. I take on the go with a few other books always with me. Definitely recommend!"
"Words cannot express how much this book has helped, me especially this past year which has been the roughest of my life... it's as if God is speaking directly to me each day and I have a peace I've never known in my 38 years! I think everybody needs a copy of this to keep with them at all times, I know I do! Thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è"
I received the book today and it is not the 2014 Deluxe edition.  It is the 2004 small book that does not have the scripture verses written out.  Instead - it has the Bible scripture and verse references.
"This is one of the best daily devotional books, that I have had the honor of reading. Each day's devotional is awesome. You learn so much about having the presence of God with you, each and everyday. It is like a guide to live by. Anyone that would like a daily devotional book; this is the best. Each day, you find something that brings you closer to understanding what God wants all of us to do. I would highly recommend this book to any one. It is powerful and a joy to read.The order was handled with speed and it was more than I dreamed it would be. Price is the best I have found.It brings new understanding to the way a person lives. It also directs a person in the way God intends for us to go through life. You look forward to each new day, to see what powerful message is to be read that day.Enjoy this awesome book,33 Sunshine"
More beautiful than expected. High quality binding. I will definitely be purchasing many more of these books as gifts for family and friends. Vendor delivered earlier than expected. This is a fine vendor.
"A  friend gave me this book when my husband died suddenly. It is wonderful...just like sitting there talking to Jesus. This has been much more helpful than the other so called ""self help"" books I received on how to deal with loss. I ordered the Kindle edition so I could carry it with me on my phone everywhere."
"This book is amazing, and I would highly recommend it to anyone! I buy these to give away to other Christians, and they then end up doing the same. I can't highly enough recommend this book. It offers daily devotions on passages and themes in the bible, but it's from the perspective and speech of Jesus. It's as if He is training and encouraging you every single day. There's also a kid's version, which is also wonderful for little ones. A great family reading/discussing opportunity every day.The book was shipped as promised, and was received in amazing condition."
Great way to start the day.  Having the Bible passages included makes a big difference.  No need to have both the book and Bible with you.
This has to be one of my favorite devotional books ever!  It feels like the words are spoken directly to me in exactly the way I need them.  Each day is a direct message with three scriptures to study.  I bought one for myself and one for my husband so we could share and discuss how it touched our lives or gave us direction.
This book has truly been a blessing to me and my family and friends.. I received this as a gift two years ago.  I  received many blessings I read it over and over each year. I Purchased 13 copies of this book for friends and family  over the years.  It is truly a  God inspired  devotional..
This book is made to read again and again. Every time you read it you will be blessed again and find something you missed the last time. I look so forward to the devotionals every morning.
"I keep giving my copies away, so had to replenish! I am amazed at how it speaks from""God"" tense, just the words I need to hear for that day or week. Full of grace, encouragementand love - if you're needing a friend to encourage you, and your in a lonely place - this willhelp immensely!"
"This author really has the hand of God on her and it shows in the way the devotions are written. The book is written in first person (as if God wrote this himself) and it's his voice you feel speak to your heart. I've bought about ten of these books to give to my kids and friends because we all need to know now much Jesus loves us. The words will inspire you, give you hope and a future if you choose to trust in Jesus. Jeremiah 29:11. Buy this book! You will not be disappointed!"
I was given this devotional by a friend. I love reading daily devotions especially when it fits my day. Which happens quite often. I bought the devotional for my daughter.
"I got this as a gift, and now I give these as gifts.  This book is a Perfect way to start the day.  The inspiration is short and sweet.  You do not need to be a Bible scholar to understand its messages. It seems like the messages are the exact words I need to hear for that exact day."
"InspirationalThought provokingReal life experiences, truth Bible backed would read over and over every single year!  Great devotional love it"
Perfect for busy people and I‚Äôm loving the content of this little devotional book.  I‚Äôm finding it easy to read to understand and pray along with.  I can relate to some entries and this devotional is helping me to understand that God does and always will love me.
"It would be great to live in a world with no sorrow ,no pain, no tears and no fears! We all can live in Heaven by believing in Jesus as our Messiah who takes our sins away and gives us eternal life with him in Paradise . Until this day comes we can spend time daily with Jesus in Sarah's  wonderful book ""Jesus Calling"". Sarah weaves verses from the Bible into her suggested conversations we can have daily with Jesus. Jesus  is always with us  and wants to help and guide us through the times of trouble as well as the times of Joy.  Try this book and you will find the peace in his presence!  We can choose Jesus or Satan  and Heaven or Hell for eternity. If you are unsure of your faith read this book in a quiet  place.  See how much better your life on earth can be with Jesus as your guide. Enjoy the peace for as many years as you have left on this earth and prepare yourself for the wonders ahead of you in Paradise!  8-2-16 Mike Fisher"
Pairs very well with the adult version so that you can discuss daily devotional together.
"Was given one during my cancer journey, gave it to another cancer friend. Just bought this copy for another friend. It‚Äôs that special"
Someone posted the October 10 devotion on Facebook and I was blown away!! It spoke directly to me and I had to get this book immediately . The daily devotion has me just about in tears every morning because it so speaking to everything I am going thru and it's like hearing Jesus say these words directly to me. This is a devotion Ill probably be reading the rest of my life!!
"I had been given this book as a gift & I can honestly say, for me, it has been life changing & has truly made me aware of the presence of God in my life & the way to not be anxious but to draw on the peace of God always."
"I have read this little gem almost every day for a few years. There's just something about it that blesses my life. I recently gave two as gifts, and I was told they are amazed be this God inspired daily devotional. I highly recommend."
"Gives peace, joy and guidance to those who may or may not have time to pick up the Bible."
"This is my 2nd devotional by Sarah Young (I got Jesus Today a few years ago whilst recovering from really ill health and really recommend that too) and this is actually my 2nd cycle (2nd year in a row) doing this 1-year devotional. I'm pretty surprised that I haven't already reviewed it as I finished it last year and immediately started over.Anyway, this review has been wonderful for the last 2 years. It has been an amazing blessing to my life offering me quick daily snippets of encouragement, reminders and perfect words to feed my faith and remind me of what would Jesus do (or rather what would Jesus say). Every single devotion written by the author is backed by several verses that you can memorize and use throughout the day to encourage yourself and others and remind yourself of God's faithfulness even in times when you feel alone or overwhelmed. Every single devotional was easy to understand and read and spoke to a gap or need that each of us encounters in our daily life. God's word truly is relevant and food for the soul even in our modern contemporary times. This is an excellent devotional for anyone who wants to feel closer to Jesus and to learn to rely on Him for all the stresses of modern life.I like this devotional so much that I got it for my brother as well and is be doing a 3rd cycle in a row for 2017 if not that I just discovered that Sarah Young has a new devotional out which I've promptly bought of course and am looking forward to. I may take a break from this devotional for 2017 but it is definitely a keeper to bookmark and refer to for those hard days where we need to surround ourselves with the Grace of Our Lord and reminders of His promises! Get this devotional, it will bless your life!"
"After positive reviews from friends, I bought Jesus is Calling by Sara Young  for my mother-in-law for Christmas.  She actually called me several weeks after Christmas and told me she really enjoys this devotional and it is hard for her to not read ahead to the next one.  Highly recommend!"
"These converted Biblical verse translations are exactly what I need to begin or end every single day.  I have learned so much of the Bible but mostly that Jesus is my utmost, dearest  friend, my savior and one that is constantly with me whether I choose to acknowledge Him or not.  I have so enjoyed this book and have gifted it to others with pride.  I have also purchased and downloaded it to my Kindle Fire so I 'll have it with me even when traveling or away from my beautiful , leather bound book.  Thank you Sarah Young for bringing HIS words to my heart and soul."
This is the best book ever.... have given many for gifts....  This Leather one is very nice..... Bought it for a thank you gift for a friend.....  You just can't go wrong with this devotional..... for any age.....
"Great daily devotions, with scriptures for reference. Has one for everyday of the year!"
"I chose the rating because it does a number of things fundamental to having an intimate relationship with Christ, the living Savoir who died for my sins, and those of the world. First, it always puts the focus on Jesus, not myself, or my performance, second, there are constant reminders of God's love for His children, third, ther are constant reminders of the need to be thankful, especially when htings aren't going well, or life doesn't make sense. Fourth,there are constant reminders of the gift of God's Spirit, who helps us to think and act in harmony with His will, and of the power of God, and His infinite wisdom. It helps so much in keeping God at the center of what I think and do."
"I am not really into daily readings and interpretations of the Bible.  I prefer to read the original verses in context on my own.  But this was recommended by a friend and it has been helpful in knowing where she is coming from.  If daily readings and insights of others is your thing, then this is excellent.  Just not particularly my way of dealing with each day."
"If you are looking for a devotional to begin your day or your prayer time, then this is the book for you. Everytime I read the passage for the day it is always something that I can relate to. Written in modern everyday language, and the passages aren't very long. But they are VERY POWERFUl. Several people in my office had seen it on my desk and picked it up. They said that they really liked it. So this Christmas I ordered 3 to give away as gifts. Need I say more? Please get a copy of this devotional and you will feel grounded in your Christian walk throughout the day. A WONDERFUL BOOK to own !!"
An excellent book. Has three scriptures with each daily devotion. Easy to read. Not too long.
"When I was going through a rough time in my life a friend gave me this little devotional.  It took me a few days to actually open it and start reading it because I was going through a depression.  On day one I started reading and it was like Jesus was speaking right to my heart...and each day I was eager to hear what he had to say.  I have purchased over 12 copies of this book and each time I have a friend that reaches out in need, I bless them with a copy.  Everyone should own a copy of this small devotional...life changing."
"Great daily devotional book to revive our hearts toward a close personal relationship with Jesus!  Has short daily messages from God, encouraging the reader to trust God, etc.  Also, each day has two Scripture references to look up! :)  This is designed to help a Christian sense that Jesus is very interested in us, and wants us to walk with Him, talk with Him, and rely on Him through each day!"
Got this for me and my sister . Now friends are asking for it.  It really speaks to you.
Love this devotional! lways what I need each day.  I have been reading this book of devotionals for several years!
"I set my Alexa to remind me to read each morning. Starts out the day in a very positive way. Highly recommend.  I received as a gift, and turned around and bought two more as gifts for others."
"Jesus Calling:Enjoying Peace in His PresenceThis is a permanent daily devotional that is beautifully written by Sarah YoungSarah and her husband had devoted their lives to God and His teachings. She heldseveral degrees and was a counselor on their mission trips and her husand was anordained minister leading congregations on their mission assignments.In the devotional she speaks as Jesus is talkin directly to you and the wordsHe speaks are referenced in the several scripture readings at the bottom ofeach page for verification by the reader. Often the day's reading melds withthe problems or tasks met during that day. This is a wonderful, sensitivedevotional that everyone should have, it will give the reader many thoughtfulpoints of view from our Lord's perspective which is often very inspiring tothe reader and a new way to behave in their walk in Jesus presence.I highly recommend  ""Jesus Calling,"" for everyone. Enjoy and live with Jesusin your life, everyday in everyway. Blessed are the peace makers.¬†

  
Jesus Calling: Enjoying Peace in His Presence"
"There are very few books that can change your life.  This is one of them.  I have never been able to practice daily devotions until I got this book.  The book really speaks to me.  I was given a hard copy as a gift and then I purchased the Kindle edition so that it is easy to travel with.  I have given this book as a gift to 3 different people.  The friend that I see most frequently told me that the book really spoke to her heart.  If I could give this book more than 5 stars, I would."
"I have this book on my Kindle and it has the scriptures written out.  I bought this for a friend, but the scriptures are not written out.  It never occurred to me that they would not be.  When I looked at other reviews, some said they liked that the scriptures were written out, others said they were disappointed that the scriptures were not written out.  Clearly there are different books being sent out for the same listing.  Not good."
It is the perfect little pick me up and something to contemplate on every single day.
"My mother sent me this book because she has one and thought I'd like it too.  As I started reading each day, I began to feel a calmness come over me.  The daily encouraging words remind me to be thankful for my life.  I talk to God more often now during the day.  I feel secure knowing He is with me all the time.  We often talk to God about our troubles but now I say thank you when things are going my way or just because I feel joy when I think about God.  I have bought four more Jesus Calling books and I'm giving them to my friends so we can talk about the daily readings.  I'm sure I will be buying more books to give out.  Jesus Calling is a daily part of my life now and has helped me become more spiritual."
Awesome devotional.  One page devotions....written from the perspective of Jesus speaking directly to the reader.  Each page also ends with biblical passages to meditate on.  I find this very encouraging.  My sister says she has gone back to this book over the years and always finds it fresh.  One theme is: Life can be hard.  I am always with you.  The awesome holiness of God is also a foundation of this book.  I also have this on my tablet as an e-book.  This is a great gift idea.
Start everyday with this devotional abs you will feel good !!! I have been rereading this book over and over each year abs always find it applies on that day no matter what !
"Must have, must read, daily, never goes out of date, simply match the day and the word will provide you everything you need."
"What a wonderful book, I have owned for years and keep re-reading every year, this year I bought 5 more to give away to people who are struggling and need His presence close to them."
I friend of mine had given me a copy of the book and I liked it so much I got one for my son-in-law. The sort paragraphs are uplifting and give me a good start on my day. I've had mine over a month and haven't missed a day.G
"This book is extraordinary. I read each daily passage in the morning before I start my day and find it so comforting, and relevant, to my life. I was also surprised to learn that many of my friends and family own it too, and they all adore it. It really makes one mindful of the things that are really important in this life, and that is a wonderful way to start each day that God gives us. I have started giving it to friends and family on their birthdays, or just because, and I think it makes a wonderful gift."
I have given away copies of this book to so many people and it is always very much enjoyed.  Everyone has said that it impacts them greatly and feel as though it was written for them.
Jesus calling was introduced to me by my sister this summer as I was helping her get through a tough time in her life and move.  We sat together and read the daily devotionals and the scripture reading attached to them.  These gave both of us peace and hope in a stressful situation.  I knew that I had to obtain a copy of the devotions for myself.  I have kept the tradition of reading and meditating on each days readings and have felt further peace and understanding of my relationship with Jesus.  I highly recommend this to anyone who wants peace and hope in their lives.
"I didn't realize I was buying a smaller version of my copy.  However, this was a gift and my cousin loves reading this book every morning."
"I have mixed feelings about a writer representing anything as from the point of view of God.  It's ok, we seek a new devotional book every year, and this one is in the middle of the pack after 14 years of marriage."
"WOW! I can't say enough about how wonderful this book is.  It's absolutely amazing, because I can be reading the devotion for today and I just have to shake my head with the feeling that this particular days' devotion was written just for me.  Not once have I read where she glorifies herself with her works.  Always her focus has been God.  If that ever changes, I will stop reading.  Thank you Sara.  God Bless You for the encouragement you have brought me and many others.  Just today I gave one of my friends the book."
The Jesus Calling devotional is wonderful. It really helps you to start your day out right.
"It's like Jesus sitting on your shoulder knowing what you are thinking today or yesterday or tomorrow and giving advice and why not to feel that way.  Sarah writes as though she's been there and relaying to me what Jesus indicated to her at those times.  It is a refreshing ""sermonette"" that doesn't make one feel shame or belittlement.  It is excellent for those who battle Borderline Personality disorder, and other emotional-type disorders and tend to blame themselves at any point.  One does not have to have an emotional disorder to benefit from Sarah's writings to anyone although it was meant towards those of us who are more sensitive to stimuli than others.  One paragraph gives me enough to think on and adjust my behavior accordingly."

I can't begin to tell how much I love this book!! I feel like Jesus is speaking to me every day through the words in this book. My days are better after reading and concentrating on the words for each day. I have bought many copies of this book and given them to many of my friends. Thanks to Sarah Young for spending time in God's presence and revealing his words to the world!!
"I was given this devotional and really love how it touches what you deal with every day.  I decided to buy some and have them available to give to friends when I felt lead.  Everyone I have given them to love them as well.  I was surprised when I ran into a  woman I gave a copy to about a year ago and she should me she carries it with her in her purse.  She pulled it out and I saw all the little notes she had scribbled on the pages.  She told me she is going through it the second time now, and it still speaks to her each time."
I have seen celebrities post this and just other normal people and let me tell you.. I love this devotional and it helps me out during my devotion time when I don‚Äôt know what to read about!
"I was burdened by many of  the trials and problems that life gives us.  It was disturbing my sleep and giving me worry lines.  I know from the scriptures that God does not want me to worry about tomorrow.  However, I was finding it difficult to let go.  A friend had a copy of Jesus Calling on her desk at work.  I picked it up and thumbed through it.  I found comfort in her words.  I purchased a copy and each morning I read the devotional  for that day and read the scripture that goes with it.  Nothing can get rid of the concerns of this life but the uplifting spirit of this book has been instrumental in helping  me rest better and not worry so much."
"i open this devotional and every day there seems to be just what i need that day. always, always, the message is to get back to Jesus, focus on Jesus and let all the other cares and worries fade away. Trusting and having faith in jesus every day will get me through the day. I was a very negative person and since I've been reading this devotional i have changed myself to try to find peace in the moment with Jesus, don't worry ahead, focus on jesus in the present and his promises for me. I am a long time christian but wasn't putting certain things into practice. Between this devotional and another one i bought i have changed myself and it's amazing how much happier i have been. I have truly been enjoying peace in his presence."
"I got this as a gift for my dad a couple Christmases ago, he loved it and told me this year at Christmas as he finished it and was looking for a new devotional that it is his favorite one to date and that he may just re-read that one instead of getting a new one."
"Unlike the plethora of other spiritual books, this particular selection is perfect for the everyday, and so far, has reached me on a level that is relatable to my everyday walk with Christ.  For instance, today was talking about setbacks being labeled as opportunities to grow with Him and to see these opportunities as just that, instead of a negative.  I've recently experienced several opportunities that changed my life, and I'm praying that I will see the positive from God soon.  Great book for kids as well."
"I have been following the Jesus calling for over 4 years. I began in preparation before loosong my son in 2014. God gave His peace to me through this study with Sarah. He has sustained me as my journey in grief grows w strength. I am now at a point in which I can thank Him for this trial. God bless everyone who reads this series. I have passed each book to my friend, sending the strength along to others."
Very pretty little book. Nicely designed with daily devotionals and noted scripture.
This is great for a gift or for yourself.  Love reading the uplifting messages every day!!
"I love this book. It‚Äôs an easy to read, daily inspiration. It‚Äôs well written. The cover is very pretty and soft. It doesn‚Äôt crease like a soft cover book but is just as flexible. I highly recommend this book."
I believe this is the first review I have ever written but I thought it was important for me to write it. I absolutely love this book and all her other books. They have answered many of my prayers in a very powerful way. The messages are beautiful and timely. I personally feel like God is speaking directly to me through these devotionals. I truly recommend you buy this book.
So far I'm really enjoying this book alot! Easy to read and very well written.
"This made a great gift for someone who'd heard of the book's predecessor, God Calling, & really liked that.  Uplifting, well thought out content, & nice quality cover."
"Jesus calling his been a daily devotional for me for five years. I have four or five hard copies of this book. But I have especially enjoyed reading it online. I begin my quiet time every day with it and I often read it several times during the day. I've given it to every family member in my family,  believers and nonbelievers. I've given it to those who don't know the Lord and they have come closer to know the Lord or received him. I've given it to many who are depressed and fighting with difficult life situations and they have received healed. It's one of the best tools I know (other than listening to the still small voice of God, and reading His word/the Bible) of connecting with Jesus and allowing his love to permeate my being. It helps me abide in Christ every day. I'm ever grateful for Sarah Ypung.  I have also struggled with issues that she has struggled with including Lyme disease, I am in full-time ministry with my husband.  We are church planters in Northern VA.  God bless Sarah Young!  God bless all who work with her in publishing and communicating the Lords work in her life so that other people can grow closer to Him."
I have total enjoyed this daily unequal book.  It seems to be just the spiritual nourishment I need each day.  Highly recommende.
"I feel like the Lord is talking to me when I read these devotions. It is worded in the first person and I love it! I look forward to reading it everyday. This book is very uplifting as it reminds me that the Holy Spirit is with me and all around me. And that God does not want us to feel alone or sad or discouraged. I suffered from depression, anxiety and panic attacks for a long time. While everyday can be a struggle, these devotions help put me at ease."
My favorite devotional! Have read it many times and given many as gifts. It‚Äôs always relevant and it has encouraged me many times. Highly recommend!
"I have started many devotional, and never finished them; but this one is different.  It truly brings you into the presence of Jesus.  When days seem overwhelming and you can't seem to wrap your mind around the events of the day or to come, you pick up your Bible and can't seem to remember where  the scriptures are you need to read; thru' her journey to draw closer to the Lord, Sarah helps us to understand that Jesus is right there waiting for us to just talk with Him and release all that is weighing us down.  The Scriptures and references are there for that moment to enter into that closer relationship and grow deeper with Him."
This is the BEST devotional book ever !! It‚Äôs like God speaks right to you !
I enjoy having the small hardback as well as the Kindle version. The daily devotional with scriptures are always available no matter where I am. Sarah Young's writing as if from the voice of God is inspiring to me and I like that the thoughts are supported by scripture.
"For many years I have read, and re-read the book, ""A Course in Miracles,"" the center-piece in my spiritual awakening, andnow, daily thinking.  ""Great"" as this book is, I have often wished for a little book, that was - essentially - a valuablesummary of ACIM . . . sort of, ""the meat-and-potatoes.""  As ACIM is a long book, and not an easy read (at least it was not for me, the first two readings!!!),  I think ""Jesus Calling"" is the perfect companion to ACIM - a power-packed ""little book,""full of spiritual wisdom, easy to read - and you can easily carry it with you, wherever you go ----"
"I have now purchased at least 20 of these for my friends and my employees as they all really like this book.  It was recommended to me by my mental therapist (to my surprise) and I use it like my horoscope for the day.  Love it!  Easy to read and doesn't take more than a minute a day!  For a nicer or gift version, the padded cover or leather cover ones are nice too.  I am getting ready to see if I can order it for my ipad too so I can have it when I travel."
This book has been a part of my daily meditation for years. It‚Äôs uncanny how each day‚Äôs message speaks directly to me on what‚Äôs happening in my life at that time.
"awesome book for you or anyone - great encouragement ----  you are never alone  -- I buy these and put them in the infusion center where I get my chemo treatment, they are always gone the next day :)"
"It was a great starting book for me to improve my communication with God.It was easy to read, and very enjoyable."
"Every morning Jesus speaks to me personally as I read the message for the day.  This book will draw you closer to Him as you realize that He is speaking to you.  When I think that I am the only one, I realize I am not alone in my trials and journey to know Jesus.  The passages from the Bible listed at the end take the message I have just read and moves me to a higher understanding of how Jesus is speaking to me and what He expects me to do to help myself along the way.  He also reassures me that He walks with me every step of the way, everyday!  I love this book and have purchased several for my sister and friends.My day is not complete without reading the message in ""Jesus Calling"".  Thanks so much to Sarah Young for sharing her thoughts and walking this journey with her sisters in Christ!"
"I use this book each and every day. It makes me feel like I have a private communication line to Jesus.  It helps me tremendously.  I have bought multiple copies for friends.  I would highly recommend this book to everyone, and I do."
"Reading this devotional is like getting a warm hug.  The author puts things in such a way that I feel comforted.  It's not like all of the other devotionals I've read.  It different, in a good way, as if Jesus himself were talking to you."
"Great meditation to start the day or any time of the day. Infused with the word and simple true meanings of who God, Jesus and The Holy Spirit is and the direction they provide in your life as you trust in them. Increases your relationship. I have gifted many of these Jesus Calling books. It meets you right where you are fir that day. Each one individually. It began as a gift to me"
I am really bummed I bought this book for my cousin and it said that it had the scripture in it when I read all the reviews this is an excellent book but some of them only have a reference to the verse and some of them have the actual verse written in them this one while it said it had the verse in it it did not it only had the reference to it I'm going to try to return this and buy the proper one that actually has the full verse not just a reference to the verse it's an excellent book don't get me wrong I bought this book for tons of people but it's always frustrating when I try to get the one that has the verses actually in it and they send the one that only has a reference to it
Was thinking this book was Bigger but With Everything it has in it its worth it! I love it
Amazing...I write in a prayer journal every morning while having my morning coffee.  Then I open the Jesus Calling boo so see what the message of the day is...and it gives me goose bumps at how many times the subject of the message is the very same subject I had written about in my prayer journal.  Really makes one  know that the Lords is really speaking to you.
The book Jesus Calling is great!  Have it on my Kindle.  Saw this one & thought it was different.  So now on my Kindle I have Jesus Calling & another Jesus Calling with a pink cover.  My mistake!!
"After my husband passed away, a niece gave me this book. I love it. There have been many, many days when the reading of the day was exactly what I needed to make it through the day.  It reinforces the fact that God has a plan for each of us and is with us everyday."
"This is one of those books that you will want to pass on and on.  It was given to me by a friend, who received one from an acquaintance he met at the hospital.  I‚Äôve been purchasing them to pass as well.  It is written as though Jesus is speaking directly to you in the loving way you would expect."
Great book!!! Everyone should have this book! I love it!!! Very day I read it and it brings life to my life.
Thia is such a great book that also gives you scripture to follow up on in the bible.
"Am considering obtaining more copies for friends.  It makes one think, ""Hey, Jesus really means what he says.""  The capitalization of personal pronouns for Jesus is distracting to me (to quote the eminent Bruce M. Metzger, in the introduction to the NRSV, ""...the use of capital letters for pronouns that refer to the Diety...is an unnecessary innovation that has only recently been introduced into a few English translations of the Bible.""), but the essential message is very personal and attention-getting."
"Apparently, some people have ordered abd hoe the book with the bible verses included.  Mine did not. It makes it harder because the bible i have is not the same version used for this book so i have to go online to look up the verses."
"While this book is written for men, so many of the principles can be used for women as well. It gives women perspective and insight into what the men in their lives may be going through. I have had the privilege of seeing this at a birds eye view as I am the authors spouse. But I am writing this review as an avid reader and as someone who has gotten so much knowledge from this book. Read it for yourself! You won‚Äôt be disappointed."
"As a wife to Marine Corpse Combat Veteran (5 tours in Iraq & Afganist√°n), I think it‚Äôs fairto say, I understand the importance of a man learning to, ‚Äúwage the war within.‚Äù On a quest to better understand my husband, and his battle cry- I decided to educate myself, and come from a place of understanding. I truly received that, and so much more from this book. Forever grateful, and will always value what came from this."
"This book, along with the 1st one by the same author, ""Cry Like a Man"" are must-reads not only for Black men, but all men, and women too. The author's own transparency with emotional trauma and triumphs gives the reader a hand to hold, shoulder to cry on, and the much needed pat on the back encouragement needed to navigate & improve emotional and mental struggles. Thank you Jason Wilson!"
I randomly came across Jason on Instagram one day. I began to follow his page because I enjoyed the message he was conveying with the youth in his area. Then I saw the book and thought why not? So glad I bought it because I‚Äôm only one chapter in and I can‚Äôt wait to get through the rest of it. Every human on this earth shares some kind of similarity in what they‚Äôve been through whether it be big or small and Jason does a great job of really making you look inside yourself. I‚Äôve never met this man before but I feel like I‚Äôve known him for a long time through his words. I highly recommend you pick this book up if you‚Äôre looking for a little motivation when it comes to looking at yourself in the mirror and wanting to improve every aspect of yourself. I‚Äôm onto the next chapter now.
"I was drawn to Jason Wilson from the very first time I saw a viral video of him on the internet; immediately I knew what I saw was special and I wanted to know how to be like that. Honestly, I wish I had this sooner so that id not be digging myself out of the whole I dug myself into. Get the book. Do the work. Become a better you. Repeat. Encourage others to become their comprehensive selves."
I love the way Mr. Wilson breaks down the barriers that men go through.  He has great insight on the walls that are built around us and how to break them down.  I highly recommend this book and hope there are more books coming soon.  God bless Mr. Wilson and thank you so much!
Holding back tears right now while typing this. No it‚Äôs not tears of pain or sorrow but tears of joy and fulfillment. I‚Äôve completed the most powerful book I ever read ‚ÄúBattle Cry Waging and Winning the War Within‚Äù by Jason Wilson.In his book he‚Äôs very transparent about his life and overcoming obstacles in faced from being a child to his adulthood. In this book I also read about myself and things I‚Äôve also went through. Waging and winning the war within trust and patience for self. Again I highly recommend it.
"I began reading this book several days ago and have found it tough to put down. It is filled with truth about where we are as men, what we can become, what we are called to be, and ideas about how to get there. Mr. Wilson shares practical and Word breathed practices men (and women) can use to reach our full potential as leaders in our homes, work, and life. Well written and introspective."
"Mr. Wilson, much in the same way as Cry Like A Man, does not disappoint with this book. It should be required reading for many of our at-risk youth (as well as adults). Highly recommend."
"The strength that It takes to be introspective and question ones reality in order to create a new one, is exemplified in this book by Mr Wilson. Real strength is not just found in physical ability, but also in emotional and spiritual vulnerability and this is what I love most about this book. Jason is open, honest and relatable in his journey of self discovery."
Great read thank you Mr. Jason appreciate taking time with this book very helpful bringing a better understanding of life  for men dealing with emotional issues from our past!
This book has helped me so much and I‚Äôm only half way through with it. I have learned how to handle and communicate with myself since reading this book.
This book should be read by all men. Most men carry and keep in so much years of pain that handles their growth and enjoyment of life. This book gives you the perspective and mindset to conquer that all and start living your best life today
Every man needs to read this book!! It doesn‚Äôt matter how old. I‚Äôm 21 and it‚Äôs changed my life and put me on a new path of knowing how to deal with emotional trauma. Get this book for yourself or any man you know
"This is a much needed book in today‚Äôs society. So thank you Jason, we appreciate you so much! I recommend this to book every man out there. Im certain you will find this book to be very beneficial."
Engaging and laid out with practical things you can do now to put the offered wisdom into practice.
Thank you jason!
I recommend everybody read this book
"So many great lessons, at 38 years old just wish I had this book 20 years ago. Looking forward to becoming a comprehensive man."
"Great read, ordered his other book reading it now!"
"Very insightful, well written, and eye opening."
Helpful for mental health
"So, I stumbled upon Cave313 on Instagram one day. It was the author Jason Wilson‚Äôs video of a young boy crying as he tried to pass a martial arts test in which Jason teaches. The video was so moving and powerful that I was in tears before it was over. But they were happy tears due to his handling of the kids emotions as well as the end result which was the little boy passing the test with great adulation! At that very moment I started following Cave313 and eventually in turn, Mr. Jason Wilson. As of this writing, it may be the most profound thing to ever happen to me as my entire body just got cold chills saying that !! This book is just an amazing read as well as it equips you with tools to use on a daily basis to help you control as well as recognizing your emotions. For FAR TOO LONG, I have let my mouth be controlled by emotions and hurting way too many people including my family, friends and now unfortunately my EX wife. I firmly believe if I would‚Äôve gotten to read this prior to my marital problems, I may actually still be married. She too would‚Äôve needed to read it because only two people can make marriage the beautiful Union and institution that God intended. I will be starting Chapter 9 tonight or tomorrow but I don‚Äôt want this book to end. So much so that I have taken countless screenshots to go back and reference after I completely finish. And when I do finish, I feel pretty certain I will read it again and again. It‚Äôs truly THAT HELPFUL coupled with the spiritual and martial arts principles that he uses to reference his writing.It‚Äôs truly awe inspiring and I believe from the bottom of my heart that at bear minimum, every man should read it. But like his spouse says in her review above, I too believe women can read this to help understand men better and that maybe we don‚Äôt always want to be the big, bad macho guy that societal norms as well as our upbringings have suggested. Life is hard and the devil is always around the corner tempting you with something evil. Reading this book and practicing the tools he provides us can beat that devil away until we become what we should all inspire to be !! That my fellow men, is a comprehensive man in the way God intended us to be when he created us in the image of himself !!So thankful for Mr Jason Wilson that I wish I could hug his neck and scream out ‚ÄúMilchamah!‚Äù That‚Äôs all I have for now but I could go on forever and you‚Äôll have to read it to find out how shouting the Hebrew word above can free your soul !!So grateful ,Matt Oxidine"
"I love this book! To say it came at the perfect time is an understatement. I felt lost, recovering from addiction that I hid from any and everyone and only I knew how much I was hurting myself and more importantly the most important around me. My daughters.This book combined with my commitment to sobriety couldn‚Äôt have been a better combination. Jason Wilson speaks from experience and going through the battle within himself. I couldn‚Äôt believe how relatable it was and felt as if it was written just for me. As I‚Äôm sure many will feel the same way.I am beyond thankful for this book and thank Jason Wilson for what I like to think saved my life!"
"The slow down of life due to COVID, has offered me an opportunity to read more and listen to more audio books.  This is by far in my top three books I've read this year, it quite easily will become my number one, as I am excited to go through it again.  The lessons on Comprehensive manhood, understanding the true focus of each battle we will/are facing allows us to tactically use the Scripture and the tools offered in the book to deny, disrupt, and destroy the attacks against our mental and our emotions.  Jason Wilson is definitely one of my bookshelf mentors, and I am glad to have found this mighty warrior of God and his words of wisdom"

  ¬†This book a 180 + plus page full of jewel üíé . It‚Äôs not just for men but apply for women‚Äôs too, in my opinion. I highly recommend it, helps you control your emotions etc. I remember one time crying while ppl were signing my yearbook 2019 as a senior, my brother and friends started calling me weird and stuff. I was crying because I will missed them but they looked at it as a weakness ‚Äú men don‚Äôt cry ‚Äú that‚Äôs ridiculous to me. I cried bro I do I do üòÇ, I cried when we lost in the soccer playoffs, volleyball etc . I can‚Äôt wait for more releases. I hope I get that one first . 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è ain‚Äôt enough so I give it 100000000000000 ‚≠êÔ∏è"
"This book is the most comprehensive instruction manual on manhood, and ""masculinity"".  I place masculinity in quotes because this blow the lid of what it really means to be, and live in manhood.  With accurate biblical integrity, and principles of mindfulness....this book clearly helps one assess, clarify, be, and then helps him be better.  I will read this book over and over again!  I recommend men read, digest, and discuss the principles in this book. It will surely change your life."
I‚Äôm only chapter 3 and this book has given me a new perspective on life and my relationship with God. This book couldn‚Äôt have come at a better. I‚Äôve been in a depressed state lately and reading this book is helping me fight the fight from within. I can see me reading this book multiple times. I might as well get the audio book too.Jason thank you for sharing your life lessons in this book.
"This is one of the most important books of our generation. I found it so hard to pull my eyes, & heart away from the pages that I had to finish it in a couple days. The articulation of Yah‚Äôs presence in our lives has changed my outlook. I‚Äôm proud to say I am on a mission of learning, becoming, and embodying the characteristics of a comprehensive man. Thank You, Jason!"
"As a 24yr old blk man, I never knew how much my childhood traumas effected my adult life. This book exposed SO MUCH shadow work I never knew I was dealing w/. I thank you MR.WILSON for allowing the Most High to Shape you in the man you are today! Truly a father I never knew I needed!"
A wake-up call for the soul. Jason Wilson's calm and measured demeanor speaks to me through this book. Battle Cry is lighthouse in the storm
I bought this book specifically for my husband. I felt that this would be great to help him cope with his emotions at the pace he would need. I ended up taking the time to read the book as well and it has really helped me not only understand my husband but help raise our son to channel his emotions. I highly recommend this book for everyone!!
"A follow up to ""Cry Like A Man"" Jason Wilson shows men how to live with strength and sensitivity. To let go of past traumas and feel emotions. To allow men to affirm themselves and their fellow brothers.It is also important for women to read this book. We can learn and use these teachings for ourselves, to better understand the men we love, and to help them feel they are at their best for themselves. Men deserve to be vulnerable, and to feel they can be themselves without judgement. Thank Mr. Wilson for your insight."
"Es un libro demasiado superficial, no profundiza en nada y realmente no hay conclusiones."
"Getting through even one chapter of this book requires complete agreement with and acceptance of Christianity.  It does not merely inform the work, it doesn't make sense without it.  This book is so God preachy that unless you are extremely religious you are unlikely to find any of this compelling.  Very disappointed."
"This book is presented as a secular self help / self compassion book but it is full of religious material. Not a huge issue but wish it was more clear in the description, be aware before purchasing."
"This book was too religious and quoted the Bible endlessly.  Once Satan was brought it, I just couldn't read it anymore.  Boundaries subject would be interesting, but this was like a Bible quote book.  Not helpful and over the top with the religious angle."
"[Note: although I'm not religious, I still found a ton of value out of this book]Cloud and Townsend do a great job of using boundaries to illustrate why we grew up certain ways. For example, you probably know someone who has a money problem. He spends recklessly and doesn't really think about the consequences of his actions. This can be traced back to his parents never establishing their own boundaries. They would always bail the son out whenever he ran out of money and tell him to be better next time. They never let him ""feel"" the consequences. And so he never learned.There's so many other brilliant examples of the importance of boundaries and how they affect the people around us.I learned a lot about myself through the sections that detail boundaries with friends, family, and work. The one that impacted me the most was the section on Boundaries with Myself. I grew up with parents who while loving, also created situations for me where I was not able to feel the consequences, and so I behave in certain ways that I'm trying to fix.When I was first referred to this book, I wasn't told this book had a heavy religious undertone (the conflict of setting boundaries and being a good person in the eye of God). I'm not religious, so the biblical references didn't really matter to me much, but that doesn't mean I can't learn from them. The concepts themselves made sense to me and I would recommend this book to anyone who believes they have boundary problems."
"This book was such an amazing eye-opener for me. At first, I was a little off-put that the lessons are framed through the scope of religion (Christianity) as I am not a member of this faith, but the advice and the selected quotes are so good, and the selected examples so relatable that even a secular humanist like me was able to gain immense benefits.One of the most audacious, and powerful observations in this book is that for compliant people like myself, feeling guilt and experiencing pushback is a GOOD thing, as it means I'm starting to set limits and take care of my own needs (and not that I'm a rotten, selfish person as other's and my own judgmental conscious might try to convince me).The other important concept in this book is the concept that ""hurting"" someone is different from ""harming"" them, and that by being compliant and codependent I am harming others as much as myself, all for the sake of avoiding causing short-term ""hurt.""These concepts may seem obvious, or objectionable on their face, but for someone who constantly feels powerless, this book is a lifesaver."
Help set limitations and have healthy relationships with this book. It's a great book.
"This book was recommended to me by a counselor at my church. Initially I had a hard time getting into it but I stuck with it and I am so glad that I did! It provides incredible insight into why we behave the way we do, where those habits come from and how to get out of them if need be. I have tried to start applying the principles to my life and I have to say that the description of how people react to the initial phase of boundary setting has proven to be very accurate. (Hint: If you've always been a people pleaser, they are going to have a difficult time with the new you until they get adjusted.) I feel like this is helping me realize that it is ok to say no to certain requests or to certain people who suck the life out of you. I feel more capable of coping with the challenging people in my life now. I was not a doormat before by any means but I have always had the tendency to give until I had little left for my self or my own family. NO MORE!"
"This book should be called ""How to accept who you are, be confident about telling people no, and have confidence in making decisions"". This is an excellent book for those looking to understand the reasons behind deep emotional road blocks. I have read this book twice because it opened so many doors in my mind and lead me towards answers I had been seeking. If you're not religious it may sound a little to holy at first but by the end of the book you'll have a much better understanding of god and his teachings. I never saw myself going to church or reading the bible but after reading this book it helped me accept responsibility for my problems and understand how god and his teachings exist for that very reason. Each individual is responsible for the quality of his or her own life. It teaches that by accepting things which may have happened to you aren't necessarily your fault but are still your responsibility to deal with, get over, and forgive in order to move on a be a whole person is a fundamental part of life. This one of a few books which may really change your life if you're struggling with being happy and being okay with who you are."
I wasn‚Äôt able to finish this book. It is like he had to mention the Bible or church every other page to keep the brainwashed audience engaged in the message. In my experience ‚ÄúChristians‚Äù can‚Äôt seem to follow the standards they try to force everyone else to live by  and use the excuse they are not ‚Äúperfect‚Äù to absolve themselves of accountability. I don‚Äôt need to read a book that frames everything from that perspective. Clearly targeted to those church based reading groups who meet weekly to discuss how they are loving and superior while propagating hate without any recognition they fail to live by their golden rule. But it is all for Jesus. He would want us to hate (fill in the blank)...
"I bought a book about Boundaries, a vulnerable subject in its own right. No where on the cover did it mention that the lessons in Boundaries were written for Christians using the Bible. In truth the book is as much about Christianity as it is about Boundaries. Maybe the authors left one of the main premises out of the title page because it‚Äôs hard or unimaginable for Christians to know how a non Christian would feel.That the book is written to enhance a Christian‚Äôs understanding of boundaries is a wonderful premise but by hiding half of the books purpose Is deceptive.  No matter how good the lessons of the book are  it‚Äôs lens of Christianity isn‚Äôt some small part of the book you can disregard.I do think the authors are proud of being Christian, so even more reason to include that on the cover. I hate to think they left out the main premise for a profit motive. Or It could be a wishful thinking, another way for the non-believers to read Christ‚Äôs words and fall in love with the Bible.I‚Äôm actually trying not to be snarky, I am however resentful of the surprise. It comes across as arrogance to think it wouldn‚Äôt matter to many of us.For most of us from minority religions our alienation started in childhood and I‚Äôm not sure those ugly awakenings get any less hurtful.Own your Christianity and proudly include it somewhere on your title page."
"This book was recommended to me when my significant other checked himself into rehab for alcoholism. Overall, I found it to be a great (and quick) read that really anyone can benefit from - not just addicts or those involved with addicts.There is so much pressure in recent years to say ""yes"" to everyone and everything and maintain an appearance of a super hero who can juggle it all. I think ANYONE could benefit from reading this book and understanding that it is ok to say ""no"" to invitations and commitments. It is ok to set boundaries around unhealthy influences and relationships.I also learned a great deal about others and how their actions now stem a lot from how they were raised and maybe boundaries they did (or didn't) have from their parents and upbringing. It explains how boundaries dictate why we grew up certain ways. For example, think of someone who has a money problem - they spend recklessly and don't really think about the consequences of their actions. This can be traced back to their parents never establishing their own boundaries. They would always help their child out whenever they ran out of money, cover the debt, and tell them to be better next time. The parents never let the child ""feel"" the consequences and so the child never learned.There's so many other great examples of the importance of boundaries and how they affect the people around us.I learned a lot about myself through the sections that detail boundaries with friends, family, and work.I would recommend this book to ANYONE."
I was hoping to get help with dealing with my adult child who does not live at home.  I have tried to overlook the religious overtones to get what I need but so far I'm having difficulty wading through.
"This book lacks in detail when it comes to setting boundaries/what boundaries are/what to do with someone who violates them repeatedly.  As others have pointed out, telling your kid ""you have to stay in your room"" if they don't go to school, is crazy.  In no way is that setting a boundary (the kid gets exactly what they want; they don't go to school, and they stay in their room).  Or, telling someone in an abusive relationship ""just leave for the night.""In other parts of the book, I began reading a section, thought we were actually getting some where, and then it turns into ways you need to be a better Christian.  Seriously.  What does that have to do with boundaries?  I tried reading it from that perspective, as if that made 100% sense to me, but it still doesn't actually help with what the issue is.I gave this book 2 stars because they do cover a lot of topics at least.As a medical professional reading this for ways to better help my patients, this book is highly NOT recommended"
"This book is overwhelmingly religious and steeped in the idea that we can only create boundaries through our relationship with God. Ok, fine, if that works for you but as a mental health professional, I don't impose religious beliefs on clients and would have appreciated knowing that this book was so religious before purchasing."
"I am not religious and was highly disappointed in how extremely religious the book is.I should have read more reviews and summaries of this book. It was so highly recommended, I just bought it blindly. The book‚Äôs description does not mention anything overtly religious until the last paragraph, however the whole book is constantly referencing scriptures and Christianity. I feel a misled, this should be clearly marketed as a religious book for christians. Unfortunately, it is really difficult for me to look past the religious content."
"I decided to give this book a try despite the warnings of it being religious. Unfortunately, I underestimated just how religious it would be. The book has constant biblical references and is very God-centric (from the book: ""We often do not actively seek our desires from God, and those desires are mixed up with things that we do not really need. God is truly interested in our desires; he made them.""). This seriously undermines my credibility in this book; I can't even get past the second chapter thanks to this ham-fisted preachy rhetoric. Plus according to other reviews, it has some 'advice' that can be outright dangerous ('Just leave your abuser for a day' -  as if that won't provoke them into escalating).It honestly seems like another Christian book with preachy, traditional anecdotal half-truths masquerading as self-help."
"This book is supposedly written from the Christian perspective; however,  with one or two exceptions, every scripture and Bible story was used out of context in an effort to force fit it to shore up the point  the authors were trying to make. For example, the story of Jesus staying behind in the temple at 12 years old when his parents returned to Bethlehem was used as an example of his beginning to break away from his parents and find his own identity. Proverbs 22:6 which says, train a child in the way that he should go and when he is old he will not turn from it, is explained this way, ""many parents misunderstand this passage. They think 'the way he should go' means 'the way we, the parents think he (or she) should go.'"" The authors have completely misinterpreted this scripture to back up what they are saying; this passage is referring to a child's spirituality. In other words, if we teach our children to follow the Lord, when they grow up they will continue to follow the Lord.To be completely honest, I think this book is total garbage and probably has done a lot of harm in a lot of relationships, but what makes me the angriest is this intentional misuse of God's Word Which the Bible strongly speaks against doing.When I read this, all I hear is ""me, me, me."" It instructs the reader to put themselves first repeatedly and not in a loving or kind way. The only mention of the feelings of the people being ""informed"" of the boundaries being instituted is to say, basically, if they don't like it, that's their problem.I don't know what Bible they have but mine says, not me first, but God first, then my spouse (if I have one), my children (again if I have them),then, MAYBE, my parents, and I am somewhere after that. My Bible also speaks of honoring your parents but all I hear in the pages of Boundaries is break away, break away, break away and put up fences against your parents.After nearly reaching the end of the book, having stopped myself a few times from shredding or burning it (which I may do after I finish it) I finally figured out what the fatal flaw is. NO GRACE. No love, no mercy, no grace - only me, me, me.If you wonder why I even bothered to buy and force myself to read it, I will tell you. We were ORDERED to read this book in a letter from our 26 year old daughter where she details all of our wrong doings during her childhood then instructs us to refrain from contacting her in any form until such time as she decides to allow it. She also has decided we need counseling should we desire contact with our future grandchildren.She did not seem to have any complaints about being put through college, given two vehicles during her high school years, being sent to Europe her junior year, or being sent to New York For a week which included a Broadway show for her high school graduation present. She also didn't seem to mind the $600 bonus for graduating college with a 4.0 average.If you see your kid reading this book hide it, burn it, or shred it. Just get it out of your house."
"I‚Äôm afraid this text struggles with which audience it wishes to capture. The result is one that caters to neither.On one hand, the book is subtly advertised as a secular take on what is otherwise a simple (however dangerous) premise. On the other, it immediately reveals itself as a clearly Christian take - thus by implication makes the mistake of an argument from authority.As it happens, I agree with the authority from which Cloud/Townsend base the book (even if I believe they misuse this authority, more on that in a moment). For the non-Christian mind, however, this book will be immediately disregarded. In fact, the subtle nature in which it presents its biblical base will actually drive such an audience further from Christianity, not closer.Christians too will find this book disappointing. Scripture is quoted constantly, but often taken wildly out of context. It would seem that scripture was an add on after the book had already been written - proof-texted to specifically line up with the authors‚Äô worldview. This is a dangerous misuse of scripture.If one manages to sift past all of that, the very premise of the book is also poor. It takes hundreds of pages to communicate a concept that would take C.S. Lewis a single paragraph. The reader will constantly feel they know what the authors are trying to say but cannot escape the sinking feeling of how it will be misinterpreted and misused by others. What Cloud and Townsend meant as a scalpel for relationships will far more often be used as a baseball bat to bludgeon others in the name of ‚Äúboundaries.‚Äù"
"I had this book recommended to me by a friend after coming to some similar (although rudimentary) conclusions about the importance of separating from destructive situations.Honestly, reading this book was the first time in my (very churched, very ""Biblical"") life I'd heard anyone teach clearly about setting necessary boundaries for yourself. I'd never had permission to do that before; in fact, that had always been packaged as a selfish and un-spiritual desire. I even had a pastor at a small church witness me separating myself from a painful, destructive relationship -- and then preach at me from the pulpit that what I needed instead was simply to ""love more"". This attitude is so prevalent in churches across the US, whether it's implicitly or explicitly stated. And it's deeply harmful, because not only does it not work, but it creates a feeling of hopelessness and shame in the people who try to ""just love more"" until they suffer a complete breakdown or shutdown or walk away from the faith in despair.What the book Boundaries teaches instead is that setting limits, protecting yourself, and separating if necessary are all loving actions and deeply ""Christian.""The authors write clearly and share many case stories and personal examples. They back their statements both Biblically and scientifically.This book won't solve all your problems, but it will perhaps be an important first step in your journey. I had (and still have) a lot of questions that I'm working through. The authors continually stress going to God for guidance; there aren't cookie-cutter solutions.I read the book with many tears and great thankfulness; it was exactly what I needed and deeply healing."
"Those who have been victims of any kind of abuse, are often the folks who have boundary issues. Their life experience has taught them that inappropriate line crossing is part of daily life. It is a hard lesson to UN-learn. This book is a tool to help folks with boundary issues to learn where the line is and how to defend it."
"I believe this is one of the best books I have ever read! I was raised a Christian and I was raised to believe that God demanded us to obey our parents. I did not realize that is not actually the case. That God desires us to have boundaries. That my misery in life was not my burden in life to bear, but it was the fruit of over controlling parents. My parents dictated my job, where I lived, friends, and they ran off every single guy I had gone out with. When I tried to move to an area 30 minutes away they demanded and forcefully made sure that didn't happen. When I went out with guys, I recently found out they had been threatening the guy if he didn't vow to not contact me again. A long time friend shared with me that my mom had threatened her to get away from me that she was too wild and independent. I can't tell you how depressed I have been and how suicidal I was at times.I finally went to therapy and went back to school. I am working on trying to move out of state and buy my own home. This book was recently suggested and I only regret I had not found it earlier! While my situation is a little extreme compared to most people, boundaries are real. And a lack of boundaries can be horrible in your life. I had no idea that what my family was doing was not normal. I had no idea that I wasn't commanded to follow their desires. If you are in a situation like mine or a situation where you are miserable because your life is being dictated, PLEASE read this book! With God's help, step out and do what you are called to do."
"I heard about this book in a podcast and it sounded like a great tool in my arsenal as I heal after a nasty divorce and try to work through coparenting with a toxic person. However, it is 100% Bible-based.No references to psychology or psychiatry or anything outside of the Bible, and most of the bibliography is THEIR own previous works.I am about 1/5 of the way through it, and I cannot stomach how many references to ""God"" and ""sin"" are peppered all over it. In one 2-page spread, I counted 9 Biblical quotations. If I had wanted to read the Bible, I would have purchased the Bible.I was looking for a book on boundaries, but this is light on science and very heavy on preaching. I cannot figure out how two men who allegedly spend most of their time running leadership and management consulting businesses could not have written a less cloyingly Christian, less boundary-stompingly in-your-face preachy, and more universally applicable and appealing than this. I am giving this away pronto."
"This was recommended to me by a friend of a friend during a time when I really needed some help so I didn't research the book like I should have.. and saw it was written by ""Dr""s so I figured it must be legit.It's all religious based drivel. I can't even get past the first section without having a panic attack due to all the religious bs."
"No where in the description did it state this book is one long bible study.  The book is written for someone who is deeply christian in faith and struggling to maintain boundaries based on that religious training.  It is not AT ALL what I expected.  Every other paragraph is a bible reference.  The context of the book is ""while this may go against your faith training...."""
"I wish I'd read the reviews before ordering this, but the summary and editorial reviews do not mention that this has a strongly religious slant so I thought it would be a great and beneficial book to help me with setting boundaries. Unfortunately, you can't get through a single paragraph without multiple references to God, Jesus, and Christian themes. It's impossible to absorb any message without those overtones and since I don't subscribe to those beliefs this was entirely unhelpful. I got through ten pages and couldn't continue. Returned."
"I‚Äôve thought long and hard about how I should review this book. I want to be kind to the authors but truthful. Basically, my review comes down to this: the authors are capable psychologists but inadequate theologians.There are generally two ways to write a Christian book. 1) Beginning from the Bible, then build a biblical framework and the theme of the book revolves around it. 2) Have a preconceived theme or framework in mind and then find biblical verses to support it or ‚Äúmake the Bible say what you want.‚ÄùThis book falls into the second category, and do you see the problem? Instead of allowing the Bible to speak, the authors often force passages to support what they already believed to be true with little regard to context.For example, on page 257, ""Our ability to trust ourselves is based on our experience of others as trustworthy. People who are 'like a tree planted by streams of water' (Ps. 1:3) feel firm because of the streams of love coming from God and others in their lives."" This is not what Psalm 1 referring to as the rooting is within ""the Law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night"" (Ps. 1:2). It is true we need God's love and love of others? Yes. But this Psalm is speaking about being rooted in God's Word! This may seem subtle or hair-splitting but there are instances more grievous than this.This kind of biblical mismanagement occurs throughout this book. Sometimes the authors are spot on with their assessment of Scripture. But more often than not, they are woefully inadequate theologians--or straight-up wrong. Again, this book comes with modern psychology in mind and then looks for verses to support what they already believe--and that's a dangerous formula.Yet to the credit of the authors, this book is helpful even if reflective of the modern psychology movement. By the modern psychology movement, I mean ""many of your problems are basically someone else‚Äôs fault."" You are the way you are because of: a neglectful father, a manipulative mother, early bullying, etc. You then must get out from the oppressive past, bloom, and look out for number one. But modern psychology does not typically take account for personal responsibility: we may not control our circumstances/upbringing but we do control our response. God calls us responsible for our personal choices, not blaming others for how we act.Again, that is not to say one cannot learn a great deal from this book: a bee can find honey in a weed. But it‚Äôs very very long-winded, manipulative of the Bible at times, and even advocating for selfishness. Why did the authors never speak of the fruit of the Spirit? How the Christian ought to build boundaries yet express: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, and self-control. Instead of creating balance, it almost seems to advocate going from being ""a pushover"" to ""an entitled jerk.""It‚Äôs true that many people need to learn boundaries. But there‚Äôs a reason why no respectable Christian authors or scholars attached their recommendations to this book: it‚Äôs half-garbage. This also means half of it is good. Yet while this book offers some useful principles, I simply cannot recommend it."
"Seriously. I would have greatly appreciated a warning that this book is basically written for Christians only. I expected intelligent, well-rounded information. Not dogma. Since I am not Christian, I'm out cash and feel disrespected. If a Muslim writer pulled this kind of a scam, I wonder how the Christian readers would react???"
"This book has such a good message & concepts, yet the over-the-top Christian proselytizing was distracting, boring and extremely unhelpful. Any suggestions for other insightful boundaries books - without the tedious wading through scripture - would be much appreciated."
"I read reviews that stated this book was portrayed as a secular self-help book. The back of the book states ""Spiritual boundaries help us to distinguish God's will from our own and give us renewed awe for our Creator -- Often, Christians focus so much on being loving and unselfish that they forget their own limits and limitations."" Clearly, this is NOT written from a secular point of view.Other things of note, you do NOT have to agree with the Bible and every word within as well as the denominational practice of the author in order to benefit from this book. I have gone through it many times with Christians and non-Christians alike. They have equally benefitted from the provided information. Although the book DOES reference the Bible (and if you are Christian, the supporting scriptures do help support the principles as each are provided), when going through with non-Christians, I have found that either not reading the scriptures or using them as supportive text (at the other's preference) was fine. If they have relationships with Christians, it has often helped them to communicate their needs to them and understand where that person is coming from.I first learned of this book many years ago from a counselor I was seeing. I found it so helpful that I always recommend it to young adults that I see struggling with their own experiences and frequently go through it with them. Reminders are always helpful and as I move through the various stages of life, I find myself processing things differently.Not all things will pertain to you. There is a reason that a multitude of examples are given. If it doesn't, keep reading. So many times, it will help you understand other people in your life. I have yet to see any person not say ""oh, I understand why..."" or ""is that why..."" within the first two chapters.Be prepared to feel called out at times. Also keep in mind, you aren't the only person to feel that way when going through this.Clearly, I recommend this to others. I also recommend the workbook to help you get the most out of the material. Amazingly helpful for anyone who deals with humans in any direct or indirect manner."
"I didn't think I needed this book. Boundaries? Sounded like a bad word to me. Boy, was I wrong. I've read this book twice now, and each time I got something new. I plan on reading it again, especially all the quotes I underlined. It's the type of book that everyone can benefit from at different points in their life. Don't be mislead, like I was, thinking this book was only for those in romantic relationships or married. It's just as beneficial for those who are single (maybe even more so). I love how everything comes from a Christian perspective, and even though a lot of tough issues are covered (codependency, addiction, abuse) I never felt overwhelmed or condemned like I have when reading some secular material on the same subjects. There's hope within these pages. Yes, it's work learning how to properly implement boundaries in your life, and you're going to make mistakes along the way. But it's worth it to gain understanding of this much-needed topic."
"To start off, I am not a religious type person. I don't know scriptures, or the people who say the scriptures. I am sure there is a name for them. I had no idea buying this book was for boundaries with the biblical sense. At first I was like oh noo, I am not going to like this.. I read this book faster than any other book. It makes clear cut steps on how to work through boundaries. Used great examples. It was a really really good read. I took soo much from this book. It is a book I would read again. There are soo many good points and objectives in the book. It has changed my stance on how to have relationships with people. I have recommended this book to many people, many people like me who aren't religious. The points are soo good, that anybody can take from this book a great amount of information.'"
"I was recommended this book by my secular therapist. I was warned ahead of time that it ""has some Jesus stuff, but it's not too much""... yeah, it definitely has TOO MUCH! Once I got to the part about how spanking children is good for boundaries... I realized these dudes are terrible doctors. It is proved and published over and over that spanking is not only detrimental to child development, it can even affect their ability for intelligence! Not to mention... if anything is crossing a ""boundary"" with a child, it is to HIT THEM!! This book went straight into the trash, I'm not even going to donate it for fear someone may actually mistake this book as legitimate advice based on fact and science."
"I first encountered this book many years ago. A friend gifted me a hard copy and I couldn't put it down. I grew up in a broken family. I am the survivor of different forms of verbal, emotional and sexual abuse so my I never knew what boundaries were growing up. This book gave me a firm grasp on everything I needed to know about establishing boundaries for myself and with others. It seems like a given that we would just come with this knowledge but when people violate your boundaries at a young age it is believed that this kind of behavior is just the way things are supposed to be. I recommend this book to anyone struggling with boundary issues."
"My therapist recommended this book to me. I couldn't even get halfway through it. It had some good points, but the religious aspects of it got to be too much for my tastes. Christians, this is a good one for you, but for any other religious standpoint, I would stay away."
"It helped open my eyes to understand how to say 'no' to people who were using me.  There are many people out there who will use nice, kind and good people to try to make them feel 'guilty' if they do not 'help' them, etc.  This book helps you to understand HOW to set healthy boundaries so you can have HEALTHY relationships with others.  This is an excellent book to help you understand yourself and others better.  Helps to improve relationships and make you much happier!"
"Those that complain that without Christianity you can't make sense of this book, I submit to you, that without Christianity, you can't make sense of whatever reason you are are coming to this book for. It would be futile. This book was excellent and really helped me deal with an extremely narcissistic, caustic, angry, toxic, scheming, self-righteous, lying, backstabbing individual.  Now one going through this ordeal would naturally be angry, which I've been.  But what if this person is so scheming as to use your own anger against you?  What do you do, get more angry?  One needs a higher perspective, and that is the perspective of your very creator, and that is the only thing that will help you, and this book deals with that angle.  And I resent as a Christian being called ""religious"", as that word connotes a certain performance standard, that is, if I do this, I'll get that.  If I am good, I'll be rewarded.  Yes, that is pretty much every religion on the planet, except Christianity.  Christianity turns that notion on its head and says, you're a screwed up, mistake prone individual that has made moral mistakes against yourself and others, and you deserve justice for that.  You're creator, perfect in justice and love, has perfected both at the cross, to take that on himself.  You're moral failings are taken care of, so you can dwell in His presence.  Come as you are, seek repentance of your ways, and have a personal relationship with your creator.  Now if you reject that, nothing will help you, surely not this book, or any book for that matter.  Give your $ elsewhere, the author elsewhere will be very happy, and you might be temporarily, but not for good, as this book will offer you, if you believe on Him."
Very disappointing. There‚Äôs likely much potentially valuable substance in this book. But I could not get past the first chapter due to the Christianity centric claptrap disbursed throughout. Attempts to give the book a chance by jumping into later sections simply rewards you with near instantaneous insults to one‚Äôs intelligence and senses once again. Too bad. I suspect something potentially wonderful was lost in the implementation.
"I read the description of the book and it sounded like something I would be interested in. I did not read ALL of the descriptions of the book though so I had no idea that the book was so heavily Christian - the blurb up at the top doesn't even mention it. This should be included in the main description of the book. Like, at the top of the page. Maybe even in the title. And it should be plastered across the front cover of the book. ""God"" is brought up approximately every 2.3 words so it seems like it would be important enough to put into the description of the book.FYI, I came back and started reading all of the reviews and it says that the book condones spanking your kids to set boundaries and I definitely didn't read past the first three pages to see this and we live in the year 2020 with a million other ways to communicate with our children so UGH I'm so glad I was too offended by the christianity to get to the chapter on spanking. This book is gross."
"Cloud and Townsend write with clarity about everyday interpersonal conflicts, personal issues, and life events. They illustrate how boundaries are involved in in many aspects of everyday life, and provide practical suggestions on how to improve your ability to identify, fix, and improve boundaries to make your life more satisfying and stable. They mix in ideas from Christianity, with biblical quotes interspersed. For Christians, this will be a nice bonus; for others, it might be distracting at first - but I will still be recommending this book to my non-Christian friends, since the core messages are also relatable and credible from other perspectives (atheist, other religions)."
"Got burned in a recent relationship, and after reading this book, I am a lot more aware of the pitfalls of having weak boundaries, especially in situations with manipulators.... Cloud & Townsend have a clear and engaging writing style that makes you want to read ""just one more chapter!"" before retiring.  Information is easy to absorb and utilize. Comprehensive subject index. Engaging case histories. Highly recommended!"
"Boundaries (Henry Cloud & John Townsend) is one of those evangelical books that sold 4 million copies because it says what (controlling) people‚Äôs itching ears want to hear‚Ä¶most notably, that erecting boundaries, issuing ultimatums, and managing others to have things your way, is Godly‚Ä¶presumably because you study the Bible, are in God‚Äôs exclusive family, and have a divine calling to define right living. The unmistakable take-away from the book: Take control, lest you be taken by control‚Ä¶it‚Äôs bad when others control you, but good when you control them. It‚Äôs 'my-way-or-the-highway-ism' disguised as Godliness. No doubt this book sits on the coffee table in the waiting room of many Christian therapists, but I think it belongs on the back shelf. If everyone followed the spirit of condescension advocated by this book, we‚Äôd all either be butting heads, or brooding alone in the corner. Self-absorption leaves little room to live and let live. Power games reduce family life to low-level warfare. Marriage is cheapened into adversarial drudgery. The boundary-setter sentences other family members to life in a minimum-security prison, walking on eggshells, hoping to avoid the boundary enforcer‚Äôs sighs, cold shoulder treatment, and pouting. Boundaries trap people, not make them free. Me-centered individualism is the bane of modern culture. This book divinizes individualism.In a nutshell, the premise of the book: If you want to take control of your life, build a wall with a gate, and appoint yourself gatekeeper. Sound familiar? Learn to say yes to open the gate if the person knocking is useful to you. But if the person knocking is not useful to you, then pretend no one is home. Life is a sailboat race. Catch the wind (i.e., use other people) when you can. When you can‚Äôt, ignore them. Yuk! If a seminar were held for this book, Simon & Garfunkel‚Äôs 'I Am A Rock' would be an appropriate song to warm-up the crowd. Tweak the words a bit‚Ä¶ I have my books, and my 'boundaries' to protect me. I am shielded in my 'righteousness.' Love has many imposters. This book mentions love but describes it as control. Ostensibly, you‚Äôre entitled to control because you‚Äôre exceptional. And you‚Äôre exceptional because you go to church. That‚Äôs how it dovetails with religion, because absent the scripture-snippet sprinkles, the book outlines management tactics taught in business school. The jacket cover states the authors are corporate consultants. I believe it. I‚Äôm mindful however that a corporation has no soul, no warmth.I read this book as I traversed 10 days for 101 miles in a canoe down the Green River, Utah. It made me want to paddle harder. It‚Äôs Pharaseeism on steroids. It‚Äôs anti-Jesus to the hilt. If you want to conquer and control a spouse or your kids or your parents, this is the book for you. It‚Äôs evil because it justifies selfishness and manipulating others as Godly. God forbid. Many of the specific ideas in his book are just plain wrong. The phrase, 'healthy boundaries' is used repeatedly, but it becomes apparent that ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù is a euphemism for self-serving. I do like how the book promotes honesty. There‚Äôs so much phoniness these days. If she looks fat in the dress, tell her. White lies have descended into lying in general. Lying erodes trust. Without trust there can be no love. Then again, this book is not about love. It‚Äôs about control. Sadly, lying can be a potent weapon of control.To hear it, God directs you to have dominion over all that he‚Äôs given you, but good stewards must always be on guard to patrol the boundaries of behavior, especially the inappropriate behaviors of loved ones who are insufficiently sanctified (i.e., not as holy as you are). The heady, 'God-directs-my-path' theme jumps from nearly every page of the book, as if its fans live in a holy silo of self-indulgent clairvoyance. According to the Biblical worldview espoused here, God‚Äôs invisible hand opens/closes doors, and places/removes people in your life. Paraphrasing Shakespeare: All the world's a stage; and all the men and women merely players; they have their exits and their entrances; and you‚Äôre His chosen one in sync with His plans.You know what‚Äôs right because you‚Äôre a Godly Christian who plucked down $15 and bought the book. Really? And you hate the sin, but love the sinner (yes, that‚Äôs in the book too). This view sounds more like self-righteous delusion to me. More like living in an echo chamber of your own ego. No wonder evangelical Bible thumpers can be stuffy. Apparently, other people with whom you may disagree must be misguided (because you‚Äôre never wrong because you‚Äôre in-the-know and bolstered by an inbred Bible-study small group, or a paid therapist), hence you are obligated to shake the dust off your feet and shun them. Nuts. The authors spin this as 'individuation.' I call it exceptionalism. It‚Äôs a form of narcissism.The 'love-must-be-tough' tactic of arrogantly erasing people until they grovel, first made famous by James Dobson (and advocated here), pops up throughout the book. But in the real world, ultimatums more often backfire because distance usually makes the heart grow yonder, not fonder. If you want someone to hate you, turn your back on them and tell them they need professional help (especially if they don‚Äôt). Infuriating. The authors do not allow for the real possibility that the person who, ‚Äúfinds their voice,‚Äù and militantly threatens, ‚Äúdo what I say else I‚Äôll erase you buster,‚Äù may be immature, thin-skinned, unreasonable, ungrateful, or mentally ill. Talk about logs and specs. Ultimatums are a sure-fire recipe for relational failure. But the book says ultimatums let you get your way. Yikes. Dobson got that wrong. So does Cloud. This is the fallacy of fictional examples that are good in theory only. Sells books, ruins lives. This book is full of contrived examples that don‚Äôt fully resolve with reality. More on that later.Of course, the book also is full of good advice, especially on how to utilize people with the efficiency of a corporate manager, primarily through contract, quid pro quo bartering, reward/punishment, and especially by the threat of estrangement (‚Äúyou‚Äôre fired‚Äù) when boundaries are violated, but it misapplies these business management principles to relationships with loved ones. The workplace and the home are not incarnations of the same game-playing. People who say I have a boss at work and a boss at home, miss the mark. But people who say I am the boss at work, and I am the boss at home, probably would love this book (and really miss the mark). The authors fail to fully switch gears between boundaries for, e.g., your spouse versus your boss. I tend to think of the workplace more as a competitive rat-race and to regard my boss in a strictly professional fashion. In sharp contrast, I perceive my home as my castle and my spouse as my enchanting, romantic lover. My spouse epitomizes everything that my boss is not. I enjoyed my career very much, but I strove to keep it separate from family as much as possible. The dynamics are totally different too. But if you want to think of your family as a business, with you as the self-appointed CEO and HR Director, and your spouse and children as employees under your management and control, then this is the book for you. Many people make the mistake of treating every human relationship as some form of business.Imagine the warmth from an Ebenezer Scrooge (the reclusive curmudgeon) or Carrie Nation (the morose temperance union lady) as your spouse, and you get the picture. Scrooge‚Äôs tool of control was business. Carrie Nation‚Äôs was a ball-peen hammer. If good fences make good neighbors, then good fences make good lovers too, or so the book seemingly would imply (although it‚Äôs squeamish about sex). I‚Äôd rather make love to a fence post than an adherent of this book. In fact, for a book that dwells so heavily on the marriage relationship in particular, the absence of any discussion about sex is conspicuous. It made me wonder if the authors are any good at it. I always regarded sex as the canary in the coalmine of marriage. The quality of the sex is a direct indicator for the quality of the marriage. No sex, no romance, no joy, no fun, no love, no bond, no intimacy. No thanks. Perhaps the authors hold to the sex-is-for-procreation-only boundary. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm thinking, H.L. Mencken: ‚ÄúPuritanism. The haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy.‚ÄùThe 'boundaries-are-Godly' ethos has inspired a franchise of spin-off books. There‚Äôs Boundaries for: Kids. Teens. Dating. Marriage. Leaders. No Pharisee should be without the boxset. Rather than a necessary evil, boundaries are championed as an intentional virtue. Silly me, I thought boundaries were bad. But to hear it, if you want to take control of your life to your ends, apparently you cannot lay down too many boundaries. I say, be careful what you want, because as the book warns, you may reap what you sow. I want love, fun, and joy. So did Jesus. The Pharisees were the bad guys‚Ä¶the control freaks‚Ä¶the rule makers‚Ä¶the boundary enforcers. Jesus frequently exchanged barbs with them. Right? Jesus turned water to wine as his first miracle. Right? I‚Äôd rather share a cold one with Jesus and his friends than suffer a Bible study with the Pharisees. The sinners are much more fun‚Ä¶Many critics describe the book as ‚Äútoo religious,‚Äù but it‚Äôs worse than that. It‚Äôs as if the authors wrote a secular book on how to control others, then went on a scripture hunt and sprinkled the pages with cherry-picked Bible verses, however tortured the applications. Most are from Apostle Paul‚Äôs letters (he had no wife), and Solomon‚Äôs Proverbs (he had too many wives). Boundaries are biblical. The authors insist. I agree, they are. But so is Slavery (Ephesians 6). Genocide is biblical (Joshua 10). Stoning a disobedient son to death is biblical (Deuteronomy 21). Demonization of homosexuals is biblical (Romans 1). Predestination is biblical (Romans 9). Subjugation of women is biblical (1 Timothy). Did Jesus command us to follow the Bible, or to follow him? I don‚Äôt think the authors appreciate the distinction.Another pet peeve I have about this book is the author‚Äôs contempt for one‚Äôs childhood family, referred to by the cold, clinical term: Family-of-origin. One‚Äôs family-of-origin is treated as a temporary but necessary evil to incubate, hatch, and ween offspring into their true family (the so-called Family of God), the sooner the better to minimize the damage from dysfunctional parents (aren‚Äôt they all?) The insinuation that nearly all childhoods are beset by abuse from bad parents, victimization, and sin makes me wonder if the author is tainted by his own resentment or ingratitude. I had a great childhood and provided a great one for my kids. My mom made me eat my peas & carrots; somehow, I didn‚Äôt suffer a complex. For me, family is something to cherish and hold high and have fun with, but you‚Äôd never know it to read this book, such is the perverse emphasis on individuation and the contempt for parents who want to love and enjoy their adult children and grandchildren for the mutual benefit of all. Instead, the book advocates deliberate abandonment of parents and substitution of a cult-like nuclear family to aggressively replace and discard the family-of-origin. I say, don‚Äôt drink the Kool-Aid. A familiar reference to Jesus‚Äô boyhood is used to drive home this agenda but misses the mark completely.-----Page 68 ‚Äì ‚ÄúRemember when Jesus‚Äô mother and father left Jerusalem without him? When they went back and found him teaching in the temple, his mother admonished him. Jesus‚Äô words to his mother were, ‚ÄòWhy were you searching for me? Didn‚Äôt you know I had to be in my Father‚Äôs house?‚Äô (Luke 2:49). Translation: ‚ÄòI have values, thoughts, and opinions that are different from yours, Mother.‚Äô‚Äù-----The author‚Äôs presumptuous translation suggests he knows what Jesus was thinking. Really, we can do that? Tiering off the translation, this reader wondered if Jesus might additionally be thinking: ‚ÄúHey, Mary and Joseph, I‚Äôm moving on to my true family of God now that I‚Äôm 12, and Joseph, you‚Äôre not even my real father.‚Äù But we don‚Äôt know what Jesus was thinking, do we? All we have is conjecture. And we don‚Äôt know all the details of the story because they‚Äôre not in the text. But Boundaries is full of such conjecture, telling the reader what God thinks. Many best-selling evangelical books are guilty of telling readers what God thinks. Problem is, no one has seen God, so how could authors possibly be so cocksure they know what God thinks? I think it‚Äôs more like clever authors know what readers would like God to think. Ka-ching! If God made us in his image, we‚Äôve returned the favor.Most of the book‚Äôs vignettes seem fictional. Show me your data. There also is a decided bias that men are bad (they yell, drink, watch porn), but women are good (because the absence of what men allegedly do makes women good by default). Only passing reference is made to passive-aggressive tactics; playing the victim, lying, thin-skinnedness, and emotional blackmail (typically the venom used by women to control men). I‚Äôm mindful that the market for books of this kind is lopsided in favor of women. The great majority of advice columnists, therapists, and their clients also are female (except for unwitting husbands who are dragged into counseling by their disgruntled, controlling wives). I will close with a vignette from the book about Brian, because it struck a personal chord with me.-----Page 276 ‚Äì ‚ÄúBrian was having difficulty with his father, a wealthy man who had always used his money to control other people, even his family. He had taught his children to obey by threatening to cut off his financial support or cut them out of his will.As Brian got older, he wanted more freedom from his father, but he found himself addicted to the family money and the pleasures it afforded him. He liked being able to take his wife on vacations to the family summer home. He liked the country club membership and tickets to Big Ten basketball games.But Brian didn‚Äôt like what his father‚Äôs control was costing him emotionally and spiritually. He decided to make some changes. He started saying no to some of his father‚Äôs requests that were disruptive to him and his immediate family. He declined to go on some of the holiday trips when his children wanted to do other things. His father did not like that.Predictably, he started to cut Brian off from the resources he had access to. He used him as an example to the siblings. He began to lavish more privileges on Brian‚Äôs brothers and sister to show Brian his mistake. Lastly, he changed his will.This was hard for Brian. He had to streamline his lifestyle and do without some of the things he was used to. He had to make different plans for the future, for he had always planned on inheriting his father‚Äôs money. In short, he had to deal with the consequences of his choice to free himself from his father‚Äôs control. But for the first time in his life, he was free‚Ä¶In Brian‚Äôs case, he had to plan to find a way to make more money.‚Äù-----Let‚Äôs tally the score for Brian. He lost his sizable inheritance, access to a vacation home, a country club, free trips, college basketball games, and fellowship with his family-of-origin. That‚Äôs a big hit. Perhaps his wife enjoyed swimming at the country club, and his kids liked going to the basketball games with Grandpa too. And we don‚Äôt know if Brian succeeded in making more money. It‚Äôs not like your boss will double your salary for the asking. We don‚Äôt know Brian‚Äôs credentials. Everyone cannot be a surgeon. Everyone hopes to win the lottery, but few do. Perhaps Brian had to take a second job to pay his mortgage, put his kids through college, and the rest. Consequently, now he‚Äôs consumed by 70-hour workweeks, and isolated from his immediate family by frequent business travel away from home. In other words, Brian is not free. He likely is less free than before. Perhaps he‚Äôs now captive to his boss and dare not complain lest he get fired. Or maybe his wife also is from a wealthy family, and now Brian is indirectly on his father-in-law‚Äôs dole. That‚Äôs very controlling and humiliating. Meet the new boss, same (worse) than the old boss. He‚Äôd been far better off to swallow his pride and stick with his own father. The old man is what he is. Live and let live. If Brian resents living in his father‚Äôs shadow, that‚Äôs Brian‚Äôs (pride) problem. No parent should apologize for making more money than their kid, or vice-versa. It must be one, or the other. Get over it. Revenge returns evil for evil. But ingratitude returns evil for good. Brian‚Äôs dad likely was a more benevolent controller than Brian‚Äôs new boss. Everybody‚Äôs got to serve somebody. What I do like about Brian is that he wants to feel like a man who made it on his own. Good for him. But he would have been better served to stick with his dad while upping his performance through other avenues. It‚Äôs no accident that C.S. Lewis labeled ‚Äúpride‚Äù as the great sin from which most of the others are derived. Jealousy and pride go hand in hand. Repent, then your free. Setting punitive boundaries on parents is no substitute for repentance. It just makes you a slave to your unjustified resentment. I‚Äôve known several sons who could not bear to live in their father‚Äôs shadow. It killed them all.My wife asked me what I learned new from this book. I sat in silence for several minutes. Even the excellent chapter on the Digital Age held no new ideas for me. The book mostly just confirmed long-held suspicions about evangelical family values and worldviews, especially regarding the deliberate distancing and contempt between parents and (adult) children. I find the notion that parents and children desire to be free of each other, the sooner the better, the more the better, to be abhorrent, however biblical. As we marry and children are born, we add them to our cloud of loved ones who we will spend eternity with (or so I hope). We wear many hats simultaneously. I‚Äôm a husband, son, father, brother, uncle, grandfather, nephew, cousin, father-in-law, brother-in-law, and son-in-law, all at once. There‚Äôs no room for jealousy or power-plays, nor should nuclear families isolate themselves, lest they greenhouse their children with inbred ideas and foster indifference, ingratitude, and resentment. Churchianity is no substitute for extended family-of-origin relationships, not even close. It‚Äôs warped thinking. Just watch documentaries on the Jim Jones or David Koresh cults to see the 'family-of-God' concept taken to the extreme.I have expressed a strong aversion to boundaries. Boundaries are born of fear. Perfect love drives out all fear. Of course, I realize I impose boundaries too (I close the bathroom door and mow up to my property line), because I fear the reaction if I didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm just mindful that most human pathologies are born of fear, so I‚Äôm very wary of boundaries, rules, and ultimatums that would oppress, censor, and restrict others. In my heart of hearts, I am a freedom lover. I obviously do not hesitate to express my opinions. Freedom of speech is a cherished right. I‚Äôm not preoccupied with imposing boundaries on others because the list of things that annoy me is short. I prefer to maximize fun and enjoyment, especially with loved ones. The measure of a successful life is how much fun you had, how many spiritually rich experiences you‚Äôve enjoyed (typically in God‚Äôs stunningly beautiful outdoor cathedrals), and how much true love you‚Äôve been lucky to know, not how comfortable you were, how often you attended church, or how much you controlled others. Power struggles are foolish. Estrangement is tragic. Ego is a waste. Live and let live. This book promotes exclusivity. Jesus promoted inclusivity. I encourage the authors of Boundaries to give a listen to Imagine (John Lennon). You may say I‚Äôm a dreamer, but‚Ä¶"
"This book came highly recommended in my Celebrate Recovery step study group. I have learned so much from what I have read so far (half way through). In my opinion, anyone that feels like they have trust issues should read this book. It provides tools how to feel more empowered while protecting yourself. My favorite concept so far is to say no to the bad and yes to the good. We need to allow good things into our lives, while keeping the bad things (that harm us) out. When we are hurting, we end up putting up a fence that keeps all good and bad out. Or, if our boundaries are fuzzy, we mix it up and allow the bad in and prevent the good from getting in.  This book really helped me with a relationship that had so much power me that I couldn't figure out where I ended and they began. It was so blurry. As I said, I am only half way through, and with only partial information, I was able to be in an extended close proximity to this person and say no to the bad and yes to the good. And for once, I came away from that experience not feeling defeated, powerless, depressed, angry and resentful. I am actually feeling confident that I will be able to continue this relationship without walls, but with a gate."
"I really SHOULD have read the previous reviews more carefully. This is not ONLY a ""Christian"" book, but a book -- ONE of MANY under the ""Boundaries brand"" -- that offers NO examples, NO advice, NO advice, NO help, NO condolences, unless the reader is FIRMLY entrenched in a day-to-day evangelical, ummm, ""lifestyle."" There is NOTHING practical, NOTHING academic, NOTHING ""research-y,"" NOTHING to offer if you are not immersed in evangelical christian gabble. I only WISH I'd looked into my options for ""returning"" the title while within the (generous) allowable timeframe. I kept thinking it would ""get better,"" ""more reality-based,"" ""useful."" IT DID NOT."
"People throw the word ""boundaries"" around a lot. And I just had no idea what they were talking about. I only had this vague notion that it had something to do with actually getting to chose how you allowed people to treat you and that it was part of protecting and taking care of yourself. I was raised that God was first, everyone else was second and I was last. And this lifestyle kind of made me resent the call of Christ to put others first because I frequently felt like I gave and gave until I was tapped out, but got nothing in return. (As well as having low self-esteem from the way people have treated me over the years.)  This book very clearly defines what boundaries are, why you need them, some really important ones to have and how to apply them. (And why you're not really doing anyone any favors by overextending yourself like that.)  Exremely helpful and easy to read. Useful stories that made it easy to apply what I learned to my own life. I also recommend reading the boundaries book for dating and relationships."
"Overly, painfully, religious. I tend to take religious self-help books with a grain of salt. Generally there is good advice and a sprinkling of bible quotes. This book swings to the other extreme with quotes and lessons  in every paragraph. I gave up on page 66 when the authors stated that you cannot set healthy boundaries if you don‚Äôt have a supportive relationship with God. Basically the authors cast out anyone who is no religious, struggling in their relationship with god, or holds another faith. The religiosity is laid on so thick that useful lessons or skills to set boundaries are completely obscured."
"I knew this book was Christian-centric when I bought it, but did not realize that the book would almost literally read like a compilation Bible study on boundaries! There seems to be an average of at least one Bible quote per page (a few pages don't have a Bible quote, most do, and some have 3+) plus about two other times per page when the author assumes the reader is deeply Christian. I wouldn't mind some Christian centrism and references, but this book is written with the premise that the Bible is the reader's source of truth or way of knowing what is right or how things should be or a justification for living a certain way as opposed to the Bible quotes being there for inspiration for those who are so inclined. If ""because it says so in the Bible"" doesn't rub you the wrong way, this is probably a great book for you with good content on learning about boundaries. If that does rub you the wrong way, stear clear because you will be rubbed raw before the end of the first chapter!!"
"If you were raised in a household with so many guilt trips you permanently have a bag packed for your trip, this is a must have book. There is a lot of scripture that sometimes takes away from the flow of the book but the overall consistent message throughout is the same. You learn to take your power back as an adult."
"Boundaries is a masterpiece. If you apply its principles, it will bring more health to your mindset and your relationships. If you read the negative reviews, you'll notice that not even the negative reviewers can say this book doesn't work. They're simply offended that so many of the book's timeless principles are rooted in the Bible and some people are offended that the Bible actually works and has practical wisdom for every part of life. Boundaries is well-researched and brilliantly delivered. Even if you don't think you need better boundaries, I guarantee this book could benefit your life. Every person on earth could benefit from reading this book."
"This book is amazing, it was referred to me by a close friend who's also a psychologist. I didn't realize that I didn't have any boundaries and things I'd been taught/shown/influenced by made me feel guilty about putting boundaries in my life, so I had become a people please to my own detriment. I LOVE the fact that this is biblically based because even Jesus set boundaries. I had such a HUGE mental shift and so much guilt and pressure come off my shoulders once I realized that setting boundaries are GOOD even if other people may not like or agree to them initially. The part it talks about being responsible FOR someone vs. being responsible TO someone was revolutionary to me because I never consciously thought about the difference. I've come to realize someone is taking advantage of me trying to be responsible FOR them because this adult doesn't want to be responsible for himself. EVEN THOUGH this is biblically based ANYONE can gain great insight on their own boundaries but for believers it's like confirmation.  It's all in what you want to get out of it. ENJOY!!"
"Great book. Give a good perspective to others and self.  Informative. Entertaining insightful.  Offers some wonderful tools to help create health relationships.  Can‚Äôt wait to read the other ones. Reading Boundaries for teens right now and so far it‚Äôs so helpful.  I personal love the biblical integration for me It important to balance all our core beliefs. This books helps with real world challenges and offers a religious perspective that is so important, yet if your not religious but just morally grounded it will still be a great read.  I personally al realized I have healthy boundaries and I don‚Äôt have to let other who don‚Äôt try to make me feel bad. It has also really helped me to help my husband who needs to set boundaries. I feel like I understand his struggles in this area better."
This book tries to claim that setting boundaries is a practice condoned by God. I disagree. Boundaries are necessary in cases of human health and safety. But to be a disciple of Jesus Christ requires following the teaching and examples he set. A Christian should respond as the Good Samaritan did to those who suffer not as those who passed by not did not stop to help.
"I started reading this book Boundaries, it is really good, you guys should read it. I was in prayer and it was God who answered my prayer abd I felt that He was saying ‚ÄúBOUNDARIES‚ÄùHe inspired me to search for answers to avoid some conflicts with some people at the time - yes. it‚Äôs true being a Christian could mean that we can‚Äôt say no as an answer to people even if is not convenient for us but expected always to be the ‚Äúyes‚Äù answer to any situation. That‚Äôs WHY We could become the target, and the subject of the abusive behaviors or manipulative actions of some people. So‚Ä¶a friend of mine recommended this book to me then I realized that my issues could have been avoided if I had been establishing limits/ boundaries a long time ago -so I confess that it‚Äôs my bad to have been struggling  with some people no one else‚Äôs fault cause we should establish limits or boundaries ‚Äúspecially with difficult people‚Äù that will be a healthy way to keep relationships working properly and avoiding issues. If you read the first pages of this book you might find your situation described in those pages. And reading them even look ridicules, Hello? That‚Äôs exactly what we are doing! Lol üòÇ we are  acting ridiculous lol üòÇ We are not victims anymore for Christianity is about being ourselves but being better individuals not looking to resolve everyone‚Äôs problem while creating another problem for ourselves‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs not acting as if we should be the victims of insensitive people or even to pretend that nothing will affect us or as if we are fake people and it‚Äôs all good always. If we can‚Äôt say no when is not convenient to say yes to something it‚Äôs on us‚Ä¶ we can be ‚Äúthe nicest guys‚Äù specially to those guys wanting to be taken advantage from us -that‚Äôs not what Christ says we should be doing cause that is bringing more suffering. He actually answers prayers that He sees fit He is not answering every prayer for a reason. And He has established some boundaries if not what it means to be obedient to God ? Can‚Äôt come and go crossing His limits and knowing it‚Ä¶but we can talk to God pray listen and obey there are limits and when it comes to relationships is right. What order means in God‚Äôs Kingdom? He has established  things in order and correctly AND with the truth so we don‚Äôt get confused or take another way. Truth spoken on time is what God wants nothing else for truth is also establishing THE WAY."
"Very well written book. I originally bought this book because I wanted to learn how to say no kindly to people without worrying about their reaction. I never would have thought this book was something I needed personally for myself and not just for other people. It not only teaches how to say no to people but also how to deal with their reaction when you tell them no. It teaches you how to look at yourself and not at other people as the one who has the boundaries issue and how to change yourself since we can't change others. It includes a lot more then what I mentioned and is a must read for everyone! We all need boundaries, not just for us but also for everyone we deal with in our lives. Would highly recommend!"
"If you have been a Christian for any length of time, chances are you have heard of this book at some point. This book is quoted by countless other Christian authors. Dr. Townsend and Dr. Cloud are regarded as the authority on boundaries. There is definitely some good stuff here, but also some problems as well. I think I may have read this book years ago, but it's been many years.On the good side, I love how this book is rooted in Scripture. I think they do a good job of helping the reader recognize how strong their boundaries are or aren't. They also also do a good job of explaining how others may react to new boundaries. I also like the sections about a day without boundaries and a day with boundaries. I also like the discussions about different types of boundaries.But the area where I think this book really falls short is in terms of how to learn how to set boundaries. It spends a lot of time discussing and identifying poor boundaries, but gives only a cursory mention to setting healthy boundaries. It talks about what healthy boundaries, but talks very little about how to move from no or weak boundaries to firm ones. I think this is a key component.Overall, I think this is a good book and it does have a lot of good information."
"I didn‚Äôt dislike this book, but I didn‚Äôt like it very much either, maybe because it was more detailed (aka more complicated) than I had expected. The best part (for me) was its analogy comparing boundaries to real estate: If you are the owner of a property, then you are the one who is legally responsible for it. Non-owners are not responsible for your property, and you‚Äôre not responsible for theirs. Works for me! Makes me the one who determines what is/what is not allowed on my ‚Äúproperty.‚ÄùI also liked the imagery of fences (with gates) to let IN the things that are good for me, and keep OUT the things that are not. It seems ‚Äúmean‚Äù or ‚Äúnot nice‚Äù for me to confront someone about something that I consider unacceptable. But if I want another to know my thoughts, I need to tell them. This book urges me to ‚Äúbe real‚Äù and tell the truth, to take responsibility, to confront, to forgive, and to see passivity as hugely destructive. One pithy example: a baby bird has to peck itself out of its own egg; if it does not, it will die.So, boundaries: basic property management. I simply stop accepting unacceptable behavior, and resentments are nipped in the bud. Dead-headed and pruned. Especially those vicious invasives like anger which, I have seen, cause cancer of the soul. Stewardship, yes, and I like this book better than I did before."
"Theres is a lot of good info, but after the 5th bible quote & god reference, I was losing interest fast. It was overdone with religion to the point of nauseau. This book is really good for god fearing Christians & bible thumpers.  TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT."
"As someone who is formerly very religious, I thought I could stomach the religiosity of this book to get to the main message. I couldn't. I couldn't get past the first chapter, because of the condescendingly patriarchal viewpoint this book is written from. If you're really religious you'll probably enjoy this book.  If you're not religious or even somewhat religious, I would get a different book."
"1. TIME OWNED: Months2. USAGE FREQUENCY: Weekly3. PURPOSES: Understand, empathize, learn, identify, implement, and maintain changes in my relationships4. POSITIVES: Well written, well organized, many scriptural supports, very relatable, very actionable5. NEGATIVES: None.6. SUMMARY: This book has so many great points and lists that after listening to an audiobook chapter, I needed to use a paperback version to review checklists and make notes for future reference.7. RECOMMENDATION: Buy!8. HOW I RATE:> 5 Stars: EXCEEDS expectations and accomplishes its purpose> 4 Stars: MEETS all expectations and accomplishes its purpose> 3 Stars - DOES NOT MEET expectations, but accomplishes its purpose> 2 Stars - MAJOR FLAWS but somewhat accomplishes its purpose> 1 Star - DEFECTIVE or deceitful. Does not accomplish its purpose."
"I agree with the other reviews, and wish I had read them before purchasing. It is not possible to read and gain anything from this book if you are not interested in Christianity. There should be something in the description of the book. There is not even anything on the cover. Not until after reading the introduction does it mention or start that approach. I was very disappointed as I really was connecting to the things covered. I tried reading the rest, but every paragraph has a bible quote. It is not possible to read if you are not i. That frame of mind. Moral of the story, read reviews, not just the description."
"Being an ex-Christian, this book serves as a good reminder for why I left ""the church"". The book canstantly talks about ""being a good Christian"" and ""God's will"". The material is so preachy that it feels like it could switch over to praising the Supreme Leader of North Korea, and you'd never even notice.I genuinely gave the book a chance since I thought there might be some valuable information hidden among the propaganda. I was wrong.Here's a quick synopsis: God is good. Say ""no"" sometimes. Praise God. Amen."
"Great book that will change the way you look at conflict and at how you deal with others and their behavior. As a pastor I recommend this book a lot and have used it myself. It has helped me as a husband, father, friend and leader. As you read the book, you will be able to understand why we feel the way we do about the way others treat us and in many cases you will find that people treat us in a particular way because we allow it. Great book and very helpful. The review was written by Nichelle's Husband."
"This is a great book that offers a lot of insight, but SO MUCH of it is rooted in Christian fervor that it gets really distracting and unnerving if you're not a follower of that particular faith. Many of the options they provide are unavailable to you if you're not a churchgoer (like how the authors keep recommending that you practice boundaries with prayer groups and lean on them for support). I'm usually good at ""turning off"" god references that don't apply to me, but that's literally 50% of this book, which made it difficult.I wish I could download a digital copy of the book and run a ""search and replace"" command to remove the words god, lord, bible, prayer, scripture, etc. That would improve the book quite a bit."
Finally finished this book. If only I read it when it was first recommended to me.  I love the story examples it helped to better relate. Yes it does site the Bible but try to be open minded and look at the book as what can I learn from this? Ask yourself how can I relate to the these people? If you really want change in your life this is it. The book touches a little bit on everything. But was definitely worth the read if you want to set healthy boundaries. If you don‚Äôt go to church then find a support group or group of people you trust.
"I'm about a fourth of the way through this book.  What has kept me from finishing it, even though I need help with setting boundaries, is that the author continually breaks up the flow of writing by inserting bible verses.  I'm a Christian, and the Bible is full of wisdom, but it's more like the author is proof-texting to lend biblical support to his premise.  This leads you to start questioning, ""Is that really what that verse means?"".  I think it would have been more beneficial to just help me understand how to set boundaries--setting boundaries is a good thing you don't have to go to great lengths to prove that to me.  But maybe it gets better further on.  I'll update if I continue reading and find that to be true."
"For my introduction of counseling class it was a requirement to read this book. Considering that I don‚Äôt read books like this very often I was kind of dreading it. This book was very good. Any person can benefit from this book if they‚Äôre struggling with boundaries in any aspect, whether it be with a spouse or children or you were the type of person that is kind of a doormat to your friends. I do go to a Christian University and this book is faith-based. I did gain a lot from this book even though I am not a believer myself."
"I don‚Äôt know where to start or how to adequately convey how much his book has helped me. As a chronic people pleaser, I‚Äôve never set boundaries in any area of my life, and consequently, I‚Äôve felt very taken advantage of. Now, I have the tools in my toolbox to help me overcome the guilt and fear I‚Äôve let rule my life and experience the freedom in Christ that comes with loving boundaries."
"Looking at the cover, the synopsis and such,  I didn't get the feeling that this was a bible heavy book, but it so is.  I read the beginning of Sherrie's example before I read it and I thought the religious parts of the story was just part of the person used as an example.  But nope.  The book, at the end of Sherrie's example states that ""This book presents a biblical view of boundaries.""  I wish this was stated within the synopsis' available on amazon.  This book crossed my boundaries with unwanted preaching."
"First off people should know nowhere on the book or description did it say this was a bible study kinda of book. Every example had a biblical reference for it. While I am Christian, I am not a Bible thumping Christian and it was way too much for me. I made it through a few chapters but I couldn‚Äôt relate anymore. The actual psychology of it seems good but it was just the religious part that got annoying. So it could be great for you but just be warned. I wasn‚Äôt expecting it. :)"
"Read it. Even if you're not a christian there are still so many pieces of solid knowledge in here. I am not religious but I still got SO MUCH out of this book. I wish I had read it years ago.If your feeling upset with where you are in life, this is a good place to start to understand how you got there. And while there is a lot of self accountability in this book, it is also very empowering because it shows you what you CAN do to get where you want to be."
"The revelation in this book is changing my entire perspective on life as a Christian. It gave me understanding that God doesn‚Äôt want me to just be everyone‚Äôs doormat and live dead inside because I don‚Äôt have time to even take care of myself. It showed me what the true spirit of self control is and gave me understanding that God cares for me too. I have an armor to resist manipulation and abuse like I never had before.  And I have hope again that I can succeed in life, relationships, business, marriage, and ministry. This was the key I needed to end my own self loathing."
"This book is for a very specific audience; middle-aged, suburban, Christian homemakers. I‚Äôm so upset I spent money on this. It is overtly religious and misogynistic. A lot of the quotations are directly from the Bible. I am not religious nor am I offended by other people‚Äôs religious beliefs, however I couldn‚Äôt get through a single page without a religious reference."
"I found this book immensely helpful! It was recommended multiple times to me by various mental health professionals, so I knew that the advice in it would be psychologically sound. I didn't actually expect this book to be one that pointed out consistently that these concepts are rooted in the Bible. As a Christian, I appreciate that, but I do realize that someone who isn't a Christian might find these constant reminders a distraction from what is truly life-changing insight, so I'm less likely to recommend to a friend who doesn't identify as a person of faith.  Others will be happy to here that these principals are both psychologically AND Biblically sound."
"I decided a long time ago Christianity wasn't for me, however I have no problem reading texts where references are sprinkled here and there. I just finished up chapter 2 and hoping things get easier, but this is VERY heavily Christian. Almost every other sentence is a bible verse, or mentioning the Christian God.I do think my mother, who is still devoutly Christian, or anyone else of that faith can benefit from this reading. However, I think that for anyone else who does not subscribe to this faith, the book will hold very little meaning to you (at least in chapters 1 and 2). Be warned, if Christianity is not for you - it's likely this book will not be for you either."
"I got this because it was the only book with a workbook and im going through that i know and its helpful.  one thing i will point out if you have dealt with any trauma - especially developmental like i have, you need to become familiar with boundaries not just on a cognitive level like here, which is important, but we need to become aware of them emotionally and somatic ally and energetically.  Our energetic boundaries are not usually conscious of them so when there are ruptures we can be distressed and puzzled.  those are important to learn about as well.  figure i would just give a wider picture of boundries.  so this is a good starter on boundries that is a solid general overview.  many of us will have to go beyond this i know and i left this to ensure people recognize that."
I‚Äôm so disappointed. Though it has great points in understanding boundaries the amount of religion woven into it makes me understand why I left it all in the first place. This book is out dated and I don‚Äôt reccomend it. I read a quarter into and will probably throw it out. The notion of evil and sin in it to blame ourselves is disgusting when I now know it stems from childhood neglect and abuse which is why I‚Äôm here in the first place. I‚Äôm changing my behaviors because I was hurt and therefore repeat the actions and sabotage my life because of it... not because of sins and evil. Save yourself the money and go to therapy or get a Book on being an adult child would be more useful.
"I am only 84 or so pages in and it has changed my life for the better. You will understand yourself, your parents, your friends in abusive relationships and how to make changes towards the better. It is a religious based book yes, literally on the back of the book it talks about becoming the person God wants you to be. I would recommend even nonreligious to read this book for the wealth of knowledge it provides. For believers it has amazing references to many many scriptures and had takes on overused scriptures I never even would of thought of. It is exceedingly insightful and I would highly suggest buying the book in a hard copy and studying it diligently. So many issues in society at the moment, arguably almost all, have a strong root in boundaries as the book explains. Boundaries really do effect areas in our lives we have no clue even how they effect us everyday in our lives. Buy the book now, you wont be sorry"
"This book is a great help for anyone who has room for maturity. Boundary setting evidently is a requirement for a healthy and enjoyable life and this book does a great job articulating it. It is true that most of the wisdom contained in this book is rested on scriptures, but I don‚Äôt mind that as all biblical commentary is used as good support for every concept, not as proselytizing. It is also very easy to read as it is very well structured."
"Figured this would be a great book not only for myself to read, but to also share information to the group sessions that I facilitate. Not that I have anything wrong about religions and what not, but I didn‚Äôt realize this book was focused on a religious aspect of setting boundaries. It was very strange for me to read as it didn‚Äôt really give much ‚Äúinsight‚Äù but provided more ‚Äúreligious comparisons‚Äù."
"This book is ""new."" :)These two professionals go directly to the nitty gritty, not a waste of time behind the bushes ;) I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants and desperately need to know where your Boundaries begin & end. I believe, that we haven't been taught with enough clarity, how far is too far, that we have the right to say ""no"" without explanations and must be respected without arguments. That we are individuals with our own calling and loads and that ""we cannot love our neighbor,"" if I don't learn how to love ourselves first. This book will help you to clear the blurry and see the clear lines :)"
"Like others, I purchased this book without knowing it was rooted in Christianity. I don't fully understand why anyone would mix faith with mental health issues, but apparently its a common theme in codependency books. I couldn't read the book and feel the description should make it CLEAR that this is a faith-based book."
"Wow, this book does lay down lines that should not be crossed and shows why we tend to cross them and the trouble that it leads to down the road. It is far beyond learning to say ""no"". It is a very good and insightful book that is linked to scripture (a bit too much for me, but understandable) It helps us understand that being good doesn't mean that you let people abuse you. Read it. Share it. Teach it to your children. Allow it to help you formulate a more confident and solid person free from the anger that builds when we allow ourselves to be dumped on."
"I took a boundaries class at a local church at a time where my life imploded. The video classes taught by the same authors (also can be found on youtube) were very informative and the book is a great supplement.  The contents of the book were on point with the many areas of growth where I need to learn but was not taught elsewhere.  Yes, there are lots of bible verses quoted in this book. The authors are Christians but not those over preaching no action type.  In fact, they specifically talked about living out Christ's words and not over-preaching it. The bible is full of life-changing wisdom and the book and the authors had done an amazing job correlating the verses directly to our day-to-day application. If religion turns you off, you could just replace God/bible/Christ with Joe Schomo or whatever name you admire, I doubt anyone would be as wise and have messages as powerful.  I have bought many copies of the book and shared the videos with friends and family as gifts.  Most have loved it as much as I did.  A few boundary busters outright rejected the very idea of the book, most likely because they just want to continue their manipulative ways and don't want to be told they are wrong.  That's okay though, as the victim of boundary busters, this book will empower you to take control of your life by setting the right limits and still remaining loving.  This book and the wisdom in it were exactly what I needed to get my life on track."
"I didn't read the description clearly enough when purchasing, and by the time I got around to reading it the return window closed. This is a very Christian book and would be helpful I suppose to those who are Christian, but I couldn't get over the sheer quantity of biblical quotes. Off-putting to say the least. Be warned, it can feel like every paragraph has at least one quote. But for those who are Christian they may enjoy this."
"This was a book that, I originally attempted to read last year and the early part of this year, and I just wasn't ready spiritually but the beginning of the third quarter (July 2021)  came and my accountability group theme was on Boundaries for July, and I knew it was time for me to read it. I must say, I am so glad I did. I thought this  book would have content that will help me get other people together, but this book got me to reevaluating my behavior towards my wife and our last child at home, I am happy to report, that I am a better person because of this book. I also recommend this book for couples."
"I picked this up after it being recommended to me for years. However, it's way too religious. I'm usually completely unbothered by this in books, but it's literally every page and every other sentence. It makes it difficult for me to enjoy the book."
"I haven't gotten through more than two chapters of this book thus far, but it has helped me immensely.  For some reason the therapists I have seen just don't talk much about boundaries and yet this is what I needed.  I love that it is from a Christian perspective.  I have already applied some of what I have learned and I have realized how a lack of boundaries has been a big part of my unhappiness in life.  I am so appreciative of this book and would recommend to anyone who has codependency issues or has been in an emotionally abusive relationship with someone."
"I absolutely HATE when you buy a self help book that has been touted and recommended for years , with NO MENTION whatsoever that it‚Äôs written by Christians who have stuffed the whole book with biblical references and passages with allusons to the ‚Äú lord ‚Äú and ‚Äú Jesus Christ ‚Äú over and over in each paragraph ! It‚Äôs insidious and highly disrespectful , once again trying to manipulate their way into your life any way possible.At least let the reader know before hand .It makes me so angry ."
"Boundaries Updated and Expanded Edition: When to Say Yes, How to Say No To Take Control of Your Life









  
  
    
  I'm Christian, but I don't like how Scripture is used here.It seems the authors were looking for Scripture verses to back up their world view, rather than presenting a more thoughtful, scriptural insight (and being open to Scripture leading along a path that may differ from their world view). The authors' version of God, here, looks mighty like what I'd assume their personal world vision is. I have no problem with the idea of people trying to integrate Scripture with highly specialized subject matter books, but here, I don't think it helps or is really faithful to the broader perspective of Christianity. If in doubt, it's better to keep them separate, because otherwise an author may end up just using Scripture to advance their own world view.Example 1: * Helping someone at work is crossing boundaries? That could be what loving one's neighbor would require. So, they don't like community and collaboration, and prefer individual will-to-power. Interestingly, no Scripture is mentioned in this section. Because if it were to be mentioned, it would probably subvert the message they convey. For example, Galatians 6:2, ""Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ,"" would contradict a just-look-out-for-yourself message. If we only help people who have shown that they ""deserve"" help, that leads us, and society, down a mighty judgmental path. (p197, ""Problem Number 1: Getting saddled with another person's responsibilities"")Example 2: * It's also unwise to reference how you're to bring a friend with you to confront your boss, if confronting your boss directly doesn't work. Btw, that scripture passage was for confronting fellow Christians, not secular authorities. It's like they just picked a random scripture to apply to this section, without considering it's wisdom/relevance. This type of ""correction"" is hardly ever even used in Christian circles, much less on someone's boss. Pshhh. (p201, referencing Matthew 18)Example 3: * Again, the authors present a highly antiseptic model of the workplace as a quasi-emotionless place, ""People increasingly come to the workplace wanting the organization to be a 'family.' "" The authors condemn this as a ""lack of boundaries between the personal and work life."" That's BS. ESPECIALLY, if you're claiming to present Christian principles. Sheer BS, in the strongest of terms. Sorry for the acronyms, but I get pissed when people advance their own personal/cultural life vision to others & call it God's vision. Just no. Look up ""professional"" in the concordance (challenging, ""be professional at work,"" which is said to squelch emotions... how about ""be Christian,"" be known for love). Most bible translations don't even use the term professional. Only the more dynamic (looser) translations will use it, and it's often in a mocking way, as something insincere & inauthentic: ""professional mourners,"" ""professional prophets. (""Problem 7: Expecting too much of Work,"" p205-206) Truly, I think that if we're not good to those around us, perhaps even considering how they're doing on a heart level (not just a what-can-you-produce, getting-things-done level), we're missing the point what we've been put on earth for.The tone is a harsh look-out-for-yourself model, which is builds itself on an individualistic culture, but it is not a Christian culture, or a Christian way of living.***A Christian model of living looks at the nuclear family, as an image of God; the extended family of future generations and past generations, as bound together in a covenant of blessings or trials; community, as interconnected members of the Body of Christ; strangers in affliction, as our own afflicted Christ (Matthew 25, FYI); and every human person, as unique and irreplaceable reflections of the Almighty.They tried though, the authors tried.I'm sure some people can absorb the message well and distill meaningful content. It's just not packaged well for me. The tone turns me off.  It would have been better, and much more palatable, from my perspective, without the religious content--simply presenting their opinion and advice for what it is--their opinion and advice, and not trying to christen it as coming from God.If you can deal with those issues, it might be fine. Depending where your needs are at, if you need to practice really strict boundaries for a time, to clarify things, this might help for a time. It just doesn't have the ""be all end all"" picture. Perhaps good for a temporary or specific clarification of boundaries, while recognizing the book‚Äôs limitations."
"EVERYONE should read this book.  I originally intended to help put some boundaries with my extended family who is always wanting money from me and trying to guilt me into just offering it.  Through the reading I saw where I needed to watch my boundaries where my adult children are concerned.  I think this is a ""must read"" for anyone feeling guilt because they have found some financial success and others in their family try to guilt them into giving them money all the time.  It gives good, sound advise and tips to lovingly say no."
"Excellent book for learning what relational boundaries are and how to make yours healthier. Mental health professionals I know have confirmed it contains sound psychology. I've been learning a lot. Some parts are more relevant to my current relationships than others, but every section is interesting and clearly written. There are also plenty of stories from people's real lives to show how all this plays out. After all, nobody will come up to you and say ""hi, I have difficulty respecting other people's boundaries, and here's how"".That said, this is aimed squarely at an Evangelical Christian audience. There are many Bible passages in every chapter, which are used in the manner specific to Baptist, Evangelical, and other Protestant Christians with a commitment to scripture as literal and divinely inspired. If that's you, fantastic! You have found a book that harmoniously combines theology with psychology. If that's not you, maybe sample before you buy, and realize you'll have to do a lot of mental editing."
"If you are related to people, talke to people, know people of any kind. You need to read this book. I didn't read it until my family was in a crisis mode. Totally worth every penny. I use much of what I learned with my own familiy and in-laws. I also use it with my parents (I'm a teacher). I now advise engaged friends to read it as well. It's an easy read, and a wealth of pratical information of how to treat yourself and others with respect."
Helped me realize some of the false-burdens and responsabilities that weren't mine but inherited through my family dynamic. If you'd like to regain some peace of mind and remove focus from what you aren't go on INTENTIONALLY READ IT AND PROCESS IT.
I have struggled with boundaries and resentment most of my life and never realized it.This book beautifully articulates so many common and complex situations we will and have faced with people and boundaries.This is one of the best books I‚Äôve read in the last 5 years.
"I literally just received this book 2 minutes ago and flipped through it. It's a much bigger book than I expected (300+ pages) so that's great! But I wasn't aware the author included Bible verses throughout the book and mentioned God often (including a chapter on Boundaries and God). Which is great for those of faith! But I must not have read the book details (or the back of the book summary), so it came as a surprise to me, as I prefer evidence-based data.I don't want to judge the book solely on this, so I will read through it further, and hopefully it can still help my situation."
"Dr. Henry Cloud was my Dr. at his & Dr. Townsend's Hospital Clinic & this book was originally written two years after I was there, but this subject is SO important for relationships for yourself to dealing with others in life.  I bought his new version and it renews & addresses where I first learned about Boundaries.  I also bought Dr, Townsend;s book & like his format and how he addresses boundaries.  I think both of them have much to offer & refresh my first first introduction this healthier understanding & putting it to practice.  The clinic is not longer but the books will  greatly help  you in life."
"This book is full of religious references. By looking at the cover and description it's barely noticeable that this is the case. I think this is misleading. I am not religious, and gave it a really good faith effort to read the book and ignore all the God stuff, but it was impossible. And actually, if you strip away the ""evidence"" and ""reasoning"" that was just religious, there is not that much useful or deep content here.I wish I could get my money back because this is just wrong. Was really disappointed because I thought this would be a great book on boundaries written by educated people (Drs)."
"I have gifted this book at least 4 times and even then, it‚Äôs probably not enough. I‚Äôve read it at least five times. If you‚Äôre wondering about boundaries then I‚Äôm almost sure you don‚Äôt have them and should dedicate this book to memory. Your quality of life will drastically improve if you implement these principles."
"This is the best book I have ever read!!! I wasn‚Äôt even looking for this book. I was reading a review of another book on boundaries and this guy suggested this book. I‚Äôve always wondered why A lot of things happened in my life the way that they did. By reading the book I learned that it was because of a lack of boundaries. It also teaches about self respect, and toxic people. Do yourself a favor, invest in this book, (very small investment) and change your life! It has positively impacted my life."
"I read this book solely because I could earn 12 continuing education credits towards renewing my national counseling certification and it wasn't a dry, boring textbook. In that respect, I'm completely happy with the book and it exceeded my expectations.Pros: The book was very easy to read though it got fairly repetitive in places. (I have the shortest attention span and patience for nonfiction reading.)The biggest plus of this book is that the author does great job of putting the book layman terms and making the concepts very applicable to every day life. I could see the concepts of this book being very beneficial almost everyone as boundaries are a tricky concept to navigate. As with most self-help books the target audience seems to be females so I'm not sure how appealing it would be to male readers, but I could see it being good bibliotherapy specifically for married couples and young adults.Cons: I didn't really buy the biblical aspects of the book. I'm not saying I didn't agree with what he said, but references to many of the bible verses seemed contrite and almost gimmicky. He could have taken them all out and I think this would have sold fine as a secular self-help book. I think his counseling concepts and presentation are great, but the bibical piece seemed like an after thought and that he was saying ""which verses really would fit my book"" as opposed to ""this is what the bible says and let me show you why"" which irritated me just on a personal level. Also, as others have pointed out, the ""day in a life without (and with) boundaries"" at the beginning and end of the book was corny and I could have done without. Though he states often in the book that work on boundaries is not easy, the intro and concluding chapters made it seems like ""just do these 5 steps and your life will be amazing."""
"This book is life-changing if you want to figure out how to have better relationships, whether with your parents, children, spouse, co-workers, friends, etc.  It was recommended to me by a Christian counselor and I have recommended it to over 20 people so far. Stop doing what you ""think is best"" for those you love and read this book so that you can see the behavioral dysfunction.  You are not helping anyone if you are enabling them. If you don't read it for yourself, read it for those you love."
I noticed that some people thought this was a secular book in their reviews. This is not a secular book. This is a wonderful book for Christians struggling with many kinds of different relationships and it gives lots of helpful advice. There are a lot of biblical references so people who are familiar with the Bible will really benefit from this book but it's also good for Christians who only have a little Bible knowledge as well. I think it will suit any believer from any denomination well. I highly recommend it. I love the book it is extremely helpful to me.
"I‚Äôm only on chapter 1 and my life has been changed. Why didn‚Äôt I buy this book sooner is the question I‚Äôm asking? If you‚Äôre struggling with toxic relationships with abusive people, this is a wonderful book to help you gain control. If you‚Äôre struggling in general with maintaining healthy relationships with friends or family, this is also wonderful. This is a fantastic read for anyone who has some unhealthy relationships they can improve in their lives."
"As a Christian I would feel guilty of saying no at times.  I felt that I always had to be available to help.  I did not have boundaries.  A friend recommended this book to me and it has helped me in so many ways.  I realized how I was enabling so many people by me saying yes to everything.  This book has helped me even with my own family.  I've gained power back after reading this and it feels so good.  If you have a problem saying ""no"" and/or you consider yourself a people pleaser, this book is for you.  I definitely recommend this book."
"I'm doing a class with this book and it's changing my life. I keep telling people that Boundaries is opening my head up like wasabi! The concept of telling someone ""no"" and not doing it just out of angst or for the sole purpose of trying to protect yourself was Greek to me. You mean to tell me that I can tell someone that I cannot enable them or be ""the doormat"" anymore not because I'm angry but because I love them..what? This book may scare the pants off of you if you dare implement it in your life but when you start, it's like something in the universe shifts. This is a keeper."
"I highly recommend this book for anyone feeling ‚Äúout of control‚Äù in their life. I think we all have trouble setting boundaries to some extent. Honestly, everyone would benefit from this book. It has sections on drawing boundaries with your marriage, your children, your workplace, yourself, etc. It‚Äôs one of those books you can read more than once and always reference back to.  I have learned so much from this book and I look forward to growing based on the principles and tips I‚Äôve learned from inside."
"For those of us that are people pleasers this book is excellent.  It helps to understand boundaries and how to set them, especially for those of us who never learned how to set boundaries as a child.  Boundaries are positive and should be applied in our lives.  I have purchased this book for others too because I have found it to be so worthy of reading."
This book teaches you to build a WALL to avoid dealing with issues in a Christian way!! You just have an excuse for for your bad behavior.
"I‚Äôm serious everyone needs to read this book. Everyone struggles with boundaries in at least a couple relationships. Such an important topic for Christians especially who are manipulated through guilt so often. When one understands the power of boundaries they lead to so much freedom as God intended. They are not a weapon, but a tool to take control of your life so you can give out of an overflow, freely, graciously and lovingly instead of out of guilt."
Biblically inaccurate. I‚Äôm disappointed after reading the section on Boundaries and God. Returning.
"I am giving this book one star because there‚Äôs no disclosure of the fact that this book is based on biblical teachings on the cover. I brought the audible version and that was non returnable, total waste of money.Edit: audible team refunded me the amount I paid for this book and that was good."
"I'm currently studying counseling and wanted to gain better insight into setting boundaries. I really wish I had read reviews before purchasing because it is really not appropriate for the kind of work I intend to do. It relies heavily on scripture. Since I do not consider myself Christian and cannot ethically recommend a book that pushes a Christian perspective, this book is not valuable to me. I'm sure this helps many people set boundaries, but it is not for everyone."
"I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!! I‚Äôm about to read this for a second time and have so many great things highlighted, and that‚Äôs even with me skipping the parenting part. I just got out of a relationship where I definitely did not stand up for myself and after reading this I feel much more confident in my ability to know about and stick up for (and feel good about it) my boundaries. The beginning and last few chapters are the best in my opinion if you are just wanting to skim."
"Though I am not a Christian, I still learned a lot from this book. Mind you, it is really heavy with Bible verses, and stories of the everyday struggles of church going members balancing life, church community, marriage, and kids. Some chapters, I skimmed because that didn't apply to me, but if you can read beyond the surface of the example, there are really great nuggets of wisdom that you can apply to your life. I felt like this book should have a title that identifies it as a Christian book, instead of an assumption that the reader would be."
"I have had a bit of a crisis here as of late. I realized about myself that I'm not great about communicating my boundaries. I don't know if you've experienced this, but sometimes it SEEMS that more is asked of me in church, work, and elsewhere, because the assumption is my singleness provides me countless hours of time that I'm sitting around waiting to fill by wandering aimlessly about my house eating pints of ice cream, petting my cat, and growing increasingly more bitter. [Not to say I don't love ice cream, but you'll never catch me petting a cat or wandering aimlessly.]I learned a few really important things in the process of reading this book [and talking to an amazing life coach.]1. I have to do something about my boundaries. No one else is going to do it for me. Unless I communicate out loud what I keep telling myself internally, no one else is going to know what I'm willing to take on and what I'm not. I have to take responsibility for my own self because no one else is going to. That's not a bitter assessment, it's actually quite freeing. ""No"" gets to be a beautiful word that helps to set values in their proper places. It relieves us of the pressure to take things on because we might feel guilty. There are often responsibilities we've taken on in our pursuit of passions, God, and enjoyment that make our lives feel full and meaningful. Learning what to say ""YES"" to will enable us more easilty to say ""no"" when we need to.2. In a chapter on boundaries and spouses, I thought I'd just fly through the chapter because it doesn't apply to me, but I found myself knee deep in the concepts. I actually found them quite applicable. I have LOTS of intimate relationships, they just don't happen to be with a spouse. They are with my family and closest friends. I could relate in a big way to a story of a wife bringing her husband to counseling because he was spending increasing amounts of time away from home and she was becoming increasingly lonely within their marriage. She wanted the doctors to ""fix"" him and get him to want to be home more. Instead, they asked her to take responsibility for herself and her needs. She would sit at home anxiously waiting for him to get home, calling several times a day, and then with mountain high expectations of him when he finally arrived. It was too much for him. He was shutting down and spending more and more time away from her, because she needed him too much. They encouraged her to diversify her interests and friendships. I could relate because the concept applies in every relationship. When our expectations for a person exceeds their ability to fulfill it, we risk them pulling away. No one can fulfill the depths of our needs. We need to know what we're asking of others, and not expect others to be more than they can possibly be for us.3. Anger is a sign of boundaries being overstepped. Not ALL anger is going to be caused by someone overstepping my boundaries, but it DID cause me to take a hard look at why I feel anger or resentment at times toward others who ask things of me. A lot of times it is because I have a boundary that they are asking me to extend to them, because I haven't told them it was there in the first place. I can't be angry with someone else because I don't honor my own boundaries or because I don't communicate to them the truth of what I'm feeling.What about you? What trouble have you had by not having good boundaries? What keeps you from setting them up in the first place?"
"It would have been nice to have a heads up about the heavy Christianity in here. I'm able to overlook it, and get great advice but there was no warning I was going to be blindsided by the word of God. This book is supposed to teach you how to respect and create boundaries, and right away it crossed over mine with sneaking in Jesus. I never asked for that."
"This book could help anyone.  Its especially suitable for Christians who are unsatisfied with their lifestyle, even though they think they are 'good Christians'.  A lot of ideas and patterns of living we have learned from our family, church, and elsewhere can benefit from reveiw.  I don't agree with everything in the book, but it can shine a lot of light into the deep crevasses of our thinking."
"If you have things bothering you in life; like, why does OTHER peoples stress get to me? READ THIS BOOK! It shows you how to set limits and boundaries in your life to help control (manage) the stress that comes into your life, and helps you realize what is YOURS to carry in this life, and what ISNT yours to be responsible for. Its hard to apply in life, but very much worth setting boundaries in your life to protect YOUR sanity. definitely recommend!"
This book opened my eyes to so much of why things had happened and continued to happen in my life. I've passed the book on to 2 others and the lessons themselves to many more.  Well written with applicable stories and application.  Honestly you will be hooked after first couple of pages.
"This book really helps figuring out how to set some limits for your own health and happiness.  I found it helpful in being able to say no without feeling guilty even though I love my spouse, grown children and grandchildren very much.  I'm happier for carving out time for my own needs and learning how to let my family and friends know what I can and can't agree to do.  It describes the common scenarios in families and friendships.  It has quite a bit of biblical quotations to ratify the advice but one can glean out the nuggets without them if desired."
"This was worth the read as it provided many insights into why boundaries are not only God-honoring, but they‚Äôre also limitations that God Himself initiates with His creation. The only issue with it is the inherent theological roots, based strongly in Arminian beliefs. As a Reformed Christian, the language the authors use to communicate some of their points did not line up with the Calvinist perspective on the sovereignty of God. Otherwise, it was very enlightening in how it encouraged believers that establishing boundaries with themselves, and those in their lives, is not only desirable, but necessary. My favorite part was how much emphasis they placed on personal responsibility and accountability."
I've read and recommended this book to my clients (psychotherapist and medical social worker). It has been a great source of reference. I'm requiring my 19 to to read it. Things I  learned as I became a therapist. Would have saved me alot of heartache.
This book is written about what boundaries are and how to set them in all areas of your life.  It is well written and I found it easy to read.  I first heard about the book on the Dave Ramsey radio show and later bought both the book and workbooks for my wife and I to work through.  The book does reference the Bible to show what God's perspective is on boundaries.  Even if you are not a Christian the principles are sound and constructive.  You don't have to be a believer to get value out of this book.
I listened to the audio book and it was great. I am still struggling to set up the right types of boundaries and separate niceness with assertiveness and making sure I am also nice to myself. I purchased the physical copy and it been great rereading through it and having a reference manual to go back too and continue to put this information into practice. I love all the boundaries books and many other Henry cloud and dr Townsend books. This is even important for us to go over with our children. I‚Äôm reading through it with my teen. It‚Äôs been good so far.
"I recommend BOUNDARIES to EVERYONE I know!  It is amazing about learning about how to relate to other people better, as well as learn about how your personality developed.... and the personalities of others around you.  This is a MUST read book for anyone seeking self-help or personal development that will help them in ALL area of their lives, if they put it into practice.  I also recommend another book by the same authors called SAFE PEOPLE.  I cannot recommend these books enough."
I wasn't expecting it to be heavily Christian and very women focused.  So much so as to be impractical to any non religious readers and push back men.
"My wife has been struggling with some relationships and the toll they take on her.  Her spiritual guide recommended this to her.After it helped her identify the problems with these relationships, it gave her strategies to manage them in a way that is not mean to the other parties but is clear in her approach to them in setting boundaries.Has also been helpful in communicating with each other to strengthen our marriage by evaluating boundaries between us."
"If you have ever had a one sided relationship with a loved one where they have boundaries of their own but you have never set up boundaries for yourself with them, then you will eventually experience the dire need to set up your own boundaries and know why and how to do just that.  I think that this is an amazing book to understand why everyone should have boundaries of some kind in their relationships.  I now understand why just being a loving and good person is not the foundation of a good and balanced relationship but is actually the finished part of it.  After reading the book, twice, I believe that if a relationship has boundaries on both sides, as a foundation, then the outcome of that relationship will give way to a loving and deep friendship or love relationship and it will foster self respect and respect for others.  We all go hay wire in how we deal with our daily lives with others and how we treat them in what we consider good or bad but I now understand that we must not let that be the influence of how we treat others.This book sounds like common sense but is actually more than just that.  I love how every chapter, I was able to see a little of me in it and how I could get more from my life and my relationships by being up front in a loving way and knowing that God didn't make us all just door mats.  Christ doesn't give us anything and everything we want but instead he gives us what he knows we need and what he is willing to give us to build our relationship up with him into one of thankfulness, trust, love and his Grace.  I now understand that we are practicing this now so that we can have a closer relationship with Him through eternity.  I believe this book is a gift to anyone that reads it.I also read his book ""Boundaries with Kids"" and highly recommend it to everyone.  I don't think it is just for young parents with growing children or a growing family.  I actually read it first and through it wanted to read this book ""Boundaries""So many books that try to help us overcome relationships in our lives, stress the good the bad and the ugly.  These books written by Cloud and Townsend stress the Golden Rule and it really encompasses loving ourselves through having boundaries before we can love others.  The ""Kids"" book would make the most wonderful gift to a young couple with a new baby.  I wish I had read this book when our children were growing up."
"Not so much to say about this book so far. Preachy and tee-balling your way to self-help with bible quotes and catchy marketing. Smart people will see through this. Waste of a purchase.It's preachy. was pitched as a self-help book, but it reeks of better-than-thou christianity and guilt.Not even suitable for a bathroom book. Better for the bonfire."
"I love the scriptural foundation this book builds as a case for Christians upholding healthy personal boundaries! Too many are led to believe that being a good Christian means being codependent. This book is the key to breaking out of that mindset, whether you're new to the concept of boundaries or are seeking a biblical basis for this concept after approaching it in therapy."
"This book is well written by experts and really helped me to understand how to stand up for and care for myself while still being caring and respectful of others. One key lesson was that hurting someone‚Äôs feelings is not the same as causing them harm and that sometimes in standing up for yourself, you will cause some hurt feelings but that‚Äôs not on you. A wonderful resource."
"Before I purchased this book, I read TONS of reviews here on Amazon.com.  The reason was that I felt I urgently and immediately needed help, and did not want to purchase a book that was useless for my purposes.  I had become enraged over a situation with a fellow church member, who I had shown great generosity to, and I was beginning to believe I had been used, exploited, or perhaps just have a problem myself.What interested me most were the negative reviews.  Many negative reviews referred to the Christian content of the book.  But that was a positive to me, because I wanted a Biblical answer to my questions.  Some negative reviews said, ""This book distorts the Bible,"" or words similar, and that did concern me.  Nevertheless, I purchased the book and found it to be most helpful to me.There were an example or two, relating to the Bible, that I thought, ""Perhaps this is a stretch.""  Also, there was a reference to ""the wide path and the narrow path,"" that did not refer to what I believe that means - that there is only one way to eternal life - and that is through the LORD JESUS Christ!  Still, I did not find the use of this example to be blasphemous, or an abomination, perhaps just a stretch of the Bible words.I went to a Pastor also about my dilemma, (Southern Baptist Church), and he felt this was a very good book.  Still, I know there is a herd mentality in Christianity, and I will not go so far as to say everything in this book is Gospel truth.  But it did help me calm down and realize a weakness in myself, and if I get the opportunity to discuss our differences with my Christian friend who caused me to become angry, I believe I will be in a good position to help him more than before.All in all I give this book five stars!"
I read and studied this book over 20 years ago and I went through the new edition recently. This book is a must read for Christians and non-Christians alike. It's full of wisdom that the authors have gleaned from years in counseling ministry and years of studying the Bible. I highly recommend it.
"This book is beneficial with help pinpointing your boundary issues and help recognizing other's as well. I didn't feel as though it gave a ton of advice/biblical. Overall I feel like it basically says be tough and allow no give, which isn't really biblical. There has to be a healthy balance of defining boundaries but also giving grace. Because lets face it some people have really weird boundaries that they use to push others way and need to give some flex."
"This is  a book about how to live a healthy life, mentally, physically and spiritually. I especially liked the discussion of forgiveness, why letting go of what's ""owed"" us sets us free from the persons who injured us, knowingly and unknowingly. The many stories show the work it takes to create respectful relationships, the most important relationship is with ourselves."
"All I can say is.. ""This is an amazing book"".  It was recommended by a psychologist friend among many other titles for my love of reading.  I am so glad I got a chance to read it.  It can be very helpful for any married or single person in understanding how to balance your day-to-day life by knowing your limitations as a human being in dealing with your own self, spouse, family, friends or any kind of relationship and be in control of your own Internal structure such as your behavior, attitude, thoughts, feelings, choices, decisions etc. and improve the quality of your life.  It is also like following God's word in living your life the way He designed it for you.  This book is for everyone, either religious, spiritual or not.  It has aleady helped me a lot, and I am sure it will help you too.  All the best!"
"I loved this book. Written with great expertise and love. I would recommend this book to anyone who would listen, and of course in particular to those of use who have not even known what ‚Äúboundaries‚Äù are throughout their lives. Highly recommend this book and its author."
"I find myself wanting to recommend this book to people all of the time. Excellent stories and lessons demonstrating how to maintain healthy boundaries with children, spouses, siblings, parents, coworkers, bosses, ect. Also explains what can happen when boundaries are not respected. Well written and easy to understand."
"My pastor recommended this book to me as a helpful Christian way to deal with some of the issues I was encountering. It's easy to read, and has lots of great recommendations which are constantly linked to bible passages, so it helps a person resolve issues in the fashion God wants us to. The book even acknowledges that humans often have a difficult time doing something they're not accustomed to, so the approach isn't critical, which is something else I embraced."
"We all need reminders in day to day life about the end for healthy boundaries. Without them we come others doormats, our angry eat us up inside, etc. This book is great at reminding of the important role boundaries play in our personal and professional lives. Highly recommend if you have a problem saying no or not set limits to read this book."
"Such an amazing book full of so many life lessons. This book has literally altered my life. I had no prior knowledge on how to set boundaries in my every day life. This book transformed the way I make decisions and really taught me that I have the power to say no to friends, family members, co-workers, bosses, and my spouse without feeling guilty! I have been setting boundaries ever since reading this book(which I read more than once because it was so knowledgeable). Since reading I have had a better quality of life and better relationships with others."
"My husband and I have read a few counseling books together and this is by far the best. It's easy to read, non-biased, and absolutely relevant for everyone. I'm trying to get my mom, my grandparents, my siblings, EVERYONE to read this. It's really helped us develop a foundation for healthy relationships and self-respect."
"The authors are Christian and I don't define myself as a follower of any one religion. Yet, I found the book very helpful. I was bothered, however, that the writers of a book about boundaries condone corporal punishment (they call it spanking). That makes no sense to me. People who have been physically punished often carry that shame and humiliation in their bodies for years. The consequences can be overwhelming and affect all their relationships (especially their relationship with themselves) in very negative ways. I didn't find a way to write to Doctors Cloud and Townsend, so felt a need to express my opinion here."
"Reading this was amazingly healing and confidence-building, clearing up 15 years of confusion. Full of ""AH-HA"" moments, clearing out old ""cobwebs"" in my brain. I actually typed out excerpts and placed them in a jar to pull out on a day to keep reminding myself of refreshing truths learned throughout the year. I am interested in following up with the group studies too."
"I really tried to get something out of this book, it's so popular, but I can't derive meaning from the examples and methodology the authors employ. I am not Christian, though I respect faith and spirituality, and do not find help here."
"My husband and I dedicated a chapter every night until we finished the book.  We gained so much perspective and knowledge. Also, brought light to personal tramas and now we have tools to implement and make changes as we move forward."
"Ok so I have to admit I JUST started this book- I am 3 chapters in but already I am so blown away. So many light bulbs are coming on in my mind. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I know it's going to change my life if I apply what it is saying.Will update after I finish it.************UPDATE****************Just finished this book and it has literally rocked my world. I am now studying it because it has had so much of an impact on my thinking that I want to be able to teach these things to others who are struggling with relationship issues- Whether it be issues with self or with others, this book can help if you are open to the correction of the Lord and humble yourself to see yourself as you are. I have been so convicted and seen so many things about myself that were not so pretty- but that was what I needed, to see the truth because the truth is literally setting me free!! I know this book was right on time for where I'm at in my life and I am so thankful for it. The wisdom, revelation, and knowledge found in it are exactly what I needed at this difficult time in my life. God has used this book to change my life already and I know as I study and continue to apply what I've learned I will continue to be changed for the better.Praise the King for TRUTH!"
"This book was recommended to me by my therapist, though not directly it came up as a side note.. anyway I'm on page 47 and probably won't be able to finish this book due to the constant reference to God and the Bible. I was hoping I could skim past the religiosity and still get something out of it but this is truly a book meant for the Christian disciple. As a former Evangelical it is not for me. Also, as being only this far in, I have already disagreed with some bits about setting boundaries with an abuser... gives the indication that you would keep giving them chances and coming back only when they are truly changed and repentant but the idea seems dangerous to me."
"This is an amazing book I am reading again after a number of years.  It not only teaches us how to set boundaries, but how to help our children learn to do the same, which can help them become better adjusted in adult relationships.  The chapter on ""Boundaries at Work"" is especiallyeffective information on learning to manage the modern workplace with street smart guidelines. I have started to practice what I am learning and to take responsibilities for setting and communicating my boundaries and learning to allow others to do the same.  It is a growing process, and the feeling and strategy is amazing.  Perhaps when we are truly ready, the teacher does appear.  Suggestion: read each chapter, one at a time, then think about that chapter and apply what you are learning. I feel it is a worthwhile building process."
"I think this book is incredible. I highly recommend it for any Christian--the book is from a Christian perspective, so there are references to the Bible, but I think the principles can apply to non-Christians. The basic idea of the book is learning to take responsible for yourself and to stop taking responsibility for other people. One of the biggest things I appreciated about the book was that it gave me the tools to say ""no"" to people (the book strongly emphasizes that we ought not to do things out of guilt or fear--which is not something we often hear in the church or elsewhere really where telling someone ""no"" is seen as a bad or uncompassionate thing to do).This book has improved the way I approach my marriage, job, church... I wish I read it 10 years ago! There were so many things I did in my life that I felt I was being pushed into doing when I didn't even realize I had the power to say, ""no, I don't want to do that."" In the end I would resent the person for asking me to do things, but really I didn't have to go along with what I was asked to do just because I was asked! Anyway... I might sound like I'm rambling, but if you're a people pleaser, or a yes man, and don't like that about yourself but don't know what to do other than be at the whim of whatever anybody asks of you, then this book is great and gives you the tools to change. You will be glad you read it!"
"Great book and very well written. A book that is worth buying and keeping because you'll refer back to it over and over again. You'll gain a lot of mental freedom and learn to not carry the burdens that were never yours to carry to begin with. You'll also see the manipulators in your life, but you'll also learn to handle them in a way that doesn't drain you of your energy."
"This has been a tough read for me. I'm into the bible and all, but this was a serious amount of scripture dropping and  informing the reader of what those scriptures mean. It might be a true interpretation of scripture, however it didn't lend the validity to the book that I think the authors were hoping for."
"Everyone should read this book!!!  It will help you with every kind of relationship in your life, no matter who you come in contact with we need to know how to set boundaries to live better and happier lives.  If you want more out of your life read this book it is a great beginning to a new life."
"This is a great book for changing your way of thinking and allowing others to use you.  Direct, to the point and definitely a winner.  Applying the changes can make a lot of difference in your life."
I am not religious and respect the beliefs of people who are religious.  To me this book was filled with religious references that I simply didn‚Äôt understand or want to read. This many religious references made this a very tough read. Couldn‚Äôt finish the book.
"Have you had past trauma which drives you to behave like a mouse to a cat or a bull in a China shop? Do you avoid certain social situations because of the expectations of your friends and avoidance is the only way you know to care for yourself? Are you wanting to find a spouse? Do you want to be more effective in your professional relationships? The list goes on; you need to read this book.The principles in this book provide a way to discern your personal property lines, and in so doing teach the reader how to behave in certain social situations. This allows the reader to have confidence in a larger set of circumstances, and therefor to tackle them head on; as your ""no"" gets bigger, your ""yes"" does too."
I first learned of this book from my therapist.  It was required reading.  I gave my copy to a friend of mine who needed it.  Since then I have ordered several copies for other friends as well.  I need to order me another copy and re-read it.  It has taught me a lot of life lessons and practical knowledge.  It's a must read especially if you are dealing with a difficult relationship or learning to navigate hard conversations and situations as a non-confrontational person.
"I had no idea that this book was about God and boundaries. It not does not say anywhere in the description that this is for people who believe in God. I'm reading it and skimming on the God part but there are so many talks about god that is hard to finish it without reading about God.I'm sure there's a lot of good information but the problem is that if you don't believe in God or if you don't abide by Christianity, it's very hard to keep reading this book. It even quotes The Bible.I bought it as a Kindle edition so it looks like I can't return it anymore. Too bad."
"Having good cause to say YES or NO is not enough.  Understanding why it is necessary and what will happen if/when you try to say ""NO"" gives you the strength to say it and politely tick by it.  Take control of your life.  This book will not disappoint.  It will take some work, not a simple solution, but it will pavee the way for a better tomorrow."
"I really think I could have learned a lot from this book. But is very God heavy, not that there is anything wrong with that. But for someone who isn‚Äôt religious, the constant stream of Bible verses was off putting. I couldn‚Äôt finish it, only made it a 1/4 of the way in, which stinks. The parts that weren‚Äôt quoting verses were very good and informative. If you don‚Äôt mind the verses, this is an excellent book."
"I removed the book, and downloaded it a second time.  The book now works again.I purchased this Audible book when I purchased the Kindle edition, but after listening to the book through the end of chapter two, it will only play chapter one.  I have not been able to get back to where I left off, and I cannot find any support topics that cover this issue."
"This was a great book on how to establish boundaries. I love how it is from a Christian perspective, Because in the past, teaching at church confused me and it years I felt like I was required to say yes to everything, and didn‚Äôt guard my time and the true ministry God had called me to. This has helped me not feel guilty when saying ‚Äúno‚Äù and I‚Äôm gaining confidence in my calling."
This book has helped me in so many ways. Christian-based and used scriptures in a holistic way. The authors did an excellent job writing this and has encouraged me to read the Boundaries with Kids. Highly recommend for everyone as this is very crucial for most of our lives today.
"This has some good advice on boundaries. However, I think they take twist scripture to fit their message at times. This really isn't a Christian book in my opinion. The advice on boundaries apply to all but I think they use scripture out of place to market to the faith based audience."
I have given them to women I coach and requested that they pass the books on to other women.  One of their first Boundaries books came back to me 10 years later by a woman that was helped through a very difficult relationship and divorce with a narcissist spouse.  This expanded edition also covers a lot of issues we all deal with using all the tech media that can cause a lot of boundary violations with careless users.  Sue in Florida
This is a Christian book. I didn't see that in the description or reviews. So if you're like me and prefer to get your information from other sources this isn't the book for you.
"So grateful this is available on CD for those who don‚Äôt have time/don‚Äôt like to read.I recommend this book to everyone, it is extremely helpful in setting Godly boundaries so that you are not weighed down by guilt, fear and other negative feelings brought on by others that we are not meant to bear. Remember that God is in control and this book can really help you let go of your past and move forward with serving the way he intended. This book will change your perspective for the better!"
"I failed to notice any mention that this was Christian literature.  Instead of backing up points in the book with references to scientific studies, the authors quote scripture.  It seems to be written on a 6th grade reading level.  Here's a typical excerpt from the last chapter, ""A Day in a Life With Boundaries"":  ""Sherrie slipped into her new dress.  It fit perfectly - two sizes smaller than she had worn a few months ago.  Thanks, God, for my new self-boundaries, she prayed.""  Infantile and sexist.  The book is heavily padded with that type of content, and that is not what I thought I was paying for.  Returned."
"I purchased Boundaries and was hooked from the first page on. Fantastic, easy to understand, and to apply in your own life. You may even see yourself in some of the stories. It will positively impact your life and create healthy boundaries in a world that continues to frightfully move towards people forcing their own objectives and will upon you. Live and let live but get those boundaries in place!"
"I am not a fan of reading books and honestly many times I looked to see how many pages I read to finish the goal of getting to the end. The book grabs your attention right from the start and is very interesting. I love how it incorporates the Bible and its verses within the book. I recommended this book to several people already before even finishing it. I do hope that my journey will go smooth, but people don't like change or to hear ""No"". Glad my therapist suggested this book."
"I read this book many years ago, the old hardcover. I taught it in women classes for many years, and recommended it for men and women in counseling, and really in helping people who want to understand their relationship with God as well as relationships with family and friends. I again am buying it for a friend, but haven't read this new edition... and hope that there aren't too many changes...because I found the original to be very useful and healing in many situations.  As with any book....always be sure that it isn't conflicting with God's true Word, the bible.  I personally liked the chapter that they wrote about MYTHS...."
"AM  USING IT AS I COUNSEL A FRIEND. THE ONLY THING I WOULD CHANGE IS THE SIZE OF THE CHAPTERS. THEY AREA LITTLE TOO LONG FOR ME. I USUALLY LIKE TO READ THROUGH ONE THOUGHT CONCEPT AT ATIME SO I READ ONE CHAPTER A DAY. BUT THESE ARE TOO LONG FOR ME TO DO THAT. WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING OR REMOVE ANYTHING, JUST AD MORE CHAPTERS WITH LESS VOLUME. BUT THAT'S JUST FOR ME, CAN'T WAIT TO GET INTO REAL DEPTH. LOVE THE SCRIPTURES AS TO APPLYING THEM IN OUR LIFE."
"It‚Äôs a good resource but too Christian centric for me. From the description, I didn‚Äôt realize there would be so many religious references. I did find it useful as it explains what boundaries are, how they are overstepped in different scenarios, and what to do to create healthy ones."
"I didn't find this very well-written, especially given that it relies on a bible verse in nearly every paragraph."
This book has completely changed my life. Most of us struggle with guilt and anxiety on a daily basis. The information provided by the authors brought so much freedom and relief to my life even in the first few months. I'm looking forward to seeing what else will come from it.
"Life-changing book! It truly is! Learning about boundaries is eye-opening and when using boundaries, gives such freedom! Some may think that by setting up boundaries life would be restricting and less loving - the opposite is true! I wish I had picked this book up when I was much younger; I believe it would have saved much heartache."
"Chock full of scripture, as other reviewers have noted. It's well written and has many interesting and useful ideas about establishing boundaries in a healthy way."
This book is a true blessing. This book let me see that I am not the only person who struggles with boundaries. I had to put the book down early on because it was as if someone had put my life in its pages. But I picked it right back up and am making the changes necessary to set positive boundaries.
"Everyone should read this book!  It does contain Christian references, but if you can look past that, it has invaluable advice."
"Biblically founded, practical ways to speak your mind and feel more valued. Resolve comminication conflicts with loved ones. Stand your ground in unhealthy relationships. Mana from heaven. Ive purchased several for friends."
"As other reviewers commented, the writing mentioned scripture too much. I need ‚Äúboundary‚Äù literature that is clear and tells it how it is, without any of the Christian fluff. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm a devout Catholic, but when it comes to sound advice on such a topic, I need to hear the cold hard truth about how to take care of myself, otherwise I‚Äôll go see my priest. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this book to anyone who really needs a lesson on saying ‚ÄúNO‚Äù."
"I was recommended this book from a friend. It opened my eyes to the unhealthy situation I was in with my job. I was given the courage to make decisions that has allowed me to leave the unhealthy environment and now I have a new job that is all that I could have asked for. I'm happier, healthier and loving life for the first time in a very long time!"
"I'll give it a 5 for the psychology that the book uses to help change behavior. But as a none religious person I give the overwhelming bible and god references a 3, a bit to much. I am not opposed to wisdom from places other than psychology but this was too much theology for me."
"This book changed my life & after using the techniques described, it also changed the lives of my husband & children. I bought this book like most other reviewers for advice on dealing with my in-laws.After reading this book, I also ordered ""Boundaries in Marriage"" & ""Boundaries with Kids"".Sadly, this book wasn't helpful for my particular situation because we were dealing with someone with a mental disorder, but it did point me in the right direction & I found the book I needed. If you are looking to set limits with a narcissist, I'd recommend ""Safe People"" by the same authors. Although honestly if you are dealing with a true narcissist as I was, I actually recommend that you ""escape & evade"".I will say that I loved this book, BUT if you are not a Christian & are not looking to save a relationship or a marriage because you're looking for the answer to WWJD, this may not be the book for you.God loves us & commands us to love others & I think this book can help anyone love & forgive."
"I can't say how much this book changed my life. It was eye-opening, sometimes in a way that scared me. It showed me things about myself and about others that have helped me live in a different way, and see things in a new way. It has freed me from some of the habits I have had since I was a child, simply by SHOWING those habits to me (I had never even understood them before). I am free now to proceed living in a way that God wants me to - to not feel as trapped as I once did by the opinions and whims of others, but to take control of my own life and choices, and to be responsible for them. I don't think there's a person in the world who wouldn't benefit from reading this book."
"If you have toxic people in your life that seem to have no boundaries and you yourself don't know how to set boundaries, this is a great book. It shows real life scenarios, to help you learn what is and is not a true boundary and that it is good to set boundaries, not only for your health but for those around you."
"This book was updated in 2017 and they didn‚Äôt want to take out spanking, really? The authors lost a lot of credibility when I read this line. I‚Äôll keep reading for boundary info that this book is regarded for, but this shows they are out of touch with a large, current body of research on what kind of discipline sets up the child for the best chance at life. I‚Äôm very disappointed."
An essential read. Should be something included in school and college curriculum. Well arranged and covers diverse topics related to establishing and maintaining boundaries.
"This book explained some of my feelings that I had not been able to express.For example, When I offer to help someone for a couple hours. then the time is up, and my energy is gone, but the person (or organization) wants more and more. So I worked for 6 hours instead of 2-3. Then I do NOT enjoy helping them. I feel resentful, angry, abused. Sometimes I am Mad At Myself for not setting or keeping a boundary. I could just say, ""I need to go now."" Instead, I just do not want to help them in the future. Avoiding them in the future doesn't work well for family that depends on me.After reading this book, I was able to use the ""good Samaritan"" example and we had a good talk. It will take some time to break old habits, but it's getting better."
"I have been purchasing items on Amazon for years. As a matter of fact I have been purchasing items online for years and not once did I felt I needed to write a review. However, I had to for this book because it has completely changed my life. I have had a crazy life, many ups and downs. I never understood why my life was the way it was until I read this book (and still rereading and will again and again). I have absolutely no boundaries and as such I did not know where I began and ended.  In reading this book I was able to realize that I needed to learn the necessary boundaries if I ever intend to live a fulfilling life, even at this late stage in the game. I am seeking out the different means of assistance and I am truly grateful to both gentlemen for this valuable information."
"I have recommended this book to anyone that will listen.  I have not yet finished it as the holidays got me quite busy (however, it probably would have been a great time to execute some of the suggestions in the book at this time)  Life is hard and we often think we are doing the right things by trying to ""do it all"" but sometimes it is ok and necessary to say NO.  This is a work in progress and one of the things that I want to put into action this coming year.  If you don't get anything from reading this book, then you really aren't comprehending."
"I bought this book based on a friend‚Äôs recommendation. Honesty this book helped me to evolve in my thinking; about myself & others. I applied techniques that spoke to my situation & mentally noted those from past experiences. Boundaries is a self help book that really strengthened my personal & people skills about respect, communication, & relationships."
Everyone can benefit from reading this. Whether you need to set boundaries for yourself or others it‚Äôs a good read. Everyone has a boundary problem at sometime in their life. Bought for my college age grandchildren. Don‚Äôt wait until you‚Äôre old to learn to set healthy boundaries.
i was looking for a book on boundries..not a second bible. it really should clarify that it has so much gospel in it before you buy. i wasnt looking for a gods eye view..i was just looking for a self help without the gospel. poor choice. i will be gifting this and looking for another book
"Although it is written from a Christian perspective, Boundaries will help anyone who feels like they get walked on, pushed around, taken advantage of, and otherwise mistreated by others. This book is not about 'sticking it' to people, but taking care of yourself with healthy boundaries.Boundaries gives the reader real life situational examples and shows how to make better choices for one's mental and physical health.I have purchased and given away this book so many times to help other people. It's that good.Don't forget the workbook that goes with it. It isn't necessary, but will be helpful if you are new to setting boundaries and saying ""no"".Saying ""no"" without the guilt is worth the price of admission!"
"I've been reading this book since it came in and I've found a lot of things quite helpful in wording my rough relationship with my family. BUT I wish it had been made clear that it also uses quite a bit of Christian Scripture to explain how a relationship should work and why something is dysfunctional (per gods words). The psychology is sound (I have a B.S. in psychology) but I'm agnostic and the scripture part does nothing for me except get in the way a bit if it's overused in any particular chapter.Although even though I am agnostic I do find it could be helpful when dealing with my very Christian family if it came down to it.Just BE AWARE, that CHRISTIAN SCRIPTURE is used frequently in the book."
This book helped me in a time of me needing empowerment in myself and feeling like I was NOT good enough it strengthened me to a better place of knowing I AM good enough. There are so many loving boundaries we need to set for ourselves and others to get to a place of security in ourselves. It is not an easy task but I am working on it slowly! I fund myself re-reading several passages in this book to help.
"This book was AMAZING. It had some really good thoughts and action steps. Helped me through some of the toughest times in life in regards to my internship and how to set good boundaries between myself, God, coworkers, and students."
I would give this book a 95 on concepts. It seems to be really effective and make a lot of good points. However I found it a bit biblical for my taste. I believe it would be just as effective if not more so if there were fewer scriptural citations.
"This book should be required reading for everyone. The younger the better. I like how it clearly explains and exemplifies common misconceptions regarding stewardship of life. The answers are so simple, it might be infuriating lol! It is beyond a self-help book - it facilitates real internal reflection and provides real solid answers for those who need to be told and given permission to truthfully conduct their lives."
Amazing book on Attachment!!!! it helped me tangle how my past relationships didn't work and how my attachment issues contributed to it.
"This book helped me to recognize when I was being taken advantage of or hurt by others. It showed me how to get out (without necessarily destroying the relationships) and avoid those situations in the future.  Do you want healthier, happier, longer, restored relationships? Or do you feel that others have too much control over your life? Then you need to read this book.Written in a clear, concise, kind and organized fashion, I recommend this book to all. It has helped me to live a much freer, healthier, more balanced life. My relationships with those closer to me are also better.This world needs more boundaries. Thank you Cloud and Townsend. God bless you!"
"This read was very enlightening to me.  It changes my approach to certain negatives in my relationships and I found that exciting. To my surprise, I was anxious to keep reading as I might be with a suspense novel!  I am motivated to try different approaches to some relationships based on a better understanding of my own motivations ."
"This book helped me see areas where I have boundary issues, and steps I can take to overcome them. It also helps ease frustrations with other people because I can see where they might have boundary issues that indirectly affect me. Most of all, it has helped me let go of guilt associated with bad boundaries within my family, and that has given me freedom."
I found this book useful since I had a very controlling mom and this book explained that I could love my mom but it also okay to establish boundaries so I wouldn‚Äôt get hurt.
"This is such a concise review of the basics of boundaries in our lives. It's an essential read for everyone who wants to have the healthiest relationships possible in every area of life. And for the spouse of someone who has one or more areas where boundaries are damaged or non-existent, it can be a great tool for back-up to the learning that the boundary-less person is going through.While there were a few places I felt the examples provided were somewhat cut-and-dried academic examples (where everything worked out perfectly when the people in the illustration applied good boundary principles), the bottom line is that this book is an excellent road map to healthy boundaries everywhere. I suspect it will be one that I refer back to frequently, as the behavior changes required will take time (and frequent referencing) to really take root in my life.If you need tangible examples of principles in action...maybe the rest of the series, or a specific boundary book, is for you...otherwise, I submit that this is all you need, but you need to read it, and re-read it, and keep it handy for ready and frequent reference."
"I didn't realize this book is a Christian book when I bought it. The subject of having boundaries is important, but all the examples are related to the Bible and Christianity. It was difficult to relate to."
"Excellent book on ways to improve our relationships, by better understanding how to manage our boundaries.  Very well written and understandable.  Written from a Christian perspective with biblical verses to support their information and recommendations."
"I was excited to read this book. It didn‚Äôt take long for me to be thoroughly disappointed due to the Christian overtones. I thought it was going to be subtle, but it‚Äôs quite obnoxious. I was willing to look past it until they talked about spanking children as discipline. I had to put up a boundary."
Reminds me of a high school paper where you have to add a bunch of fillers to reach your page minimum. The author heaped in so many bible verses that I had to remind myself of the point they were trying to make.
As others have stated it would have been good if the fact that it is christianity centered would have been helpful and I wouldn't have bought it. There are many secular volumes that cover the same material.
"This book has changed my life. I am finally healing from all the crap life hit me with. I finally understand what triggers anger and hurt and closing up and that it‚Äôs ok, and how to work through that. So grateful for this book."
"I won't be reading this book it was a gift. Seemed to go on sale for 2.00 less a week later. Not overly happy with that. Apparently for those who might need it, supposed to be a recommended book."
"This book covered so many examples of having boundaries violated and WHY, that I think any adult would learn something from this one.  I especially liked the scriptural references because, for me, it offered much better 'reasons' why one should learn to say NO.  The reasons go 'way beyond' just wanting more time for yourself and controlling your own life.  The one that jumped out at me was related to how does one arrange their time to do what GOD intends them to be doing on this Earth, if they allow everyone else's decisions for their time to take over?  And if one allows everyone to control their time, then are you honoring GOD at all??  I wish I had read this book back in my 20's rather than in my 60's when dealing with parents who have controlled my life forever, and although they are no longer even competent, still continue to try to control, even while I am their POA and handle their trust and finances.  It's a difficult situation to have to take charge of your parents when you have allowed them to take charge of you beyond childhood!"
"This book was all Christian. My feeling after reading it was that if you not god fearing its impossible to set boundaries. Would have been nice if the headline mentioned ‚Äúyou better be a good Christian to be a better person.‚Äù  If your not, in my opinion felt this book talked down to you for not being a believer. Not impressed with what this book had to offer"
"I got this book from the library and started reading it. It is really good so far  but I am a slow reader and knew I wanted to take my time reading it on my own so I bought it. There‚Äôs so much truth in this book and good tips, it‚Äôs great to take care of mental and emotional health and that comes from a Christian perspective with biblical principles made it even better!"
"I made a mistake in thinking this book would be about how to set BIBLICAL boundaries and live them out. For example: how to stay distant from what the world praises as fun (partying, smut TV, etc) yet is much about self satisfaction and pleasure. Or even boundaries for a husband and wife together and/or separately to set up that keeps their marriage focused on God and one another.  But this book seems geared more for people that are just afraid to say no in all aspects of life. Thus saith yes, yes, and yes."
"Amazing and insightful. Definitely buy if you have trouble saying, ‚Äú no‚Äù"
This is such a practical teaching tool on a subject that is often not taught in Christian environments.  The principles are life changing and this should be on your ‚Äúmust read ‚Äú list.I learned so much .... I will be reading it again just to soak it all in!
"I‚Äôm still working through the workbook in the book. But I am enjoying the red and the information it‚Äôs been very helpful for me to recognize what boundaries are, which ones I need to draw for others and for myself."
"I thought this was a book about boundaries in general life, but it turns out to be a book for a bible study. Every page has scripture references and talk of God. This very religious format was not made clear in the description of the book. I will be returning."
"This is a really good book for understanding different ways that you are not setting the right boundaries in your life.  There are many examples of real life situations to identify with and ways they began to change the way the looked at their situations and how things changed.  It has been a real help for me to examine my own life.  I read it with a highlighter and pen in hand so I could make notes as I went and I could look back at the things I found especially useful.  I have re-read it and find it very helpful.  The only thing that I think is missing is a few more ways to really implement the changes they suggest - or more directed ways or suggestions.  You can figure it out, but I would like some real direct suggestions.  All in all a really good book that gets you thinking and changing while retaining a Christian perspective."
I‚Äôm hoping to get something from this book.
This book has some great ideas and it is presented well and with humor. It is mixed heavily with Protestant Christianity values. This was not what I was looking for but it would be appropriate and useful for someone who is more religious.
If you're the kind of person that has a hard time telling people NO.  This book really helps you.  you will realize you're only hurting yourself by not setting boundaries.  You will never be happy until you do.
"I can't say enough good things about this book.  I've read it four times and when I recently shared that with someone, they said ""what happened that you didn't get it the first three times?""  Great question and the answer is this:  When reading a book like this it is eye opening usually on current pressing relationship or situational struggles.  Sure you can take the things you learn and apply them across the board but I have found at different seasons in my life my eyes were opened to new truths in this book.I love it and recommend it to build healthy relationships with others but also with yourself!"
This book was recommended to read this book.  I was a little skeptical because of the religious references.  I soon found that even taking the religious references with a grain of salt the message was still there.  I read and reread several chapters and bought the workbook.
"I am a licensed marriage and family therapist, who is also highly spiritual. This the BEST book I have ever read on the topic of BOUNDARIES: why they matter, how to set them, the healthy ways to do so and the emotional, spiritual pitfalls that keep many people from having the courage to set healthy boundaries. If you are NOT CHRISTIAN, don't bypass this book. Yes, the book is written from a Christian perspective with biblical references. Don't let that deter you from reading the INVALUABLE information. These are the principles that all good therapists teach their clients who have boundary issues. By the way, a huge percentage of problems that people seek counseling for involve boundary issues. I highly recommend this book!"
I will recommend this book to anyone who has problems dealing with their own problems. I was very controlling to everyone around me and it was driving me nuts! I have learned how to regain my peace and happiness. Thank you for this wonderful book I plan to read the authors other boundary books.
A MUST READ FOR THE MILLENNIALS AND YOUNG PARENTS.  If parents don't set boundaries that their children are looking for there is chaos in there future with children that are defiant and untitled
"This book is hands down the most important information I have ever received as an adult. Coming from a family with severe codependency, I was able to learn just what ingredients were lacking in all of my relationships (friends, work, family, husband) and start working on myself to live a free and fulfilling life.As a non-religious person, I chose to skip over the Bible references to the core information underneath  and am eternally grateful to the authors for having put together such an insightful book.1000% recommend"
"Ultimately I loved this book. There are a good bit of bible references, but this shouldn't deter you from buying this book if you aren't religious. This book has solid advice for everyone whether you are religious or not, and realistically as an atheist (or whatever you are or aren't),  you can read the references and see the connection being made to the author's point. Personally, I thought I had pretty good boundaries, but what I found out was that there were one or two things that I did marginally ok at and the rest of my boundaries were absolutely horrible. As you're reading it you think ""Yeah, this makes sense! It should be common sense. I was right to believe what I thought"" but it brings to light plenty of things that may not be obvious to everyone. It then goes on to talk about why you feel a certain way and how to begin to overcome it. As with anything, it doesn't provide step by step instructions for specific scenarios, but I was able to understand the idea and apply it to my own situations.Here's a big issue everyone can relate to (me included! A lot! ), and what the book says about it. Everyone gets angry- but whose problem is it? Is it the person who made you angry, or your own fault that you are angry? What it boils down to in this book is that IT'S YOUR OWN DAMN PROBLEM. It's YOUR personal issue (anger is a warning signal!) and it's due to your inability to respect boundaries that others place on you OR your own inability to place boundaries on others. It doesn't matter what the situation is - kids, spouses, co-workers, etc. But this book will help you to define your boundaries, recognize when someone is crossing a line, and help you understand how to build boundaries. If you're on the fence, definitely buy it. This book will do one of two things for you: 1) it will help, or 2) you'll throw it away because you're too self-centered and won't want to improve yourself anyways."
"I am only mid-way through this book but it is so VERY helpful to me.  And all along I thought there was something wrong with me if I said 'no' to something and I felt guilty if I didn't do everything I could to help someone.  This book teaches you that it's okay (in fact, it's necessary) to set boundaries and that you are not responsible for everyone elses life.....you are responsible for your own life.  It is written in a clear, easy-to-understand manner and I am finding it to be required reading for people like me.  In fact, I sit and read the book with hi-liter in hand.  There's so much for me to learn and this book is teaching me."
"I REALLY wish I'd known this book was written for Christians specifically and that it made constant references to the bible and incessantly quoted it. The book is assuming the reader is Christian and I honestly couldn't get past the constant, often unnecessary quotes and references. I felt alienated by the non-inclusive language. I am spiritual but don't identify with any religion and it's very very clear this book is only for Christians. Super disappointing. I'm donating this crap."
"I wish I could have read this book 30 yr.s ago. Instead of the usual blame game so many self help books get into, the authorsshow that you are responsible for you! You can't change the people around you, but you can sure change how you deal withtheir treatment of you. This book points out that you don't have to be a door mat to everyone around you to be a ""good""person, you can walk away mentally and physically. The authors explain that we all have our responsibilities, just don't take onsomeone's duties or attitude as though it were yours to deal with; if your coworker has a stinking attitude it's not your fault,don't let him make you think it is either. This book gives you tools to make it work."
This is a great book it help me through my counseling and I recommend it to anybody who needs to learn how to do boundaries where does that boundaries if you feel like you're constantly being run over by people
Kudos to Henry Cloud for presenting meaningful help for those needing to learn the whys and hows of good boundary setting principles and practices! Relationships are blessed when individuals live accordingly.
I have bought this book many times and seem to give it to someone who is hurting and then go buy another copy for me.  A keeper to read and let the information and examples sink in.  Excellent.
"I am not convinced this is the best way... Agape and trust in God to deal with the situation seems to be the way Jesus handled most things, I want to be like Him in all ways and not just lean on my own understanding, which is what I tend toward automatically."
"If you are not a religious person, or you don't have belief in the Christian god, I would strongly suggest finding another book. It's pretty difficult to read this book from a secular perspective, when every other paragraph has to do with something from the Bible. Personally, I couldn't get past the first chapter."
"Great boundaries content, but it is heavily religious, mentioning god in almost every page, did not give any religious description before buying"
"I finally understand why I feel so drained. I've been living a boundary-less life that led to a lot of resentment and even destroyed relationships. A therapist recommended that I read this, and wow she hit the nail on the head - I basically highlighted this entire book. It's full of practical skills that God intended for us to use with Him, others and ourselves. I've recently started to put these skills into practice, and I can honestly say that I'm already starting to see the benefits. HIGHLY recommend."
"I can‚Äôt believe not one, but TWO psychologists wrote this book, and openly condones spanking your children in the book. I don‚Äôt understand how two psychologists who are supposed to have learned and understood any of the science behind child rearing could‚Äôve have wrote this. This is an overly-religious, piece of crap."
I bought this book to learn about boundaries but it is chock-full of bible quotes and religious subtext (Catholic). I personally did not mind too much as I am religious but I do find myself wishing it could be more psychological/informationally-based. I could see my friends being turned off by how strong the authors incorporate their religion and I do wonder if it could've been done in a more subtle way rather than throughout the entire book.
"Although this book attempts to address an extremely important aspect of human relationships (i.e. establishing healthy boundaries) there are times when I feel the book was not very realistic. In an ideal world perhaps information imparted would work quite well. Unfortunately we do not live in an ideal world.For instance in Chapter 9 the authors attempt to discuss ""Boundaries and Your Spouse.""  The authors state ""in marriage...When the two become one on their wedding day, spouses do not lose their individual identities.  Each participates in the relationship, and each has his or her own life.""  Wouldn't that be nice if that were true?  What IS realistic far too often is that the WOMAN does in fact lose HER identity to the man as evidenced from the beginning with her very last name change.  The man does NOT lose his. The authors continue ""The problem arises when one trespasses on the other's personhood, behaviors, choices, and values of the other...To try to control these things is to violate someone's boundaries.""  This I fully agree with but having worked in the field of domestic violence for many years is NOT what I often saw. The authors rightfully point out that in 1 Corinthians 7:4-6 the Bible says that the husband and wife have ""authority over each other's bodies.""  Husband and wife are advised to submit onto each other. However, what many priests and ministers overly stress is the necessity of the WIFE'S submission to the husband. Apparently it is left to the husband to decide what form this submission should take. If, heaven forbid, the wife is not submissive enough, there are many husbands who feel justified to use physical abuse to make this happen. This violation of the wife's boundaries does not seem to be addressed in any of the churches currently in existance.In Chapter 11 ""Boundaries and Work"" it is NOT realistic nor particularly helpful to confront an overly critical supervisor telling them how you feel about their attitude and how it affects you. Particularly those of us who have been in the military or worked for the Department of Defense know that this would not likely have a good outcome. This would be true particularly if you followed the authors advice:  ""If she will not agree to change, you may want to tell her that you do not wish to talk with her until she gets her attitude under control."" I have to say though that the authors DO offer the alternative of following a company's grievance policy. This sometimes might work. The authors make the point that ""The important thing is that you can't control her, but you can choose to limit your exposure to her either physically or emotionally distancing yourself from her. This is control.""Still the ability to establish REALISTIC boundaries can be very helpful and one worth exploring. This book can help you with that."
Counselor recommended this book. It‚Äôs so helpful!! Great book. Helps deal with difficult family members! Really makes you take a good look at your own actions as well. I‚Äôll read it again and again!
"Writing style is a little hard to hang in there with but is still a great resource! My husband and I kept pausing in our read through from laughing fits over strange phrases and oddball details included in example stories. I guess you could say that it added to it in some ways, slightly... but will give it four stars for how distracting that proved to be."
"Wonderful book. In a secular world it can be difficult to find sources on setting healthy boundaries that doesn't seem to conflict with the biblical teaching. The author's beautifully address many of these ""biblical"" barriers to healthy boundaries and provide many biblical examples of when healthy boundaries were formed or encouraged."
I learned a lot from reading this book. Examined myself and my own areas for growth. I've made some real progress. And am so glad I read this book.
"I first read this when a friend recommended it; she was an adult having difficulties with her dysfunctional parents who would criticize her even though she was trying so hard to be a good daughter. She said it helped her so much. It gave her the freedom to stay out of fights and family squabbles that were dragging her down.When I read it for myself, I saw how I had the right to say ""no"" to people who tried to take over my life. It gave me the methods and the words to say to these people and also prepared me for what to expect when I put these guidelines into practice. The result? Self-respect and freedom!"
"My business consultant recommended this to me so I can better identify toxic employees and not give them so much unearned leniency. Great book for all ages with a Christians value side to things, but not in any way so much so that any person would not find a lot of wisdom and good advice here. A new staple in my library."
"This book was recommended to me by my therapist and while i was at first put off by all the Christian references, i soon came to understand how they worked.  And how, by building walls, you actually curate your inner circle effectively."
"I saw nowhere that this was a book written for Christians exclusively. Very hard to read unless you are a practicing Christian, and very dated info.  It should say Christian on the front of the book."
"DR HENRY CLOUD has been a guest speaker at my church on more than one occasion over the years. He‚Äôs an amazing speaker, and seems like a genuinely nice guy. When I heard about BOUNDARIES: WHEN TO SAY YES, WHEN TO SAY NO ‚Äì TO TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE by DR HENRY CLOUD AND JOHN TOWNSEND, I decided to purchase it.I‚Äôm sorry to say I let it sit on my bookshelf for some time before finally reading it. Once I got started, I quickly realized what a treasure I‚Äôd stumbled upon. There‚Äôs so much good stuff packed into 304 pages, I can‚Äôt begin to cover it all. I will say that I have more dog-eared paged in BOUNDARIES, then I do in any other book I‚Äôve ever owned.I didn‚Äôt realize I had boundaries issues until I read this book. There wasn‚Äôt a chapter I didn‚Äôt get something out of it or couldn‚Äôt connect with. I had thought about skipping the section on ‚ÄúBoundaries and Work‚Äù, since I‚Äôm no longer in the work field. I would have missed out if I had. It was a real eye opener to when I had worked, and packed with wonderful information if I ever decided to return to working.Boundaries are needed in all parts of our lives including, our family, friends, spouses, kids, and those we work with. We as individuals need to set our own boundaries as well. To not do so would only be cheating oneself. We also need to recognize that God has boundaries as well.BOUNDARIES will teach you all you need to know about boundaries in all aspects of your life, and how to apply them properly. I love the reference to Christianity, but even if you‚Äôre not a believer, I highly recommend this book.My copy of BOUNDARIES is filled with highlights, parentheses, and astericks. If I had to pinpoint the most valuable piece of information I took away, it would have to be in a paragraph on page 89.‚ÄúWhat you can do is influence others. But there is a trick. Since you cannot get them to change, you must change yourself so that their destructive patterns no longer work on you. Change your way of dealing with them; they may be motivated to change if their old ways no longer work.‚ÄùWhat amazing advice. How often do we gripe and groan about others? How often do we try to change others, whether in the way they act or what they say? And more importantly ‚Ä¶ how often do our efforts have a positive result? On page 89, BOUNDARIES teaches us that we are the ones that need to make a change, and by doing so, we may be instrumental in changing other‚Äôs life.I can‚Äôt even begin to guess how many people I‚Äôve recommended this wonderful book too, packed full of knowledge for every person, written in a way that anyone can grasp. It‚Äôs a book that will remain in my home indefinitely."
If only I knew it‚Äôs another religious book. They should put a warning on the covers...
This book is for church Christians
"This book was terrible if you aren‚Äôt a Christian, it was a struggle to get through. Half of it was scripture rather than reason."
This book was recommended by a friend but I couldn't get through it with all the evangelical clap trap inside.
"I read this book almost 20 years ago and I still have it and refer back to it.  This book will change your life and gives you the tools to set healthy boundaries; resulting in less drama and a more peaceful life.  If you have trouble saying no, this is the book for you."
"Great book that has been a staple for me and I have referred to others for years. :) Never will stop recommending it for those that are looking to expand their understanding on Boundaries and how it can help relationships be stronger and more Christ-like and healthier. I know even Attorneys that recommend it but ""overlook the Christian Biblical references"" just to get the strong ethical and philosophical points from it. I will not overlook them because think they are the focus! :) Good for everyone however and strong points on how to make your relationships healthier and happier."
The writing is so awful that I couldn't even finish reading this book. I know it has amazing rating and I was really looking forward to using this for personal development but it's just horrible.
Good resource for understanding boundaries using Christian foundations
This book is everything everyone is saying - it is life changing. The perspectives and information in this book push you to think about your relationships and how you interact with others. It shines a spotlight on things and helps give you the motivation and the incentive to move forward in life as a stronger person with firm boundaries that help you enjoy life and stress less. I recommend this book to everyone.
Common sense but great book for the push over type or for people who don't know about boundaries. This book was recommended by a friend. I can see how she liked it but didn't help me much. Gonna give the boundaries in relationships a try. I'm too much of a giver! Gotta quit that lol
"I couldn't get past chapter 2 of this book due to all the bible references (at one point there was at least one on every page).  There was more mention of Christianity than practical information on boundaries.  If you are not religious, don't bother wasting your time."
"Excelente libro para todas las edades y situaciones. Me hubiera gustado saber sobre este libro antes, pudo ayudarme a entender tantas cosas y as√≠ manejar mucho mejor las situaciones. Pero nunca es tarde, a√∫n pude poner l√≠mites y me trajo muchos logros personales."
"Boundaries by Drs. Cloud and Townsend is a fabulous resource and this new updated version is great. It includes thoughts and tips on how to handle boundaries in the digital age we now live in. As a therapist, I refer to this book often!* I received this book in exchange for my honest review."
Really hard to get past the religious overtones of this book. No where in the description is it made clear how connected this book is to the Bible. I don‚Äôt think I can finish it. Should be in the Christian books category.
"Several of my friends have been recommending that I read this book for a while now, so I finally decided to purchase it. I originally went for the .99 Kindle version, but after getting halfway through it I realized I wanted to own a physical copy. The book should be here any day now, and meanwhile I just finished reading it on Kindle. I honestly can see myself reading parts of this book again and again for many years. It's taught me valuable things about myself and the way I relate to others. How to own my own issues, and how to not try and take responsibility for the issues of others. I've been practicing some of the concepts I've read, and hope to keep growing in my ability to make and keep boundaries for myself."
"This book gave me a voice and permission to protect myself. You can protect yourself too!  Our boundaries are like a front door. You get to decide who you let into the safety of your inner sanctum.  You can choose to close the door and turn hurtful dangerous people away, out of your life.  Everyone should read this book."
"I love my family and friends, but I have a tendency to say ""yes"" to every request.  I used to bend over backwards to be sure everyone was happy - or at least as happy as I could make them be.  This book has changed my life!!  It is not MY responsibility to make sure others are happy - it is their responsibility!  It is not mean or selfish to say ""no!""  It is HEALTHY!  I have a tool to help me understand myself and those around me (thank you to my therapist, whom I no longer have to see).  My husband is not thrilled with my new found freedom, but he is pitching in now and I LOVE IT!!!  I have given this book as gifts to two of my girlfriends.  They love it too!"
My therapist highly recommended this book and said it‚Äôs one of the best for this topic to help with family drama or hard relationships
I didn't realize this would be a bible bumping book. I  Wish I could return the audible download.  I set a hard boundary and turned it off in the car after realizing it.
"I was not entirely sure I would like this book, but after years of having family difficulties I didn't have much to loose in giving it a try. I am so relieved after reading this book. It helped me change my perspective on the problem. The problem wasn't in everyone else, it was in me! There were definite things I can do differently, regardless of what others do. I can set and maintain my boundaries and keep the peace in my own life, no matter what other people do! It is wonderfully freeing to see what I can actually do to have peace in my own life. This book helped me see where I was lacking and how to better myself. I am so happy I read this book!"
"Love this book. I can‚Äôt put it down since I received it. It‚Äôs so helpful in helping you realize the areas you need to work on for yourself to live a happier life. Lots of bible references so if your not a religious person you probably won‚Äôt like it, but I am so it‚Äôs great, very easy to understand."
"As someone who is in the process of re-parenting myself and taking charge of my life, this book has been a phenomenal help. It seems to touch on every aspect of life, which makes this book a great ""overall"" boundary-setting material. Chapters were easy to read and weren't too long! I plan on getting the more specific boundary books in the future!"
"It's so easy to get off track, even when we have the best intentions, and so many self-help books not only contradict one another, but offer advice without any regard for Biblical guidance. Not so with Boundaries. It was recommended to me by a friend I trust to understand our behaviors regarding the need to care for ill family members and the feelings that went with that. This provided a gentle, Biblical, way to do that without forsaking our real responsibilities or elevating our own perceived needs above others'. I have already recommended to friends twice."
"If you struggle with setting Boundaries because you feel like you are not a nice or good person,  read this book !!  and then keep and re-read!!  You can be Christ -like and have boundaries!!"
This book opened my eyes to so many things. I have a lot of work ahead of me but now I know it‚Äôs possible to succeed.
"If you can implement the advice from Boundaries into your life then you will be better for it.  The book explains why it is appropriate to sometimes say ""no"" to people.  Some of the fictional examples are unrealistic and detract from the good advice (a woman tells her boss that she will not work on his last-minute project, and as a result she is promoted and her former boss is assigned to be her assistant).  The authors like to quote scriptures to support their ideas, but they jump between several translations of the Bible and you get the impression that the verses don't always say exactly what is desired.  Despite that the book contains useful concepts and it reads well."
"If you struggle with people-pleasing tendencies, you‚Äôll get a lot out of this book. It‚Äôs full of helpful tips for developing healthy boundaries in all areas of life."
"I have worked as a jail chaplain for almost twenty years and this book has been both an inspiration and a clarifier.  Not only is it important for me to set clear boundaries in the work place with inmates, but because of the nature of the work on my personal life, I've needed to set countless boundaries in my relationship with people who don't understand my love and concern for the incarcerated.  I have asked all of my volunteers to read the book also because we've used it as a teaching tool for inmates, most of whom have never learned how to set boundaries.  We have found it most helpful in dealing with battered and abused women, as well as those needing anger management.  Because the text is filled with biblical principles, I believe it is in line with what God chooses for us, but allows us to make the choice for ourselves.  Personally, I also have children and grandchildren and I'm using the guidelines to create a place of harmony in my home.  Thank you, Drs. Cloud and Townsend for giving us a user friendly guide to boundaries and the happiness they give."
"I was very disappointed. I bought this new CD as a gift to be played on a car CD player, and it wouldn't play on it. It also would not play on a Phillips Jogproof CD player. Unfortunately, I bought it ahead of time, and the return window is closed."
"Wish there was a version of this book without all the bible stuff. All the advice and instruction makes perfect sense without it. If you do the whole bible thing, you'd so give this five stars. Regardless, this book stated helping me before I even finished reading it."
"I will only write one review at this time because I have recently had surgery on my right wrist and it difficult using my left hand since I am right handed. I love the condition my book was in. I liked how easy it was for me to order my books and I didn't have to wait a long time to receive my order. I bought this because it was recommended by a friend to help me say ""NO"" to my friends, co-workers, family, church family and sometime even strangers at times but after reading only a few chapters from this book I feel better about saying no.  I plan to keep ordering item from you.  A. Austin"
"Another one of Dr. Henry Cloud great books! Boundaries: When to Say Yes. How to Say No to Take Control of Your Life. You begin to learn that being a Christian is not always easy. You have to live on purpose. Saying NO takes courage but as Christians we are required to learn how to take control over our lives with the help of God. I'm still learning through love to move in a positive way with the power of taking control of my life..Thank you for helping me be a better person,with courage, hope, love and obedience. We are all a work in progress....Give grace and you'll get grace!"
Wish i would have known its religious. I‚Äôm not religious so this was a waste of money for me.
Omg..... I am so so glad I got another copy of this book. I recommend it for anyone who struggles with setting boundaries. It‚Äôs hard when it comes to family. This book and the workbook is helping me reclaim my life and put people in their appropriate place in my life. Get it. You will love it.
"Absolutely Necessary when others start dictating your life.  Families are the worst, but anyone can commit you to do things you don't want to or can't afford IF YOU LET THEM!  This book helps you learn the art of setting your boundaries and being able to say ""NO"""
"It was exactly what I ordered, and unlike a lot of books that get bent corners during shipping, this arrived in mint condition.  I was super happy."
"Christian based and referenced.  Honest.  If you find yourself always helping but being upset about it, feeling guilted into many things, unhappy in a professional or personal relationship- this book and an open heart and mind will give you hope!"
This book was a little too religious for me. Should have read more reviews.
"This book had some great ways to set boundaries in your life to improve your mental help. However, every page is littered with bible verses and religious scripture. My only wish is that there was an atheist option that had all of the helpful tips without having to base it on religion."
"This is a great book for anyone on a journey of self discovery. We‚Äôve all been there. Tired of being taken advantage of, in our relationships, in our jobs, in our friendships. We know we need to stick up for ourselves, but are scared or don‚Äôt know how to do so. This book is the perfect guideline for those of us that know we need them but have absolutely no clue where to start."
Everyone can benefit from reading this book.  I reread it once a year.  Have sent copies to others frequently.  It is that important
Very enlightening book.  I have learned soooo much from the short time I‚Äôve been reading it.
It‚Äôs all religious based.Not for everyone
This book is a life changer.  I bought 4 in total and two of the others also said how helpful it was for them.  I highly recommend this book!
"This book seriously changed the way I see and handle my life. I was hesitant at buying it at first simply bc I‚Äôm not a big reader, but I was in need of encouragement and information. I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the outcome. I am healing, along with my relationships with family that have been an issue for quite sometime. I highly recommend for anyone struggling with any kind of relationship!!"
"This book has really opened my eyes to a lot of things about myself. I've known for some time the struggles that I've had in my interactions/relationships with others and now it finally has a name. Although I know that establishing boundaries for myself that I've never had before in life is going to be hard work and an ongoing process...this book definitely gives me hope and points me in the right direction. It's as if the book knows my story personally, which is how I know that Cloud and Townsend really know what they are talking about."
This book was very educational for me. I discovered that my best intentions of helping others can actually be harmful to their personal growth.
I love this book! A must read for anyone who may have an issue with boundaries in their relationships or work. A good read even for those without boundary issues as the information is helpful for many real life issues.I haven't read a book this helpful in many years.
"This is an outstanding book to help you or someone you know to learn the power of our word choices. We have let others control our actions and feelings by the negative words that they unknowingly use to manipulate those around them whether in our home, workplace or friendships.You learn to identify these controlling issues and respond in a manner that increases your value and teaches others that you will no longer tolerate their choice of words.I highly recommend it to everyone.....young and old."
"This is probably the second most influential book I have read in my life, after the Bible. Having come from a broken home and having boundary issues but not realizing it nearly destroyed my life. Reading this book helped me get a clear vision of what boundaries are and how they can help me lead my best life. Having recently found my faith again after literally forty years of being the prodigal son, I found it faith affirming to realize that so much of what is known about boundaries is substantiated by the words  and wisdom in the Bible."
"very important book, the ideas are great. just one this which is not forwarned this is for the christians only, this book has every other sentence with bible refrences, i wish he made this book without all the biblical stuff, just the technical success part."
"As a Christian, I've struggled with how to maintain my own boundaries with people who are under-responsible. So many people are looking for a bleeding heart, over-responsible person like me to use, but it's been important to me to realize that I am at fault for letting much of it happen. I reviewed my words to these people and I found myself not being honest with how much they inconvenience me, if at all. I stopped lying to some people and telling them that it's 'great' to see them, or it's 'no problem' when it's not. I was raised to be compliant and avoid conflict by well-meaning godly parents. I struggle when unhealthy people put me down and don't feel like I should spend time with these kinds of people. I noticed that they often do it to try and steer me toward doing something for them.My biggest problem is that I do stuff for other people and resent it big time. Then, my family never hears the end of how frustrated I am. Part of me deep inside just knows when I have allowed myself into being manipulated and resents it. Thanks to this book that gives a lot of food for thought, I am able to separate my ministry works from my friendships. True friends don't go off the deep end when you don't comply and say 'no' sometimes. I feel fulfilled and non-resentful when I choose my own ministry projects, as I am led in my heart by God; not having them forced on me.Every person has to figure out how much they are capable of and set limits. I have taken steps to invest more in friendships where we enjoy and respect each other's differences. I don't want to be the enabling source of someone to keep them wallowing in immaturity. Now, I hope my biggest issue is that I've got to find other things to talk about than how one or two peripheral friends behaved to me. My family and close friends deserve better.Edit - Oct 2014 - It has been a great year! Less resentment, more enjoyable relationships, and lots of steps in the right direction. I've been able to sort through my priorities better in how to deal with people. I've been able to dodge those who want to impose on my boundaries and enjoy healthy boundaries with true friends. The boundary busters get mad when they don't get their way, and I fight feeling bad about it sometimes because I have been over-empathetic to manipulative people for years. You don't get better overnight, but with each interaction, you have a chance to make things go well. I used to not give a clear no, and it often prolonged the process with intrusive people. I simply refuse to deal with people who don't take no for an answer. It has not been a problem to ignore over-the-top texts, fb messages and emails. I find that these people just move on to the next person on their 'list' anyway. I am working with people I love and trust. My energy is endless because I am doing the ministry that I am supposed to be doing, instead of feeling responsible for areas that I am not suited for. It is freeing like never before. Thank God for this valuable, Biblical insight into relationships!"
"Unfortunately, I discovered I have 2 others just like this in my bookshelf.  I waited too long to return it."
"I really enjoyed this book. It is straightforward and easy to follow and apply. I recommend this book to everyone. Yes, it is from a Christian point of view."
"I‚Äôve actually already gotten a copy of this book before now. This newer one introduces how to withhold boundaries even in the midst of social media and the constant pull towards technology. It helps to discover when to respond and when to leave the phone there. I think maybe the biggest lesson in this book for me personally is discovering you can‚Äôt change other people you can only change your response to other people. Even if they cross a ‚Äúboundary‚Äù that you have set up, you can simply change how you will react to that. Maybe that means not being around someone as much, maybe it means letting them know hey i‚Äôm not okay with that if it continues thats up to you but I won‚Äôt be around if it does. For me I‚Äôd always wish the other people would change to my way but in reality that just doesn‚Äôt happen that often. So you have to learn how to change you or speak up. I‚Äôm definitely a passive aggressive type person or maybe just passive, so confronting things head on is my least favorite. Sometimes being an adult makes you have to do the tough things, after all now that i‚Äôm a mom someone is going to have to learn how to do these encounters. This book is also awesome for how to lovingly do that instead of having some huge confrontation it tells you how to diffuse the situation and make it more of a conversation and less of an ordeal. I would highly recommend this book!!!!I received this book in exchange for my complete and honest review! snag the new version if you haven‚Äôt!"
"I was so confused on boundries. People walked all over me. I thought it was my Christian duty. Then I started to get angry and bitter about one sided relationships. Anyway, An eye opening book. Thank you both from the the bottom of my heart. Which is much more at peace!!"
This is an excellent Christian based book on boundaries. It uses sound doctrine and clear examples. I gave to everyone one in my family. Setting boundaries is essential in healthy relationships and this has improved my attitude. I don‚Äôt feel obligated to do things and resent it. I can freely so no thank you without guilt.
I learned so much on setting boundaries and the importance of them.
"Many of us were not taught about boundaries and their importance.  And we end up over-extended, over-involved, over-dependent, and so on and so on.  Add to that, we feel guilty when we try to set a boundary.  But this book tells the truth that boundaries are healthy.  While it is based on Biblical principles that show us that God intends for us to establish and to respect boundaries, the book's content is helpful to non-Christian people, too.  It is easy to read and provides good examples."
This book changed my life. It still helps me today as I reference it during my daily practice. I recommend this book to help heal those who have cloudy boundaries.
"I loaned my book out and never got it back.  This is a must for every library, so I had to reorder to review!"
"I can tolerate, even utilize some religious context and some referencing to scripture but this was too thick of it. Avoid if you‚Äôre not looking for biblical perspective. I was disappointed - but that‚Äôs not the authors fault, it‚Äôs mine for not researching beyond word of mouth."
"This book has helped me understand so much about creating healthy boundaries with people, especially toxic people."
"This whole book heavily leans on scripture and your relationship with God. We were very disappointed as this was referred to us by someone and there weren't many top reviews referencing this so we were in for a shock. Most pages reference the Bible or God at least 5 times. This was a big let down as we are not Christians and had high hopes for the book. If you are Christian, I'm sure this is a great read for you."
Too much religion for me. Boundaries is a simple concept but this book beats it to death.
"I had heard about this book many times. However, I felt I didn‚Äôt really need to learn about the topic at this stage of my life. I am so grateful I have given myself the time to read it. I have learned a number of things, validated things I was not sure were Godly. Great book for anyone wanting to grow and get the reward of applying what is learned in this book."
"This book is wonderful. I was struggling with some relationships in my life and I couldn't tell if I was over reacting or if my feelings were justafiable. This book is great because it addresses many issues and helps a person say, no or how to hamdle difficult relationships. It has helped me to not feel bad about things or make a decision based on other people. It explains things so that it makes sense. I keep this book in my library because its something I love to go back and read to be reminded."
Recommended by a friend. WOW! What a great book!!! So helpful in so many ways. Not your typical ‚Äúself help‚Äù book. Really helps you to understand how you can improve your life by not allowing yourself and others to destroy it. We are all in charge of ourselves & we must do what we can to make life enjoyable.
I didn't know I needed to learn about boundaries. Every area I get stressed by is an area that relates to having nuclear boundaries. This book is so helpful!
"I should have read the negative reviews before purchasing. I realized a few pages in that this was a Christian book,  which mentions God every other sentence. If you're seeking a psychology guidebook, look elsewhere."
"I bought this hoping to use it with my mediation work. It is a decent introduction to boundary setting, but does not go beyond that."
Excellent biblically based examples of why boundaries are necessary and how to set boundaries with others and yourself. I‚Äôve recommended to many others.
This is a Christain sermon not a self help book. I am good at filtering out religion but this one was impossible  to filter out. I just threw it away.
I was looking forward to this book until I opened it up and was suddenly bombarded with a bunch of Christian dogma. Will be returning immediately. Amazon should have a warning label for this kind of garbage.
Way too much religious material. To the point where it is unbearable to read if you are not religious.
"Good thoughts and ideas, just be prepared for 3 or so Bible versus per page. If that is not a deterrent for you, this is a great book."
This book has opened my eyes to boundaries I need to set in my life. A very good read. Thank you
"This book changed my way of living a better life not just for myself but for my family as well. Make me more in control of my life in setting boundaries to people in my life and focusing more on my relationship with Christ 1st, me, my wife, then my kids."
I wish I'd found this book years ago! It's so good!!!
Amazing. Has so much knowledge and NEEDED in healthy relationships. Allowed me to see where I can put my own personal boundaries. It also allowed my husband to see the years of emotional abuse he hasn't been able to get over. He is able to set boundaries with his family and is happier and healthier for it.I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone.
"So that has been my problem...no boundaries! A transformational book of major proportions. It described the problem of no boundaries and gave the understanding of why we need them and how to create them. Because I now have healthy boundaries, I don't need walls to protect me (which of course created additional issues). Scripturally presented this is an excellent read, and a book I frequently recommend."
"My pastors wife got this book for me, and it was a lifesaver! I am TERRIBLE about not saying no. This book was affirmation that I am important too, and that I am not selfish for wanting to have a date night with my husband or just a night to do nothing to myself. Highly recommend!"
Very Christian. I would have preferred the same book without all the scripture. I am not Christian and the scripture interfered with an otherwise good read and pertinent information for lif.
I wish everyone would read this. I wish I had as a young adult; it would have saved me a lot of heartache.
"This book is so God preachy that unless you are extremely religious you are unlikely to find any of this compelling. Very disappointed experience for me! Only buy this if you are only extremely religious! Reading this book, like reading the bible!"
I started reading this book I like it so far the only thing I don't like is the religious verbage it hasn't it because I am not a religious person otherwise it is a good book.
Must read for healthy relationships and healthy you ... especially in problem relationships.
"When I purchased this book, it was it's title that grabbed my attention.  When seeking a book about Boundaries, I was not also seeking spiritual guidance.  If you are, this is the book for you.  It teaches us that boundaries in our lives for friends, family, at work are okay, or allowed; even necessary for our own sanity...for lack of a better term."
One of the best books I have ever read on keeping boundaries and learning about co-dependency.  Didn't know when I bought it that it was Christian based which made it even better.  Would recommend this book to anyone looking to establish healthy boundaries for themselves.
Absolutely loved this book! My whole life I have spread myself thin trying to help everyone thinking it was the right thing to do. This book helped me realize that taking care of myself and establishing boundaries with others is not selfish. You can not care for others if you do not take care of yourself.
"The book was clearly not new as described. There were creases on the spine, damage on the spine, the corners we're white from wear, and there was discloration on the edge of the pages. The content of the book is fantastic, but the book itself was really disappointing."
Great book about learning to set boundaries and not crossing boundaries in others.
This book is religious. If I wanted a religious book I would go to church and check out a book and talk to a minister.
This is one of my top ten books and I highly recommend it. It can be applied to personal and professional relationships.
"This book needs to be read by everyone, great for relationships!"
"Great topic, but much too dense for my poor brain"
I cannot recommend this book enough! It is truly life changing!  I wish I would have read this when I was younger!  I‚Äôve ordered many copies for friends and family. If you‚Äôre alive you can benefit from this book.
"I'm a spiritual, not really religious person and I'm not into bible study. Honestly, the bible is not one of my most inspiring spiritual texts to be honest as a Christian. I was hesitant for that reason about this book, hoping it wouldn't be preachy or judgmental. Instead, what I discovered was a wonderful use of biblical verses that is very lightly woven into the stories about why it's important to set strong boundaries, and why God wants us to stop being martyrs and make choices that support our happiness and well-being. This is such a refreshing approach to using the bible as helpful inspiration to apply to real life situations, similar to Joel Osteen. The authors are very down-to-earth, real, honest and direct about the issue of weak boundaries, identifying them, and explaining how to implement them. I bought another book called Energetic Boundaries in the past that was more focused on metaphysical aspects of boundaries. That was helpful, too, but this book blows it out of the water with it's grounded approach and strong tone encouraging the reader to take charge of their life and stop being a doormat. So many spiritual, Christian people tend to be taken advantage of or get burnt out always tending to everyone else's needs, and this book gives permission to stop that unhealthy cycle so you could feel peaceful and take better care of yourself instead of feeling guilty like you owe everyone else your time and energy in order to be a ""good"" person. I sent this book to my best friend, and we've been reading it together and agreed to be each other's boundary buddies when those pushers come along our path, which they often have! I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys the spiritual connection and psychological awareness that makes for a holistic approach to changing unhealthy habits. I also purchased Doreen Virtue's Assertiveness for Earth Angels but it's not as in depth as this book, and has a more gentle, soft approach that hasn't drawn me in strong enough, where this Boundaries book feels highly motivating to me. Doreen's book has been sitting on my shelf for a year and I've breezed through it not feeling compelled to get into it yet. The first day I opened this Boundaries book, I read 50 pages on the spot, highlighter in hand."
"This is the most life-changing book I have ever read (second to the Bible)!  I think every high school graduate should be required to read it!  The authors describe in great detail what boundaries are, and who needs them.  I experience a lot of guilt when I want to say no to someone's request.  I feel that I am letting them down, no matter what the request is.  The authors use scripture to help you determine what are appropriate things to say no to, and why you should not feel guilty.  Even Jesus, the most giving person who ever lived, had boundaries!  This book does not give excuses to get out of your responsibilities, but helps you to see what are unhealthy situations to avoid, and how to get out of them.  It even gives some examples for parenting so you children will learn boundaries.  I am grateful to have read this book, and find myself re-reading it often."
"Bought this book for my wife, to help see, create, and understand the value in creating boundaries. The best thing about this book is the Faith-based approach to creating and enforcing boundaries."
I never realized how many problems in my life were related to boundaries
"Love, love, love this book! It has totally encouraged me to begin a change in the way that I handle people, family, church relationships. So worth reading. this book does not leave you hanging. At the end of the book is a website that is a continuance of the book. Highly recommend."
Good!  Purchased for an online class.
Wonderful guide for setting boundaries and taking control of your life written by 2 of my favorite Christian authors.
"Most Christians struggle with the demands and frustrations resulting from their everyday relationships.  Cloud and Townsend have produced a true classic in this volume, presenting Biblical concepts that address those demands and frustrations.  I have just finished reading this book again for the second time, and chances are good I will read it again in the future.The authors introduce their work with a short section entitled, ""A Day in a Boundaryless Life."" Most persons can easily identify with the young woman depicted in this typical life situation.  The authors then describe the concept of boundaries in detail, and how boundaries are developed in our lives.  They present ten laws of boundaries, and then proceed to describe common myths regarding them.  These laws and myths, as well as the rest of the book's content, are very readable and easy to understand.In the second portion of their work, the authors touch upon the areas of life in which boundaries can be helpful.  I cannot think of any area that is unaffected.  These areas are: family, friends, spouse, children, work, self, and God.The authors conclude by describing typical resistance to boundaries.  They also summarize the benefits to be gained as persons persevere through that resistance to a more ordered life. Before ending their book, Cloud and Townsend revisit the young woman depicted in the opening section.  This time the title is, ""A Day in a Life with Boundaries.""  She now has learned to incorporate boundaries into her own life, and the change for the better is amazing.This book is a must-read for every Christian believer who wants a wealth of Biblical insight into Christ-honoring relationships.  I have recommended it to others in the past, and after this second reading am even more enthusiastic about doing so.  Buy it, read it, and allow God to transform your relationships for the better!"
"I've read this book 3x and it's amazing to me how rereading it sheds light on new areas of my life and work to put boundaries in. Furthermore, just reading it reinforces my confidence in boundaries that I set."
Super religious but a really great message and puts things in scenario form so you can truly see how it relates to your life. I‚Äôm only on chapter 3 and i think it‚Äôs really going to be influential in my life.
"Excellent book on boundaries, but religious. Focus on the boundaries content if you don‚Äôt care about religion and it will change your life."
Very helpful in understanding when to set limits.
"This is an awesome, she opening book. I have applied the concepts and experienced so much relief. It is good to study it with a trusted small group of Christian friends. I have purchased two extra copies for my close friends."
"What a wonderful book!!So many people are in the dark about personal boundaries. Some have never heard the term.I used this book in my Human Relations college class for a one week study. It really helped my students, some of whomwere going out into the world of work, not knowing how to handle some difficult situations. And it also helps one in his or her personal life.Cloud and Townsend write in a very easy and kind manner. Worth the read!! No cons."
"The principles in this book has changed my life, forever! I was hooked since chapter 1. I believe everyone should read this book; even those who believe they already have boundaries. This book will help to make sure that you have HEALTHY boundaries."
"Reading this book, I realize I don‚Äôt have boundaries and in more than one way. Helped me understand how I didn‚Äôt grow up with a healthy boundary home and had a lot of work to do to learn boundaries. It also made me realize how important this work is and how much better off I will be by putting in the work."
"This book is based on sound Christian principals using conflict resolution and support for difficult situations. The ability to avoid guilt, make compromise, and say no when necessary makes this book essential for couples, families in distress and parents."
"I actually purchased this book for my mom as she needed it for a class. However she told me that it was a good book and an easy read. It was clean and looked great.She loaned it to a friend who my mom mentioned it to as well, and that person felt it was quite helpful for her in understanding better what she was going through.

  
Boundaries: When to Say YES, When to Say NO, To Take Control of Your Life"
Teaches things wouldn't thought of past effected you made who are today. Helps see good and bad. How establish oneself but also how say yes and no to others. Teaches you even why boundaries are healthy for you and others. Good book to have for all to read up on.
"Wow.  I highlighted almost the entire book.  A great lesson for those who grew up with a some-what dysfunctional family, and how to treat yourself more kindly including your other relationships in work, family, friends, and love life.  It‚Äôs like a Bible on how to respect yourself, and others, to lead a happy fulfilling and rewarding life with non-toxic people."
Just getting started reading this book and it's already stepping on my toes...in the best possible way. I will update in more detail when I've completed reading.
This book is a game changer. Just get it. I couldn‚Äôt put it down because I loved learning from it.
One of the best books I‚Äôve read on the subject. Even if you don‚Äôt relate to the religious aspect of the book the material is powerful and helpful beyond measure.
"Incredible book! Wish I‚Äôd have read it years ago, but have to trust  that God‚Äôs timing is perfect. reading it brought so mush understanding and newfound freedom to my life."
I don't mind having a strong faith perspective whatsoever but this book presents much of its focus based loosely to solely on faith vs observable testable facts. Still a pretty decent book and for a stronger person of faith would likely be more compelling.
I'm reviewing the condition of the book that was in the description when I ordered it. I am pleased because it arrived in wonderful condition.
THIS WORK BOOK IS A WONDERFUL ADDED TOOL WITH THE BOOK.  IT IS SO WELL DONE THAT A PERSON COULD STILL GET A LOT FROM IT IF THEY ONLY BOUGHT THE WORKBOOK.  FOR ME I HAVE FOUND IT MORE BENEFICIAL TO GET BOTH OF THEM AND USE THEM TOGETHER.  THE BOOK ALONE IS A WONDERFUL SELF HELP GUIDE TO SETTING BOUNDARIES AND LIVING WITHIN THEM.I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO HAS DIFFICULTIES SETTING BOUNDARIES NOT ONLY WITH OTHER PEOPLE BUT WITH THEMSELVES AS WELL.
Lots of useful information.
"Oh my, this book is incredible. I‚Äôve already told at least 20 people to read it. This book was written for me. It puts into words so much about how I feel.  I‚Äôve already used some of the advice in parenting. This is a book I‚Äôll keep and reference."
Gave it away as a gift. Well done.
"well written and worth buying. Boundaries are something thats seldom taught and should be. young ladies especially would benefit from understanding that its ok to say no and to have boundaries. with all relationships: friends, co workers, family members, boy/girl friends, any type of relationship. If i would have known the information in this book when i was younger and practiced it- would have saved me a ton of heart ache, confusion, and built my self esteem. worth buying & worth giving to your teenagers to read."
"Very good book, could possibly change your life for the better if you read it, recognize yourself, and work on setting proper boundaries. I've given away several copies and need to reorder one for me again."
I really liked this book as it was so interesting. It was a really good read and I could not put it down!
"This book taught me all about boundaries and how it is okay to have them. This book teaches boundaries with all aspects of life including family, work, marriage, etc..."
Best book ever!!! Easy read too!
"Where has this book been all my life? Yes, it has scripture in it but even if you are of a different religion or none at all, this book does the job to help you see all the sides of the story with setting Boundaries. It's really hard to put down, so make sure you do this when you set yourself some time and have quiet! I am really looking forward to the workbook that can help me overcome my obstacles with boundaries! So worth it!"
This book was a gift for a friend but I read it years ago when I didn't have many boundaries.  Now that I do life is less stressful.  I highly suggest this for anyone who is lacking in them
"This book has been very helpful in understanding my own boundaries. Why I do what I do, and what I need to change for myself. A Must Book for everyone interested in improvement to self"
"This book has honestly blessed my life. I did not realize how much material would be biblically related but for me as a Christian I am ok with it. Even practicing some of the tips in this book to a small degree has made a huge difference in my mentality and outlook on the different relationships I have in life. I highly recommend reading this book, the only regret I have is not buying the workbook to go with it. I will be buying the workbook and rereading this sometime in the future."
"Great book!  Boundaries we should learn to set before we are even out of high school.  Relationship boundaries, work boundaries.  It is not as if boundaries are a bad thing at all.  This book really helps people, especially those like me, who never really learned how to say no, not now, or I am unable to commit to that additional task/responsibility.  Very, very good book.  Workbook helped a great deal and cemented the instruction."
"This book has come highly recommended from pastors, counselors, and friends alike. That said, it really helps bring to light both internal and external boundary issues. Henry Cloud has a way of disentangling these issues and explaining how to live a healthy life with boundaries letting good things in and out and keeping out the bad."
...my girlfriend and I work through some issues we were having. I highly recommend this book to anyone that needs clarity on the importance of boundaries.
"Excellent book. Great concept, helpful for anyone, especially if you tend to give too much - if you find others taking advantage of you or if you or someone you care about has a tendency towards codependency. So important to have clear boundaries that you can set in a loving way, without feeling guilty."
Life-changing book! A bit heavy read. Loaded with a lot of information from a professional psychologist. My wife and I read it a few times and we pick up something new every time. This book helped us to greatly improve our personal relationships as well as relationships with others and with our kids. I truly recommend this book!
"The book arrived when promised. It is a used book that is in excellent condition, no tears or frayed pages.This is a great book that will apply to almost anyone who has other people in their lives. It has very easy, clear ""story"" lines that really make you think. We took a class on Boundaries years ago. Regretfully, we didn't keep up with what we were taught for very long & continued to get hurt by some people. We were happy to see this book on line & we won't give the book up again! There are other Boundaries books to purchase, & they are all very enjoyable."
A helpful book with much insight.
"This has changed EVERY relationship in my life. Please buy this. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE--buy this book. Everything in your life is affected by your relationships--this will only make them INFINITELY better."
"I gave this book four stars because it contains a lot more information regarding Christian bible verses and how it ties into boundaries in our lives. I wasn't expecting it to be as in-depth as it is about religion. The book does make good points, I just wish that some of the religious aspects were left out. It tends to get repetitive."
Everyone should read this book! It freed me from some unhealthy relationship problems and gave me freedom and health in all of my relationships. It helped me take back control that's for sure!
It helped to understand me and my relationship with others
"I would highly recommend this book for anyone. It has helped me tremendously and I didn't even realize I needed the help. Whether you are an employee, employer, parent, child, friend, significant other or even a friend this book will no doubt add value to your relationships as you learn to create healthy boundaries.  This book will no doubt help you highlight problem areas in your current relationships and will also teach you how to be a stronger individual in your everyday life."
Great book!
Very good book to glean from.
"I never would have thought that such meaningful, life changing wisdom would be so illusive up till now in my life. I loved how the book referenced the Bible and fed me in the style of a warm devotional. I‚Äôm already seeing the benefits of uncovering the concepts and implementing them. This one is highly recommended."
Goodwill always seems to ship quickly and books in good condition
"This resource is a great help for those who have issues with boundaries, Christian content or not, it is still a solid book that will help people gain control over their lives if they apply the principles."
The entire world should read & follow this book. Have friends in crappy relationships? Dysfunctional family? Twisted friendships?Not sure because delusional politically correctness is messing with your head? Bought for a friend and so glad I did!!!!!
Anyone in college should read this book!! I worked through all my childhood trauma and toxic relationships with this lol
"Am not very far into it-slow going-starting a class/group at church next week, so have the work book coming..is making a whole lot of sense-would be good to learn these principals as young as possible! Am 74-never too late I suppose...needed it in my 3 year engagement to a man who attended lots of 12 step programmes-but he still hadn't learned properly-progressive dementia, so no engagement/future with him..will learn the steps for my future, as I learn to be solo again.."
Best book by Townsend and Cloud.
"This has been one of the best books I have ever read in my life. In fact I'm almost irritated that this book has been around for 15 years and I never even knew it existed.I could never understand why I constantly felt guilted into doing things I didn't want to do but I did them anyways to try and please others. Now it's obvious I just didn't know how to have proper boundaries which I've learned is setting personal standards with love and grace.Once I started reading the ideas and suggestions in this book, coupled with the real life examples given, they were immediately implemented in my life.  Right away I started feeling more confident for setting those standards and being able to say 'NO' or walk away from something/someone without having those guilty or shameful feelings.What is even more incredible is now when talking with other people and they tell me their problems/struggles, I'm able to pick up right away that they too have a boundary problem. I've recommended this book to over half a dozen people since finishing itThis is most definitely going to get read again in the near future. What an awesome book, highly recommended!"
"Biblical, practical, inspiring, freeing. Wonderful to realize that setting boundaries and respecting boundaries is Christ-like behavior. Every strong relationship has strong boundaries."
I hope to absorb all of its goodness and live better.
Great
Amazing book...Recommend to everyone. It will change your life if you apply it!!
"Wow!!!  This book was absolutely incredible, and is one that I'm sure I will read over & over & over!  There is so much wisdom in this book, that it's impossible for all of it to be absorbed the first time through.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone!  I think that everyone has issues with boundaries at some point or another, and this book shows you why we have boundaries, need them, and need to respect them both for ourselves and others.  I'm sending a copy of this book to all of my close friends because I know they'll love it & it will really make a huge difference in their lives."
For those who want to understand what it means to know yourself and your personal boundaries - and how to properly let others know your boundaries and limits. This book is so helpful!
I loved the book and the workbook too. So grateful to have been able to buy them both. Easy to read and understnd. It's a book I will read again and again for refresher.
Decent contend but has a heavy christian bibke thumping agenda. I don't think I was even a chapter in and there was already references to The Garden of Eden and some Bible verses. Same reason I get turned off from Dave Ramsey. The topic of healthy boundaries doesn't have to involve the Bible. Come on
"With this powerfully written resource, you will learn that it is not only okay to set boundaries, but it is also the loving, Godly thing to do for your friends, family members and colleagues. Drs. Cloud and Townsound offer sound strategies backed by scriptures to help you teach others how you want and deserve to be treated. This is not just a one-time read, but a valuable tool that will give you ongoing strength and direction in getting the most out of all of your relationships."
This book is awesome!  Everyone should read this book!  I struggle with being friendly and helpful without constantly being taken advantage of.  Great for relationships or parenting or just figuring out your own crazy mind!
This book has helped me in all the relationships I have in my life. It has been a revelation to me that I had difficulty with boundaries and why. It has been a gift that has improved my life for the better.
Love the Boundaries book and workbook. Recommend to everyone.
"The book is great. Unfortunately, I bought the book used from a third party. They had the picture of the new cover, but I got the older version. Not a huge deal - the content is still the same. I recommend this book to everyone. SO many relationship problems are due to poor boundaries. Using the info in this book can definitely transform your relationships."
Everyone should read this book!!!
"This volume is helpful and a solid resource for considering how to form healthy relationships with others.  I would recommend it for individual or group readings, and see it as a personal source of counsel that would produce wonderful discussion."
Great read and useful strategies to share with others
I have bought this book for several people. Wished I had read it years ago. I am notBiblically inclined and thought the biblical references were wise in their application even for secular people like me.
If you are dealing with boundary issues with your kids or family you need to read this book. I have not given it to a person yet who doesn't come back and say how much it helped them and it will help you also.
I love this book and I think that if I had studied this when I was younger I would have been a lot better off now. I recommend this book to the teenager who has to deal with peer pressure and it is hard for them to say NO and stick up for themself. This book will help give a confidence that is needed to say NO and to TAKE CARE OFYOURSELF while earning the respect of others because you are taking care of yourself.
This book changed my life. For once I was clearly able to see that I am not responsible for other's and am not allowed to change them. This book shows the reader where he begins and ends and how our decisions need to reflect this. Anyone who feels guilt when they disappoint another person needs to read this book. I've given more of these books out as gifts and got the tape to play in my car over and over. The truths presented here give us permission to make healthy decisions which allow good in to our lives and keep the bad out. I found I was doing the opposite for years. If you are a natural people pleaser...get your hands on this book!!
Oh My Goodness! I own my mentors who referred this book to me more than I could ever repay them. This book has changed my life profoundly. I never would have thought that the root of all of my struggles and challenges in life stemmed from the lack of healthy boundaries. Thank you Drs. Cloud and Townsend for allowing God to use you to bless the millions of readers who have read this book!
Overall I liked the message. There were parts that felt long. The author had good use of scripture to illustrate points.
Love the information and biblical references
Wonderful book. I have read the boundary series and they are a fantastic tool. A most read for those dating Christian or none alike.Boundys are needed and healthy to enforce in your life and relationships right from the beginning. A must read for ladies AND men.
"""Soul-Care' classes have revealed the hurts of God's people and this book was just one of many recommended to read to help me (and other concern ministry persons) to identify the cause and effects of people setting up (and breaking down) boundaries in the lives of Gods people. Healing starts when boundries are identified and taken car of. Thank you to the author of this book."
I was so broken for so long. I had issues where my family never approved of me and would treat me poorly. I also have a teenage son who was rebellious and I did not know what to do. But thank God I now know how to set boundaries. This book is life changer. I am now free.
"This was a great book. It goes into boundaries in several areas of life ex; spouses, children, friends, coworkers , bosses.  A friend loaned me their bbook and I ended up hi lighting my own."
This book was not what I expected.  It took a much more spiritual approach than what I was looking for
I have read this book twice in 6 years.  the first time in active codependancy recovery and recently from a much healthier place.  I can't say enough good things about this book... teaching us the limits and healthy dynamics of all our relationships.  With biblical support and explanation of how God intended healthy relationships to be.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND for anyone who doesn't have perfect relationships...  and that's all of us.  ;-)
Incredible book. If your in an abusive relationship or if anyone has ever told you ‚Äúthey‚Äôre still your family you still have to spend time with them‚Äù....please PLEASE read this!!
I cannot recommend this book enough! It is fantastic. Life-changing. Make yourself and your relationships healthier and get this book!
Used the book as a choice for our book club. Struggled to finish the book (kind of felt like I was reading a psych book) but when the club members got together to discuss the book we really walked away with some valuable information.
"I bought 6 to give out to nursing graduates. I keep some on hand to Lend out. This book changed my life. A MUST READ! When we establish healthy boundaries our relationships, health, outlook, and emotional maturity changes for the better."
"Great book, good price, great condition, and shipped faster than expected.  I‚Äôm a high school science teacher, youth leader, coach, advisor, program director, and more.  This book revolutionized the way I think, capture, organize, and execute. If you are having difficulty balancing all of your commitments, this is worth a read.  I used to hate the word ‚Äúboundaries‚Äù, but this book will teach you to love them.  Also, check out David Allen‚Äôs ‚ÄúGetting Things Done‚Äù ... awesome!"
It‚Äôs good even for those not of the Christian faith.  Authors are very wise and well educated.
"Can‚Äôt say enough good things about this book. It really is life changing. Please don‚Äôt hesitate buying it, you‚Äôll be glad you did."
This is an awesome book to study along with your Bible as the author quotes scripture throughout! Teaches how we were made to have boundaries!
"This book will challenge you, but also help you relate to people better while being true to who you should be as a person as well. Highly recommended!"
"To say this book changed my life would be an understatement.  I don't think I've ever read a book that actually changed my life and this one most certainly has.To be clear, I would not call this a ""Self-Help"" book.  Do not read this book expecting step-by-step handholding on how to create boundaries -- some of the reviews I've read suggest that's what people are looking for.  You need more than a book; you need therapy.This book is Christian / Biblically based so be ready to read a lot of Bible passages, a lot of ""preaching"" about how the writers are translating those passages.  I know I can't give my parents this book because the Biblical passages are going to be over their head -- they don't know the Bible, they don't know God's Word.  Same thing with a friend of mine who needs better boundaries -- this is not the book for her because the Bible passages are going to turn her off to the underlining message in those passages.  I have shared this book with a parishioner friend and a coworker, both who have a deep faith and understand God's Word.After reading this book I now have a better sense of what a ""friend"" is ... and what a friend is not.  I am working on creating clear boundaries in my life -- in my personal life and in my professional life.  I'm working on making this clearer at work as well ... just because we're friendly at work does not mean that we're ""friends"" -- we're only ""friends"" if we have a relationship outside of work, otherwise we're just friendly coworkers.Adrianne"
This was a very helpful tool in helping me with saying No. I've always had this problem and in the end Im the one that gets hurt.  Very interesting and helpful book in learning to form boundaries.
the book is quite useful and there's lots of useful information and I read like half of the book.but what I dislike about this book is that there's lots of references to god and bible. personally I don't like books that use bible and god as reasons.
"Very scripture heavy, and a bit of reach on coordination at time. Does have some great content and concepts on boundaries."
I was quick to blame others for their deficiencies without doing some self reflection. I had no idea that my boundaries (or lack there of) were the problem. This book is wonderful. I‚Äôm not religious & I was able to look past the religious aspects of the book to get to the true message
this book is so clear and to the point about the issues I think most of us struggle with as we learn more about ourselves as individuals and how to get along best with others. especially wisdom in steering clear of those are boundary bullies and how to deal with them in a mature and truthfully loving way. This book has done huge things for me in evaluating some of my past mistakes and clearly understanding my weaknesses and needs for improvement. Townsend and Cloud will open your eyes to a lot of important things you may not be aware of that will benefit you the rest of your life. Definitely recommend this book highly as I've already done to many of my close friends.
It's definitely a little more religious than I would have liked/anticipated. But I'm able to put that aside for the purpose of the book.
Great book.It articulated the living skills needed to achieve balance in life.Highly recommend it to everyone.
"THIS BOOK IS FANTASTIC!  I  see myself in it, friends, family.  What bright wonderful Drs. the 2 authors are.  No wonder a NYT Best Seller.  This book is helping me so much. Thank you Amazon for carrying it."
I needed to read a great book for some self help. I would recommend others to try this book. Arrived fast and easy to read. Love it.
I grew up with somewhat boundaries but I was never taught how to install healthy boundaries with family or friends. This book is such a great reference to have and I swear sometimes feels like it‚Äôs my story. This will forever be on my bookshelf
"This is a great book to read when your personal boundaries need sharpening. Its Christian grounding is helpful, too."
I bought this book about seven months ago I finally had the time to read it recently. Went to read it and realized I had a chapter or two where every page was only half a page. Wish I would have seen it sooner because I passed the return window.
"Even someone who doesn't think they need this can gain something from reading this book. Every human being can learn from this, about themselves and about others. It's kind of long, but I can't imagine any part that could be left out."
"From page 196 in Kindle Edition: ""Little boys want to be like dad, and little girls like mom. They also develop competitive feelings toward the same parent, wishing to marry the opposite sex parent, defeating the same sex parent in the process."""
"I'm disappointed that I didn't read more reviews, if I had, I would've never bought this ( let alone whisper audible) It should tell you SOMEWHERE in the description it states its about christianity based boundaries. I feel deceived."
Very insightful of children‚Äôs behavior and how damaging a parent can be if they don‚Äôt understand why a child is seeming to act out!
"It was a great read, especially for Christians.  I am looking forward to doing some work to setting my boundaries."
"2 chapters in and this book is already amazing. If you struggle with setting boundaries with others and yourself and if you‚Äôre a Christian, this book is perfect. It sensibly combines biblical truth with psychology for a very helpful read on boundaries."
"way too much bible in it to make it readable for me, a non-Chrisitian (and no, I am not a liberal atheist). Practically every other paragraph had some biblical reference and/or excerpt. Otherwise, some of the ideas were great. I'd love if they made a non-religious version - boundaries are essential for healthy human function. Oh, and one other point: the book writes that it is occasionally acceptable/necessary for a child to be spanked. This is especially surprising coming from psychologists who should be well-versed in the hundreds of studies to date that show that corporal punishment is not only ineffective but harmful."
A definitely good book to have.
Reading
"I am not quite through the book. Definite insights on how to stop repeating the same choices in life. Get out of the abuse and stay out of it by understanding what is ''normal'' and works. The insights are scripturally based on God's plan for us in His Word, but doesn't hammer you over the head with it on every page. Another transformative book, if you let it and let God."
"Through this book, I'm learning when to say no and when to say yes. I'm seeing what is my responsibility and what is not, and why enabling is so destructive."
Recommended.
"Seriously, EVERYONE should get and read this book!!! It has CHANGED MY LIFE. I always felt guilty standing up for myself, saying no, and would put people's negative emotions on myself, so this book was a life-saver. It teaches you how to avoid over-exerting yourself and being overly burdened in a Godly way by teaching you about God's boundaries and then showing you how to apply those principles in your own life. It has been SO LIBERATING for me by helping me own my choices and letting other people worry about theirs. It's seriously my new favorite book. PLEASE, READ THIS BOOK AND THEN LEND IT TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW!!! IT'S THE BEST!!!!"
Helps you to understand why you sometimes do and say the things you do. Some habits we have and how destructive they can be to our own health.
easy to read and helpful!!
"Excellent book.  Didn't realize I had been raised without them and after two failed marriages I now know where I am going wrong and can change myself.  Thank you for this book!!  I had no idea.  Countless therapists could not help me, but this book has."
"OMG! Very impactful book. It really discusses boundaries IN all areas of our lives. I think the  most impactful part was how we are creating and teaching our children boundaries at a VERY early age. After reading this, I started looking at my struggles and how they correlate with my raisings. HIGHLY recommend this book!"
I've read half the book and I already see amazing changes in my life.  You don't realize how much people are invading in your space and boundaries until you've read this book.  Learn to say no when you mean no.  This book gives useful tools to combat relationships with people who perpetually invade our boundaries.  You will experience amazing changes and have a more happier life.
I felt like she was talking about me personally in so many parts of this book! It made me understand a lot about myself and about other people and I've already applied what I've read in this book to my life. I believe it has helped me in MANY ways and has the ability to make a big difference in people's lives who deal with boundary issues.
"There are certainly many personal and business lessons to be learned in this book. Keep in mind this is a Christian/religious focused book so many sections will refer to bible versus and their tie-in to the lesson. If not interested in bible references, it's easy to skip sections."
I like that is is clear and direct and gives examples but the book has so many bible quotes it would be offensive to anyone of any religion other than christian. If I had not bought it onljne I may have returned it. It doesn't talk about the bible thumping in the review.
Nice product.  Would purchase again.
I cannot say enough how great this book is!  A book everyone should read and practice in everyday life.  I've given this book to several people and they've all appreciated it and loved it!  Great for anyone and everyone regardless of life circumstances.  Empower yourself and others by reading this book!
"This book is taking me some time to read. I really want to let it all sink in. I am thankful for this book, because it has helped me to do some self-evaluation. I think anyone could read this book and learn more about themselves and what boundaries they need to work on."
"I found this book to be helpful in identifying what boundary-overstepping is and how to deal with it. Before I read this, because I am a people-pleaser, I thought I was being ""Christian"" by putting up with certain behaviors from others when actually I was enabling sin.People who cross your boundaries may think they are helping when they really should be allowing you to act as an adult and allow you to  depend on God's leading to guide you in making your own decisions instead of depending on them."
"this was recommended by my therapist, it is PERFECT  my go to tool for when ever I need ME time or simply dont want to do something I feel I am being forced into. I love it!!!"
"I like the idea of having a workbook and practical examples, but I am not christian or so religious and this book cite the bible on every page almost"
This book is good. It is very intense at times and I had to read it slowly to get everything out of it. Glad I read it.
"I gave this book as a gift to a couple who is soon to be married. I read the first chapter before I gave it to them and knew it was spot-on. It had been recommended by my cousin as a wonderful book to help learn to set boundaries and keep them. I asked the gift recipient if he thought it would help them and he said he thought it definitely would, so I gave the book 5 stars."
"Very insightful, great guide that we all should read.  You can skip through some of the overdrawn sections, but most of the books is filled with priceless tools, suggestions and guidelines that can be applied to your everyday life.  It's one of those books that you keep by your bedside and re-visit from time to time.  Puts things in perspective and helps you re-think your behaviors."
"Everything you wish you'd known going back to childhood. Read, learn, do."
"One of the most important lesson you can learn, a wonderful book. It is based on a Christian world view."
"This book is absolutely life changing. I encourage anyone to read it! My husband and I (both polar opposites) both gained incredible insights from this book, and found it absolutely fascinating along the way."
"GREAT book - a good read for many! Can be applied to any area of our lives - whether personal or business relationships. And, of course, cannot beat anything written by Henry Cloud - perspective is so trust-worthy..."
This book changed my life! Best purchase i ever made
This book really helped me with setting boundaries with family and friends. Made me feel no guilt about my me time. Taught me how to allow only positive.
Helps others from a biblical view learn to say no and moving forward from past problems or manipulations and get out of that self destructive cycle with others.
Henry Cloud has tremendous insights into the makeup of our minds and self perception. THis book is well written and easy to understand and assimilate into making changes in the way we treat ourselves and others. I have read many  Cloud/Townsend books and this is one that I bought several copies to give away to others that have issues with saying no or yes for the right reasons.
This devotional is much larger than the many books I have by Sarah Young but it's really nice. It's filled with lots of encouraging prayers and scriptures for every day of the year.
Another daily devotional by Sarah Young that I absolutely love. Very inspirational & uplifting to one's heart and soul. I also love that her readings include Bible Scriptures to refer to.
"I read Jesus Always and Jesus Calling daily for many years and like the format with the corresponding bible verses. This devotional, however, just includes the Bible reference so the reader has to look them up. I would pay extra money to have the kindle book the other format. I don‚Äôt want to be bothered."
Was really surprised by how good the devotional is.Definitely a step up from the Jesus calling devotional
The daily prayers speak directly to me. I love all her books but this one is my new favorite
"I have used Sarah Young's devotionals (e.g. JESUS CALLING) a couple of times a day for several years. I was delighted to find she had published a new one, JESUS LISTENS. This book of daily prayers lives up to the inspired quality of her previous books."
"My sister and I both bought a copy of Jesus listens, it is truly amazing, I feel as though Jesus is right beside me, it‚Äôs written so very well straight from the heart"
"Encouraging and Full of Positivity!Joel Osteen does it again in his new book, You Are Stronger Than You Think! This book is perfect for anyone who needs a little push and the courage to get through life‚Äôs toughest and most overwhelming moments. Don‚Äôt let anything hold you back from living your best life. As Joel says, ‚ÄúNothing you face is beyond what you‚Äôve been designed for.‚Äù What a great read!"
Our Bible has all the answers and Joel draws on his in-depth understanding of the scriptures to help us learn to encourage ourselves in the inevitable difficulties of life.  His life and the life of his whole precious family are living testimonies of the points made in this book.  Do something nice for yourself or a suffering loved one and buy this book... you will not be disappointed.
I love his work!
"If you are feeling overwhelmed, this book is for you. It is full of encouragement. The title says it all. ‚ÄúYou'll never know how strong you really are,‚Äù Osteen writes, ‚Äúuntil you face pressure that you've never faced.‚Äù (109/3059) He uses lots of Scripture promises, examples from the Bible (such as Gideon), examples from his own life and the lives of others to support his case.Osteen is adamant. God has designed you with the inner strength you'll need for this time. Like buildings designed to withstand the pressure of earthquakes in California or hurricane force winds in Florida, God has designed your infrastructure for this difficulty.Lest it seem Osteen is overly optimistic, he is realistic too. He reminds us sometimes God may take away something or someone we think we can't live without. God wants us to totally rely on Him. God doesn't stop every difficulty. He allows challenges to move us, to grow us. We may feel like we are in the furnace but God promises to be right there with us.Osteen calls us to have faith, even when it seems the darkest. This book is encouraging with the message that God is working. We must have faith in God. ‚ÄúNothing you face is beyond what you've been designed for.‚Äù (1363/3059) Should a reader not know Jesus as Savior, an opportunity is given to do so at the end of the book.I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher. My comments are an independent and honest review."
"I've read a number of Osteen's books, and I appreciate the encouragement I get from them. His latest release is great for those who have been feeling overwhelmed. I suspect I'm not the only person who has felt that way recently. And Osteen wants to remind the reader that God gave them the strength to get through life's pressures, with Him by our side.While there is an optimism to the book, Osteen is realistic, too. As a Christ-follower, we're not guaranteed a life free of trials. God just promises to be with us through them, like he was with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the furnace. Even then, God is at work.Chapter Eight, ""Overcoming Weariness,"" is the one that most hit home for me. I'm sure most readers will find something in this book that feels like God, through Osteen, is speaking right to them.Some of my favorite quotes include:- ""Don't wear yourself out to where God has to make you slow down.""- ""Many times the enemy knows who we are even before we realize who we are.""- ""When you have a big future, the enemy is not going to roll out the red carpet and let you fulfill it.""- ""The reason you have big opposition is because you have a big destiny.""- ""Don't talk yourself out of what you know God is calling you to do.""Disclaimer: I received a complimentary copy, but I wasn't required to leave a positive review.-"
"As a Christian, I think the power of positive thinking is so important. Joel does an excellent job of encouraging, equipping, and preparing individuals to use their God-given thinking and cognitive skills to further their work for His Kingdom. By unleashing the Power to Go Bigger, Go Bold, and Go Beyond, we allow ourselves to be used by God for a purpose far greater than we could ever ask or imagine."
"This book spoke to me on many levels. I love Pastor Osteen's work because he's so uplifting and positive as the world is so negative and destructive. This book is about knowing who you are as Christ sees you, not as the world sees you. It's about knowing where your true strength is, and how to change your thinking about where you are in life. I recommend this read!"
Just when you feel like you can't move forward and you begin to doubt yourself is when you need to pick up this BOOK and get one for a friend!  You Are Stronger Than You Think is encouraging and gives you the biblically based tools you need to keep going because God knows that we are stronger than we can even imagine!
"What a blessing this book has been! There are so many amazing nuggets of insight and inspiration throughout, such as, ""Don't be discouraged because it's been dark a long time--that's a sign that God is about to do something you've never seen."" I've gained a lot of clarity reading this book and would recommend it to anyone that's experiencing a moment of darkness. You are stronger than you think! :)"
"Joel Osteen's book, You Are Stronger than You Think, is a good book to read. My friend sent me a copy of this book and reading it was a pleasure. As a reader going through some tough time and season, a timely book always come handy. Its pages speak of practical insights from the Word of God, personal stories, and applications. There's no theological jargons that are hard to understand for common folks--just plain truths and principles that bolster healthy confidence in life and work. In such a time as this, finding strength in God and realizing the power of God within us makes us bolder. J.Osteen delivers again with positive message of hope, boldness for the future, and upbeat spirit. Kudos!"
"Tim Keller is ALWAYS good. What I like most about this book is that it is a really good balance of biblical study and practical living. Chapter 6, which is written by Kathy Keller, is the best chapter in the book as it talks about the complementary gender roles in marriage. She does a great job approaching a VERY controversial issue with tact and wisdom, relying on the teaching of Scripture to make her points. I would love to converse with someone who would disagree with her after reading the chapter just so I can understand where the sticking points are. His chapter on sex is also really good and honest."
"Marriage is clearly a troubled institution in American culture, and that includes even among American Christians. The problem is that so often Christians have accepted the world's definitions of marriage. While many Christian books have been written on marriage, Tim Keller's ""The Meaning of Marriage"" is one of the best.What makes ""The Meaning of Marriage"" so excellent? At least four things. First, Keller gives a vision for marriage. His main reason for writing the book, in fact, was to give both Christians and non-Christians a vision for marriage. What is Keller's vision for marriage? Keller writes, concerning the meaning of marriage, that ""It is for helping each other to become our future glory-selves, the new creations that God will eventually make us."" More than this, Keller (in Chapter 6) relates marriage not only to ""the dance of the Trinity"" but also to Christ's love of the stranger (Chapter 5).The second reason ""The Meaning of Marriage"" is so excellent is that Keller bases his views on the Bible. Time and again, instead of turning to what the world teaches about marriage, Keller returns to the Bible, especially Ephesians 5. While Keller begins with the Bible, he does more than just quote Scripture: he unlocks its meaning and applies it to our lives. This is what makes his teaching on writing so profound and powerful. While he doesn't cover every possible topic, he does give a theological vision for marriage that will change your marriage for the better or better prepare you for marriage in the future.Third, in presenting a biblical view of marriage, Keller directly challenges the worldly views of marriage, including many that have infected the Church. Among the most popular of these myths is that we should be looking for our ""soul mate,"" in the sense of finding someone we're presently in love with. This view minimizes the importance of the hard work that goes into marital love. Keller also rightly rebukes the idea that we should not go into marriage expecting to change the other person. To the contrary, marriage is precisely for the purpose of sanctifying one another, and Keller demonstrates some of the many reasons why marriage is such a powerful means of sanctification for Christian spouses. Keller takes on many other myths as well, for example, the idea that marriage is primarily for self-fulfillment, instead of mutual sanctification and becoming one with another.Fourth, ""The Meaning of Marriage"" is both readable and practical. Keller's ideas are rooted in theology but are written in a very readable prose. Most importantly, his book is eminently practical. While it's not a ""How To"" manual and doesn't give you every detail, he does amply illustrate and explain his major ideas on marriage. So practical is ""The Meaning of Marriage"" that it's applicable not only to Christian spouses but also non-Christian spouses and Christian singles.  He has, for example, a chapter on a theology of singleness (Chapter 7).There are many profound insights in the book. There was little that was new to me as a priest and as a husband who has worked every day on his marriage for 18 years. But there were still many revelations and ""Aha!"" moments that reminded me of what it was all about and encouraged me to love my wife to an even greater degree. As I'm writing this, she's out of town on a business trip (which she never takes). I can't wait for her to return so that I can begin immediately putting into practice some of the things Keller has taught me.Here are some of his best insights:1. You never marry the right person. No 2 people are compatible. For this reason, marriage takes a lot of love and work. Also, marriage profoundly changes us!2. Two-thirds of unhappy marriages will become happy within five years if people stay married. Keller uses this to demonstrate the power of making and keeping a vow. Promising is the key to identity and is the very essence of marital love.3. Actions of love lead to feelings of love.4. Marriage is a friendship, and friendship must have constancy, transparency, and a common passion, which, for Christians, should especially be Christ.5. Each spouse should see the great thing that Jesus is doing in the life of their mate through the Word. And each spouse should then give himself of herself to be a vehicle for this work of God.6. Your spouse IS the ""someone better"" you're looking for! This is true if you see him or her in terms of the glory God intends for them, a work to which you are called.There's much, much, more, and each chapter holds its delights and wisdom for the reader. I highly recommend both ""The Meaning of Marriage,"" as well as ""The Mystery of Marriage"" by Mike Mason!Keller presents his teaching on marriage, based on a sermon series of his, in the following chapters:1. The Secret of Marriage - how marriage and the gospel relate2. The Power for Marriage - submitting to one another out of love3. The Essence of Marriage - covenantal commitment4. The Mission of Marriage - marriage and mutual sanctification5. Loving the Stranger - the power of love (all 4 kinds)6. Embracing the Other - man and wife as one flesh; the Trinity as a model for marriage7. Singleness and Marriage8. Sex and MarriageEpilogue and Appendix (Decision Making and Gender Roles)"
"My girlfriend and I have been discussing marriage for a few months and both decided we should read up on Christian marriage to get some better invite on different obstacles we will face over the years.After some basic research, I decided on getting both of us a copy of this book.We both were impressed by how drawn in we both were to this book. Neither of us are huge readers, but found ourselves immersed with the Keller's writings.Not only did this reassure us of several decisions that we have already made, but enlightened us with many different tidbits to better our walk with God and in our relationship.It has been fun watching both of us implement different parts of this into our lives.I'm sure we will read it again after a few years!"
"If ever there was a must-read book about marriage, this is it! My husband and I have been married for over 14 years and this book was an incredible encouragement to us. There are so many scripture based truths we wish we would have known years ago! Timothy (and Kathy) Keller did a remarkable job of digging into scripture and breaking it down into applicable truths. They also unpacked several misconceptions about marriage which is useful for any couple, no matter how long you've been married.We will revisit this book for years to come as we continue to seek the Lord in our marriage."
"Everyone should read this book...married or not...this is a must read. My husband and I read this together and it literally changed us and helped us put things into perspective. We are both Christians and have been for quite some time but it has helped us to not just say we have a godly marriage because we identufy with the Christian culture and do christian things, instead it forced us to look at what God says is a godly marriage and understand that marriage is soooooo much bigger than us...GOD IS ON A MISSION...and he has blessed us to be apart of that mission in marriage. This book made us look at ourselves as followers of Christ. This is so much more than a marriage book...this literally points you back to Jesus and his redemptive love by looking at God through the lens of marriage."
"Buy this book!!!!! I have never encountered a more thoughtful, well written treatise (maybe a little strong, but I didn't want to type ""book"" again) on the subject of marriage. Keller's intellect and heart are famous, this gem is an additional confirmation as to why. Your love for your wife/husband will increase if you follow his advice."
"Fantastic! Agree with a majority of what Keller says.  Especially the section on consumer vs covenant relationships.  Marriage is not about consumption, but commitment. If we get this wrong as an individual concerning marriage, it will affect all other relationships.  Keller points out that your spouse is your best friend as well as your life partner, especially in parenting.  If your marriage is strong, you love out into the world in strength.  If it is weak, you move out in weakness.  May your marriage be strengthened by this book."
"This book is so powerful and full of so much wisdom, it makes it really hard to put down. Every time I stopped reading, I couldn't wait to start reading again, which is big for me because I am not big on reading. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is single, dating, engaged or married. It explains marriage it such a way that is uplifting and educational, but the best part...with a Biblical view. Do yourself a favor and purchase this book."
"Tim Keller is a New York Times best selling author, speaker, and the founding pastor of the 5,000-person Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City. Based on Keller's sermon series on marriage, this book explains to Christians, skeptics, singles and married, the vision of what marriage should be according to the Bible.Keller, with his wife Kathy, helps us see what a biblical marriage is and is not. This book shows us the dangerous and damaging concepts that are put in our head by secular society. Hollywood, pop culture and secularism have sold us a bill of goods on marriage and have created an unobtainable and unhealthy view of matrimony in our minds. Keller helps to clarify what God intended in marriage and how our spouse is to help us point to and reflect Christ.Keller tells us that God devised marriage to reflect his saving love for us in Christ, to refine our character, to create stable human community for the birth and nurture of children, and to accomplish all this by bringing the complementary sexes into an enduring whole-life union. If we look to our spouse to fill up our tanks in a way only God can, we are demanding an impossibility of our other half.A Christ-centered marriage finds each partner sacrificing for and serving his spouse. A marriage is a daily opportunity to provide examples of the unconditional love, grace and mercy that Christ showed us. In the secular world this example of selfless service and sacrifice are contrary to what we are taught. The world tells us to find our own version of the perfect mate and when you grow apart and are no longer happy you can move on.Keller outlines a wonderful biblical example of the marriage that Christ molded with his bride, the church. The Christ honoring union Keller describes is not an easy one to achieve, but it is the most rewarding."
"Please read this book! We are all at least a little bit influenced by Western culture‚Äôs cynical view of marriage today. This book is a celebration of marriage, but also a hard, honest, look at what it really takes. Great explanation on the biblical meaning of marriage, the purpose of marriage, the benefits of marriage, and how to make yours everything God designed it to be."
"I counsel couples both prior to marriage and in their marriage and this is a book that has consistently helped folks. It is Biblical, thoughtful and concerned with the challenges faced by married couples. I can't recommend highly enough."
"It will shatter your selfish view of marriage and help you rebuild your thinking so you can build or strengthen your relationships. Even as a single person, it has a very helpful and powerful message. Reading it with a group, I can see the amazing and applicable ways that each member (married, unmarried, dating, single, young and older) are being impacted by it. I highly recommend for believers and nonbelievers! If we promoted more loving, covenantial relationships then we could have a better world and stronger families."
I gave this as a gift at Christmas. It has completely transformed a highly contentious relationship into the marriage of their dreams in 3 short months.Highly recommend!!
This was a great book! The author explains concepts with real and relatable stories. I have plenty of highlights that I come back to revisit; certain teachings and concepts that help with life as a single person preparing for the potential of marriage.
I have read a few of the Timothy Keller books before. He makes the writing of the books easy to read. I like an easy read.
Great book....We give it to all young couples getting married. Keller does a good job bringing God's thoughts (as revealed in the Bible) to the subject and giving a refreshing and honest look at marriage and what it's supposed to be.
"Tim and Kathy Keller provide us a great resource for the Biblical Theology of Marriage.  As a pastor of a church with a demographic of 80% single adults we find that Keller has a great opportunity and need to research and teach on the subject of marriage.  His congregation obviously will be thinking about marriage and thinking about whether or not it is a cultural covenant or a Biblical covenant.Keller bases his book on a series of messages that he first gave in 1991, but he has refined those messages over the years and delivered them many times.  So, with the background of 37 years of marriage and the many years of counseling others and preaching about marriage he has a profound sense of what our culture, especially our Western Evangelical Church culture, needs to hear.  He has taken his messages, refined them and added pertinent data from Christian and secular sources to provide us a great book.Don't neglect to look at his bibliography and download some of the articles that he mentions in the book.Each chapter builds on the previous one.  Maybe the best chapter happens to be Chapter Six, Embracing the Other.  It is written by Kathy and does a great job of defining the roles of men and women (husbands and wives) in the marriage relationship based on Ephesians 5.  It is nice to hear from a woman's perspective how those roles are defined and best played out in marriage.  Kathy gives good insights and lots of good information that I plan to incorporate into my pre-marital counseling situations.Chapter seven deals with Singleness and is just as profound as chapter six on providing good and sometimes very new thoughts on how the Bible relates to marriage.  Given the fact that Redeemer Church has 80% single adults this chapter is well researched, well written and comes with lots of experience behind it.  This is a wonderful chapter.  Chapter eight deals with the topic of sex and has great information.This book is a must read for any couple thinking of marriage or for any Christian Counselor who is dealing with people and their marriage issues.Finally, the best principle for me from the book was on page 168 when Keller states that the most powerful tool in any marriage partners arsenal is the gift of ""Forgiveness!""  That is absolutely true and something that many people forget about.  If you have the ability to love your partner, forgive your partner and seek forgiveness from your partner you will succeed in marriage.Well, enough said, stop reading reviews of the book and just buy it, you won't be disappointed."
Tim Keller‚Äôs books are always well thought out and convincing books. I recommend this book to married and single people alike. It is worth the time.
"I have been doing premarital counseling for over 10 years.  This is the first book that contains almost every major topic I cover.  It covers topics I've never seen in other books.  It brings together topics from some of the best single topic books (like 5 Love Languages).  I'm have been recommending this book to everyone.  I am going to use it for premarital counseling.  I'm hoping to get every married person, and single person hoping to be married, to read this book.  I couldn't more highly recommend it.  This is one of my top five favorite books probably of all time."
"Tim and Kathy do an excellent job in presenting what a biblical based marriage should be and its foundation. Truly appreciate the focus on the meaning of marriage, given most books focus on the how to."
My husband and I read this together before marriage and still reference it today. We also use the corresponding devotional and find it thought provoking and rooted in gospel and the good news
wonderful book. great for married couples and singles. Well written and easy to follow. Actually has an impact on my life
"Hands down my absolute favorite book on marriage. I recommend it to everyone that is getting married, already married or thinking about marriage! Highly recommend!!"
Great book.  A must read for every new marriage.  Helps husbands and wives learn about what is expected by your partner and setting of expectations from a scriptual point of view.  Keller does a great job of laying it on the line.
Best book on marriage yet.  All couples should read this before getting married.
My pastor recommended this read glad I accept
"I think EVERYONE needs to read this book.As a single 19 year old, my friends teased me about it when they saw the title, but don't be fooled.  This is a book for married AND single people.  EVEN IF YOU DONT PLAN ON GETTING MARRIED.This will be at the top of my list of books to recommend!"
"What do I think of Tim and Kathy Keller's book published by Riverhead? Let's plunge into the Deeper Waters and find out.This is the second Tim Keller book I've read and like the first one, I loved it and I hated it. I loved it because it's just packed with excellent information and wisdom to help one be a good spouse and learn to appreciate marriage all the better. I hated it because in the midst of all of this, the Kellers smack you right between the eyes with what they've written so you have to take a good long look in the mirror and come to the conclusion that there are ways that you don't shape up as the spouse that you are to be.Tim Keller is the pastor of a church with thousands of people in New York and the overwhelming majority of those people are single, quite the rarity. Despite that, this book is based on a sermon series he did on marriage. Sermons on marriage are not just for married people. They need to be there for singles as well. Why? Because many of those singles just might want to get married someday and they need to learn to honor marriage the way God intended. If they don't, they still need to honor marriage, such as avoiding having sex with other people, because they will be interacting with married people and even if you are not married, you can still work to build up the institution of marriage.At the start, the Kellers want to dismiss with the idea of a Hallmark card. Marriage is usually treated like a fairy tale where you live your life feeling constant love for the other person. However, if this was what marriage was meant to be, then very few marriages would last. In fact, it could be the reason that many marriages do not last is because there are too many people who expect this. C.S. Lewis once wrote that the feeling of being in love is the explosion that gets the relationship started, but after awhile, it has to learn to rely on a deeper love that does not depend on the feelings.The Kellers also give a history of marriage and show how in the Enlightenment, marriage came to be about fulfilling your own needs and not so much about self-denial. It came about fulfilling yourself as a person emotionally and sexually. Each person was entering more often for what the marriage would do for them and not what it would do for the other person. What a shock then that we wind up in a scenario where if the other person is not meeting our needs, well we just walk right out the door. Unfortunately, when we do this, we don't realize that many of the problems from the marriage we still take with us and we just bring them into our next relationship, and then we probably bring even more since we're trying to recover from a past relationship.Tim Keller says that as a pastor, he points out to people that love is hard. Most anything that you want to do well, it requires sacrifice and effort. Look at the star athlete in any field. Could they have been born with some natural talent? Absolutely. Yet despite that natural talent, they had to work hard to do what they are doing today. We could in fact argue that love is very hard because it does go against our natural inclinations. Our natural mode of operation is to look to ourselves and take care of our own needs. Marriage calls you out of that to look to the needs of someone else.The Kellers contend through their work that marriage is a picture of the Gospel. Of course, you can have a good marriage without knowing the Gospel, but if you know the Gospel well, it will improve your marriage. This is why they say that marriage is painful and wonderful. So is the Gospel. We can all appreciate good news about redemption in Christ and forgiveness, but with that good news comes the message that you are a human being who is not perfect and you are guilty of great wrong and need to seek forgiveness for your sins. We don't like being told we're sinners, and frankly, marriage has a great way of showing you the many things that you are doing wrong. I often tell guys that when you get married, it's like God putting a big mirror in front of you and saying ""Hey! This is what you're really like! Do you like what you see?!""The Kellers point out that at the heart of many divorces is a self-centeredness. You can see this because many times when someone divorces, they will often rail about what a jerk the other person was. Very rarely will they talk about all the things that they did wrong. (This is not to say there are no valid divorces. Sadly, there are.) This is of course our natural tendency. None of us really likes to look in the mirror and see who we are, but I often tell people who are married that the rule I apply in our marriage is when something goes wrong, I try my hardest to first look at myself and see if I did anything wrong. I'd like to say I always succeed at doing this, but I don't.Ironically, if we put the needs of our spouse first and seek their happiness, we can more often find our own happiness. The reality is many of us know this. A wife who provides a good romantic evening for her husband can enjoy the sexual act itself. Yet despite this, the greater joy she will often get out of it is knowing that her husband is going to bed that evening a happy man. (And yes ladies, we will go to bed happy men!) A husband will not normally enjoy spending money, but when he buys his wife some flowers, the great joy that he gets is not from spending the money, but from the joy that he brings his wife. We all know this! Why aren't we living it more?The Kellers then go on to speak about the people who ask why a piece of paper should matter so much. Keller says that if you say ""I love you, but let's not ruin it by getting married"", it's a way of saying ""I don't love you enough to close off all my options. I don't love you enough to give myself to you that thoroughly."" Getting that piece of paper is a public declaration with solid evidence that there is no one else and that all other doors are closed. Yes. The piece of paper does mean something. (Also, the Kellers are strongly against any idea of living together before marriage as that also increases your odds of divorce.)Keller also talks here about our idea of passion and uses sex as an example. He writes that if you only have sex when you feel a time of great passion, then you will rarely do it and there will be fewer times of great passion as your spouse feels deprived. Why should they try to ask you for sex if they're quite sure they will get a no answer? I happen to agree with those who say that many times someone should have sex even when they don't feel like it. Once again, this is not about your needs. This is about the needs of your spouse. William Lane Craig has emphasized this as well.There's also the emphasis on what it means to honor your spouse. Breaking faith with your spouse means breaking it with God. It's a shame that many couples enter the covenant of marriage and before a year is done, they're looking to get out. When you got married, if it was in a church, you made vows to God and you made vows to man and you made vows to each other. Does that not mean anything to you? Those vows, the Kellers point out, are not just a vow of how you feel today, but they are meant to be vows that you will in fact keep loving your spouse in the future as well.The Kellers also want us to know that in marriage, our goal is to shape the other person to be all that Christ wants them to be. We don't just love them as they are. We love them as we see them becoming. We love to see what Christ is doing in them. You must be committed to your spouse's holiness. As you do this, you will experience romance, sex, laughter, and fun, but those are not the cause of the great marriage. They are the result of it. The more that you are getting from your relationship with Christ and becoming like Him, the more also you will be able to impart that to your own family.Aside from Christ, your marriage must be first. If your spouse does not think they are being put first, then you are not putting them first. That sounds hard, but it's the truth. What would it mean if you have to convince your spouse that you are their first love? It would mean that you have done something to them to demonstrate to them that you are indeed not their first love. There has been someone or something else invited into the marriage and the person who feels rejected is just drifting into the background. You will not be able to have a great marriage if this is going on.The Kellers also write about loving the other, and this in two chapters with Tim writing one first and his wife writing one on being a wife in the relationship. Tim writes about the power to transform, pointing out that he never really felt manly until he married. This is something I can relate to. I never did either, but now that I have a wife, I can fully delight in the masculinity that I do possess. This is also another reason why the sexual component means so much. It is the loudest way that a wife can scream to her husband ""You are my man."" The rest of the world may look at me and see nothing special, but if Allie is looking at me and saying I am her man and her rock and the one she turns to, then I'm ready to conquer the world at that point.Keller also writes to never withhold the primary love language. This goes both ways. A wife should not use sex as a weapon, such as punishing her husband by withholding herself when she doesn't get her way. On the other hand, the husbands can often be quite guilty of this when they give the silent treatment.The Kellers also have a chapter on the single life and marriage. It's important to realize that if you are single, you are not looking for another Jesus. Your spouse is not supposed to be your savior. That is expecting too much of them. It is tempting to put your spouse in the place of God, but that is a recipe for disaster. Your spouse will not solve all the problems in your life. In fact, your spouse will quite often cause all new problems in your life.The last chapter is on sex, and I think this is the way to go. OF course, this is the chapter most of us men want to skip ahead to, but we need to know all about marriage before we get to one of the greatest fruits of marriage. The Kellers write that sex is a covenant making activity. There's a reason why in the bedroom, you will often get the greatest cries of love and passion. It is a passionate time and each person is practically under a spell. Earlier in the book, the Kellers write that it doesn't necessarily start out this way. The Kellers write they were virgins when they married and the first time was frustrating, but like any other skill, it improves over the years. One of the greatest ways to improve it is to focus not on your happiness but on that of your spouse. Don't try to perform. Just love one another. If you love one another, then there will definitely be times in enjoying that sex that you will indeed rock each other's world.Finally, sex is enjoyable not because it just includes awesome and incredible physical sensations, but because it reflects to the Trinity and the delight that our soul will have before God. Sex is often the closest we get to a moment of true ecstasy and an out-of-body experience in this life. (Is it any wonder some have even said that sex could be used as a proof that God exists?)In conclusion, I highly recommend this book by the Kellers. I suspect I will be going through it again sometime, this time with my wife.In Christ,Nick Peters"
"This book had so much substance and wisdom that it's hard to break it down into a cogent list of key points. My hunch is that married people would share that assessment, but since I can only speculate on that, here are some of the things I appreciated as a single reader.There are a lot of books about dating and relationships out there (the more of which you've probably read, the older you are), but not a lot of them are focused on what it is you're aiming at: the marriage relationship. I've had the good fortune to grow up in a family with several long-term, healthy marriages (parents 34 years, two sets of aunts and uncles nearly 50 years, grandparents more than 70 years and still going), so a lot of what Keller says about the nature of marriage made intuitive sense, but I can't remember the last time I heard someone articulate it so clearly.In particular, their stress on the importance of friendship struck me as one of the book's more radical themes, and something that could have powerful implications for how singles approach dating and potential partners. This perspective dovetails very well with John Van Epp's advice in ""

  
How to Avoid Marrying a Jerk - The Foolproof Way to Follow Your Heart Without Losing Your Mind)









  
  
    
  ,"" about the variety of settings in which one should get to know a potential partner. Yet, as Keller notes (I believe, in an endnote on cohabitation), the typical structure of dating these days doesn't always provide many opportunities to share day-to-day type experiences with someone and observe how they handle mundane challenges.I also found the discussion of sex refreshing, though some may be disappointed by the largely principial, abstract nature of that chapter. It was so wonderful to hear someone say, flat out, ""Sex is for whole-life self-giving."" I've written about this elsewhere, albeit somewhat speculatively, but the Kellers do a very nice job of balancing the biblical sex ethic's implications for both the boundaries and ethos of sex.A final remark: even if you're not usually one who reads the endnotes in books, they're worth taking note of here. Several times I found a very significant point or observation -- even a multi-paragraph critique of Jennifer Knust's book ""Unprotected Texts."" It's well worth keeping the book cover's back flap in the endnotes as you read.This is a book I will recommend to many friends (and frequently, alongside Van Epp's book when talking to fellow singles), and which I imagine will hold up well over the years. Highly recommended."
"In recently preparing for a seminar on ‚ÄúSex, Love, and Marriage‚Äù to be attended by youth and young adults, a colleague recommended Tim Keller‚Äôs The Meaning of Marriage to me. As I read it, I felt quite thankful that the author, a Presbyterian minister, approached relationships both practically and theologically in the same way as I try to share about it. The Meaning of Marriage is packed with devotional thoughts and theological insights with regard to relationships, just as I expected it to be, but it was also full of unexpected insights. For example, in the very first chapter, he cited, ‚ÄúA 1992 study of retirement data shows that individuals who were continuously married had 75 percent more wealth at retirement than those who never married or who divorced and did not remarry.‚Äù (p. 16)Another aspect that I particularly appreciated was Keller‚Äôs debunking of the romantic idea of ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù He perceives this quest for the romantic ‚Äúsoul mate‚Äù as meaning, ‚ÄúToday we are looking for someone who accepts us as we are and fulfills our desires, and this creates an unrealistic set of expectations that frustrates both the searchers and the searched for.‚Äù (p. 25) He goes on to suggest, ‚ÄúThe new conception of marriage‚Äîas self-realization has put us in a position of wanting too much out of marriage and yet not nearly enough‚Äî‚Äú (p. 26). It‚Äôs comments like these that often evoke accusatory questions like, ‚ÄúWhat kind of minister are you?‚Äù We‚Äôre supposed to have all the positive things to say about relationships, not the realistic and skeptical ones. Yet, Keller is quite realistic in his counsel provided in this book.From a theological perspective, he particularly skewers this search for the ideal partner‚Äîdrawing from the Genesis 2 verse about cleaving to one‚Äôs spouse and the Ephesians and Philippians examples of Christ giving everything. He concludes: ‚ÄúThe Christian teaching does not offer a choice between fulfillment and sacrifice but rather mutual fulfillment through mutual sacrifice.‚Äù (p. 39) Again, ‚Äú‚Ä¶the picture of marriage given here is not of two needy people, unsure of their own value and purpose, finding their significance and meaning in one another‚Äôs arms. If you add two vacuums to each other, you only get a bigger and stronger vacuum, a giant sucking sound. Rather, Paul assumes that each spouse already has settled the big questions of life‚Äîwhy they were made by God and who they are in Christ.‚Äù (p. 44)Of course, a thinking person rarely likes everything in a book. I have a particular problem with the assertion in nearly every book from The Purpose-Driven Life to Keller‚Äôs The Meaning of Marriage that the primary purpose of human life is to worship God (p. 51 in this book). That may be true in the broader sense of worship being a recognition of God‚Äôs presence and activity in every facet of life, but since most people presuppose worship to be primarily praise and adoration, that doesn‚Äôt really cut it. It makes God sound ‚Äúneedy‚Äù rather than ‚Äúgenerous.‚Äù Rather, I contend that when humans are proclaimed to be made in the image of God that this means humans are junior partners in creating and sustaining with God. Living life to the glory of God involves partaking in God‚Äôs agenda and not confusing God‚Äôs agenda with our ‚Äúshopping list.‚Äù I guess I‚Äôm afraid that proclaiming the primary responsibility of humanity is to worship misses the totality of living life in partnership with God rather than being part of a greater unity.But, back to the positives. I loved Keller‚Äôs discussion of the ‚Äúfear of the Lord.‚Äù He is one of the few contemporary pastors that explains it as I do. ‚Äú‚ÄôFear‚Äô in the Bible means to be overwhelmed, to be controlled by something. To fear the Lord is to be overwhelmed with wonder before the greatness of God and his love. It means that, because of his bright holiness and magnificent love, you find him ‚Äòfearfully beautiful.‚Äô That is why the more we experience God‚Äôs grace and forgiveness, the more we experience a trembling awe and wonder before the greatness of all that he is and has done for us.‚Äù (p. 60) Sadly for me, that is clearer than I personally have explained it. What does it have to do with marriage and relationships? It is part of Keller‚Äôs fine discussion about how the believer‚Äôs relationship with God powers those important relationships of family, marriage, and church.Keller also does a great job of talking about the socio-economic problem of contemporary western attitudes toward marriage. ‚ÄúSociologists argue that in contemporary Western society, the marketplace has become so dominant that the consumer model increasingly characterizes most relationships that historically were covenantal, including marriage. Today we stay connected to people only as long as they are meeting our particular needs at an acceptable cost to us. When we cease to make a profit‚Äîthat is, when the relationship appears to require more love and affirmation from us than we are getting back‚Äîthen we ‚Äòcut our losses‚Äô and drop the relationship.‚Äù (p. 73) Then, Keller cites the idea of a marriage covenant from Malachi 2:14, Ezekiel 16:8, and Proverbs 2:17. Hence, he can note, ‚ÄúLove needs a framework of binding obligation to make it fully what it should be. A covenant relationship is not just intimate despite being legal. It is a relationship that is more intimate because it is legal.‚Äù (p. 77)This review has focused on theological aspects of marriage, but Keller offers insights on dating, courtship, personality differences, and sex that are very useful both for those contemplating marriage and those trying to make it work to its fullest. Frankly, this is the best book on marriage that I‚Äôve read since my seminary days and that means it gets my highest recommendation."
"As a single, this book is so beneficial! The way that Keller defines love and self sacrifice is something that all sing!3rd need to think about before heading into a relationship."
Great book. Would recommend it highly.
After 39+ years of marriage my wife and I read this and both agreed that we wished we had read it 39 years ago!
Everyone needs to read this.
"Wow, so much great information, great view points, really helps you think differently."
Good
"It was a good idea from Tim Keller to write a book on a subject which can cause so much distress and joy in our lives. It is a typical Tim Keller book: Easy accesible and putting the emphasis on the right spot. I should have read it earlier. The only improvement would be to reduce the size to about 50%. There are many duplications, however, I am afraid that we have to live with the fact that this is close to impossible for a minister."
"Fantastic, and enlightening....spells out clearly why marriage is so commonly broken apart.Great wisdom if you want to truly understand what a marriage covenant involves.A must read for anyone struggling in their marriage relationship or looking to gain understanding"
"After reading this, recommending it to a few friends and discussing it with them, we think this is one of the best books you can get as a primer on what Christian marriage is. I'm currently single and seeking to get married and it articulates a lot of my frustrations with modern American culture in regard to marriage and offers a number of encouraging and practical ways to be at peace in my station."
"As a pastor and husband of almost 10 years, I wish I would have read this book 15 years ago. This is arguably the best book on marriage I have ever read. Pastor Keller blends practicality and applies Scripture and the gospel perfectly as he looks at God's intent for marriage. Recommend for singles, engaged, newly weds, and those married for 50 years!"
This book is incredible. I really enjoyed reading it. Already married and wish I had read it a long time ago.
We love reading this together and getting an eternal look at the meaning of marriage.
My favorite marriage book to date...and I've read about 6 so far. Love everything about it. People really do set the bar both too high and too low in their expectations of marriage. This is a must read.
A must read
very insightful and taught me a lot about Christ centered marriage.
"Solid foundation for marriage (and dating, or pre-dating); have read several times myself and gifted to singles and engaged couples."
This book was an amazing testament to what marriage is supposed to be.  WhenYou put God first you can truly have the joy and love within the covenant that isMarriage. It also addresses what you should look for in a spouse to ensureSuccess.  There is no shame in being single either.  A real learning experience.
"First off, I'm not married but I wanted to gain a biblical perspective on what marriage could look like. Keller drew most of his insight from the famous marriage passage in Ephesians 5. One of the main points I drew from the book is that marriage is supposed to produce ""profound character change through deep friendship."" The basis of a marriage cannot primarily be physical attraction but rather an attraction to who a person is internally and who you see that person becoming. He likens looking for a spouse to a sculptor looking for a beautiful piece of marble; the sculptor isn't looking for a finished product but rather someone who has the potential to change deeply. He gave a fascinating illustration of how a potential mate is like a mountain in Wales, the rain and clouds often cover up the mountain and its splendor is hidden from view but every so often, the clouds are peeled back and you see the snow laden, towering peaks can be seen.Keller describes marriage as a sort of molding process that the married couple both partake in to push one another to be more like Jesus. It's a radically different idea than what our culture puts forward; that marriage is primarily about self gratification or a transcendental sexual experiences. Overall Keller puts forward a lofty view of marriage, but one that could be attainable through the working of the Holy Spirit."
"This is an awesome book on marriage. For any amount of years married from many to newly married. Both husband and wife share their thoughts, mistakes, victories etc. It really helps to hear from both the make and female perspective. I highly recommend."
I can't recommend this enough. Opened my eyes to a whole new perspective on marriage.
"if you want to gain more insight into the backdrop of the new testament, especially those mysterious teachings that seem to come from out of nowhere, the book of 1 enoch is the answer.  suppressed for centuries, it is the indispensable text for those who are not afraid to ask and search for the answers to: ""from where did jeshua (jesus) borrow so many of his sayings?""  here is an answer."
"It bridges the gap between the terms ""serpent"" and ""dragon"".  This is an accessory to the Talmud.  It is obviously used as a reference for such works of fiction such as The Wheel of Time and Many Waters.  This is the version that has Michael and Sammael described.  I have tried the Complete Edition and the Book of Giants and they are of little interest.  The good stuff on the Dragon, the Serpent, Satan, as well as the angels from Paradise Lost, the Book of Revelations, and Faust are in this edition."
"This is written in plain English and easy to read and understand. He explains where his information came from and how all of the source material connects.  The story itself was easy to read. This is all the books of Enouch in their entirety. Others claim it, but this is the only one that I have found to be true."
This book was common knowledge at the time of Jesus Christ and a full copy of it was found with the Dead Sea Scrolls.
"The diverse information.  It was not a one sided ""tale"", but a compilation of sources from reliable writings.  I also appreciate the authors honesty at the end giving the reader a chance to judge the information on it's  perceived merits."
"I have just started the book and what I find interesting is that right away I could see that what I was reading was helping to pull together a lot of what I 'd read in my bible but had not completely understood.  I believe the original council that formed our bible really should have included The Book of Enoch I think it deserved much more attention than it got.  If you want to get a better understanding of our current bible, read Enoch. Works for me!"
This book contains to lost scrolls of the Bible & actually the book of Enoch was removed for the Bible by the Catholic church ....It's a book pertaining the fallen Angels who mated with earthly women & giant were born from them. A must read for those who wants to understand the Bible & cross references indicated in this book.
"I got this book hoping for God to enlighten me on all the hide secrets...  It was more than I bargained for and I am still learning in Christ, but this book and all the books within it gave me understanding and I was looking for that and I got it!!!  I have shared some passages with family and friends and I always have something new to learn from sharing my knowledge of Enoch..."
"The Amazon ad indicates that this book has LOTS of Commentary. This would be TRUE IF one considers bible references Commentary. Very, very, very, very, very little commentary. Actually, if you placed all the Commentary all together it wouldn't even cover 3 pages by themselves. Very disappointed. Another wasted $15."
Awesome book....really put a lot of the puzzle pieces together for me.  I highly recommend it to anyone 'sincerely seeking'....you will find the answers to the questions you could not put into words.
I was always curious as to how some things such as demons came about since its not in the bible. This book explains alot. Im not sure how factual it is since thats up for debate. But im enjoying it.
"This Is A Must Read!!! Very happy I bought this, it answered many ? Buy it, you'll be glad you did. [ASIN:1936533073 The Books of Enoch: The Angels, The Watchers and The Nephilim: (With Extensive Commentary on the Three Books of Enoch, the Fallen Angels, the Calendar of Enoch, and Daniel's Prophecy)]"
I like how the book references the bible al9ng with this book to show that it is indeed missing out of the bible. alot makes so much more sense now.
"Ever wondered why we have a record of mythology and the ""gods"" from ancient cultures?  The Book of Enoch which was held sacred to early Christian scholars and the Apostles and explains the fall of the angels, the nephilim, and why there was a worldwide flood.  It is also a warning according to Jude to this present generation not to commit the sins that they did which brought judgement.  A must read for all serious Bible scholars.  This book has numerous alliterations to the canon of scripture we hold today to back up the authenticity of the Book of Enoch's claims."
"I made a mistake, the order was delivered and all was good with the order, this order was for my daughter and she likes the item very much. great price and delivery time was spot on. Sorry about the confusion."
These lost books of the Bible are definetly worth the read since some of them are mentioned in the Bible as reference books.  Loved it.
Paperback book is easy to read. Very interesting.  The lettering is a good size so it doesn't stran your eyes. I highly recommend reading it. I recieved it on time.
A very thourough examination of the lost books. I believe all people of the cloth would benifit from owning and regularly referring to this book as well as others. The lost books really do shed light on the bible and draws a clearer picture of events of creation and beyond. This book is an exiciting and  interesting read and I will definitely recomend it to others.
"It's a well researched and really good insight on some of the behind the scenes events that validate the Bible.  If you love the Bible, this book is for you to validate what you believe in.  Nothing in the Book of Enoch contradicts the Holy scriptures and it actually accentuates it as well."
The book of Enoch. A book of great controversy. Hey book The Church did not want to include in the Bible. All about fallen angels in their evil exploits. this is a long sometimes tedious read in my opinion.
MAYBE A LITTLE EXTRA BIBLICAL BUT I BOUGHT TO READ IT!!!
Excellent description of what happened in early history.
Gift recipient more then satisfied with the product.
If you are a student of  Judaic / Christian studies it is well worth reading
"What a great read. Believers or not, this will make you question many things."
I got rid of this book. The first book is great. The rest of the book leads you on a different path which isn‚Äôt knowledge nor Jesus Christ.
"I‚Äôm currently reading the book, haven‚Äôt finished it yet, but this book provides a lot of information, you really have to have an open mind in understanding this book, and a passion for it. Good book so far."
I liked the format of the book. It inserted various extra biblical texts in chronological sequence for a different type of read.
"A difficult read for me, but the author has done a great job of helping, with explanations of the events and backgrounds for the words and meanings that, at times, are very elusive  Very difficult subject matter that has been covered and explained superbly.."
"An absolutely amazing book. I had been curious about these books for a while, now they are all in one binding. It is a great little gem and shines a great light on the Christian fruit punch that's been forced down the throats of so many of us. Very enlightening, if your mind is open."
The first book of Enoch is great but the rest of the book is mythologidal and weird
Haven‚Äôt finish it Yet but so far so good thanks it‚Äôs very interesting love it as I have always been interested in the Bible angels and such things.
Great Book. Very interesting.
It is brand new and it has the context I expected.
It was very interesting to finally read Enoch. I love that this book gives all 3 versions with context so you know important info about each.
I love reading this book and its different from the Holy Bible
The commentary proved helpful in the history and timeline of writings. The views offered are fact/information based and presented with honesty and integrity.
I am very happy to have these texts in my collection!  Would recommend to anyone who collects scriptural writings.
Enoch among other books were removed from the Bible.  If you read it you will learn why and learn you have been lied to about why it was removed from the Bible.  This is worth checking out.
I liked it very much.
Exactly what I expected. Arrived on time and great price.
"Wow, I was impressed with every chapter."
about our spiritual history but had no idea about. How great is God and how He loves us more than we know
It Was Exactly Like The Seller Said It Would Be.!
Extremely informative. The commentary heightens the level and depth of comparative study with other texts such as the canonized bible. Promotes questionable practices of early church canonization
Very good book to read I enjoyed it so much that I loaned it out and the person that read it after me enjoyed it too.
Extremely informative! Great for any Bible studies!
"Interesting read, considering it was referenced by James, it is worth the time to see whats inside."
I found this to be really interesting and throughly researched.  It is being presented in an easy  understandable way and give one a backgroynd perspective to todays Bible
interesting reading
Good read
Exactly what I wanted. Good size font. Easy to read. Great book.
Highly recommend.
very interesting reading and understand ancient beliefs about fallen angels in the days of Noah.this text should be studied along with the Bible.
Very good reading
Very Good!
Intrigued
Love the book! It helps understand the  Ancient world in the Old Testament
Well laid out and cross referenced. It‚Äôs a must read if you are doing a thorough understanding of all the books in the Bible as well as those that were not chosen
Very interesting
"I have not completed the book as yet. But I have read some enlightening things, which help to explain the Bible more fully."
"Fantastic Book.  Apparently, one of the reasons it was not included in the Bible was that it wasn't discovered until after the Bible was compiled.  Opened my eyes to a lot of things."
Half way through. Good read so far
A wonderful addition to my library.....
Loved this version. Lots of information.
A book everyone should read
"GREAT BOOK very good information, should have been put in the Bible."
Great read for opening your eyes to truth and what is not truth. It really made me think and investigate further.
This book was amazing and it fills in a lot of gaps left for questions in Genesis.
"I learned things in this book that I had never known existed.  I was stunned by the ancient Nephilims, (Giants), who were the offspring of human women and the fallen angels, or possibly aliens.  I hope there really was an Enoch, because he was an incredible person.  He was the seventh generation up from Adam.  He is mentioned a few times in the Bible, and a book of Enoch was in the Bible at one time, but was removed.  There is another book by Joseph Lumpkin called ""The Lost Book of Enoch"" that I think should be read before this one.  I have  both of them."
Enjoyed reading this book. Was very helpful to have all three versions and other commentaries that add historical context all in one place. VERY interesting read and offers a lot of food for thought.
Ordered the book for my husband and he is re-reading it for the second time.  Thoroughly enjoyable reading and will be looking for more books along the same lines.
Wonderful!
It's a real good read. This book gives you a more detailed understanding on how the earth operates. It also goes into detail on what's not written in Genesis about the fallen angels and the offsping. It also gives you an idea of who Enoch is.
MOST Insightful & Revealing religious book I have ever read.
This item is as pictured and works fantastically.
Good read
It took me a good while to read this book. I know at some time I will read it again. I found the book fascinating.  Some parts were a bit difficult to follow but still worth the reading.
havent read it all do believe in 3 books of Enoch I have so many books to read now I have to wait on this one
A very useful text for new and old biblical scholars alike. A must read for folk that are born again or have found Christmas.
Perfect for bedtime. Easy-to-Read even with preschoolers.
Read this to my kid every night before putting her to bed. It has short chapters and it‚Äôs easy for my 6 year old to understand.
The pages wear golden on the outsides. Beautiful. I bought this as a gift and it was such a beautiful gift to give. I would definitely order this again. Thank you!
the book is great. the delivery method was horrible. the person crammed the book in the mailbox after the rain. the book is salvageable. it just needs to dry out.
"We absolutely love this book!! However, it seems to be used. Scratches all over it and something sticky that I scratched off in3 places. GROSS! Pages are good but can‚Äôt give it as a gift in this condition. Bummed"
"This book was in great condition, and my great-nieces will enjoy hearing and reading these bible stories that are so important for them to know, especially now at their age, and I'm sure they'll remember them throughout their youth."
"This book is so threatening and scary!! I can't believe it is described as being inspirational for ""Children"" to enjoy!!! Scare your Children away from God!!"
Love to read to my daughter!
My son loves his book
The paper & print quality is good with nice hardcover.
simply good.

  ¬†I love the beautiful pages! It‚Äôs perfect for my eight and nine year old kids. Lots of great helpful tools inside that‚Äôs going to really get them to read their bible more! We are thrilled!"
"This is really the best Bible for kids, my son is always reading all the little hints and insights and learning so much"
"The material is of excellent quality, but the person who made the delivery left the box outside the door on a torrential rainy day without proper plastic protection. The box was completely destroyed and the bibles completely soaked.Is there any way to fix this problem? I can not deliver the product to children in the church as a gift under these conditions"
Love this little book. Great for children‚Äôs stories!
"Kids like this version, and it is not too much in way of distracting.  Page quality is nice."
Great reading for a school student. Great pictures and very informative. My grandson couldn't put it down. Thank you.
I like this version of the bible. It has started a couple conversations with my grand daughter and I.  Thank you.
Perfect kid bible!
My son and I read most nights and he loves reading the little special features it has throughout to help explain things. Great version for young readers/listeners.
Can't review this gave it to a boy 10 years old.
I bought for my grandson.  He loved it.
Son loves this Bible
"Bought this for my 3 1/2 year old who is really starting to show interest in reading the Bible. It is very fun, and visual. Great step up from your typical ‚ÄúBaby‚Äôs first Bible‚Äù."
Very nice.
Great for kids
My daughter needed this Bible for school and I'm so glad we got it. It shipped quickly and was in great shape when it came. The pictures and little lessons throughout it are great too and she is excited to use it. She'll be using it for years!
My 7 yr old loves this Bible. She reads it with her daddy and loves all the little side notes and photos on each page.
This is an awesome Bible. Easy for my kids to navigate and read. Very great quality too.
Good value for the money. Thanks!
Great for my 12 yr. old.
Agood way to start young children out in learning how to read the Bible
ok
Great Bible.
"This is just what the granddaughter wanted, she wanted the same wording that her Sunday school teacher was using to teach with"
My son loves it.
the shipping time was great.
my daughter uses this bible in school and loves that version
I love itVery easy to read .
Fantastic child's Bible!
This book is awesome for kids
"I love how Mr. Wilson shared his life story so that we can see the entire journey. I disagree with this book being geared solely towards men. When reading the book and visualizing the traumatized male, I also saw myself in that character as an equally traumatized female. My journey may have been different, but the outcome was the same. To relegate this refreshing read to males is doing a disservice to this piece. This book is timely and needed and beneficial to all that read it."
"This zine is absolutely phenomenal. As someone who identifies as queer, it is difficult to find queer art that resonates with my soul quite like these poems and art pieces. The language used is both stunning and raw, a very clear portrait of a consciousness that has been through much, and is still so passionate. My particular favorite is the one about stars (I nearly cried). Anywho, seeing this work by Left at London, I am genuinely excited to see what comes next."
"I got my first taste of this book in a Christian devotional, and it really hit home for me so I had to buy the book. It was written from a different perspective than my life, but the underlying theme was the same. One man trying to get through this life with all its challenges and heartaches and keep GOD first. It reminds you that we all are on the same journey. No matter what your background, we all have to walk this road."
"Though this book is written for men in mind, as a woman, his story concerning emotional incarceration really resonated with me and helped me through my own healing process in a lot of ways.I appreciate Jason‚Äôs vulnerability in sharing his journey. Considering his perspective as a black man it opened my own perspective concerning the men in my life - my father, brothers, husband etc. and how they have similar experiences. Cry Like A Man feels like a key to better understanding and supporting them. I don‚Äôt have a son yet but I know when I do, I will be better equipped because of this story."
"What an awesome book.  I got the audio CDs after hearing Mr. Wilson on a podcast, and I'm not even finished but so inspired.  The stories and the content speak to everything that I was taught growing up, and also to everything that is wrong with what we've been taught to expect and accept.  I can't say it enough, get this book for yourself and anyone you care about.  Thank you Jason and God Bless!"
I‚Äôve been praying for my family and felt led to buy this book for my brothers. My oldest has been talking it about it so much without even realizing it. He asked me today if there was a workbook! That‚Äôs huge for a man who made it clear after chapter 1 we were never going to discuss this. The Lord is working and he‚Äôs using Mr. Wilson‚Äôs gifts and story far & wide. Thanks and amen.
"I purchased this book looking for some skills and tools for dealing with my own emotions, as a black man we tend to repress or not understand them.  What I got was an amazingly in-depth and raw exposure of emotion.  This book gave me, as a father and husband, insight to how easily my words can change the life of my child, as a husband it taught the power/responsibility I have, and it gave me a few ideas to travel when I get out of my depth.  I didn't give it 5 stars only because I was hoping for direct teachings when I purchased the book (i.e. ""Try this technique"", ""Use these points"", etc...) but overall I have already recommended this to my own father and members of a dad group within my family.  This is an amazing book all men of color should read."
"What a privilege it was for me to be able to peer into the like of Jason Wilson. I will never experience that trials he went through, but I will benefit and carry with me there lessons he has taken from everyone of them. Thank you Mr. Wilson and I look forward to reading your next book!"
"Even as a white male, the lack of a father or verbally abusive fathers also affected me, and those parts connected. I purchased physical copies of the book for my friends and family because this book moved me, and I'm eagerly excited for his new one Battle Cry. I originally heard this on audiobook."
"This is a great book about the life of the author. To read about the challenges he has faced, yet he continues forward and in the process growths his faith. It was full of laughter and tears and allows for great reflection of life. Very proud to own this book and share it with the ones around me."
A must read for young men or men of all ages.
This book is a must read for men.
Purchased to read in group. Very good read
"You may need some Kleenex while reading it...it‚Äôs an easy read, and will challenge you to be the best man you could be while growing in your EQ (emotional intelligence)"
"I'm so happy I ordered this, it was amazing in every way and really touched me. I can't wait to see what else she comes out with, I will always support in any way I can."
Great biography. The arithmetic takes you on an adventure of his life and while reading it you‚Äôll see some of you in it. Men do have duct years and there are moments in life we must let it out.
I got this for my ex who needed to get his mind right. He said he connected with the author and was very insightful.
"This is a powerful book written for men, but is an excellent read for the women who love them.I bought a hardcopy for my boyfriend and a digital copy for myself. We both love this book!! Thank you, Jason Wilson!"
All I can say is THIS is a must read and must have for any man!!!
Great book. Very insightful. Very happy that I purchased this book. Jason Wilson delivered!!
"Really good read, very transparent read this after reading wild at heart was a great follow on and the resources found in this book are great - the style is autobiographical but I believe many men can be released through this honest testimony all glory to God"
"His story, the conviction of God becoming relationship with him. The relationship with his dad,  one of disappointment to reconciliation. Deep down I desire these things more than a life of pain and anguish. Great book. Thank you for sharing your story Mr Wilson."
Opened my eyes. Great book to have and share.
Very Intriguing book excellent writer well written
Great read.
"I looooooved this book.  I did not expect it to be as autobiographical as it was.  It contains a great deal of wisdom and guidance TO men FROM a man.  The black male experience doesn't have enough of a voice in our society other than what contemporary music and the media says about it so I believe that books like this and a voice like this have never been more important.  I would love to see this book in the hands of more men.  It speaks at length about how our society has taught men what ""manliness"" or male ""power"" looks like and that it is one devoid of vulnerability and tears.  It makes the very important point that if a man doesn't learn how to cry, the bottling up of those emotions of helplessness, grief and sadness can explode into violence committed against themselves and others.  I love how this book holds space not only for young men but men of all ages to touch the innocence within themselves in a safe and powerful way.  I hope this book makes its way into the hands of many men to come."
"Unlike other titles that promise a lot, there's just a short resume of Mr. Goggins biography on the back cover. But once you start reading, you get sucked up in the his absolutely mind-blowing story of overwhelming seemingly insurmountable odds! I was deeply moved by the book and can wholeheartedly recommend it to just about anyone."
From the first page i was hooked. Written very well and from someone that doesn't read books... ever... i struggled to put this down.
A beautiful book for men. I wanted to read a chapter or two before bed and ended up reading half the book that night and finished it the next day. Many parts made me pause and cry and you will too - if you're ready.
"Amazing book, still reading it! Super recommend!"
I am going slowly with my reading as there is a lot to comprehend. Plus I have my Bible beside me as I read for reference. But I am enjoying it immensely and I have been recommending it to all my friends and family!
This book was mentioned in a sermon by Greg Laurie...it is a wonderful book...Randy Alcorn did 25 years of research for this book...It is about real people enjoying a relationship with God in Heaven.  A must read!!
"After the recent sudden loss of my husband, I was desperate to know what Heaven was like. I know my husband is there and I wanted to know as much as I could about what the Bible says about heaven. I was so impressed with Mr. Alcorn's plea at the beginning of the book: ""If you can find in the scripture where I am wrong, I want to know"". I was so impressed by his humbleness that I had to read more. I have now shared this book with hundreds of people via church and social media. I also bought a hard copy to keep in addition to my Kindle version. This is a must read for every person!!!"
Awesome book
"My husband went to heaven on November 14, 2016.  I had been struggling with the teachings that I had received about heaven.  Struggled with trying to picture my husband in heaven...it wasn't happening.  Then I read (am reading) Randy Alcorn's book:  Heaven.  It is and easy read that is filled with clarity and truth.  It is helping so much.  And, it underlines what I read in his fiction book: Dominion which I LOVED."
"My husband of 54 years went home to be Our Lord Nov. 28, 2011.  I miss him very much abd so reading this book Titled Heaven has been an extreme source of blessing to me.  It lets us know thru the Word of God what heaven is like now and what it will be like when we get there and when we once again see and be with our loved ones as well as our Saviour The Lord Jesus Christ.  This is an excellent book in every way and I recommend it to all who are going to heaven or have loved ones there already.  Lord Bless"
"I had always believed in Heaven, now I understand why. I‚Äôm not sure exactly what I thought but I really had no idea until now. It really is an eye-opening experience and very exciting to know about here and now."
"None of us have been there yet, but this is a thorough Biblical resum√© of the subject. This is, in my opinion, the best and likely the most accurate book on the subject. Well written and recommended."
"I'm on my third copy of this book because I've given the first two away, and will probably give this one away, too. Media like ""All Dogs Go to Heaven"" and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" et al give us such a twisted view of what Heaven will really be like, and it was eye-opening and life-changing to finally read the truth. This book fills me with hope for the future."
"Very encouraging book about Heaven. My Mom was studying this over and over the last two years and as she just passed on to heaven herself, I am so glad that this study helped us all with her passing. (She discussed it with us a lot)"
"I read, studied, and preached the biblical principles in this book also gave one to a terminal lady for comfort and an evangelism tool."
The author uses many Bible verses to get the point across about Heaven and Hell.  You ought to read this if you have any doubts about the truth of God's Word.
This Brook gave the reader great insight into the future heaven and renewed universe. By putting together relevant scriptures and references the author allowed the reader to form a more complete picture of what to expect in the future heaven.
"After my mother passed away 6 years ago, I became more and more curious about Heaven, where my mom was now and where I would be someday.  I am so very glad I started reading this collection on Heaven by Randy Alcorn.  Very, very good!  Bought more for family to read recently as my father is now facing his own journey soon.  These books have been a great comfort to all of us!  It's something to get excited about... Losing a loved one is so hard.  Heaven gives everything a different perspective... an eternal perspective!"
"This is a very good book on the subject of Heaven. I purchased this after a friend was widowed at a young age. It helped ease my mind and answer some questions I had. One of the interesting parts of the book is the viewpoint that animals are indeed in heaven, and that it's not just something we tell ourselves to feel better."
"Wonderful book based on sound scripture and oh, how glorious Randy shows us what it will be like when we arrive in Heaven!  I absolutely agree with these reviews that this could be (next to the Bible) the most informing, scripture based book out there.  I say this because of Randy's incredible attention to detail with the enormous exhaustive amount of scripture that he has spent, which must be a lifetime of study.  Also, he quotes a multitude of the greatest current and past teachers, authors, pastors and great Saints!"
"If you have any doubts about the Trinity, Jesus, heaven or hell you will not after reading this book."
This book follows scripture and is well written.Theological and good for a bible study.
"Wow, what a thought provoking book! I have studied more and mediated longer on God's word since reading this book. I truly can say I have a greater longing for heaven and great appreciation for redemption than ever before.o"
Using this book to visualize Heaven and have scripture to back it up.  Very well written and will hold your attention.  Would make awesome gift.
"This is the most exciting, yet probable, view of Heaven and the new earth I have ever read.  I would recommend this book to all who are concerned about their future.  The author is careful to explain the way to assure our entrance to Heaven."
"this is an excellent book on a topic we all wonder about.  It's one you can pick up and pick and choose a chapter or a topic of interest rather than sitting down and reading through the whole book even though you will eventually want to do that.  Randy Alcorn combines scripture support, deductive reasoning, examples, and a delightful humor to various areas that we wonder about.  The book is being circulated among Christian friends now for their enjoyment as well."
Great Purchase. Loved it. Would buy again if I had to.
"Slogging through the trench warfare of this earthly life, do you ever wonder if the next one will be better?  I've heard people say that if they go to hell, they'll be so busy shaking hands that they won't realize where they are for several years.  Others feel a secret dread that Heaven will be one long, exhausting church service, and many are so overwhelmed with issues of this life, that thinking about the next one takes too much energy.Heaven by Randy Alcorn shines the true light on humankind's real destiny: an exciting, creative, joy-filled eternity with Jesus who created you to live in perfect peace, safety, exciting, selfless love with Him and his family forever!Do you think of Heaven as a realm of disembodied spirits, clouds, and harp music?  C. S. Lewis thought of Heaven as having more solidity than what we now have--so does Randy Alcorn, based on his thorough exegesis of the scriptures. I liked his organization of the issues because the book can be used as a daily study guide. The chapters are thorough, but short enough to be read during your normal study time.  Mr. Alcorn tells you when he is speculating, and when the exegesis of the scriptures are according to their historic meaning.Mr. Alcorn addresses questions and issues about heaven that have stirred within human hearts for years:"
Loved the mind games this book induced. Changed my view on this present life. You‚Äôll enjoy glad you spent the time to read it
"This is one of the best books I‚Äôve ever read. The descriptions of Heaven from a biblical standpoint, are amazing."
"Randy Alcorn and those who joined his research team have given us the best possible answers they can give to our questions about Heaven.  I believe this book affords an incredible translation of Biblical Scripture.  It is not ""made up"" as many books on Heaven have been.  If one is a Christian and has read the Bible, both Old and New Testaments, one will find that everything in Randy Alcorn's ""Heaven"" is taken from the Books of the Bible and explained in layman's terms.  Of course, we will never know all answers until we get there.Great job!  Have given this book as gifts to several friends and family members."
Great book about Heaven.  Very informative thru scriptures.
Powerful well written book bringing clarity to the content and meaning of the Revelation of Jesus Christ in the Bible. Highly recommended to anyone who seeks an understanding of the end times.
"Heaven is one of the most misunderstood topics on Earth.  I wanted to know more about Heaven, especially after my father passed away.  I ordered a copy of ""Heaven"" for myself and my mother.  It brought comfort and peace to both of us and through scripture, answered our questions.Kenny Chesney sings ""Everybody wants to go to Heaven, but nobody wants to go now.""  He's not alone in this view of Heaven.  Most people think it sounds really boring. It's anything but floating around on a cloud, playing a harp for an eternity as a spirit with no purpose and nothing to do.  Contrary to popular belief, the scriptures have a lot to say about Eternity and how God's people will live -- yes live, not float around aimlessly, bored out of our minds.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wonders about the after-life, those suffering with chronic illness, those who have lost loved ones, and to those who love the outdoors and our planet.  I also recommend this book to those who think Heaven sounds boring (young and old, Christian or non-Christian)."
"I was totally amazed and my daily outlook changed forever!!! Everyone should read this book... So full of truth and hope!!! I will read this book over and over again. I thank my Pastor for recommending it! I thank Randy Alcorn for allowing God to use him to bless so many. And I look forward to meeting him on the New Earth! Most of all I thank Jesus Christ my Lord, my God and my Savior for His love and patience, His grace and mercy and His promises I cherish. When I die hallelujah bye and bye!!!!! I'll fly away!!!!!!"
"A well researched and well written book that I highly recommend to everyone.  There is much information here to absorb and so it is not the type of book you can breeze through in a few hours.  To get the most out of it I found it best to read just a portion at a time and look up scripture references, etc.  I have loaned it out several times to friends and they have loved it and tell me they learned alot of things they did not know.  Highly encouraging if you are a disciple of Christ and love Him."
"This is a must read for everyone, especially those who know Jesus as their LORD & SAVIOR. This book is such good reading! Heaven is not as it is depicted, it is even better."
"Thorough review of what God‚Äôs word says about Heaven. If there is more than a single possibility about a particular topic, Randy Alcorn points that out. Well written."
Everything in the book is based on scripture.
"Very inspiring and well written.  I love the Scripture references.  I appreciate his explaining things that are somewhat nebulous so that they make more sense!  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have  a better perspective of heaven and the hope that we have in Christ.  I don't always agree with some theories, but understand that he is only theorizing when he says ""it is possible"", and doesn't actually use a Scripture to back up his theory.It is hard to live down here without hope of a brighter, happier Heaven and Earth.  That is our goal, and the gol that Scripture states is what we are striving for while we are here...at least in part.  Mainly we want to see Jesus and be with Him and all the rest will be ""frosting on the cake"", but my hope is also to meet my favorite Gospel writer, St. John., as well as those loved ones who have passed on.  Thank you for having it available.Linnie Robinson"
"This is the best scripturally based book I've read on the subject of heaven.  I jumped around in the book a lot curious for answers to a lot of questions we all ask.  I am now getting into the real nitty gritty of the book.  This book has actually changed me and my attitude about life.  I am more positive about everything, more anxious to share Jesus with others, and soooooooooooo looking forward to our final home.  It will be AMAZING!  Like most people, I never really thought about the fact that we will be right here on a new and improved earth, with jobs, homes, friends, maybe even sports, perfection in every way and asking Jesus personally all the things we want to know.  Can't wait for the angels to tell me all the times they stepped in and protected me and my family. I know there were a lot.  This is a must read!"
"I just finished Randy's book last night 25Jan 2018.  It is critical that each reader enters this book with somewhat of a warning.  There are many, many reviews that denounce this book and Randy and they all quit around midway through the book saying that he uses too much of his imagination and that they can't take him seriously etc. etc.SO.... they quit.  What a travesty that they quit.  Seriously, no one is likely to quit reading C S Lewis because he used fantasy to paint portrayed biblical truth!  But, if you will allow a suggestion i would ask you to read this book from beginning to pp225.  Read slowly and allow yourself to think and pray.  Then turn to chapter 45 and read the last 18  pages.  You have to get the foundation from Part 1.  Then you can collect the solid gold in the last two chapters.  The Spirit chin of God comes screaming through in those two last chapters.  Please don't cast this work aside because it takes effort...  Give God's Spirit a chance to reach you where your need is.  God bless you as you read!PS:  I don't know Randy in bbq person just yet...  Some day I will!!!"
This book is so exciting you won't want to put it down. Heaven is a real place and Randy explains what heaven will be like for God's children. It's so fantastic that I gave a copy to my family members. This is the best book I've read on heaven yet.
"An excellent book.  I learned so much about Heaven that I had just never thought about.  I loved his novels that are wonderful even if you are not ""religious"" but if you are hungry for ""the truth of the Bible"" this will teach you a lot."
"Oh yes, this book is a wonderful read from a man that has obviously researched the word of God, and gleaned from it the insight and revelations of what God has waiting for the one that makes it into eternal life.  It certainly makes sense to me.Religion has failed to search these things out and I believe that Randy Alcorn's timing of ""Heaven"" is ""Divine Providence,"" since we are very close to the end of this dispensation, and will soon ""see for ourselves."""
At the age of 93.  I read about what my heavenly home would be like. I read about this book in the magazine Modern Maturity.  I have just completed it and because Mr. Alcore so fully documented it scriptural and so beautifully written it thrillsmy heart to know soon I will be seeing it all.
If you have ever wondered what Heaven might be like or what redeemed man and a redeemed universe might be like this book is for you. Great book!
This is a must read in your collection!!
"This is the 2nd or 3rd time I have purchased this book, in either hard bound book or in Kindle form.  I cannot say enough good about it.  Randy Alcorn knows his Scriptures, and pieces them together for us, so we can get a whole new picture of Heaven!  I want to know as much as I can, since I am spending eternity there!  So glad to know we will be productive in heaven, not sitting on a cloud, singing for all eternity!  Get this book, you will NOT be disappointed!"
Great book and great content. Recommend Reading for everyone.
"I haven't read it all the way through, but it really makes you have wonderful thoughts about the possibilities of how heaven is and what is happening there. I have loved ones that are there and it gives me comfort in some of the thoughts revealed by the author."
"Whenever I'm going to go someplace new, I like to know where I am going.Randy's book on heaven is informative - and exciting!!!Any one who is interested in facts (rather than fiction) should read this.A mystery partially revealed - all based on Biblical text.Excellent!  one worth re-reading - which is what I'm going to do."
"This is the most exciting book I've read in years!  I've already recommended it to everyone I care about and bought it for many of them, because it's a great, uplifting read.  Randy Alcorn has spent years researching heaven, and by his own admission has read every book on the subject.  He is a biblical scholar who has managed to sort through all of the facts and nuances of scripture and present them in organized, understandable thought sequences.  The information he has gleaned is the most fascinating I've read in my life.  I also recommend this book to non-Christians, as the orderly question/answer-based format allows for everyone to gain information on what to expect in eternity. There are surprises for all, even those who have studied the Bible all of their lives. Best of all, reading this book adds much to our life now by putting things into proper perspective.  And it is exciting to anticipate the things we will see and do, many that we currently enjoy - just without the negatives.  If you're too busy to read, this book can easily be read in small segments without losing the thought process its contents generate."
A must have...bought other books by the authorNow!
I added this to my personal library.  I have purchased multiple copies but have given them away!
"Every Christian Should read this Book called ""Heaven'by Randy Alcorn.It is the place we desire and aspire to go to...and yetwe know next to nothing about it. It is the place wherewe will spend Eternity and yet we don't even know thetrue location of it or what we will be doing there. Whenmost Christians are asked what they think it will be like?...they don't know and they aren't even sure that  really wantto go there because they have a feeling that they will bebored there. Yet they know they are pretty certain that theywould rather be there with Jesus than in Hell with Satanin Eternal Torment.Please do yourself a huge favor and buy and read this book...because it will change your life, your perspective and yourthinking about Heaven and what you have to look forward to.And it's not sitting around on big fluffy clouds playing a harp all dayor standing before God day and night singing Holy Holy Holy is theLamb...even though He is!  So, what do you have to lose? Nothing!But what you have to gain will change your life forever.Always Happy to Review Good Reads for Book Lovers Everywhere,PeggyAnn Smith/Lady In Red"
"Very few books are written on the subject of Heaven and even fewer give a biblically supported complte review of the subject.  Randy Alcorn's book is the most complete work available on the subject of Heaven. This book answers questions, fills in gaps, and is a perfect purchase for a friend or relative working through the grief process in the loss of a believer. I very highly recommend this book."
Very disappointed in how often the author refers to his other works. A terrible case of self-promotion that runs throughout this book.
"This book has changed how I think about Heaven!  I was glad to be on my way to Heaven before, but now I'm so excited!!  I can hardly wait to get there!!!  It is so vivid and alive in my imagination now, and I know it is going to be so much more than we can imagine or expect!!  Hallelujah, I'm Heaven-bound!!! :D"
"A great book!  There are som many illustration that it gets somewhat tiring just reading, but it is great."
I bought this book shortly after my daughter passed away. When your children move away you want to know all about where they moved to. It was a comfort to me and it is now my go to gift for anyone I know who has lost a loved one.
"This is one of the most informative books I've read on the subject. It is easy to read and understand. It's based on Scripture and if there is any speculation on the author's part, he clearly states it. It clears up so many false doctrines on heaven, including the false claims in the latest book and movie ""Heaven in For Real."" I am recommending this to all my Christian brothers and sisters!"
Gave food a great texture.
"Great book for those who want to stir their spiritual imagination on "" the Word of God "" basis ..."
Extensive and scriptural.
"There are many different reasons why people want to go to heaven, whether it be to get away from pain and problems or to enjoy the many blessings of heaven, but it's usually about wanting to be happier in some way for our own sake. When you realize that it's so much more than that it really gets exciting, when you realize what it will mean to be with God face to face."
"Oh my goodness, I love this book!!  In our misguided concerns for ""saintliness"" we have painted heaven to be such a ""vanilla,"" bland place of stilted and dull monkish inhabitants.  This book has awakened in me such an amazing glimpse of what heaven and the renewed earth will be!!  I sit here listening to the Audible version from my Echo and just feel myself wrong up over and over again with the anticipation of a much more lively and fulfilling life after this one that I am so excited and couldn't help but as my review.When I was a child, a well-meaning pastors wife taught us about such a bland heaven that I really was not at all looking forward to it. Later, in my 30's I read a book titled ""Visions Beyond the Veil"" that have me reason to hope for more.This book has based those impressions on Scripture and given me a secure basis for my faith in a heaven of unlimited beauty, love, opportunity, and creativity.  Though I had a basic understanding of this, his deep and imaginative descriptions have opened up my conception as one stepping forth from a prison cell into the vast open spaces of the wilderness.Oh, that all Christians would read this book. I believe it would so enliven their excitement and joy in their salvation that their witness to this dark and sad world would become so much more powerful and positive!!I have to say it again, I Love This book!!!"
Easy to read
"Not only have I read through this book,  I gave my book away, only to purchase another, I have done this more than once.  I now have a copy by my bedside and open it to where it may, I read a portion on the page and it blesses my soul.Thank you Randy Alcorn, for your faithfulness to our GOD and our Salvation.  This book has changed the way I view my humanity and how I live my life.  Heaven,  my future home.  The Kingdom of Heaven now and forever!"
"An in-depth Biblical review of Heaven, relating its importance to everyday life. Highly recommended."
"Totally new way of looking at Heaven and the life after death mystery, or at least it was new to me. Very thought provoking and I am going to need time to assimilate this"
Answered a lot of questions.
Great read!
"For the biblically well-educated, HEAVEN is a book above reproach. It covers in depth, all the questions about a Christian's Eternal Home. However, if you are a beginner, you need to get one of the abridged versions of this same book for use. The other versions cover the basic points without the extras, such as opinions from biblical scholars, and references to other non-biblical sources. In fact, I really would have enjoyed the book more without those other references. The book, HEAVEN, is what I call a hard-read, because you cannot read very much at a time before taking time to assimilate all of it, and I am very well biblically educated. Choose wisely according to your own Biblical knowledge."
This book is the cutest little story book. It tells bible stories in easy to understand stories just for kids. We gave it to our granddaughter for baptism and we even liked reading the stories.
It‚Äôs a wonderful little book for any little one to read. It‚Äôs a perfect size for a child and the book is a hardcover but feels cushioned. The Bible stories is a must in any children‚Äôs library.
We ordered this for our sons's Easter basket. It's the perfect first bible to add to his library. It's much baby friendlier than the Bible stories we bought separately.
Very cute little book with padded cover. I just glanced through it as it was a gift for a baby shower.  The illustrations were very colorful.
"I bought this book for my nephews baptism and ended up also getting my 2 year old son this book! Many reviews say this book is over simplified but I disagree this is meant for a young child! I love the pictures in this book too, they‚Äôre very bright, colorful and detailed. Perfect book for around 2 years old!"
"I sent this book to my grandbaby as one of his Christmas presents from me. He takes it off the shelf and ""reads"" it aloud to himself. He has a lot of nice books, & his mom says he loves this one. She'd asked me to get this baby Bible for him so they could read it at family prayer time before he goes to bed."
"Bought this for my grandson‚Äôs First Easter.  Simply written for little ones, and beautifully illustrated.  I think he will love this book, and I know I will enjoy reading it to him!"
"Bought as a gift for my neice's baptism/dedication. This is a nice toddler-aged book, with thicker pages. Simple, short stories for her to learn.Her mother was really happy with this gift! She stated that they will use it as the preferred ""take-along toy"" for church services."

I read this book in order to get a better background of life in The Netherlands during WWII.  I prefer non-fiction because I really wanted the facts and not an embellished story.  This book had a huge impact on me.  I'm only sorry we weren't able to visit the ten Boom museum when we were in Haarlem.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this period of history.  It's a true story of a family who strived to help a population of peoples who were wrongfully treated.
"This book is life changing! Internalize it and it will revolutionize your Christianity. It‚Äôs an easy read, but so worth it! Born in Germany (army brat) visited the concentration camps. This book puts that experience to shame, and I was only 11 or 12..There‚Äôs nothing like reliving what happened, 1st hand, even if you‚Äôre just reading about it. Get the book, get the book, get the book!"
"Corrie Ten Boom's story is compelling and heart wrenching.  Every Christian should read this book, particularly in this post-Christian era when persecution is rising."
"I reread this book again after many years, since I had the chance to take my 13 year old son to Haarlem to see the Corrie Ten Boom house.  When we were there he really didnt understand what was so special about it. Now I am reading it to him aloud, and he is finally able to understand why the Ten Booms took in so many Jews and how they were able to forgive the Nazis.  For a child who basically only likes to play video games, that is saying a lot.  He even added Corrie to his list of people he admired on Facebook."
"Can't believe I taught literature for 18 years and just now read this book! It will inspire anyone with Ten Boom's courage, faith, compassion and love for her family and countrymen & women. It's a religious and spiritual experience to read this book but not in a preachy manner. I would give it 10 stars if I could."
"It's books like this that make me wonder about the human spirit. Good AND bad. With everything Corrie ten Boom and her sisters went through and the positive faith in their maker that they kept.....makes me feel guilty when I complain about the smallest thing. It makes me WANT to have a better attitude and more positive outlook on life. This woman shows more faith and spiritual conviction in the midst of trial and tragedy than I could ever imagine. God bless her soul! Thank you Corrie ten Boom, for your fine example. Rest in peace."
Corrie's story is one not soon forgotten. An incredible tale of Grace provision in the most incredibly adverse circumstances. Also a great reminder of history and the depths to which humanity can fall.
I'm captivated with reading about the haulocaust ! Everyone should know what happened during that period of time.
This book was an excellent read.  I felt as if I part of the story.  It made me think about life today.  What we go through is nothing compared what they went through.
You never know how much pain a person can go thru and come out still loving God and Mankind...
"This is a book you will read and come away changed. No matter how many time you read this book, it never fails to amaze and encourage. Facing what Corrie and her sister, Betsy, did was, for most of us unthinkable. That she survived and God blessed her life with the opportunity to share her testimony is amazing. Her growth as a woman of deep and abiding faith through all her losses is an inspiration."
"This book like many I have read about the holocaust and world war II, has given me much to think about, how no matter the circumstances we go through, God is always with us, Jesus Himself suffered some of the same as well as taking the sin of the world upon himself. It teaches about forgiveness in the face of our human inability to forgive without God's divine intervention in our hearts."
"The chronicle of Corrie ten Boom's life is a lesson in God's love. The book is not nearly as ""good"" as the details of her amazing life."
"I loved this book and it was such a rare thing in the time of the Holocaust to have love and compassion and find happiness in the midst of great horror, sorrow and death.  But Corrie Ten Boom and her sister,  Betsie, managed just to do that. It is a beautiful story that needs to be read over and over."
"This book has a wonderful true story, lots of love, faith, carrying about others, take place during wwII , specially two sisters Cornie and Bessie, and other Boom family members, faith, and much more in Amsterdam and Germany."
I loved the perspective that Betsie had and the love for God they shared. Truly touching lives and so thankful for you sharing their story
"This book although short is packed with a powerful message. Elie Wiesel was sent to the concentration camp at a very young age and survived. At age 15, his captors told him he was 18 and separated him from his mom and sisters. This book details his life in the camp as well as surviving until it was liberated. It's a hard read, but I think it is a book everyone 16 or over should read."
Inspiring story very well written about a family that sheltered Jews in WWII and paid the ultimate price. Wonderful Christian witness of faith and love.
Yes! Everyone should read this book. Corrie ten Boom was an amazing woman with a history none of us can imagine. Her ability to seek the good in others in spite of her circumstances is amazing. It's so clear she relied on her faith in God and He was faithful! Love this and absolutely encourage others to read it! We can learn a lot from others stories and how they handle life.
"NO Matter how long ago this personal story occurred, it is a life-changing read.  There are not adequate words to express the depth of inspiration to my soul.  I am 72 years old and have read many, many memoirs - how I missed this one is beyond me.  Don't let your life pass without having this experience.  .....however long I live, I will never complain again without Corrie's life as a survivor running as a video in my brain."
The best witness of one's true devotion and belief in God is through personal testimony. Corrie's testimony is truly proof of that fact!
Wonderful story of Faith and perseverance ! It's written many years ago so it was a little harder to understand than today's books . I tried to use this as a reading out loud book for my daughter and it didn't go over well. I would recommend Young Heroes of Faith to read to a child they have the Corrie Ten Boom story- however just to read to yourself this book truly is inspiring! I'm going to get her other books as well!
"I should have read this riveting work years ago!  The words of courage are ""written on my heart.""  The actions of bravery and fearlessness propelled by unconditional faith and love for Jesus Christ are almost incomprehensible to me who has only known a life of freedom.  I will be referencing ""The Hiding Place"" in presentations when I can and to whom I can from this moment forward.A powerful, powerful account of survival in an horrific time in the history of man.  ""The Hiding Place"" yet again reinforces that in the human condition of the struggle between good and unspeakable evil, faith in the Lord Jesus has brought and will continue to bring mercy and ultimately the realization of triumph of the spirit and of the soul!"
"This is how the book reads. As though you are living what Corrie wrote about: her childhood, growing up years, fears as she and her father and sister hid Jews, yet filled with the sure knowledge that what they were doing was right. And through it all her unshakable faith in God's truth and abiding love is encouraging and inspiring. Three times I've read this book, and it won't be my last."
Good
I loved this book and have read it many times. I want to learn to love as Betsie and Corrie learned and to have a faith as strong as theirs. I try very hard to show my faith by the way I live but I do feel very successful most days.
"It's amazing how Corrie was able to go through all this. It is hard to go through losing loved ones. God was able to use Corrie in an amazing way. I would recommend this book to anyone who can handle sadness. Anyone who can endure excitement, brutality, and gory things should read this book. It's a good example of how Christians are persecuted. Lord, thank you for using Corrie as an example of how you were persecuted, and how you loved us so much, you would die for us."
This is seriously the book for you if you are struggling with anything. It really helps open your eyes about being content wherever you are. I wanted this book to never end.
This book is awe inspiring.  I want to have faith and inspire people like Corrie and her sister.  An unbelievable journey and reminder that life isn't over until God says so.  We all have a purpose - we just have to open to it.
This is a very eye opening book. I had no idea that this went on in Holland. I really feel bad for what they had gone through. How awful it sounds. The details written are very well explanatory. It is well written and well worth the time I spent reading it. I would recommend it for children to read as well as adults. Their faith in Jesus was astonishing.
Incredible true story about a  Dutch family who's strong faith helped them hide Jews during WWllThey were discovered by the Nazis and sent to a concentration camp. Corrie's faith and courage sustained her during the years of hell she endured. This is one of the best books I have ever read and I have read many.
"I read The Hiding Place many, many years ago.  So when I came across this 35th Anniversary edition I was immediately drawn to purchase and read it again --- almost as if for the first time.  This story is as important now as it was then.  There are special stories that have an impact on our lives and contain elements that cannot be defined.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is ready for a chance to make a difference."
Love book
"What an incredible story. When I first started reading about the Ten Boom family members I was thinking how wise the father, Casper Ten Boom, was and how he chose his words so carefully. How Betsie was so devoted to God and the family's ministry. As were her siblings Willem,  Nollie and Corrie.It took a lot of courage to do what they did by hiding Jews in their home during the occupation.Corrie describes, in vivid detail, about her, and Betsie' s experiences at Schevenigen and Ravensbruck concentration camps. This is a story of how good can overcome such evil and how love and faith triumph over all.I highly recommend this book. It truly is life changing."
"I first read this book and heart Corrie Ten Boom speak when I was a teenager. It became a touch stone moment for me which I never forgot. Now, in these frightening political days, I re-read it to give me the courage to be faithful to God's love for all people rather than try to protect myself in the days to come."
I'm glad I got a chance to read it after reading so many quotes from her. The struggle was real and it  made me think of slavery and their struggles and how some of them went through and made it as well. Why are people so mean and feel the need to be dominant over a race of people I don't understand.
I read this book many years ago AND saw the movie too.  I ordered this for a young lady in the Philippines who had read The Diary of Ann Frank and was touched by the story.  Corrie Ten Boom's story was similar and I recommended it to her to read.
"This book was absolutely incredible and I've recommend it to people every chance I get. It is so powerful and honest. If this is somewhere in the middle of your ""to read"" list bump it up to the top! You won't regret it."
Amazing book and the pictures are fascinating! Placing a face to the story! Great great book! A must read for everyone!
"My kids needed this book for school. It's a great book that brings to light something wonderful done by a family/group of people, during a VERY DARK TIME, even though it cost them everything they knew & loved in the end.Many schools aren't even teaching about the HORRORS of the Holocaust anymore, which is FRIGHTENING that the powers that be would choose to WIPE OUT such an evil atrocity in history from curriculum... yet they push other TRASH that needn't be in schools anywhere.if you are someone who would like to educate yourself based upon TRUTH & not fill your mind with a FALSE view of history that eliminates the Holocaust atrocities, then read this book. If you are one of the Holocaust nay sayers who claim it never happened, READ this book & open your mind. Nobody would DARE say SLAVERY never happened, but they dare to say the Holocaust was MADE UP?! Take another bong hit & live in denial if you must, but don't expect the rest of the world to cow tow to your fantasy world.I WOULD purchase this again!"
"I am a richer person having read the life story of Betsey and Corrie Ten boom and their faith-filled family.Their courage, care for fellow humans and steadfast love of God is inspirational!"
"Awesoem read with my family. I have a 3rd, 7th and 9th grader...and husband. We have all enjoyed this read together, even through my tears as i read."
So poignant and truly beautifully written.  I cried tears of joy with the great miracles from God that Corrie experienced and tears of sadness for all the evil they had to endure!
This is a great book with a testimony about Jesus's greater work through the forgiveness of those that would be the hardest to forgive.
"Wonderful treatment of the Holocaust! It is touching and heart-warming---- and tragic. As the beautiful story unfolds, you dread the inevitable! You fall in love with Corrie's family and friends and the many people they risk their lives to keep safe! It is a wonderful, faith-filled story that needs to told and re-told! Young people must read this book!"
"Everyone should read this book.  It really gives you a perspective of someone who has lived through the worst of the worst and was able to have it not make them bitter, but have it make them better.  Amazing true story of a survivor of a concentration death camp when her village was invaded by the Nazi's.  Very inspirational."
"My daughter has a reading list and needed to read a book for Spring Break. I downloaded The Hiding Place for her to read on her Kindle. Since I wasn't reading anything for the moment, I started reading it. What a story. Corrie Ten Boom was an amazing woman with an amazing story to tell. I highly recommend this book for anyone, especially those interested in the Holocaust and World War II. This is a story unlike any you've read."
"It takes some time to get ""into"" this book because you already dread where it's going. But it becomes captivating and impossible to put down. Now that I've read it, it was well worth the time. Truly difficult, but as important as any book I've read."
I loved this book. I cried and felt their pain and realized how blessed I am. God is so good!!!
I am reading this book for a book discussion at my church and thoroughly enjoying it. It is a truly moving story of faith and evangelization.
Student using purchased item very well
Gifted to an avid reader who starts the day off with devotional. Nice compact book of devotional.
I bought this book for all of the ladies in my life for Mother's Day.  Great gift!  Great price!
"I love this devotional, I am able to read it every day‚Äã and take it with me, whether throwing it in my purse or the diaper bag. Great devotionals relatable to life."
Daily examples and explanations of how God hears us. Many of my clients use this and love it.
"I love this book! Perfect for a morning coffee read, uplifting and relevant to everyday life."
"I've given these as gifts to some of the women in my life.  They love it as much as I do.Inspirational, easy to read and fit into your day--"
Lovely book with a ribbon to save your place. Love the devotions. Very inspirational.
Enjoyed the daily moments with reminders of how God works in our lives through other people and their experiences and just every day living.
"Not great. The stories are strange and kind of a stretch on how they try to relate it to the devotion. I read it for a while at night with my husband and he agreed that most of them weren‚Äôt insightful and made little sense. Pretty sure his exact words were usually, ‚Äú What was that even about?‚Äù"
just to have that personal relationship with God
"I got this after seeing it on a vlog by Paige Danielle of her favorite products. I LOVE it! The perfect daily devotional, I‚Äôm very much enjoying it."
Just what I was looking for to give to my wife.
I read this every morning and I love it.
Perfect for everyday devotions! Relatable!
This was a gift.
This book is amazing. I‚Äôve been reading it since I got it and I wouldn‚Äôt trade it for the world.
Love this ! Good reads ! Good value .
Love it
I like that the devotions are short but power packed.  I can read in the morning and think about it all day.
Love it. Yet would of loved it to be KJV version.
"I applaud the women who contributed to this devotional. I have no doubt they love God and His word. However, I was unable to finish this devotional book because so many of the days were very disconnected from the biblical message. It felt like a stretch many times from the chosen verse. I was hoping for conviction, challenges, and simple truth. Instead, I got a bunch of anecdotes . Not fasehoods at a but if you want  devotional a bit deeper, look elsewhere. If you love anecdotal devotionals, this is a great devotional."
"**FTC DISCLAIMER: I RECEIVED AN E-ARC FROM NETGALLEY IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW. RECEIPT OF THIS BOOK IN THIS MANNER DOES NOT AFFECT MY OPINION OF THE BOOK OR THE CONTENT OF MY REVIEW.**I‚Äôve always enjoyed reading ‚ÄúThe Daily Bread‚Äù devotionals so I was very excited about getting to review this book since it was published by the same writers. I am really enjoying the daily lessons. They‚Äôre easy to read and there is a Bible verse for every lesson. While these lessons seem to be very simple, they really do have a lot of wisdom behind them. And they have the same feeling of encouragement that I remember from ‚ÄúThe Daily Bread‚Äù devotionals. I‚Äôm finding that starting my day with the addition of a daily message from this devotional, in addition to my Bible study, really helps me to start my day off with a better perspective. Thank you Netgalley and Our Daily Bread Ministries for allowing me the opportunity to read and review this encouraging book!"
"Comfort and joyYou will want to snuggle into your favorite chair as you read this touching 365 day devotional. God Hears Her is written for women of all ages by women.I thoroughly enjoyed these lovingly crafted words by several Christian women authors. Friend, whatever season you are in in your life, you are sure to find comfort and joy within these words.I smiled, cried, and nodded along as I read the stories these relatable, transparent women told. This devotional is written in short one page personal story form.I was touched by how charismatic these women are. I felt as though I was sitting face to face with a friend over coffee.I highly recommend this book. It is truly a treasure, one I am pleased I read. Within its pages, you will find comfort, joy, serenity, and hope. God is truly glorified within.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Net Galley and Our Daily Bread for an honest review. The opinions I have expressed are my own, and I was not required to write a positive review."
"This beautifully designed, one-year devotional journal focuses on God's attentiveness to His people. Each daily reading includes a Scripture passage reference, a key verse, and a devotional that connects the Scripture to life. The devotionals are authored by favorite Our Daily Bread writers, experienced Bible teachers, and popular Christian authors, like Elisa Morgan. Lined and blank spaces throughout the book provide ample room to record personal reflections. Black line illustrations encourage the journaler to add color and creativity to this keepsake.Each day's reading can be completed in a few minutes, making this a helpful resource, even for busy women. What an encouraging way to begin or end each day--reflecting on God's desire to hear us whenever we call to Him!An advance, digital copy of this text was provided to me at no charge in exchange for my unbiased review."
"What a wonderful way to connect with God. This daily devotional is aimed at women, but men could also gain from the readings. Each day starts with a Bible passage, which in the e-version is easier accessed by a click. The devotionals are short but thought-provoking. I have found this is a great way to start my day. However, the offerings could be read any time of the day. I will be purchasing my daughter a copy."
"""God Hears Her"" is a devotional based on the story of Hannah in the book of Samuel in the Bible. This has always been one of my favorite Bible stories growing up. These devotionals have been very timely for me with personal things I have been going through the past 3 years. So far the devotionals are very encouraging."
"An inspirational and wonderful daily devotional book for women.  Each day a Title, Bible verse, and an inspirational short story relatable to women.  For example, on April 18, 'Not Fear but Faith' Numbers 13:25-14:9.  Highly recommended for daily devotions for women of all ages."
Bought for my elderly Aunt who lives 750miles from me. She absolutely loved it.  She said it is so nice and just can't wait to start it in Jan once she finished up her other one from 2020. I say this is a must buy item.
"God Hears Her is a 365 day devotional written by women, for women. I found the bite-sized truths an excellent addition to my regular Bible plan. A great little book to toss into your bag, or gift to a friend, I recommend God Hears Her to anyone looking to supplement their daily Bible reading."
Beautiful 365 day devotional for women reminding us that God does hear our hearts. This is a wonderful devotional book to read. Its well written and easy to read.Thank you NetGalley and Our Daily Bread Publishing for letting me read this devotional. I read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book. All thoughts and opinions are of my own.
nice book
"Beautifully written and full of inspirational quotes. Very glad I bought it. Every woman should have a copy of this devotional, very helpful!"
He heard her
Use it every day and loving it so far!
Great messages for each day.
"Me entregaron el libro s√∫per maltratado, estaba empacado todo mal y por eso me lleg√≥ as√≠.. por favor tengan cuidado al empacar, son libros!!"
The book is fantastic
great book. easy to handle. i love it.
"I was experiencing some hardships in my marriage and even questioning on leaving my Husband. A friend of mine suggested this book and as I began to pray for him, I realized that I was praying for myself as well and in turn became closer to the Lord. I have now been able to see into our marriage with spritual eyes and not worldy eyes and we are much closer and the Lord is healing us both.The book is great because you are given sample prayers and sometimes we do not know what to pray or don't want to pray anything at all. The devil's goal is to break up the home in any way he can, this book enables a woman to battle with the Lord's help.I pray at least four prayers a day, even when ""all is well."" I can sense and feel the prayers working in his life. I have since purchased other books from Stormie such as ""Power of a praying husband,"" ""the power of a praying parent."" As well as making these books great gifts for other."
Stormie covers all the bases in this book of prayers for a Christian wife. It's next to my Bible so that I remember to specifically pray for my husband and our marriage.
I never read this book but I bought it a couple years ago for two married friends of mine who expressed to me some problems in their marriage.  Both had mentioned they were leaving their husbands. Around that same time someone else had told me how this book had helped their marriage so I bought it for my friends.  To this day I have never asked either if they read it but its been two years later and they are still married.  Make any inference you'd like...
we are doing this study in our women's meeting. and are learning a lot about our self and how to talk and walk in married life. I have been married 61 years this year and i'm still learning. Hope all of the ladies out there read this and use the information in it.
"Ordered for me by my husband, great read"
"I like this book as a resource and a guide for praying for my husband and our marriage. There are 30 chapters, one for each day of the month. Each chapter covers the most important areas to pray for our husband. I love the lesson in each chapter, the prayer at the end of each chapter and the Scriptures used. Excellent book. I would recommend it to any girl married 1 week or many years."
"Unfortunately, the book arrived torn on the back. That's why I give it 4 out off 5. I know the content of the book is awesome and that's what matters most!"
"It is hard to know what to pray and even when we do know what to ask is hard to keep focus on God's will for our lives.  I think this book brings to light the deep impact prayer can have on our lives and the importance to pray for each other.  The best part is that it is Biblical and every prayer is not whimsy and emotional, but backed-up by God's word."
This book is powerful!  Stormie Omartian writes from first hand experience and from her heart.  She also writes from Scripture.  We cannot recommend this book highly enough!
This book is nothing short off amazing! It not only gives you a different outlook on the way you view marital issues but your role as a godly wife.
"I bought this for her after reading the ""power of the praying husband""  BIG MISTAKE""  let her choose to read it, that being said it is a great book for the hubby to learn somethings about her.  we had trouble and was heading for the big D.  this book and the power of the praying husband helped us turn this around"
A long time favorite.  I have bought several copies over the years to give as gifts.
I buy this as a gift for a new bride or groom . It is wonderfully written. Spells out praying over a certain situation. Very good.
I purchase the book and study guide and they compliment each other well!! I think this book is great and works married and non married couples
I‚Äôve read this book in the past when I was single but reading it now that I‚Äôm a wife gave me a whole new perspective on my marriage. I‚Äôm so grateful.
"I have only read two chapters of this book, but so far it is amazing! I love the truth this lady brings. Praying for your husband in this way is so powerful! I like the written prayers she has at the end of the chapters for me to pray."
"I am reading this book for a second time, and I am not married yet.  But this book helps me understand how to pray for myself first in relation to my (future) husband. I have also found it very helpful in praying for others.  I would love for my boyfriend to read the power of a praying husband, however he won't read it. I wish it was on audio book."
"This is one of my favorites,  I lost it so I reordered it."
I highly recomend this book. It is the perfect gift to give to new couples or those married awhile and need a fresh reminder. To those yet married... who says you only pray for your spouse when you're married? It's never too early. A very balanced and practical book for one who desires to saturate their relationship in prayer. Stormie Omartian is a fantastic voice on prayer. I recomend all of her books.
Got this as a gift for someone who is having marital problems. It really helped not just in their lives but also in their prayer life.
Gifted
I found the importance of consistently praying for my spouse.
I have bought many copies of this book to give to friends and now both of my daughter-in-laws.  I love it and it is such a wonderful guide on praying for your husband. Thank you Stormie Omartian for a wonderful book.
This book is a wonderful reminder of how to pray for our husbands. It offers much insight to the struggles of men and how we as their wives can lift them up.
Great for those engaged or married. Got this during my engagement and now have been married almost a year. Def great advice and an insight on praying for your marriage and for each other. I would recommend to any engaged or married woman
"I learned a lot from this book, I would recommend it to any woman. Single, in a relationship or dating. I really enjoyed it. Perfect gift for a friend."
This book is an awaking of the woman's spirit as a wife.  We tend to forget how God intended us to have a place in a family and the role we play is extremely important in the dynamic and plan He had mapped out for us.
encourages prayer
This book was such a blessing to my spirit!
Such a great book for the wife that needs reassurance and to deepen her faith! Easy read. Realistic goals!
Beautiful and powerful. This little book will transform your relationship and bring you closer to God and yourself as you discover more deeply who you are. Anyone who wants to live as a truly christian wife should take the embark on the beautiful journey offered by this book.
"This book helped to guide my prayer life and gave me hope! I'll read it again, for sure! I love the easy to read format!"
EVERY WIFE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK!! Thank you Stormie
I highly recommend this book!
Awesome book
good thank you
This book is A Must Have! It will definitely transform your marriage as well as your life. You will see radical change by the power of fervent prayer. Order your copy ASAP!
"After being recommended to read this book by my therapist, I‚Äôve purchased 4 additional for other wives I know! Highly recommended !!!"
Love the series!! Arrived on time and in good shape. Thanks!
"Arrived very quickly. Have enjoyed reading this in conjunction with my husband (he is reading ""The Power of a Praying Husband) while he is deployed with the military. The teachings in this book have really put some things into perspective and helped me understand different aspects of my husband and aided me in how to more effectively pray for him."
Life changing! I gift this book often! Best marriage self-help book!
"YES! Life changing stuff here, girls. Read it honestly and YOU can't help but change. Just understanding your husbands makeup is huge."
"I have used this book for prayer for many years. Excellent guide for praying wives, struggling wives, those who are fighting for the marriage God promises!"
Great
This was a used book. Still in great condition. Thank you For a great book with a great used price
I would recommend this book.  Didn't agree with everything she wrote about.  But it made me think more about my husband's feelings and showed me how to pray for him that will also help me in the end.  I love the prayers she wrote to say.  It's a good book.
Good book. Very nice and easy read.
"If you struggle with prayer this book will teach you. I've read it twice, it's different for me this time because I'm using it to empower my husband and encourage him in his walk with Christ. If you are a little bitter towards your husband it will help you as well. My prayer for you is that you read it with an open mind and let God work. Bless you!"
"I've only read through the first 3 chapters, but everything Stormie has to say is a clarion call to any wife. My wife is in a prayer group that is using this book, and I've noticed a big difference in her. Wow."
It was a good book in helping you and guiding you in how you should pray for your husband. I wish it used the KJV for the references to the Bible but a good book overall.
"I could not find my copy, and I wanted to read it again, and I bought a copy for my sister. If you like C. S. Lewis you will love this book. It.isn't difficult to read, (as I know he can be), rather, these are letters written from Screwtape, whom Mr Lewis refers to as the devil; to his nephew and pupil Wormwood. In these letters, Screwtape explains to Wormwood what he is doing wrong in trying to 'turn the patient' which is how Screwtape describes getting a Christian person to turn away from the Enemy, as he refers to God.Don't worry about reading about the devil, as I was concerned with when I started to read it. But the more you read it the better and closer relationship you can develop with God, which of course is what Mr. Lewis has intended.The author is pure genius. I have read Mere Christianity, The problem with pain amd A Grief Observed. I have also read his space trilogy Out of the Silent Planet, Perelandra and That Hideous Strength; which are all wonderful.Word of warning, A Grief Observed is a difficilt, depressing book. DO NOT READ IT if you are grieving about anything or one.I hope this helps and helps people discover the genius, as I have, of C. S. Lewis."
"Some people are fascinated by the devil.  I'm not particularly.  Perhaps I should be, but I find it more helpful and rewarding for me on my spiritual journey to reflect on other Truths: the Trinitarian God, Christ, Grace, living an empowered Christian life.  I do believe, however, as C.S.Lewis tries to make clear in this book, that Satan (the devil) exists.  This is certainly part of Catholic teaching.  See, for example, ""Devil; Satan"" in the Catechism of the Catholic Church.  But also see ""God,"" ""Jesus Christ"" and ""Holy Spirit.""  This is where the focus is in Catholic teaching.  But the Church doesn't neglect Satan.  Unfortunately, I don't have a copy of the Summa Theologica with me now, or I'd check to see what Thomas Aquinas has to say on Satan.  He is always, at least I find it so, informative.The point of the book is that Satan acts in subtle ways in human lives.  Don't think he is likely to knock you over the head with a manifestation of his power and contrariness. He is much more subtle, and thus much more successful. And that is where the danger lies. If we are aware of and sensitive to spiritual things, we no doubt have seen this.  At least that is my experience.When we read this book in our parish book club, it did not receive a raving review, although it received a solid one.  (Some, being unfamiliar with this type of literature,  found it a bit confusing.)  I'd recommend it, as part of the Christian canon of books.  And more.  After all, it is not good to ignore what can destroy the life and love of God in us."
"I've read this before (around 5 years ago), but this time I enjoyed it way more than last time, and I think I was able to follow Lewis' thoughts much better. In sum, this book was full of insight after insight about how we as humans work, how we are variously and subtly tempted in the Christian life, and even who God (referred to as 'the Enemy' throughout) is and how we works for the good of his people. Many might think this is mainly fiction, or satire, or just a strange book that is about how demons might work, but the book is much more profound than that. It most certainly isn't just fiction; it includes some satire, but isn't mainly such; and Lewis does use the letters from one demon to another as his template; but in reality, this is just as clear and profound as Lewis' other classic works on Christianity-such as Mere Christianity. In fact, I would say that if read slowly, this book is just as profound. Just instead of it being longer chapters with longer arguments, each of the 31 chapters in this book has its own main argument (or multiple) that really shed much insight on the Christian faith.Of the 31 chapters, I marked 15 of them as really great and worth revisiting over and over. I will keep this book always in close range on my bookshelf simply because it is so full of practical advice and illustrations about the Christian life.I will not quote or list most of the insights here-just for the sake of time-but here are the main topics that he talked about. I will word them as coming from evil's perspective, and will put the chapter number in parenthesis.- Keep the Christian ""in the stream"" and not really thinking about bigger things (1)- Use the War, but watch out for how the Enemy can use it (5)- Use anxiety about the Future; make him lack self-awareness (6)- Make him extreme on either side (it doesn't really matter much) on Politics (7)- Use Pleasures (even though that's Enemy territory), and make him a nominal believer (9)- Make him spend his time, all throughout life, doing and getting Nothing (12)- Manipulate his 'Humility' (14)- Keep him from seeing the Present and eternity; focus him on the Future (15)- How to use sex and marriage (18)- Make him think he has ownership on time; how to twist the word 'my' (21)- How to use this quest for the Historical Jesus (23)- Make him crave novelty; twist his desire (25)- Change the Christian idea of 'Love' for the negative idea of 'Unselfishness' (26)- Use the world slowly over time to attach him to the world (28)- Use a little Fatigue; and twist the idea of what is 'real' (30)These are the main insights about the Christian life I listed. Although, there are many more.SPOILER ALERT BELOW:Finally, I simply want to mention the last chapter. The last chapter was different as it was not about how to tempt the Christian man because he suddenly died. Rather, it was about one demon (frustratingly) explaining what happened to him at those moments after death. In short, this chapter was beautiful. It really was. Almost made me cry tears of joy. Lewis so clearly and cleverly--even through the disgusted pen of a fictional demon!--and so wonderfully captures the Christian's final deliverance from all evil, how the Christian will see all the angels that helped him along the way, and especially the moment when the Christian will finally see God himself, Jesus Christ, and be finally home. Again, the last chapter is beautiful. And it is a perfect ending to the book.In sum, although it uniquely is a book containing 31 letters from one demon to the other, it is super applicable, insightful, clever, and even beautiful as it shows who God is and the future he has for his people.Without a doubt, I would wholeheartedly recommend the book. Read it as slowly as it takes; take it in; and see the shining glory of God, especially as it is contrasted with the backdrop of the darkness."
"Unreadable due to awful formatting, punctuation and lack of capitalization.  DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION.  Also see no way to complain/return!"
If I could give Zero stars I would!!  This is unreadable!  Like it was transcribed by someone who cannot type. None of the sentences are initial capped and there are font capitalization and spacing issues EveryWhere!  Example:  ‚Äúi waswalking alone. then i sLiDe down.‚Äù  I have the book version but thought I‚Äôd buy this for my Kindle. Worst $4 ever spent!
"This classic, timeless, humorous and witty book, written by one of the great theologians of our time, is the letters of a senior demon to an inexperienced demon coaching him on how to capture the soul of a newly professed Christian.  While I chuckle I also think hard about how to be a Christian in thought and deed.  I purchased this in hardcover because I have already worn out my softcover copy to the point where it can no longer be mended.  I bought a second copy for a friend.  If you want to be Christian, of any denomination, buy, read and think about this book; after that read it again and again.  You will gain something new every single time."
"One of the things my Father and shared was our interest in philosophy.  My Father had a full library of a variety philosophical books from Kierkegaard to Lewis.  He loved Lewis works especially.  I got that interest from Him.  It seems that Lewis cuts deeply into my  thinking.  He seems to be asking questions regarding my values and the philosophy that leads my life.  This book looks at life from the under side.  How the lies in the world constantly give us the mirage of fulfilment, but never can.  Your purpose in LIving doesn't come from the external, because that  is only momentary satisfaction.  It is like grabbing fog, it Is only an illusion disappearing in a moments time.  The real substance of life comes through the thoughts, morals, and values that make your lifes decisions.  Lewis' entire collection of writing deserves careful readings.  Lewis's critics are shallow at most.  Lewis must have been a fantastic teacher to sit under.  If you are reluctant to read Lewis because of his obvious Christian perspective, remember that he‚Äôs called himself the most reluctant convert in England.  If you think Christians are ‚Äònon-intellectual‚Äô, remember Lewis was a Professor of Middle Age and Renaissance Literature at Cambridge."
"The book itself is fantastic, but trying to read on the phone or tablet app is a nightmare.  Words are put together without spaces, random letters are about of order, proper nouns and first words of sentences aren't capitalized, etc..."
"From husband Dan: I'm not a big reader by any means and I have a hard time finding books that I do like. Even if I find a book I like, I don't always get around to finishing it. But I loved this book! At least for me, this was not a quick read. Lewis's writing style, that of Screwtape, on Satan's side, writing a letter to his nephew, is not always easy to understand the first time through. I often found myself going back and rereading paragraphs to make sure I really understood what Lewis was trying to say. Also, you have to take Screwtape's point of view and really think about the opposing letter might say if written from an angelic POV. There are several themes in this book that I found myself saying, ""Wow, he wrote that in 1942?! That is still so applicable to today."" Love this book and a very different take on how to think about your walk with Christ and how the devil tries to derail your journey."
"I have been wanting to read this book so I ordered this red hardcover edition since I thought it would be easier to read but as soon as I opened it, the first letter already had too many typos. As a former editor myself, I question how this could happen. . .almost at once, there was a word ""nanf"" which made no sense. When I checked online the kindle edition, it was correctly spelled and accented as NAIVE. It went on like that for several pages and I just gave up and decided to return it. Unfortunately, I do not have kindle, so if I want to take a chance on another format, i.e. paperback, I will have to do so. I fail to understand how this happens over and over lately, whereas older, out of print books are usually flawless in spelling and grammar. I can only assume that newer books rely on scanware or AI, neither of which is truly as accurate as a literate human being. At least, not yet. This is a pet peeve of a real book lover."
"I really can‚Äôt say enough good things about this book. I‚Äôve read it so many times. Each time I read it I learn something new about myself, the world around me and the people in it.It is beautifully, masterfully written. There is keen insight in every chapter.You don‚Äôt really have to be a believer to benefit from reading this book but it probably does help. The prose is so wonderfully constructed and eloquent, it must be read more than once to be fully appreciated. I love it more each time I read it.You really don‚Äôt even have to be a CS Lewis fan to appreciate the book. All you really need is a curious mind - a curiosity about what makes human beings tick and about what corrupts their behavior, what they fear and love, and perhaps a desire to understand the difference between good and evil not on some grand scale but on a day today basis we all inhabit.You will understand humility, pride, selfishness, sin, virtue and temptation to wrongdoing better than you ever thought you could if you read and absorb this book.Do yourself a favor and read this book, slowly, and often, as you would sip a good wine or beer.  It‚Äôs filled with essential, timeless wisdom.  It is frequently hilarious."
"This book has really helped me understand the enemy and how they work in our lives. This is brilliant writing and makes the reader think critically. I'm a writer and I am a fan. Further, it is a perfect fit for any time but especially for these times. May God bless America, the world, and may God bless you."
"Screwtape Letters is as relevant today as when it was first written 75 years ago. The power of understanding the strategic tactics of the invisible, demonic warfare that surrounds us cannot be overestimated for the God-seeking Christ follower today. Then it was tension between Christians, tension in families, materialism, sex, apathy, lack of prayer, judgment over the political decisions of someone else, and many more. Today is it the same. Reading this thoughtfully will bring you closer to understanding the source of some of your personal internal defeats, and learning to read it from God‚Äôs view will bring you into a new relationship with the source of all power, the Holy Spirit."
"I have other books by C S Lewis, including Mere Christianity, and purchased this book based on reputation and other reviews, including a plug by Jordan Peterson. Rather than say this is not up the standard others have seen, I will offer that maybe I need to re-read it to get additional insight I probably missed first time around. Of course, though not an ancient publication, it still benefits to put yourself in the times it was written. The takeaway for me was it's just a study of basic human nature, with all of our imperfections, and to be aware that ""the Devil"" is always just around the corner waiting for you to slip up."
"This one was recommended by a neighbor.  And it was... interesting.  It is a series of one sided letters from Screwtape, a senior demon to his nephew Wormwood who is still in training.  It explains all of the ways to bring a human being away from ""The Enemy"" (God) and over to the side of ""Our Father"" (Satan).It's a satirical work.  And there were a few times I giggled, but I had a really hard time concentrating on this one.  My mind kept wandering as I read.One of the things my mind kept wandering to was the ex-President.  If I thought he read books, I could see this as his playbook.  Temptation and Fear are great ways to turn people to the dark side.  And then I realized that 45 also exemplifies all Seven of the Deadly Sins and then I fell down a wormhole of googling the sins and their origins and put the book down for awhile.So it was interesting and it did make me think, but it didn't hold my attention.  But maybe that was just Screwtape whispering in my ear...."
"This really is a must have book. I wanted to reread it, but couldn‚Äôt find my copy so I figured I‚Äôd buy a new one. It‚Äôs such a great book that I also thought it would be worth buying a hardcover copy which I did. Big mistake. The red hardcover copy can‚Äôt possibly be an actual authorized publication of the book. The font is ridiculous and the cover looks like a kid created it. I sent the hardcover back as soon as I got it and purchased the paperback. I‚Äôm really glad I did. The paperback (different than the one pictured) is a beautiful version of the book and clearly an authentic print. Do not buy the hardcover. Buy the paperback. You‚Äôll be glad you did."
"Excellent description of much of the Christian life in this world. Through the wit of CS Lewis we have a glimpse of the works of evil towards humanity. And, also, the way humanity, itself throws itself towards evil. Written during the first stages of WW2 this is a book that represents well the way Christians react to the world even today. We have in ourselves a disposition to be allured by the world and, if not by the many mercies of God, we could not go the opposite way. This book can serve as an eye opener to 'Christians' who find themselves bathed by the dirty waters of this evil world. The only way to avoid the Screwtapes or Wormwoods of evil is to turn to the only savior there is, our mighty savior Jesus Christ. Very interesting book."
"This classic is simply ahead of its time. The beauty of this book is in telling the villain‚Äôs side of the story. These villains include Uncle Screwtape ‚Äúmentoring‚Äù his nephew Wormwood in order to torment a soul who is generically referred to as ‚Äúthe Patient.‚ÄùThrough a series of letters, the reader will be challenged to perceive the temptations of the heart. The result is a thought-provoking read that will forever remain relevant.I mentioned this book was ahead of its time. The past 30 years has seen a flood of stories told from the villain‚Äôs perspective such as Grendel, Wicked, and many more. I hope this genre will continue to flourish in the future.David NelsonAuthor of ‚ÄúWhy I Would Have Killed Jesus and You Might Have Too.‚Äù"
"A must read for so many reasons. It doesn't matter what your religious or non religious beliefs might be this book is a brilliant insight into the human condition. We are offered an extraordinary mind's view of the basis of suffering and happiness with great humour, albeit very dark humour, and a level of personal involvement usually only found in poetry. There is a very strong sense in this book that the writer is actually living the characters struggles page by page. This book is a classic and a must read  and will stay with you and help you if you let it. I am not a Christian or a believer in devils or demons and it didn't matter one bit. Ten stars if you read it twice!"
"""The Screwtape Letters"" is a fictional series of correspondence between an agent of the devil and a younger, less experienced agent.  The older agent is assisting in the moral corruption of a young English male during World War II.  He gives intructions to the younger agent in writing about what steps to take to bring about the young man's moral destruction.  Obviously C. S. Lewis, a great man of Christian thought is providing fuel for contemplation for the reader.  I liked the work a lot in that context; fuel for contemplation.C. S. Lewis is a great man of moral teachings and a fine author from the middle of the twentieth century.  He is an author of both more traditional fiction and also religious writings.  Thus far my favorite example of the latter is ""Mere Christianity"".  I also liked what I have read of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" but I have not completed those novels.The letters in this work are relatively short and I read one at a time, sometimes just one a day for a few minutes.  I tried to think about the message and lessons contained therein.  It proved a pleasant, fruitful experience, but I did not read this as I would a standard novel.I did the same thing with ""Mere Christianity"" and actually felt I got more out of that study.  When I read ""Mere Christianity"" there was a situation in my life concerning bullying and harassment and I kept waiting for it to end.  C. S. Lewis provided a lot of insight into why bullying and harassment will often not stop on its own.  I suppose that was directly relevant to World War II when he wrote it, but it proved very meaningful to me.  I may have personally received more from ""Mere Christianity"", but ""The Screwtape Letters"" are also very good.In summary, I really liked this work and am glad that I had the opportunity to read and study it.  It is NOT a traditional novel.  It is religious and philosophical in nature and I am quite sure will not fit the wishes of every reader.  Thank You..."
"One of C.S. Lewis' greatest. As it says on the back cover, ""A Masterpiece of Satire on Hell's Latest Novelties and Heaven's Unanswerable Answer.Inside flap ""wildly comic yet deadly serious"". For the unfamiliar, Screwtape (assistant to the Devil) is writing instructions to Wormwood (novice demon in charge of securing the damnation of an ordinary young man by setting up temptations which are triumphed over. As a Christian, it was humorous to see the satire while being a participant observer from the pew and the world how hard the devil works (often very successfully) to pull Christians (me too) away from ""The Enemy"" (God). A bonus, perhaps even better, is another essay ""Screwtape Proposes a Toast"" (In Hell at the annual dinner of the 'Tempters' Training College for young Devils. This is a must read for all Christians and even non-Christians. Note: The sexual content is not explicit, but only to show how sex is used as a temptation to draw people to the dark side. (Remember C S Lewis is of Narnia fame)"
"After reading this book, I feel that it has given me a greater spiritual awareness of the temptations that the enemy gives to me. Lewis does a great job of mixing humor and wisdom to explain how temptations can arise in our spiritual lives at all different stages. If you are just beginning your walk with God or are deeply entrenched in a relationship with Him, this book can help you to grow in maturity and desire to fight against the devil."
"The Screwtape Letters is actually a book on how to maintain a genuinely Christian attitude, but is written as a series of letters to a junior demon named Wormwood, whose goal is to tempt his ""patient"" away from God and toward Hell, where the patient will be used as food.  Screwtape, who writes the letters, is Wormwood's uncle who used to be on temptation duty himself but has since been promoted to a desk job as a low-level administrator in Hell.  Although Wormwood writes in reply to Screwtape's letters, we never actually see those.Of course, Screwtape's advice is backwards from what you should do if you actually want to be a Christian.  If read in a playful and semi-serious frame of mind, The Screwtape Letters can actually be funny, such as Screwtape's utter failure - along with the rest of Hell's failure - to get his head around the concept of selfless love, or the letter in which Screwtape had to dictate the latter part to his secretary because he lost his temper and turned himself into a large centipede.I already had more than one hardcopy of this book before buying the Kindle version, the extra copies being for lending out.  Because this book is not indexed, finding a letter dealing with a specific topic can be hard to do without being very familiar with the text or doing a lot of scanning, hence the purchase of the Kindle version and the failure to receive the fifth star."
"What more can I say about CS Lewis. He was a masterful writer blessing us with ‚ÄúThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, and so many, many other Christian writings. This book is definitely not ‚Äúlight reading,‚Äù but it is entertaining and insightful. This book is full of insight into the way Satan tries to worm his way into the Christian‚Äôs life. It is a bit complicated, but well worth the read. I also purchased the study guide."
"I couldn't be more impressed with Joss Ackland's audio peformance of this book.  For my money, it's the best ever audio Screwtape, and a masterpiece.  Even better than the John Cleese performance, which is saying something.Ackland has a deep, resonant voice.  The delivery is dryer than Cleese's, but at the same time heavier and more diabolical.  And it's more pleasurable in general, the kind of voice that can be heard for hours without grating, a rarity in the audiobook world.  For some, there may be too much benevolence (think of the warmth in Donald Sutherland's voice) in this Screwtape, but I think two things save that from being a real fault:1. It makes a more diabolical lie of Screwtape's ""affection"" for Wormwood by having him sound sometimes like a genuinley loving uncle, and 2. it is a large part of the visceral pleasure of listening to the book. In other words, it might be more realistic to hear Screwtape sound more obnoxious, but then we'd have to listen to someone being obnoxious for 4 hours!(You can get it on Amazon's audiobook branch, audible.com, and at the time of this review it costs less than $10 for the download.  I mention it because I just found out the two were connected.)"
"The story itself is genius. Making the ""bad"" guy the main character.  I will admit I had to keep reminding myself that the ""Enemy"" is actually God.  Poor wormwood , I wonder how he got himself into such a predicament.  Uncle Screwtape is very knowledgeable at pointing out man's sins and how to make sure man really gets tangled in it."
"I was pleasantly surprised at how well Lewis was able to delve into many of the nuances of sinning. How often we think of the main ""offenders"" of adultery, outright lying, and theft, and forget the adultery of the heart, thinking hurtful things of others when that's not accurate depictions, and stealing so subtly that one can rationalize it.It was quite amusing (in an odd way) to see Jesus referred to as 'the Enemy"" by Screwtape, and to have the demons not even remotely understand actual temptation, sin, and redemption. Sadly, they did understand many human weaknesses, and it made me want to do some introspection...I heard a pastor say once that the darkness does not understand the light. This played out quite expertly in the book of letters. Oh, how the devils wish they were as successful as they claimed to be! Oh, how they misunderstand charity, the true love of Christ. This made for some laughable letters, rife with wishful thinking from the demon.There was one portion, in the preface, that stood out to me the most:""There are two equal and opposite errors into which our race can fall about the devils. One is to disbelieve in their existence. The other is to believe, and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them.""I also was quite intrigued to note that Lewis stated that he would never write another of these books, as he was afraid that he would, because of having to act the part, fall prey to the feelings he knew demons elicited from those who delve too deeply into their realm.Smart man."
"CD LEWIS was brilliant in his writings when placing himself in Satan s place and instructing younger devils on how to tempt humans. Just thinking how to write in this context is in itself difficult for a letter or two but to do it enough for book is incredible.  The mindset of writing sin-filled dialog between two evil spirits and making sense about it, and combining history between the chapters makes it all most noteworthy. Truely an exceptional writing in his time and now."
"A wonderful book, which I listened to using Audible.The narrator is great for the part.  I think this might be the best of all Lewis' books."
"C.S. Lewis is regarded by many to be the best Christian author, in the English language, of the 20th Century.  His books are brief, extremely thoughtful,  highly informative & useful. This book, I feel his best, is remarkable for it's humor .  Heexpresses his thoughts, clearly, briefly, and has you laughing.  When you have finished laughing, you suddenly realize thathe has slipped a thought into your consciousness, that you have avoided, often for years.  Your journey has started!"
"Purchased the kindle version for my Mom who is a huge CS Lewis fan.  She is thrilled.  Although she likes to hold a real book, the older she gets the more she likes not having to store all the books.  So win/win."
"This is a book I lend to others to lend to others.  It is a wonderful story of how the devil uses hiss minions to do his work here on earth.  How he uses the ways of the world to suck us away from our real purpose here on earth ""To love the LORD our God with all our heart...""  It shows how Satan uses our thoughts against us...how we can think we are perfectly safe following God but yet get drawn away.  Satan uses so many different worldly things and thoughts to deceive us and so many times we are not knowledgeable about it until we have been ""HAD"".  Many times I said to myself....oh my word...that has been used against me....It makes you more aware of when and what Satan is doing in this earthly ""WAR"" for our souls."
"I am a big fan of CS Lewis so it's no surprise that I love this book.  That being said, it contains so much wisdom and I highly recommend any Christian to read his books, multiple times as needed.  This one in particular is both entertaining and world-view shifting."
"One of the greatest minds of the 20th Century exposes the greatest Evil of all time. ""The Screwtape Letters"" is C. S. Lewis' masterfield expos√® of Satan--the False Seducer--and his insidious, diabolical schemes and temptations.Screwtape is a senior demon training his nephew, Wormwood, in the finer arts of infiltrating and influencing, for evil, the human mind, heart, and soul. Letter by letter, point by point, as Lewis pens the imagined correspondence between these two demons, you feel as if Lewis has stepped inside your soul and listened to the secret musings of your mind.How? How did Lewis gain access to the process of spiritual seduction? The same way the great saints of old did--through knowing God, knowing self, and knowing Scripture. This trilogy of epistemological awareness is essential for understanding the schemes of Satan. Combined, they allowed Lewis to penetrate into the inner workings of his soul, and ours.If you want company along your spiritual journey, if you want to feel like, ""Wow, others have felt and thought and experienced this, too!"" then read ""The Screwtape Letters.""Reviewer: Dr. Robert W. Kellemen is the author of ""Soul Physicians: A Theology of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction,"" ""Spiritual Friends: A Methodology of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction,"" and the forthcoming, ""Sacred Companions: A History of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction."""
"Ever wonder what separates us from God? This book will give you some hypothetical, all though theologically sound ideas as to how Saten and his dominion run chaos on earth. This book will make you take a look at how you think about how you are influenced by the secular world around us, and our reactions to it. Are we tempted in ways we have never thought about? It is easy to think of being tempted by money, lust, self-pity... but what about being tempted by the mundane, the obvious, the everyday? What about being tempted/preoccupied by the ails of the world at large, yet being soured by the needs of the person that lives next door to you? Does that seem to little or unnecessary? Or perhaps... if everyone chose to help and care for the person next door, then eventually the people a half of a world away would feel that influence? C.S. Lewis' novel is timeless and is must read for anyone who is finding new interest in the Christian faith, or has been a Christian and would like to understand the aspect of temptation even more."
"After at least a decade and several personal recommendations to read it each year, I finally got around to buying ""The Screwtape Letters.""  The initial emotion I experienced after reading its introduction was jealously as I could not help but wish that it was I, and not Lewis, who had such an ingenious idea.  Once you discover the book's method, which is of a senior demon writing to his nephew with recommendations on how to steal souls, you'll be astounded at the wonderful complexity of the author's mind.  His reverse theological technique provided ample opportunity to skewer many of the most powerful members of England's WWII society.  What is most remarkable about the book is that it is even more applicable to our present day world than it was to the author's era.  Moderate and touchy-feely churches are ubiquitous to our landscape and Screwtape undoubtedly would be most pleased with their constant empthasis on social issues rather than the Lord's Word.  The book has tremendous meaning as it difficult to dismiss the possibility that the Devil influences our daily lives and the world around us.  One cannot help but wonder if their are Screwtapes and Wormwoods in the air we breath who attempt, with subtle direction, to steer us away from productive activities and into the netherworld of souless entertainment."
"Classic work. An interesting view of Christianity and virtue through the eyes of a demon. This was a re-read for me. What was new was the included article ""Screwtape Proposes a Toast"". I found this quote particularly interesting: ""Democracy is the word with which you must lead them by the nose . The good work which our philological experts have already done in the corruption of human language makes it unnecessary to warn you that they should never be allowed to give this word a clear and definable meaning. They won‚Äôt. It will never occur to them that Democracy is properly the name of a political system, even a system of voting, and that this has only the most remote and tenuous connection with what you are trying to sell them . Nor, of course, must they ever be allowed to raise Aristotle‚Äôs question: whether ‚Äòdemocratic behaviour‚Äô means the behaviour that democracies like or the behaviour that will preserve a democracy. For if they did, it could hardly fail to occur to them that these need not be the same.""Lewis, C. S. (2009-05-28). The Screwtape Letters (p. 197). HarperCollins. Kindle Edition."
"Classic Christian literature.  I doubt I can say more about the praisewortiness of this book than what has already been said since it's publication.  So I'll just say this.... it is slim, entertaining, and illuminating.  Give it a chance if you haven't already I think you'll be surprised.  Don't be put off by the title... as I was for many years.  It put ideas in my head about tapeworms or something........  there are no tapeworms in this book.  Read it!"
"We're using this is the subject/content for our Bible study group and it's perfect.  Although we're all in Bible study for the same reason-studying the Bible-we've got a varity of backgrounds.  Believers, non-believers, life time Christians, new Christians, etc.  The book is various letters from a senior Demon to his nephew.  It's amazing how it truly times to that little voice in your head.  CS Lewis is an all time favorite writer for many.  Although it's my first encounter with one of his religious works, it's an amazing story."
"CS Lewis brilliantly tells the story of two demons, one mentoring the other, in their quest for stealing souls from the Enemy. It‚Äôs funny, witty, sarcastic, and reflective of our inner motivations and self deception. Like anything written by CS Lewis, it‚Äôs excellent."
As someone else mentioned: Edition received was different than the one shown on website. (I for the red cover.)Son needs it for summer high school assignment. Hoping no issue.
"An excellent product.* Production.  I read this book in high school.  This reading is very entertaining and the actor adds a great deal to the text.  You can hear the effort.  The reader is acting not just reading with animation.  His interpretation helps with the understanding of the language from 70 years ago and the discussion of a complex subject.* Book.  As to the book itself, it is the standard quality of C. S. Lewis and worth the purchase.  I do not understand the negative reviews on this site about it being a Christian book or about Christianity.  If you read C. S. Lewis, it will be a Christian book.  If you not interested in Christianity for any reason, do not buy this book."
"CS Lewis needs no introduction and at first glance this book might seem like a children's book, or kind of nonsensical. After all, it's written from the POV of a demon, and it makes Hell seem like a corporation! But as I read this book I was really convicted by the Holy Spirit of my sin... of unnoticed blind spots in my own life. This book is a definite must read. I read quite a lot of Christian literature, and I have to say that this book has become an invaluable ministry tool for me, and a mirror into not just the spiritual realm but also into my own soul."
"Gives a different perspective on who and why things happen in life . Also , gives ideas on how to overcome those challenges."
"You probably won't get the copy shown in the listing. I ordered it for that specific copy (the signature classics box version) and I got the red and white one with the gargoyle face. Not once, but twice. If you don't care which copy you get, then go for it. But I was hugely disappointed in it."
"My niece is a voracious reader and I loved the way she described the letters. It's not every day a 20year old asks you and your best friend (another literary genius) to join her in this journey. not being very religious myself but grew up Roman Catholic; I find Uncle screwtapes ingenious, Don't point out the faults of some ones  religious or ( more apropos political beliefs ). Not by attacking the heart of the matter and not by putting things in peoples head. But by mere distraction and taking thing OUT of their head. Or out of going to mass his nephew (Wormwood) he points out the parishiners who sing funny, have squeaky shoes, The devil does not have the advantage of being human."
"You will find no better book written -- ever -- about Satan.  If you want to know how he tricks you, how he lies, how he tempts you, the tricks he plays to win you over, how he seeks to devour your soul, this is the book you need to read (or in this case listen to) over and over again.  Modern day prophet C.S. Lewis takes us on a masterful journey through many letters from a senior demon training a junior demon on how to make sure the human to whom he is assigned ends up damned.  The style of the book is elegantly brilliant, and at the same time profoundly disturbing in a ""wake up call"" kind of way.  Truth exudes from this book.  One of the most important books you will ever experience."
"Wow, what can I say?  This book portrays the level at which Satan wants us to not be with Jesus."
A classical Lewis opinions of demonic plans for mankind. Great for Christian fiction about daemons learning how to trap people.
Liked. One of C S Lewis‚Äôs best. I would not recommend it to non-Christians as it may cause embarrassment to their conduct.
"I don't want to get into a debate in a review but this book seriously made me question ""God's will"". The characters are doing what they think is ""God's will"" but the devil uses it for his plans. Makes me think we are merely doing things and then pretending we know as if they were part of God's will or not. Much more but minus a star for all that.Either way this is a CS Lewis so its definitely worth the read."
"Its ok, not as good as I expected compared to what I have heard about it. Does help one to see a different view of how easy it can be to have the evil one try to step in ones life through the small seemingly lesser noticed ways. The book lay out, feel and design are well done. Not a book I would keep, more of a hand it on to someone else or trade it after reading."
Screwtape Letters was required reading for my Freshman class in college in 1962. I found it a little convoluted to read then. But now! Wow! I have much more insight into the world where we live now and I can see just how right on CS Lewis wrote back in the early 1940's. His insights on how the devil works through relationships and their natural difficulties has special meaning for me.
Such discreet elegance in a book to teach faith and understanding to those who believe. C.S Lewis put a fine point to this letter and it should be well received.
Edition received was different than the one shown on website. Normally this would not be an issue but the book is being used as part of a group study in my case so that page numbers or page alignment could differ making it hard to locate information being discussed.  Others in the group are using the edition shown on the Amazon page rather than the edition I received.
"This is a phenomenal book. As it comes from the perspective of a demon trying to ""help"" some character damn his soul, it's certainly a unique take - tremendous satire. Each chapter addresses some of the different temptations you and I face everyday. As the book progresses, you begin to see just how important those little moments of saying ""Yes"" to God are. I was hoping this would help me become a more faithful Christian (Catholic to be more exact) and I think it did. This book can be very helpful for those who want to grow in their faith regardless of whether they are new to it or far along in their journey."
"There is really not much I can add to all of the commentary on this spiritual classic by C. S. Lewis. I imagine that nearly everyone knows at least the premise, a series of letters by the experienced demon Screwtape to his nephew, Wormwood, the inexperienced tempter.  The Screwtape Letters is my personal favorite of Lewis's books, even more so than the Chronicles of Narnia.I must confess though, that I find reading The Screwtape Letters a slightly frightening experience. I keep imagining my own tempter sitting on my shoulder, writing glowing letters about his success in guiding his ""patient"" to Hell."
C.S. Lewis was an amazingly smart man that wrote scholarly theological books that will make your brain hurt but as well as beautiful fiction that created worlds that help you understand faith and life in a new way. This is one of his very easily ingestible yet super personally challenging fiction books. This is an easy read that will leave you thinking.
CS Lewis writing is absolutely amazing. I can‚Äôt believe the depth of these chapters and the length they were written. I had to chew on these chapters daily. They were packed with so much truth. It was a fun perspective to read through as well.
"Classic tale. Recommended for any one who loves ""the angel vs devil on your shoulder"" dynamic"
WE ARE IN A SPIRITUAL WAR AND C S LEWIS EXPLAINS IT
"Tough to read, monotonous, thank God it‚Äôs only 175 pages.  A few good principles highlighted, but this one will be shelved.  Onto the next one..."
Loved the message. Brilliant writing.
A very interesting and insightful take. I have always loved the chronicles of narnia. But I was only recently introduced to his other works. This is a strange take on Christian concepts but it really makes you think about them in a different light. This book actually made me laugh and cry. I typically prefer reading over audio books but I whisper synced this and listened to the audio as I read. The narrators voice is perfect and makes the book very engaging. But certain parts I paused to reread myself so they were such important passages! I definitely recommend!
"Screwtape Letters remains one of my favorite books. With each rereading, I find new reasons to appreciate it.The premise of the book is that a senior devil/tempter, Screwtape, is writing to his nephew, Wormwood, about Wormwood's ""patient."" Everything is backwards - what's good to Screwtape is NOT good to us. When he refers to Our Father Down Below, he's talking about Satan, and the Enemy is God. This alone is enough to delight me as a reader.But wait, there's more!The Screwtape Letters struck me, the first time through, as though it was one of the best examinations of conscience I have yet found (admittedly, I hadn't looked very hard). It made me consider sin in a whole new way. It made me think about angels and demons - especially demons - as workers with a stake, and as forces that I can beat, but not alone. It made me see the need for God in my life ever more, ever more.The second time through, I was reading more carefully. Since I had listened to the audio version the first time, different things leapt out at me when I went back through it with the paper copy. I was again struck by the fact that this was, in effect, a description of ME, and it was a starting place for an examination of conscience.This remains a book that inspires an examination of conscience in me. It's also a good reminder that there are forces of evil working against us all.the.time.I love having a book that makes me think differently about the world around me. This book has the advantage of also inspiring a number of other works, and I am a sucker for reading source material. Besides that, C.S. Lewis is just fabulous. Need I say more?Be sure to make time to read this book. It's relatively short, available even at my small town library, and the audio version is quite stunning."
"I had mostly read this once in college. Decided I needed to go back and read the whole thing. I was great. It will really freak you out how well C.S. Lewis is able to get into the mindset of the Enemy (ironically, in the book, God is referred to as the Enemy). I recommend this read for anyone that is interested in seeing just how subtle Satan (and his minions) try to be. They are not blatant, normally, they are not obvious, but extremely subversive."
It took me awhile to read through this book and I had to keep telling myself that the person speaking in the book is a baddie! The book explains how Satan attempts to control those seeking Christ. Great learning experience.
I first read this 35 years ago as church Liberian. I found it fascinating and humerus. It is still so. Truth in humor.
Not impressed at all....
A MUST READ FOR CHRISTIANS
"this book is amazing its about a devils uncle telling his nephew how to deceve humans. the book came as advertised just asd it looks in the picture!!its a good book fo ages:7,8,9,10 and older my child loves it and i do to i recomend this book to readers who like cs lewis and have seen other booksriiten buy him ITS COOL !!!!!"
Every time I pick this up I learn more about human nature and the condition of my own heart. Constantly recommending it to others and quoting C.S. Lewis's wisdom in both religious and secular contexts.
This book is of a very basic quality. There is no introduction.
"Remember that this is satire. Although at the same time, it caused me to reflect deeply on my walk of faith."
"I have enjoyed this, but It was a little deceiving - as this is NOT JOHN CLEESE, as mentioned in the AMAZON Editorial Review.  Shame on you, Amazon.  It does say, at the end, ""This text refers to the Audio Cassette edition"", but it wasn't until I received it, did I realize I got a non John Cleese version.I don't regret my purchase, I just wish they would leave out the misleading Editorial Reviews!!!"
One of my friends read one page of his digital copy at our dinner table. All I can say is I immediately ordered the book right then! I really like the approach C.S. Lewis takes in making us aware of our enemies‚Äô tactics; they know ours!!! I give this unconventional yet VITAL read 10 Stars!
"Many of the gut feelings I would get in certain situations C.S. Lewis has put into words, and to top it off in allegory form!It was really fun for me to glean from his text, what he REALLY thought about the things brought up - my favorites were his take on fatigue and reality. SO GOLD!kind of was sad to end the book. onto the next of 60 CS Lewis books!"
Great book for those with serious spiritual questions.
"What can you write about a classic of this magnitude other than that it is a masterpiece of creative writing, spiritual insight, and nasty humor? It is for good reason that this book has sold more copies than most books around the world. PLOT? Uncle Screwtape, a senior devil in Satan's army, writes a series of letters to Wormwood, his nephew and devil-in-training. The aim of the teaching letters to Wormwood is how to keep ""The Patient"", a man who is a Christian but a weak one, away from a closer relationship to ""The Enemy"" - God. You do have to twist your mind to keep up with C.S,Lewis' modus operandi here because your mind doesn't want to understand. Still, after a few of the (short) letters, yoiu begin to get the feel of how Satan and his demons subtly and without barely being noticed, seduce people away from God by distractions, pride and other techniques. I am teaching a Bible study on this book right now, it is that powerful, despite the humor."
"I had heard of C. S. Lewis, but never read any of his work. I bought this book just to satisfy my curiosity. It is an amusing and entertaining little book, and just about the right length for what it does. Toward the end of the book the novelty of reading letters from a devil starts to wear off. The book makes you think, as the letters, though amusing and obviously written tongue-in-cheek, do impart some cutting insights."
"This book is one that needs to be kept and read periodically as the insidiousness of Satan (Srewtape) and his minions continue to lure us into the wrong direction. The way Screwtape has his protege, Wormwood work to seduce people in to sin is convicting because it is so true.  The humorous side of how this plays out adds to the likability of the book."
Item came as described and delivered quickly.
Very interesting read for a Christian understanding of how the devil works in your life c
Eye opening and thought provoking. Really made me analyze how the Devil is at work in my own life.  Easy read. There is a great free study guide on CS Lewis‚Äôs website to accompany this book as well.
"Great book from a great author. This is very nitpicky, but I would make it 5 star except that the cover is not the cover with the fountain pen, it is the red with gargoyle on it.Caution: This book is Satire, so reading the first couple of chapters can be hard to grasp. Keep reading and it becomes more clear and really is a great change of perspective."
Lewis takes the reader on an interesting journey as he discussed the greatest eternal struggle between heaven and hell.  The means in which the devil undergoes to claim unsuspecting humans in his struggle for God‚Äôs power is insightful.
Love this book. Lewis is spot on.
Awesome.  Never heard about it until I was 52.  I'm reading Mere Christianity now because of it.  Satire was fantastic.  Not a dull moment in the novel.
Purchased the book for someone else to use
This could have only be written by a man familiar with the constant din of spiritual warfare. To see it so clearly he had to have won often.
Imagine you are looking into the mind of Satans minions. What can you learn of their tricks of their trade? C. S. Lewis said that this was his most difficult book to write. But it gives proof that if we know the mind of the enemy we are better equiped to battle them. Read for yourself and see.
good book
"A very thought provoking book!  C. S. Lewis is a great writer, and I haven't read him for years, but have thoroughly enjoyed reading about the war of souls from the ""other"" side.  This is a compilation of letters from ""Screwtape"", a 'recruiter' for Satan, and his nephew (who is still green in the 'sales department)."
Product was as promised and promptly delivered. Would buy again.
Don't know about this book.. Has a great principle message.. But don't like the way it is written.. Gets really confusing as to who is who..
Definitely worth the read for Christians and non-Christians alike. Lewis does a fantastic job delving into the subtleties of human behavior and psychology while still remaining very understandable. The book is a great read that draws the attention of readers towards their smaller yet often more impactful quirks. Highly recommend for the person who wants to see themselves in a new light and understand just how impactful little things can be.
"These are letters to an underling from a boss demon.  This book is so accurate.  I saw my sins in it again and again.  And, it is amusing and funny!One of my favorite books and I have probably read it 3 or 4 times.  Everything he has written, I have read at least 1 or 2 times."
"Armed with a genius intellect, a rapier pen, and inhuman insight, CSL never ceases to enlighten me. Every one of his works burnishes my mind via crucible and wit."
I'm ashamed to say I had never read any C.S. Lewis books until now. He truly was so talented and put things in very understandable and informative ways.
Fantastic Author!
"I choose this rating because of its soul shaking clarity!! While written in narrative form it moves the reader at a rapid pace. Facts given can be verified and are accurate.  You feel and hear the sense of urgency to "" RETURN"". Biblical and historical facts are woven so the reader understands this vital message for a nation and for each of us personally. Thank you sir"
"A must read that will amaze and keep the reader in awe - a definite page-turner that's hard to put down.  Highly recommend reading especially now while our nation is in a downward spiral toward destruction.  The details of every harbinger/warning could only have been put together by God Himself.  Yes, there is a God!  And this book, as well as each book written by Jonathan Cahn confirms the faith of a believer, and for anyone who is seeking or has been seeking for God--it will be obvious that not only is there one God--the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, but that every Word written in the Old Testament and the New Testament stands forever!  Isaiah 40:8Thank you, Jonathan Cahn, for your willingness to seek the Lord with all your heart and be open to His voice as He guided you to every revelation.  He has gifted you as an end-time prophet with the heart of Nouriel--humble and in awe of the One and Only Living Prophet--Jesus--the soon-coming King!"
This is second favorite book with the First Harbinger first. I actually got teary reading this one because I agree with all he said (I also researched and checked) and I know that God is a just God and the country I love so much is going to ‚Äúflame out‚Äù unless we beg Gods forgiveness and change our ways. The end chapters give hope though.
Jonathan Cahn is a very good writer who colors and brings to life with an exciting journey Bible prophecy. I read his book The Oracle which was written in a similar style. This is and probably like his other books very hard to put down after you get into reading the story of his journey through Bible prophecy. If you know and read The Bible his books are a great compliment to Bible prophecy.
"Very interesting reading both Harbinger I and now II.  God is the master weaver and creator of all things.  The alignment of dates thru history and time is far to methodical to be happenstance  As a Christian, I see the  breadth and depth of the world‚Äôs turning away from God most especially in the US.  God has always sent warnings whether it was the Assyrians, Babylonians or Romans in 70 A.D.  I am grateful that while I left God for a long period of time, he graciously brought me back home to Him.  I pray others that have left have time to come back to the Lord and those that have never known Him to seek and find Him. Jesus Christ is the one and only way to eternal life"
It is indeed amazing that two years before the nation was warned about 911 but no one heeded the warnings. Mind boggling that God even bothered to warn us after we killed over 6 billion babies. I feel like Jonah and sort of think we get what we deserve. He was upset that the people repented and disaster was averted. I am so angry at the death of the babies I want to see justice served but luckily I am not God. Return!
I have read both Harbinger books and highly recommend reading them.  God is trying so hard to get our attention and our world just goes merrily on the way to hell.  Please take seriously and  heed the warnings that God has graciously given us to give our hearts to him in repentance and spend eternity with him.
This book reveals so much that has been going wrong in America. It is time to return to God as a nation and people. We have been so blessed and have forgotten who did the blessing. The message is strong. The book is a bit redundant at times but I think it aided in a more complete grasp of the urgency of the message. I am so glad I read both Harbinger books and I highly recommend others to do so! Soon!
"This book continues from the first book the Harbinger. It is a wake up call to individules, the church, this country and the world to get your priorities and heart right with God. It was hard to put down after starting it.I highly reccomend reading this book."
"You know, Rabbi Cahn really should have included a spatula with his book.  The readers need one to pick up their jaws from the floor while reading his book.  There will always be those that shrug about the information but, surely a thinker will notice that these things are beyond coincidental."
"As always, Cahn calls for repentance and faith in Savior Jesus Christ.  He ties God's grace to repentance -- and relates the founding of the USA, the virus, riots, etc to what God allows to turn His people and those unsaved back to Him.  Judgement tends to come in the fall.  Appreciate that Cahn is careful to never date set, as repentance and prayer can turn God (think Ninevah)."
"I have seldom read anything quite like this book!  I am utterly amazed at the research done in history showing the parallels occurring in this outstanding warning to our nation as a nation as well as individuals of that nation. I pray that this book falls into the hands  of our leaders and that its message pierces their hearts and lives. Thank you, Mr. Cahn for sounding the alarm a second time. Thank you , God Almighty,  for giving this Man insight and COURAGE to answer your call."
"I expected more from the book. It is very repetitive. I read the whole thing, waiting for more information, and was disappointed. It seemed to me the book could have been a booklet or an article, and that the information was deliberately couched into kind of fictional narrative simply to ""plump up"" the content. For me, it wasn't sufficient to overcome the lack of substance."
Awesome continuation of his first book. But more relevant to the Times we are living in. Each harbinger is directly correlated to the Times in the Bible Israel went through. This is a definite warning that time of repentance is now. Our country was founded on Godly Principles and unless we return we are doomed.
"It moved a little slow to begin with, but once it got going, I couldn't put it down. This book brings us to today in the midst of the pandemic. And all I can say is ""wow!"" We need prayer like never before if this nation is to survive. As a nation we must repent or we will go the way of ancient Israel."
"I bought this for my eldest son. He finished it last night. He couldn't stop thanking me for purchasing him the book. To me, this is important. That future generations learn from the past in order to face the future with assurance that God is in control of it."
"Interesting Book, but as reminder to all believers we must each study to show ourselves approved unto God to rightly divide the word of truth. For there is no private interpretation of the scriptures. But the Spirit of God leads and guide us into all truth."
I love the format it was so easy to read and understand. There were so many shocking facts I double checked quite a few of them. I would recommend to anyone. Even if you read it as fiction the facts will slap you in the head. Haha. I was energized and moved to RETURN!
"An eye opening read. Turns out Vice President Pence used Ronald Reagan‚Äôs bible and placed his hand on Chronicles 2 when he was sworn in as VP.  ‚ÄúIf my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land."""
"Having read all of Rabbi Cahn's books and having followed him on FB for a while, I was expecting my reactions to be as they were.  Without a doubt I was not disappointed.  He has an engaging pattern to his revelations and the revelations are very clear and verifiable.  He stays the course set for us in The Harbinger and faithfully gives us all we need to follow the will of God.  It's a fine book in its own right; but I personally think it will be even more effective for the reader who has already read the first Harbinger book."
Riveting! A real page turner!  Truly a must read for all Americans. A little depressing at the beginning (such as life) but ends with hope so keep reading.  The sharing of specific dates and events is shockingyet exciting.  Thank you so much Rabbi!
This book further opens your eyes to the mysteries of the Bible.  It is captivating and intriguing.  Once you start it you can't put it down.
I got this book as a request by my mother.  She read it from cover to cover and really enjoyed it.
"The book left me spellbound in places as Mr. Kahn laid out the harbingers that we have been sent. He takes us back through the beginnings of the United States of America and how closely we are tied to Israel. He explains things in a way that is easy to understand. And he backs up his claims with notes at the end, not quite a full bibliography, which I used and then did my own fact checks. As far  as I  can  see, he was truthful in his telling the story and the facts."
Anyone reading this book should with a searching mind into where we stand today. It is related to Gods word for each of us today.  It should make us want to study The Bible so we understand what is happening today.  I urge everyone to read this book.
"WOW, this book will truly blow your mind.  The intricate web of details from ancient history to present day is incredible!  I fact checked over 70% of the information and dates confirming they were historically accurate.  I highly recommend this book, an essential read!"
"Jonathan Cahn has done it again!  Be prepared to be blown away. He not only explains what is going on in our country but why and where it all started AND backs it up with scripture.  It's time for America to turn back to God, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob the God that blessed this nation from its birth."
"While the book is written as a story, it relates to actual biblical scripture to recent events.  I find this book very enlightening in ways I never imagined. It combines history with current events to explain prophecy and the beginning of the end of time before the second coming of Christ. Great reading."
The author needs to learn how to explain things better. He is a very tough person to get through.
"A look at things from a perspective of wisdom and logic.  How important it is to challenge group pressure and current education where thought is restricted to one path, their's. We do need to return to our foundation of government guided in faith."
"I‚Äôve been following Jonathan Cahn for a short period of time. However, I admire his insights and how he relates things to scripture"
Great book.  If you liked The Harbinger you will love Harbinger II.
The Harbinger blew me away! Harbinger 2 The Return is even better. Johnathan Cahn is a gifted writer
Excellent well written Amazingly seeing the direction this country is taking if we don‚Äôt change our ways Not preachy Makes you thinküá∫üá∏üíï
Glad to receive this book
An interesting account of the why of recent events in the United States right up to the pandemic.. For anyone interested in the why of recent tragic events in the United States ranging from 9-11 to the pandemic
"Jonathan Cahn is indeed a watchman on the wall. He has heard the Words of God through the Holy Spirit for this time in the most profound and convincing evidence I‚Äôve heard. Listen to what is spoken and heed the call to return to God. God, in His great love and mercy has given us an opportunity to come humbly before Him and find life eternal. Please read this book and share it with family and friends"
"Fascinating read. Scriptures instruct us to watch for signs of the times. This book should inspire every Christian to be alert and live out the gospel intentionally, expecting Christ's return. Yet, ultimately our trust is fully in Christ and the scriptures. The underlying these in the book is ""Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord."" It is a call to personal and national repentance."
Its an unparalleled book of mindblowing facts that can be proven that link America to many biblical events and you have to have an open mind to really get the jest of it. If you are ready to take the RED PILL READ IT!
"For any Christian who seeks to understand the Jewish connection to modern events, this book is your roadmap.  Jonathan Chan‚Äôs  books are often college level material  presented in an understandable way.  The timeline in this book shows how far from the religious roots of the founding of our country to todays falling away.  Time is quickly running out for our country to come back to God."
"Everyone should read this book to know how to cure the United States. Sure opened my eyes to how United States can be saved. Thank you, Jonathan."
The ramifications of our present day are clearly seen in historical context in this book. The prophetic underpinning of Cahn's books is an amazing gift to all of us.
It would great if an example of the future were provided to show the people that Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.‚Äù
"An awesome book for those not only hungry for revelation but also those wanting hope on change and what to do. I will admit the book was a little longer than expected but overall, I am glad I got a chance to read it."
This book will rock your world!  It tells the truth about what is REALLY going on!!!! Wow!!!!
I have read several of his books.  His point of view is very well reasoned and entertaining as well.  I am a fan.
"This BOOK is what everyone needs to read to understand what is happening in HISTORY! Great historical and social analysis of events in the USA from it's FOUNDATIONS to it's PRESENT ""State!"""
Do your homework and look up scriptures and actual transcripts.  It‚Äôs accurate and scary as all heck.  Well written
Gift
Awesome books! Great message! I got chills through  the majority of these two books. I am amazed at what I've read. A must read for everyone!!
I really loved the entire book. I felt that it was a message from God & He was showing us where America is headed if we don't repent. We were also shown how we are repeating history.
Like all of Rabi Cahn's books this one has a timely message about the future of the USA and what lies ahead for all mankind.
What's not to like!!!  I've read the first and this was a great second
I am enjoying the study guide and everything about this. Thank you
This is a sacking up call for everyone who believe in the power of  God.It is very powerful and this I would never thought about.I learned a lot of history ready this book
This is history and prophecy wrapped together into an amazing book.
"A sequel to The Harbinger.  This book continues where The Harbinger left off, explaining new harbingers of the future fall of the United States.  This book is nonfiction, however it's written with fictional characters to present facts in a new way."
Johnathan Cahn is right on and is warning America of it‚Äôs ungodly ways.
"Book not as good as the first Harbinger, but still a good read."
Delivery was quick. Book is extremely interesting and I‚Äôm not a reader.
"Love the feel, love the print, love the size and thinness. Was easy to carry around to my bible study and hold under the arm or carry while visiting with others. Simple format and easy on the eyes to read. Love the cover too."
Love our bibles! Use them every Sunday l. God Bless!
great for my aging relative!
Easy to read and study. My best was given Bible as a gift she loves this Bible.
"We got 5, buy these to give away, price point is great. 10.5 is not large it's larger than most bibles its size but it's a nice size. If a person has vision problems go for a giant print bible. This is a good larger print bible. Lays flat which is good. Very nice bible."
It's not the bible's fault...ordered black and it came labelled charcoal..or as it appears gray!  while not exactly right I am still happy with it!
Perfect it. Large print. Deep gray color. Very nice cover. Exactly what I wanted.

Great
"Little minds ask big questions as they are walking their faith journey and making their faith their own. One of those questions is surely to be, ‚ÄúWhat is God Like‚Äù. This book answers that question in such a beautiful way that children and adults alike will find solace as they form their faith. Both Rachel and Matthew have given such beautiful answers that truly help a child understand what God is like, using gorgeous illustrative language that will appeal to young and old alike. I think the true picture of beautiful children‚Äôs literature is when the adult reading it to their children finds answers to their childlike faith questions, and this book certainly does that."
Have missed Rachel‚Äôs voice so much. This book does a wonderful job of capturing it and it is just filled with love. I wish I grew up believing these truths about God rather than believing that God was always angry and waiting for me to mess up. What a gift that Matthew Paul Turner was able to complete this book and bring it to a world that desperately needs it. This books will resonate with both young and old.
"The book is beautiful and inclusive of all peoples and abilities. I cannot say enough about how wonderful it was to read a book for children that spoke to the safety and comfort that God provides, that reads in a way they can understand, and reminds the adult reader that God is there for them as well. In a quiet place, in the wind, as an artist, all around. Well done, very well done."
"This is a breathtaking book.""But whenever you aren't sure what God is like, think about what makes you feel safe, and what makes you feel brave, and what makes you feel loved. That's what God is like.""I immediately preordered ‚ÄúWhat is GOD Like?‚Äù as soon as it was announced because I loved the work of Rachel Held Evans, and Matthew Paul Turner‚Äôs books have been some of our family favorites. I had incredibly high expectations and still it surpassed them. When I read it, I immediately ordered more for both kids and adults in my life.Though it is certainly coming from the Christian perspective, this book is not heavy handed, and I would recommend it to people of all faiths. It leaves much room for mystery, which if we are honest, is the only authentic way to engage this question.If you have issues with God being referred to not just as a ‚Äúhe‚Äù but also as a ‚Äúshe‚Äù or ‚Äúthey‚Äù then this is not the book for you. If this is you and you identify as a Christian, I would encourage you to think about why this bothers you and to take another look at how God and the Trinity are described in the Bible. Rachel Held Evan‚Äôs other non-children‚Äôs book work is a great starting place for this if you need one.When I read it, this book feels like a safe place or a supportive friend. It gently reminded the deepest parts of my heart that God is love. I cannot think of any other book that I was more excited to share with my 3-year-old son than this one‚Ä¶ In truth though, it is one that I keep re-reading to myself."
"What Is God Like? is the most beautiful children‚Äôs book describing who God is. As someone who found RHE‚Äôs work after she passed when I started going through my own faith deconstruction, the timing of this book is so helpful for the stage of life with parenting young children (4,6&8). It can be really difficult answering questions about God with young children when you aren‚Äôt sure who God is yourself. What Is God Like? has been helpful having those conversations with my children AND helpful while figuring out my own beliefs.I love that it is inclusive with the pronouns of God (he, she and they) and with the illustrations of the characters including people of color, those with disabilities, and LGBTQ+ people. Speaking of illustrations, I don‚Äôt know if I ever seen a more beautiful work of art on every single page. Ying Hui Tan did an amazing job making this book come to life."
"I preordered this book months ago, so when it showed up on my doorstep this morning, I was thrilled! I fell in love with Rachel Held Evans and her books many years ago and had to get her last book (published posthumously). While it was written as a children‚Äôs book for ages 3-7, I think it‚Äôs a book we all need. Definitely for all ages!‚ÄúBut whenever you aren‚Äôt sure what God is like, think about what makes you feel safe, what makes you feel brave, and what makes you feel loved. That‚Äôs what God is like.‚Äù RHE"
"The most beautifully inclusive and loving children's book I've ever read. Matthew Paul Turner honors Rachel Held Evans' legacy by completing ""What is God Like?"" in such a way that reflects Rachel's admiration for God, her belief that God is love, and her love for God's people. Their gentle words give children permission to ask questions without shame, while reminding them that ""But whenever you aren't sure what God is like, think about what makes you feel safe, what makes you feel brave, and what makes you feel loved."" Favorite line of all! This is not only a children's book. Buy it for yourself! If you have a difficult relationship with the Church, I think this book will be healing to your soul. If you have a child in your life, this is the description of God you'll want them to grow to know. The illustrations are gorgeous and include children of color, children with disabilities, and give a nod to the LGBTQ community. I will be buying this book as a gift for years to come."
"I preordered this book as soon as  I heard about it and am so glad I did. I loved all of Rachel's books and this one is no exception. It made me tear up the first time I read it. It beautiful approaches the concept of ""God"" for children, without preaching at them, and leaving much space for mystery. I'm not sure how anyone could find anything ""wrong"" with this book. (But I know someone will.) It's comforting. Reading it is like snuggling under a weighted blanket. I bought it for my grandkids and am ordering another copy for myself. Beautiful illustrations as well!"
"Two of the things I loved about Rachel Held Evans are that she really knew how to tell a story and she wasn‚Äôt afraid to take on big topics and  issues. Both of those traits are beautifully embodied in ‚ÄúWhat Is God Like,‚Äù co-authored by Rachel and Matthew Paul Turner. Their words are at once, both powerful and relatable. The illustrations by Ying Hui Tan are filled with children and adults forming a beautiful mosaic of races and genders. The book‚Äôs format invites the reader to pause every so often to take in the imagery and put themselves in the story.  Whether the reader is an adult seeking remembrance or a child seeking to discover, this book is one they‚Äôll read over and over again."
"I wish I‚Äôd had this book when my two children were young, when my two teen grandchildren were younger, but in reality it doesn‚Äôt matter - because within its pages the message is universally ageless and timeless.  If you want to see how big Rachel‚Äôs heart was - it is imprinted within this book.  Her inquisitive nature led her to question, to yearn for answers, to evolve, to take in the stories from those around her.  She also cared deeply as a wife, mother, author, and friend to a diverse group of people - many of us going through our own questioning.This story will bring a sense of curiosity and wonder to the inquisitive minds who read it.  I can hear those voices now‚Ä¶a resounding cacophony of ‚Äúahhhhh‚Ä¶.this is just the best feel-good message‚Äù.  A message we can each tenderly carry within own hearts.  So grateful to her husband Dan Jonce Evans, co-author Matthew Paul Turner, illustrator Ying Hui Tan, for giving Rachel‚Äôs heart to us in this beautiful book‚Ä¶for her heart led her to discover more of God‚Äôs mystery and love‚Ä¶and then share it with us.  I plan to share her book with many, but also believe you will feel compelled to do the same‚Ä¶no mystery there."
What a beautiful story to teach my girls and remind me of God‚Äôs goodness.
This book is beautifully written and illustrated. It will be my go-to baby/small child gift from now on. I purchased it as a gift for my niece (2 yo) but my kids (8 and 10) loved it too.
"""What is God Like?"" Is a glimpse into all the parts of God. This is a great read for all kids. I will be gifting this book many times over! I love the illustrations as well. So beautiful and inclusive."
Beautifully written and illustrated! A wonderful finished product from the late Rachel Held Evans and Matthew Paul Turner. I can‚Äôt wait to read this with my youngest daughter!!
"What Is GOD Like?  That is a great question.  ""What is GOD Like?"" is a beautifully written and illustrated picture book for children.  It innocently explains (from a secular point of view) who and what GOD is.  Though we cannot see GOD, we see His reflection in the wonders of nature and the loved ones in our life, whether they are parents or best friends.  I like that the children in this story consists of various races and genders.  One child is physically challenged.My only issue with this children's book is that the word ""love"" is never used in the text.  I read and reread it several times.  It is nearly impossible to describe GOD without using this word.  The entire Bible can be summed up with one verse:  John 3:16 NIV.  ""For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.""  GOD is love and He commanded us to love one another.  No exceptions.  God showed us what He is like through His son, Jesus.We recently had a toxic presidential administration that divided our country in more ways than I thought possible.  Even the Christian community has been divided, which is a shame.  I enjoyed reading ""What Is GOD Like?""  However, you can't describe GOD without using love and mentioning His son, Jesus, who represented the complete expression of GOD's love for us.  You can't write a Christian book without referencing Christ.  Therefore, I have a question.  Was this truly intended to be a Christian book?Thanks to Goodreads and Convergent for providing me with an advanced copy of ""What is GOD Like?"""
It speaks love and grace. It shows dream and reality. It will come alive in you so that you know what God is truly like. God  is like you and me.
"This book is only for progressive or liberal Christians. No mention of Jesus or love or anything biblical, but refers to God as multiple genders (again- not even once done in the Bible) and shows the same propaganda in the pictures . Amazon shows that this book has mostly 5 star reviews and almost no 1 star reviews despite the fact that there is more bad reviews then good. Again- if you want a biblical Bible story for kids just like I did then this book IS NOT FOR YOU. Don‚Äôt corrupt the name of God and lie about his character. Luckily I read this before showing to my kids‚Ä¶"
"Super excited to get this book after pre-ordering it. The illustrations are brand it will be a great addition to our library. I do need to add a disclaimer though.*This part can mean different things to different people but I do think it's good to know before purchasing. There is a gender and sexual identity element that I did not feel was necessary and I'm not a fan of the waybit was executed. On one page it refers to God as He, She, They or something along those lines. I understand the authors heart and wanting to communicate God's love for all, but that took it a little too far for me. Some people might love that about this book but it might catch some off guard like me."
"This book is pushing a human agenda and is incredibly politicized and to be frank, heretical. It was a gift for my children (from a relative) that they read once and that is it. But some of the best teachable moments come from complete disasters. If you are truly a believer, this book should be considered a hard pass for young kids, or possibly a discussion topic for teens on things we need to watch out for. Remember John 15:18-19."
This book refers to God as ‚Äúshe‚Äù and ‚Äúthey‚Äù. Also has an unusual fairly-like creature that show up on every page and includes an image of a woman (or man) with a beard and lipstick on. I am very disappointed and will be returning the book. What a way to mix poison in with the sweetness of who our God truly is. Too bad I didn‚Äôt research the author prior to purchasing the book-I would have quickly discovered that her doctrine and theology are not sound.
"Others have pointed this out well. But these images/descriptions here are not biblical.They're trying to sneak in progressive & woke agendas even in ""Christian"" children's books. Very deceiving."
"This is a great discussion of what God is like for children. The words and images come together to give the reader a sense of the possibilities of God and helps parents explain what is so hard to explain. RHE‚Äôs ideas, MPT‚Äôs words and the artist‚Äôs rendering of the two creates an amazing and impactful experience for kids and their parents."
"My kids both love Matthew Paul Turner's books, and his newest book alongside Rachel Held Evans' words and Ying Hui Tan's art is a true gift. We love the diversity and representation, the expansive ways of understanding God, the simplicity of the message, and the love that's threaded throughout the pages. Thank you."
"I really like the imagination that this book promotes. This page is the only one I take issue with. As a Catholic we do not refer to God as She or They. The Church is She, the Holy Trinity is They, but God is One Being, therefore He. An important theological distinction if you‚Äôre a Catholic looking to buy this book.Also on another note, the illustrations are somewhat blurry or unclear. Not as vibrant as I was expecting from pictures."
It portraits God as a she? And.... Just doesn't fit the Bible that I know of. The drawings are cute that is all that I can say.
"I've read Rachel Held Evan's blog and books for years. I was happy to share this inclusive book with my kids. My daughter thought comparing God to a fort was weird, so I told her that one came straight from the Bible. We're now reading through the Psalms together."
I gave these books to my grandchildren and my nephews.  Gives children something to actually equate God to besides a Lincoln Sized Memorial in the Sky. Loved that they used all pronouns to describe God‚Ä¶. He is like‚Ä¶. She is like‚Ä¶. They are like‚Ä¶!  Includes demonstrations with racial diversity and special needs children.  üåüüåüüåü
"What Is God Like? is a wonderfully written and amazingly illustrated book that answers the question about God in so many different ways. The childlike question is answered in thoughtful ways that show the many facets of God's personality and traits. The book is written for children, but it is a brilliant reminder for adults about the reality of who God is without all of our doctrine, rules, or structure imposed on God. Reading this book with my daughter made my eyes tear up and my heart warm at thinking of instilling this loving, brave view of God.Matthew Paul Turner took the words that Rachel Held Evans wrote before she died and created a space for them to shine brightly. Ying Hui Tan's illustrations are a diverse and remarkable understanding of God and those who are created in God's image.I received an Advanced Reader Copy of the book from the publisher."
Rachel Held Evans is a gift! Losing her was a terrible loss - this book is beautiful gift from her legacy! I cried reading it and can't wait to share it with the children in my ministry program. Seriously a beautiful book and a blessing!
"I own every adult book by Rachel held Evans, so of course I had to buy this the day it came out. I love it. Thank you for presenting a slightly unorthodox but meaningful depiction of God's love. Recommend!"
"Some might say, ‚Äúit‚Äôs liberal‚Äù but it‚Äôs honestly a beautiful and inclusive (picture) story. If being inclusive of ALL different types of people is wrong, than I don‚Äôt want to live in that person‚Äôs ‚Äúright‚Äù world. God made all of us in his image, even those whom you might not relate to or look like."
This book is so lovely and perfect. Rachel was such a genius with words and I miss her wisdom so much. We literally cried my way through her meaningful description of God through this book.
I seldom write reviews for purchases but this book is just too good not to. Both my husband (who is a pastor) and myself were brought to tears by the beauty of both the words and illustrations. Overwhelmed by how simply beautiful it is. ‚ô•Ô∏è
"As beautifully written and illustrated as this book is, there are some minute theological gaps that prevented me from granting it the kind of rating that it could have deserved."
I loved this book. I first heard it read by someone at my church. I wanted a copy for myself; I am really glad I bought it. The illustrations are wonderful and the prose is inclusive and nonthreatening.  A must for all adults who have a scary picture inside of God. A healing treasure.
"I look forward to reading this book to my daughter over and over as she grows up. Being able to show her that God‚Äôs love is for everyone is very important to me, and the comforting words from Rachel and Matthew, and the inclusive illustrations from Ying will be great examples for her to see. Rachel‚Äôs legacy is wonderfully honored in Matthew and Ying‚Äôs work finishing this book, and I thank them for that."
Miss you Rachel. Grateful to this one last book that helps speak to my children.
"Like all of Matthew Paul Turner‚Äôs books, this is a beautiful way to share God with little ones. Together with RHE, they crafted a fabulous look into the mystery and vastness of God and yet the truth of who we can know Him to be and how we can experience Him. I‚Äôm always so excited for my kids to read MPT‚Äôs books and this is no exception!!"
"Well-written, masterfully illustrated, child-appropriate and thought-provoking for adults."
This book is unlike any book I read about God growing up - and I‚Äôm so thankful for that! We are forever grateful for Rachel‚Äôs words and how they will help children grow up understanding more of the truth about who God is.
Thoughtful and creative way to demonstrate God. Love reading this with my girls.
Totally Wonderful Book for All Ages
This beautiful book represents all that is heaven.
"We love reading this book to our twin toddlers! Beautiful depictions of God‚Äôs goodness, and yes‚Äîthe divine essence of God that is both masculine and feminine, in part, and also transcends such human distinctions."
"The wording and artwork in this book both contribute to a sense of God that is both awesome and relatable for children. If your goal is for children to fall in love with a God who loves them, this is your book."
Heard about this book through a podcast. Immediately bought it and my kids as well as myself absolutely love it!
"Beautiful, truthful, and something everyone should experience!"
This book is incredible. In-cre-di-ble!
This is a beautifully brilliant book that challenges my own perceptions of God and brought me to tears. I'm grateful to have such an amazing book to read to my little boys.
This is a great book written by a great friend!
"My wife is a big Max Lucado fan, so when I bought her this book and did the same for myself I was really looking forward to reading it. It explores all the different facets of the well-known Philippians 4 passage on being anxious ‚Äî reported by this book to be the most highlighted verses of the Bible. As I started working my way through the book, however, I found some interesting anecdotes and solid common-sense application, but nothing really surprising or revelatory. Finally I broached the subject with my wife, who had also been reading the book on her own. She confirmed the impression I had gotten: While certainly containing sound Biblical teaching, this book is not on par with Lucado's other writings. What this book does do a good job of emphasizing is that the Creator of the universe is in control of your life, too. My ""other"" read during this time was an astronomy textbook, and so that point struck me quite poignantly. If you consider the smallness of man, then your problems (and their contrast to God's immense power) fall into perspective. I don't dis-recommend this book, and don't have a better Biblical alternative to suggest, but if you are a follower of Max Lucado you may be a little disappointed.For a strictly secular book on the topic, I highly recommend Dr. Gary Small's compact book ""The Small Guide to Anxiety"". I will warn you that this clinical tome is a little dry compared to your average self-help book, but does include interesting case studies, provides excellent coverage of all the various forms of anxiety and related problems and their treatment, and best of all includes a variety of relaxation exercises which are easy to start practicing right away. This short book provides a very solid psychological background on the topic of anxiety, and a scientific foundation for any subsequent reading, religious or otherwise."
"Life hands us many blessings, many troubles. Right now in my life the anxious, scary and worrisome thoughts could take over if I let them. Using all the tools I could summon I was blessed to find this book. Max gives such great reminders and insights, Bible based instructions on how to remain in the arms of God while walking in the valley of darkness. I would recommend this book"
"I liked the content of Max's message though there wasn't anything new on dealing with anxiety in the book. There are two outstanding issues that continue to bother me. The first is not enough emphasis on seeking professional help. For many people, anxiety is a crippling and dangerous disease that isn't overcome without professional assistance. The second is the over abundant use of pull quotes. In publishing, over use of pull quotes is a cheat and very much dilutes the power of an otherwise great book. I would have purchased the book for the asking price with 200 pages only and without the annoying pull quotes. Shame on the kindle formatting too! The zero formatting applied to the pull quotes in the kindle version makes them more confusing and annoying. Come on, this is simply unacceptable."
"As Christians we sometimes get caught in a tar pit of anxiety and worry that‚Äôs even stickier because we may believe it indicates weakness. We start to wonder if we really are Christians, because shouldn‚Äôt we always be confident in God‚Äôs promises? Shouldn‚Äôt we, of all people, be free from worry and anxiety?This book is a wonderful reminder that we‚Äôre human, and that anxiety and worry are part of that human experience. And it reminds us further that God does have plans to prosper us and guard us, and that trusting in him is a path out of anxiety. Gratitude, as well, keeps us present in today. Worry lives in yesterday and tomorrow‚Äîthose two places where we are powerless, ignorant, maybe ashamed and often afraid.This book, like all of Lucado‚Äôs work, is comforting and inspiring. It‚Äôs a heartbeat we can get into step with, and learn how to look away from the storm and the rough sea and look to the calming face of Jesus.I highly recommend this book for finding a path to inner peace during times of high anxiety."
"This is a fantastic book that I believe everyone could benefit from reading.I think I have been a fairly anxious person in the past, though I‚Äôve always been decent at masking it.  Nowadays as an adult with a family of my own, I am less anxious about most things.  But, since I have lived the life of ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù I now can recognize anxiety in other people more easily.  I‚Äôm not talking about the overused term of today‚Äôs younger generation, but actual real dread and fear that some people feel every day.It‚Äôs comforting to think that we can place our worries on something or someone else.  It‚Äôs refreshing to me to read about faith.  I can understand now why people need faith and organized religion.I know too many people who stand at the banks of the If Only River mentioned in Chapter 7.  They don‚Äôt live in a life of now, they only live in a life of constant want.  I think striving for more in life is a good thing ‚Äì but the people who are standing at the shore are the ones who never do anything about what they believe they need to make them happy.  Perhaps this book would push those people to grab a canoe and start paddling across the river."
Thank you Max Lucado for following God's prompting and writing this book for all of us!  What a perfect reminder from God to depend on him for everything always and it has really helped me start my day in a more positive calm and exciting way.  I look forward to what He will do each new day in my life as I choose to glorify him instead of worrying about this crazy mixed up world.  This book will relieve so much stress for anyone who is anxious if they will read it with an open heart!
"I‚Äôve appreciated Lucados writing ever since first reading ‚ÄúNo wonder they call Him the Savior‚Äù (in one night in college!). This might be my new favorite. His excellent writing style, keen insight into people and our struggles, and exposition and application on Scripture make this one of my favorite books of the past year. Highly recommended!"
"I‚Äôm sure this book would be great for some people, but as someone who truly suffers with anxiety/depression, the overarching theme of just ‚Äútrust God‚Äù doesn‚Äôt cut it. I prefer books with more practical suggests about how I can come to the conclusion myself to always trust God and be comfortable living with that."
This was such an easy read. I had been anxious about a number of changes in my career and at home so I decided this book might help. It was exactly what I needed. Max Lucado invites the reader to be active in overcoming their anxiety. His writing is empathic and reminded me of God's grace and promises to calm my heart. He made the scriptures easy to understand. This book is reassuring and encouraging with no judgement. It simply encourages the reader to focus on our faith and an amazing God while reminding us we are not responsible for controlling the universe. I highly recommend this book to anyone experiencing anxiety or worry.
"Each page had more intuitive, thought provoking shut my mouth & start writing type of book!!!  I started this book, anxious for nothing, feeling like I was taking a journey of all journeys!  Hands down, A great read!  (Between pages 185 & 186, it must have blinked...for there are numbers I could not write down....now I am a total nerd, but what happened in High School to this adulthood persona, Hahahahahaha....I was looking forward to answering the vanished questions!!!)  I hope someone will read my review & get back to me if you find these questions!!  :)"
I actually meant the review for the study book be for this book.  We have really enjoyed it.
"This book is a must read for all because there isn‚Äôt one person who hasn‚Äôt let the devil in during times of stress or anxiety!  Satin is alive and well, and this book teaches how to put him in his place and focus on the constant and that is our Lord and Savior.  Thank you Max for encouraging all of us!"
This was a gift for a friend and she said she likes the book.  I haven‚Äôt had a chance to read it yet but will as soon as she finishes with it.
Very helpful and inspiring to those are wish to make a change in their life. Max Lucado is wonderful. Thank you
Love this book I enjoyed it very much. It was easy to read and understandable. In my bible study group we all read it and has though us to depend more on  not lean on our own understanding.
"This study is excellent. Max provides scripture-based, practical tools for dealing with anxiety the way God intended.  These tools are presented in a way that is easy to follow, easy to remember, and easy to implement. I strongly encourage anyone who has ever had an anxious thought to work through this study, memorize the tools, and put them into practice. If you know someone else who struggles with anxiety, go through this study with them. It will be the best gift anyone has ever given them."
"The pages are filled with wonderful advice and life's applications.  We used it for our small group study & everyone benefitted by it.  Like a lot of Max Lucado's books, you can refer back to it over & over and find inspiration and help whatever your circumstances."
"I needed this book! Max's writing is always profound and yet simple. It feels like having a conversation with a great friend. The Biblical truths, inspiring stories and practical applications infused into every page of this book are potentially life-changing. I felt peace on every page. After completing it, I can honestly say I have more faith and less stress."
"Life changing book, absolutely love it. I highly reccomend to anyone struggling with anxiety or not!"
Great book. If you struggle with constant fear and anxiety.... I need to read it again. :) Max speaks In normal folks English. He doesn't use A lot of theological bumbo jumbo.  He's my favorite author
Very good teaching book
GREAT
"Great read, especially because of anxiety issues. I will probably read this book multiple times throughout my life. Highly recommend!"
So much great bible advice in this book. Explained so anyone can understand it.
Thanks
Good read and helpful
Such a great read in this busy life!
"By chance, I started reading this in March, 2020 as the coronavirus was brand new in the media.  For the next six weeks, it really helped me and taught me things I can use for a lifetime."
Great read so far
Great book. Just what o wanted.
"What I love about this book is it is straight from scripture.  As a Christian, the most important thing to know is what the Bible says about topics."
MAX LUCADO does it again.
Absolutely wonderful book!!!!!
"Max is easy to read , excellent"
The letter font is way too small to read comfortably.
"I felt as if Max and I were sitting in a room together. He put me at ease and explained things in a way that I could understand, and that made sense. I love his writing style and the stories that intersperse the narrative. I will come back to this book time and again."
A great study on Anxiety
Wonderful read
good book
God's promises
"This book is AMAZING! Buy it, you will not regret it. I read it to my 4 yo and 2yo. They LOVE IT and I am learning too! The devotions are the great, but brief. Obviously my kids do no read yet but this is an easy read for young/ beginner readers. After we read we will typically YouTube whatever the learning was. Ie. One devotional talks about us being tools used by God and gives the example of a veined octopus using a tool. So after we read we looked up that octopus to see what the book was talking about!  We haven‚Äôt finished yet but we will definitely purchasing the follow up book How Great is our God!"
"The only downside to this purchase is that I was unable to ""look Inside"" at some of the devotions.  The one regarding the beginning of the universe, for example, is very conservative and does not allow for the big-bang theory.  Otherwise, this book is completely high quality and adorable."
"A friend on a FB group recommended it to a group of Christian Mom's. Have to say a spontaneous purchase, and to my surprised HE loves it...  He reads it to us in the car, before bed, at a meal.. My son is 10 - daughter 5 and I will tell you that WE are ALL fascinated by what this book is teaching US daily !!!  I actually used it as a tooth fairy gift, she is super behind, so this was a 4 tooth gift !!!  We homeschool, so bonus learning that we can dive into further ... Great gift - addition to your reading with purpose I call it ... !!! I think it will be a gift we give to friends - truly  great read... no yawn fest with this one... You want to read more !!!"
"I‚Äôm almost finished reading this with my daughter, and it has been a gift. I love science, and this is a great way to share this and impart some of my knowledge and interest all while showing her how to see God in everyday life. Reading this devotional should really only take about 3-5 minutes, but it often takes us a half hour because it leads to other questions about God and science. It‚Äôs been a wonderful way to have deeper discussions about our faith and life and is one of my favorite parts of the day. I‚Äôve already bought the other one to start next. Please write more!"
"For us, this is a great supplement to how I have already been using teachable moments to show my girls how God is an intelligent, creative, and loving Designer, as we explore life around us (yard, nature parks, museums) and in books.  My kids are now 5 and 6 and we recently started using this devotional in the mornings at the breakfast table.  We love it!!  I did NOT just want to get a Scripture or ‚Äúrelational‚Äù type of devotional, as one of my kiddos is not neurotypical...  Science offers a truth that serves as a bridge to The Truth, and I hope these seeds will stick and grow steadfast roots in the years to come."
"I bought this for my 8 year old son. We are Christians and he attends a specialty STEM school. I wanted to make sure that we start the day with the Truth, especially as it pertains to science, given the curriculum at his school. He reads one of these out loud during the drive to school in the morning and we discuss and pray. I‚Äôve been impressed with the writing‚Äîsuccinct, powerful, always points to the Word yet also has some fun and interesting ‚Äúdid you know?‚Äù facts. We have also given this as a gift. I will buy more Giglio devotional books due to my experience with this one."
"A beautiful book that shows how BIG God is and shatters the false dichotomy that one must either believe in God or science. A bit too advanced for my 2 year old grandchild, she still loves the pictures and me showing it to her. It‚Äôs perfect for school age kids, including my middle school class that I teach. The illustrations are detailed and beautiful. Im so glad Louie Giglio spent time writing this! As an adult believer, I find it a joyful devotional book. I plan to buy many as Christmas gifts!"
Our family has loved doing this devotional together.  The content is very engaging for a wide range of ages.  The problem we encountered was that the book started coming apart after only a few uses.  We were gentle with it but the pages just seemed to let go from the binding.  Now we have loose pages that get out of order frequently and some even misplaced.  It was mainly the section from page 64-191 that came completely apart from the cover.
"AMAZING!!! We bought this book for our 6 year old son for Christmas. (We always include a book in our children‚Äôs‚Äô gifts.) But this book has proven to not only be a favorite of our son‚Äôs but one of the entire family!! This is the book that is chosen by our kids for bedtime- reading nearly every night! And their parents LOVE it too!! First, it is not a long read at all, so perfect for just before going to bed even if it‚Äôs getting late! We also absolutely love the science facts! We have learned SO much!! But even more than that, we love the spiritual lessons that are taught to our kids (and to us!) They are so good and so challenging to children and adults alike!! We would recommend this book to everyone!!"
"This book is amazing!  It really relates to children well and each story has something the entire family can learn about.  My middle schooler leads my other children in devotional with this book.  It is written well, scripturally-sound,  illustrations are wonderful, and encourages spiritual growth and love and learning of the Word.  Overall, it is really a well-put-together book.  It has exceeded my expectations and I look forward to their devotion and seeing their excitement about how wonderful God made us and everything He spoke into existence.  It's a definite buy.  You won't be disappointed :)--My middle schooler's review:  I really like this book because it gives fun facts and it is easy to understand.  I like the way science is tied into God and I find this book very interesting.  One of my favorite birthday presents!"
We are in our 3rd time through this book and we still love it. My kids are 8 and 10. We are super excited for the new one to come out in November... I already pre-ordered it. We incorporated reading this into our bedtime routine before prayers. Usually I or my husband reads but sometimes the kids read and we help with harder words. They absolutely love it and I know that they'll do this with their own kids one day as a result!
"I want to give this book 5 stars.  We LOVE content. The kids (4,6, & 8) are interested,  engaged, and we all learn something. In that regard, it is perfect. But the binding is terrible. The middle section of pages have all come unglued and fallen out completely. I hope they fix this issue for the next book."
"We love the combination of science and the word of God written in a way that young children can understand. It opens up conversations and Illustrates how big God is in comparison to our universe, world, country, etc., and our problems we face every day. As adults reading to our child, we also learn new facts and each devotional is a needed reminder to our daily lives as well. It also helps teach your child how to pray to God about that topic, in praising Him, thanking Him, and asking Him.  Each devotional is 2 pages with big print, perfect length to hold their attention, with several pictures, including a bible verse and how that verse relates to us, science, and God, ending with a prayer and a fun facts section."
"My kids really enjoy the science discussions in this book. It varies significantly from day to day, and gives a wide variety of topics with a biblical, God-centered foundation. It's also nice to see a devotional that deviates a little bit from the typical story+discussion standard that I've seen among multiple other children's devotionals (not that those are bad, but once you have one or two... you probably don't need to buy any more)."
Great book for kids ages 3-12.  Me and my hubby LOVE reading it to our kids as a night time devotional.  Evokes lots of thoughts and questions about God and how amazing Our Creator is.  Great for kids who aren‚Äôt in a Christian homes too bc it builds upon that natural curiosity we have of our amazing universe.  Very cool book with lots of amazing facts of creationninyertwined with science - the perfect fit.
Our sweet son is obsessed with Louie giglio. those science DEVOS have left an impression on him. He said Louis giglio knows more about the Bible than anyone on earth because he includes a verse at the end of each chapter in his book. And he said his dad looks like him but with no wrinkles and not with white hair. We got lots of these for cousins and friends for Christmas- highly recommend!
"I bought this for my son simply because it‚Äôs Louie Giglio‚Äôs. It did not dissapoint. Every day has information on creation, which is highly interesting for kids. There is also a scripture quote and prayer. My son is often resistent to biblical books and finds them ‚Äúboring‚Äù, and he couldnt get enough of this. We have been doing more than a page per day because he loves it so!"
"I love this book. However, i docked it a star because i am disappointed that it doesnt have an index. Giglio's book, ""How Great is our God"" has an index which i use often to find lessons that my little one expresses interest in. This book (Indescribable) has a table of contents, but with chaper titles as vague as ""A Tool for God"", ""The Planner"", etc., i have no way of knowing where/if i can find info about my son's latest science question: what is fungus.Other than that, it's a great book."
"This book is perfect for inquisitive minds!  My science loving 8 year old had read this book numerous times and never tires of it!  Wonderful blend of all the questions I had from my science classes and how God created it all!  I believe the more science you understand, the more evidence for divine creation!"
"My kids (9 and 6 years old) have just asked me to stop reading this as devotions and instead read something that teaches them about God more. They like the science part. The devotion part is really weak - God made you, God loves you and that's it, basically.They have enjoyed Jesus Storybook Bible and The Action Bible."
The kids love this devotional.
I really like the ways that this book creatively looks at God's works in the world and connects them to our daily lives. It's been a great thing to read at bedtime with my son.
THE best!! These devotions are so SO good! They are absolutely fascinating for both my kids and me! They are so interesting and really open up your mind and show what an awesome God we have. I love this devotion. Plus I love the artwork too.
"My kids love this book! They love the fun facts about science that are included. Each lesson is pretty short. It has a scripture for each day, but isn't very scripture heavy. I would actually like it to have more Scripture. But it is Biblical. The pictures are all illustrated. This devotional is quick, excellent for family devotion time or a nightly devotion. It spans many ages. My 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 11 year old all love this devotion."
"This is an interesting angle: science and spirituality. Interesting and eye-opening for kinds -- and even for grown-ups who see science and religion in an either-or relation,"
Great book
Bought this for my 8 year old granddaughter to use for her nightly devotion. She and her mom take turns reading it. They both love it! Makes God‚Äôs creation come alive!
My kids love this devotional! There are so many fun facts and it‚Äôs enjoyable for the whole family. I love that they are learning while deepening their faith. Highly recommend
"My son LOVES this book! It was a surprise for him. It is much different than most devotional books. It has science and quirky things included. It's just really cool and interesting, PLUS teaches them about God's love and creation!"
Good book and the quality
My boys love this book!We read it every day and it‚Äôs been their go to for bedtime.We read it and then discuss it a bit.It also includes a little prayer that goes along with what was learned!
"We got this for my science-loving 7 year old for Christmas and it is even better than I had hoped. Not only are the science topics interesting, but the way the message is presented is just so well done. The book shows how we can look at God‚Äôs creation to learn about his character. It really is the best kids devotional I have seen."
"Bought for my kids 10,8,7. So far my completely independent reader, age 10, loves it. This would be perfect to incorporate into a daily lesson. Quick read and you can expand with further reading and discussion."
Our 10 year old really enjoys this devotional as he loves science and God! Hoping to find another one like it this Christmas!
I bought this to encourage my children to engage science and Christianity together rather than as opposing forces. Overall I think it does a great job of trying to incorporate the two into an entertaining/educational medium for young children.
"Read this with my grandson who‚Äôs 11. He looked forward to it every day. We will read the second book next! Bless you, Louie!"
"The best devotional we have...and we have lots. My son loves this devotional. As soon as he finishes it, he starts it back up again. We are hopeful for an indescribable part 2!"
this was for a gift.  fortunately I contacted the publisher and they rushed a replacement.  the book i received from Amazon had pages sticking out and cut off.. like one page was printed on top of another .. too complicated to explain but shame on them for not catching it.
Okay wow I am blown away by this book. So amazing! Been reading it to my five year before bed. So amazing perfectly written.
"So happy with this devotional! My girls are 4 and 6, and they not only look forward to reading this each day, but they remember the lessons!"
"I love the content of this book from what I have read, however it came damaged. The front has some scratches and the top corner of the binding is torn. Next time I'll just buy from Christian book."
I love this book and so do my girls! The both have a science brain and to be able to explain God and science in an easy and clear way is so amazing!
"I couldn't be happier with this purchase! My boys are excited about God! We read a passage every night and they repeat the prayers, which are perfectly written. I want to raise good, kind boys and this book helps set the stage. Definitely recommend."
What a wonderful and scientific book blending God's truth in fun and meaningful ways.Makes for a terrific gift!
My niece loves it! She loves to read and this is a great way for her to learn from the Word of God and do her own Bible study. I also got the other book for my nephew.
"The science presented in this book shows the awesome power of the Almighty without apology. It is the perfect devotional for His children, who know that all of creation worships GOD."
"I read this to my girls, 5 and 2, every morning.  Its fun and short so they pay attention."
"Bought for my 5-year-old. It's meant for kids a little older, but he will enjoy it in a year or two! I read some of it and it's very well written."
Wonderful book for kids. Tells about many scientific wonders and then gives the right  credit to our amazing creative God.
"Just a heads up, the description says it includes STEM activities but I‚Äôve looked through almost the entire book & couldn‚Äôt find any. Good devotionals but I was disappointed about this missing."
My boys are 4 and 8 and we have loved reading this devotion.
"We spend time almost every night reading this together, and we really enjoy it.  My kids age range can make it  difficult to find one devotional for both of them, and this one has passed with flying colors!"
"This is so great! We do one or two a week, and then stagger activities tied to the subject. My kids LOVE them. They are fun and quick, but incorporate a scripture, prayer, as well as scientific exploration. It leaves my kids thirsty for more!"
"Great bedtime/evening devotional with the kids. Short reading, with interesting facts and Bible verse."
"Exactly as described, a great devotional for kids!"
Informative and Biblically sound. A fun read for my husband and 5 year old
"The book content is wonderful and my Science loving boy looks forward to it every night; however, it is literally falling apart. Every time we turn a page, it comes unbound. I‚Äôve never purchased a book that was so poorly bound. It‚Äôs unfortunate because I‚Äôd like to reread it with him in a couple of years as he is able to grasp more it, but it is just a pile of pages at this point."
"High quality material. I like how it has an outline of different subjects.  For example, one child is a space nut, so we can read all the devotions on space.  Another of my kids loves animals, so we can focus on those.  We've enjoyed it so far."
"I bought this for my nephew for his 7th birthday. I thought it would be perfect because he's really into science activities. I was disappointed that there are no ""Easy to follow STEM based activities."" There are a lot of cool facts and it does have lots of verses about our amazing God. However, I may be returning this for something that actually has what was advertised."
"Shipping was fast, it arrived nicely packed. Beautiful book that keeps my kids curious, and longing for more devotional time every night. It is informative in a cool and fun ways for kids to learn about God, His creations and the Bible!"
Excellent bookMy grandson 11 years enjoyed it
Gift
These are great devotions!  A little long for us at bedtime.
Totally biblically based. Beautiful pictures. Great science insights. Every household should have this book for their kids. Your kids will love it.
Full of valuable information
great to read to my grandson - well written!
My 8 yr old reads this every morning. He's amazed by what he learns....and can't wait to tell me.
Love the content but the book is literally falling apart! I read it with my 7 year old so it‚Äôs not being handled roughly. But we love the devotions!!
Wonderful blessing to our morning time routine.
My 8 year old son ate these devotionals up! Great book with easy to read and understand devotionals! Great read and he loved learning new things about God and God‚Äôs creation!
This is a great devotion! I will say a little over my kindergarteners heads at times but they love learning cool facts.
"We‚Äôre not far into this book just yet, but I‚Äôm absolutely loving it so far!"
My 9 year old daughter has thanked me multiple times for her new devotional! She loves the science facts she‚Äôs learning about God‚Äôs amazing creating and is sharing it boldly with others! Very thankful and impressed with this devotional and would highly recommend it!
This book is Awesome! I read one page to my son every day and we learn so much. I love how science and God is put into each story. This book is great for anyone and so beautiful. I have already recommended this to a lot of people. Thank you for writing this.
"This devotion has been the biggest blessing to us, it blesses us so much that it's what we're giving all the kids in our lives for Christmas."
I love reading this devotional to my grandchildren daily!  It is a great book showing kids how amazing God is & all of the things He created!
Love this book!! ..bought 2 for my grandkids..beautifully done..great devotional or study guide...great service from seller: Passion Resources
My kid and I enjoyed reading this together at bedtime
We have tried reading multiple devotionals with our boys but they would always lose interest after a few days and not want to read. Not with this devotional! They look forward to it nightly and my 7 year old even asks for it if we forget. So good!
Beautifully illustrated book and I know the author.
"This book has encouraged many hearts!  I am a counselor in private practice, and some of my clients are not religious, so daily readings with Bible verses would not be appropriate for them.  I looked at many, many books of daily readings, finally finding this one.  Although Melody mentions God in a few places, this book is not ""preachy"" in any way, just heartwarming and growth-oriented.  It is a marvelously written series of encouraging messages that would lift anyone's spirit.  I often give a copy to clients who are needing encouragement in their search for wholeness.  I keep extra copies in my office so I always have a copy for new clients. I highly recommend this book -- in fact, I read the day's message each morning myself!"
This book is a great way to start your day. It is filled with daily excerpts that encourages a positive and mindful perspective on life. It is a must have for your collection or if you require an extra boost of positivity!
"A truly inspiring book that accompanies it's reader on a daily voyage of self-understanding and positive thinking. In a simple but clear way it reminds us of what is essential and helps us to focus on it. It promotes a healthy and compassionate mode of thinking all the while it opens our hearts to the people in our world, this fast-moving world in which we live today, that requires us to slow down and reflect on its beauty and the good that is always within our reach..."
"I loved her first daily reader, "" Language of Letting Go"" This one is just as good if not better. I felt like Melody and I grew together in the same direction, all of the pages are relevant to me today. Most times the meditations are right on for what I am going through, of course, this is how Spirit works. It is super yummy for the soul. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!"
"This book was recommended to me from a very dear friend, 3 years ago.  I'm on my 3rd go around. Each time I read it, it seems to be just what I need to read for that day.  I was going through some major life changes and this was very encouraging and gave me peace.  I would highly recommend this read to anyone!!"
Paper used is cheap like a cheap paperback and not like her other daily readers. Not the best if you like to highlight and take notes.  Content good.
"any book by Melody Beattie, if an addict or codependent is a valuable tool in the journey of recovery.  She shares her journey in daily readings.  This book was written in between her ""Language of Letting Go"" and ""More Language of Letting Go.""  Recovery is a process and we can slide back into old habits very easily, so that is why Ms. Beattie's books are so good to encourage and remind of the pitfalls that can drag us backward.  She also shows the joy of moving forward, even when it is not always easy."
One of my yoga instructors reads passages from this during class and there have been some truly impactful ones that stuck with me to this day. I‚Äôm happy to have finally gotten my own copy of this book! Very inspirational
I was given this book as a gift . I look forward to reading it every morning before I start my day. Each day of the year you read a short meditation most of them are less than a page long. The meditations really are motivating and introspective. I have purchased this as a gift for several people and they have also purchased it as a gift for others. I highly recommend! Great Boook!!!!!
Best journaling motivation for anyone struggling day to day or week.
"very good book, you really have to concentrate on the book when reading to fully focus and pay attention...  but very good book to read when you are alone, and really do not want to be bothered with talking..  has a lot of amazing things about every day life...  recommend it very much"
I decided to read The corresponding reflection every Day And it became a wonderful way to start The day. Thanks
This book is a must have. I come back to it often throughout the day and just pick a page for inspiration. I use it in my yoga classes to guide meditation  and I even read it to my kids before school.
My new favorite!
Read everyday and love it.
"This book was very helpful to me and my family members during a difficult time in our lives. Yet, beyond the healing energy- Journey to the Heart- also provides uplifting and empowering messages to help you heal and move forward. Thank you for a simple, quick, and meaningful guide into the heart and beyond."
"I was introduced to this book via my yoga studio, when they would read a paragraph after class.  I got one for myself and I love it and use it daily.  It has been invaluable and some of the daily paragraphs are just what I needed to hear that day.  I ended up getting a bunch of these so I could give one to each of my girlfriends as gifts."
I need a replacement for this book  You need to check your others as well to see how the pages can be missing ; looks like they were never set up to go into this book.  The book is worthless.
I bought several to give as gifts.  Insightful and practical daily meditations!
"Lovely spiritual book. Though I believe the author is Christian, she takes a new-age approach using only the words ""God' and ""universe"". Generally, I'm not a fan of this, but it's good for someone who needs a lift and is perhaps ""agnostic or spiritual but not religious""."
"In May 2015, my holistic physician recommended another book by Melody Beattie which I could not find so I chose this one instead.  It has been a daily source of inspiration ever since.  This book is rich in heart-based wisdom for how to best appreciate the joys and best meet the challenges of life.  It is also a wonderful course in accessing your intuition, your inner guidance.  Each day's passage is steeped in inspiration and practical guidance and is just the right length for my morning spiritual reading.  Along with reading a passage from the Bible, I read the daily reflection from Journey to the Heart as my morning spiritual ""breakfast.""  I could not be better nourished year round.Laura Venecia Rodriguez, Author of Yoga at Home:  Gain Energy, Flexibility, and Serenity in 20-30 Minutes a Day"
Great book great price
I love it! One of the best books that I have ever read! Finally an author that I can most certainly relate with! I wish I found her writings much earlier in life! She's absolutely amazing! I read it daily.
Awesome writer
Liked everything.
You never know what you need to hear/read. opening this book to a random page is my favorite and reading a passage because no matter what the words are inspiring.
Such a great book. Wonderful for morning meditations.
"Just get it. These daily meditations bring healing to your heart, mind, and soul. Laid out in 365 readings, each reading is just enough words to keep the idea in your head, digest it, and let it drop into your heart throughout the day.Or, if you read it at bed time, it can bring closure and perspective to your day, you sleep upon it, and wake up with those words still fresh to help you get through the day. God bless Melody. The tragedy she endured, along with her gift of efficient writing, allows her to bring healing to everyone who reads her anointed words. After I read a daily passage from this book, I read a daily passage from her other book, ""The Language of Letting Go"" - what a blessing. I am learning so much about myself, how to let go, move on with my life, not to worry, treasure what I take for granted, and mostly, how to accept, bless, and just be. And this applies to both people (including myself) and to life itself. This book is life. This book is light."
"Love this book! I read the meditations daily, and they are very uplifting. The seller sent it very fast too! I loved it so much, I bought another copy for a friend."
"First knew about this book when yogi instructor read a  passage  during savasana....some beautiful and uplifting meditations for the start of a day, end of the day, or anytime during the day when you need it."
Thank you!
Good way to slow down and reflect. Mediations are meaningful.
Fast shipping and product as described
Amazing. So poinangt without being stuffy or judgemental. Love this book!
Get it! It's calling for you!
Melody is one of my favorite authors...read this every day
one of my favorite morning reads  Just enough to start the day  Have given as gifts
"I use this daily (and sometimes twice daily) to read aloud in final resting pose of my yoga classes.  Every time, it seems the message was just what I or one of the students needed to hear."
Gives me inspiration every day. Even this morning. I didnt want to wake up and head to work. But reading one passage I am motivated to get out there and nurse the sick people!
Melodie has truly created a book that follows the year with all it‚Äôs ups & downs. I‚Äôll read this again & again.
"I use this daily and it helps keep me motivated and centered. This year I gave copies to all my family members for Christmas to help them deal with daily life. I don't know if they will use them, but they have it."
Always enjoy the author
Friend had this book in Indonesia for a retreat. We used it daily for the end of our yoga classes. I had to purchase when I got home and now use at the end of my classes. My students love the passages and they are of all ages!!
"I am very pleased with this book.  I have not read it straight through, but I have read my usual samples (my birthdays, belly-button and AA) and have been using it daily for about ten days."
I love every page of this book. Get it.
good daily reading
Amazing book to wake up to daily and read. Helps set your day on the right path.
my favorite gift for myself and others.
"It is just what it says - book with daily thoughts/meditations. Nothing fancy, deep."
I have always loved Melody Beattie's books and daily  meditations.  This one is a very good book to follow her other meditational book--The Language of Letting Go.  I highly recommend it.
I bought this as a gift and was worried that it would be too dorky or religious but it is really wonderful and was well-received.
wife liked it
Good daily thoughts
I loved the book. It is series of very inspiring notes based on personal experiences of the author. You can read a page every day and it makes you think about that idea.
One of my favorite books of all time! I use so many of these passages and quotes for when I teach yoga--very inspiring and in laymans terms so it's really accessible for anyone to understand!
The author nails it on the head when talking about caring for yourself. Very inspirational and comforting.Lets me know it's ok to treat myself.
"Awesome book I buy one for all my clients.  This is the best daily meditation book out there, so many positive things that help you keep perspective life and focusing on your heart and soul!!"
This is a good book to read every morning to start the day.  Look forwardevery morning to read the daily words.  Nice and short and takes no timeto read.
"Wonderful book. You can read it over a year or I like to just open a random page, it always gives the perspective I need to hear in that moment."
a feel good book
Beautifully written! I love reading this each morning with my coffee.
I enjoyed opening this book every morning! Thanks for the encouragement to love as Jesus loved; to live in grace and truth.
"Love the scripture-inspired words Bob Goff writes in this devotional. He has a gift for loving people and sharing his thoughts, so I am glad to have this in a daily devotional!"
Short daily devotions that encourage and inspire you to live and love well
"Buy it, read it and glean some nuggets out of it. I did!!"
This book does not disappoint! Everyday wisdom with a twist. Very usable.
I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good devotional.  My husband and I read it daily!
My husband and I read this together before we go to sleep. I‚Äôve loved Bob and his wisdom since reading Love Does in college and he and Sweet Maria‚Äôs words have carried me through many seasons and now I share them with my spouse. This is brief day-to-day reminder of how to live like Jesus for everyone around you.
Everyone should own this book! It‚Äôs very Inspirational!
"Bob Goff has done it again. Live in Grace, Walk is Love inspires me to do just that. I need a daily reminder to be loving, kind, and grace-filled. Just a few minutes each morning jump starts my heart and my awareness."
Awesome.  I can‚Äôt wait to read a devotion daily
Great product. Thanks!
Love Bob Goff! He just makes thing so simple and fun! I'm really enjoying this devotional book! Definitely recommend!
Bob Goff is an amazing author! I love this book
Great devotional. Inspiring us to love more!
would by more
I love this devotional! Ties into daily situations and asks you questions at the end of each days devotion so you get to participate!
Thoughtful Christ-based devotionals
Super
Wonderful!!
Absolutely love this hard back and look forward to starting my new year off with these wonderful devotions.
"This is a really nice devotional. Indepth, great points, challenges us. Bob Goff is great!"
Great purchase! Can‚Äôt wait to start 2020 off with these amazing daily reads from Goff.
Bob Goff is amazing
"Best daily devotional book !  Easy to understand, and very Bible based."
This is wonderful for a young believer in today‚Äôs culture-I am not
Highly recommend another gem from Bob.  A wonderful devotional book that makes you really think about how we should be treating everyone...
Worth every penny
I love this book :)
Great book and encouraging.
"Book seems really good, however it arrived printed upside down"
"This should be a mandatory read for all schools and a perfect way to start your day!I am forever sharing the daily thoughts with friends and co workersIt is exactly what we need in the middle of this pandemic , just love large like Jesus and you will be ahead of the  gameLove love love"
"Bob Goff is the master of words. He makes Gods nature more fathomable and this devotional is just yet another of his great works. On January first I began to read one page each day, and my goal is to continue to do this until the year 2020 comes to end...I actually answer the question at the bottom of each page directly in the book and write down just one goal to work towards that is relative to the question; be it something small I want to accomplish that day or something that is ongoing for the year, and I tick them off once completed. I hope to be able to look back upon all that I‚Äôve done in 2020 when the year comes to an end. I truly look forward to my reading each day and it‚Äôs been a nice way to journal without feeling like I have to write 5 pages out or think of what to say."
"Kann leider nichts zum Inhalt sagen. Wurde sich gew√ºnscht, von Amazon schnell geliefert und verschenkt. Die Freude des Empf√§ngers war gro√ü :)"
Das Buch an sich ist super- aber ein neues Buch darf schon auch neu aussehen! Alle Ecken sind angehauen und die Seiten sehen aus als ob das Buch mal feucht geworden ist.Sehr schade- zum verschenken nicht wirklich geeignet. Schade Amazon!
In love with this devotional
Another wonderful book by Bob Goff! He is a wonderful author shining his light!
Awesome
"As a Pastor and Mental Health Counselor I appreciate the way Curt Thompson weaves together the Biblical storyline of Creation (The Anatomy of the Soul), Fall (The Soul of Shame), and Redemption (The Anatomy of Desire) with common grace insights from neurobiology. Thompson heightens the longing and desire of the way things should be and exposes the reality of the brokenness where we find ourselves. Then he offers a pathway of hope and redemption to bridge the gap."
"Curt Thompson's new book, The Soul of Desire, does not disappoint. Integrating Scripture with neuroscience, he helps us understand ourselves and each other and how valuable we are, not only to God, but to each other. It's hard to let yourself be known and yet it is what we all long for. This book gives examples of the power of ""confessional community"" and the healing that can occur when we take the risk to share ourselves and become honest and vulnerable. Not only do I highly recommend this book but also Curt's other two books, Anatomy of the Soul and The Soul of Shame. Eye opening and life changing!"
"Dr. Thompson has a way of bringing the merge of interpersonal neurobiology and its connection to our daily lives in a winsome, easy-to-understand way. This book was unexpectedly timely and poignant, and I felt encouraged and challenged to look at my current life circumstances and rethink how community is playing its necessary role in my daily reality. After a year of such isolation and insecurity for so many, what an encouragement and reminder for how we are wired and created for Beaty and community!"
"I loved this book! Curt Thompson offers so much wisdom, most especially about how our desire for beauty and creativity affects our lives. Mako Fujimura‚Äòs art also adds so much. If you want to understand why we do what we do, check out the Soul of Desire."
"Neuroscience is fascinating especially when paired with scripture. Dr. Curt Thompson weaves and explains how disintegrated we are and what causes the issues between us as humans. When we have an awareness, or awakening, or understanding of what we probably are going through, we are able to better understand and better heal and go forward creating beauty. This book is a true treasure and eye opening experience especially with healing from trauma from my own family. It allows me to see how unhealthy I've conducted life for so long. Looking forward creating beauty despite the pain. Go and buy the book."
"In this beautiful book, Dr. Curt Thompson invites his readers to ""pay attention to the world in a different way"".  The Soul of Desire is an excellent, powerful and thought provoking offering from Dr. Thompson as he encourages and convinces his readers to examine the longings, desire and depths within each of our souls.  Dr. Thompson truly believes that beauty, goodness and truth will change the world.  He demonstrates, with compassion and sensitivity, this significant and practical life-change through sharing poignant stories of real people that he has served faithfully as a therapist.  He weaves together his work in the area of Interpersonal Neurobiology---which is utterly fascinating--- with his day-to-day work with clients in his personal therapeutic practice.  I have read each of Curt Thompson's other books, as well.  I would highly recommend Soul of Desire and his other works to anyone who may want to know themselves and others better.  His offering of hope for personal healing; as well as his proposal that we can heal others as we hold hope and imagine beauty---this offering is an invitation you just can't refuse!  In our current climate of daily doses of hard news, darkness, hopeless situations and broken relationships, this book is ---100%--- a must read!!"
"I love this book, my daughter got it when she was little, so I bought it for a baby shower."
Very cute book. I can‚Äôt wait to read it to my daughter. I got this for her because I did pray for her. Prayed for 3 years....
So sweet... makes a great baby shower gift!
"This was a really sweet book. Although my child did not go through everything here and I might not necessarily pray for all of those things in real life, the point is being thankful and praying with your child! I like the message it brings and read it to my children every night!"
"Love this book. I got it for my 7 yr old daughter & my 18 yr old son. Yes they are a little old for this book BUT I did pray for both of them, as I was told at 17 I would never have children. I got it to write a message to them on the inside to let them know how very blessed I am to have them both. Just wish they had written one for girls too."
"This makes a great story book right before bed. Very cute, nice pictures. Makes a great gift for little ones."
"Got this for my sister who is expecting, she loved it!"
Bought for my daughter who is having a baby after a couple years of disappointment. She loved it!
"I was disappointed that the prayers were in verse, but the text wasn‚Äôt. Also, the book is 100% about mom and baby. No room for dad or gramma or anyone else who loves and prays for the baby."
I love the illustrations and story. It‚Äôs adorable!
What an excellent book! Ended up buying more to give as gifts. Great way to help show kids how prayer weaves easily through daily life and waken thankful hearts within them.
"Such a sweet book. Got it for a friend who previously miscarried and just had a baby. She loves it. It's perfect for Any parent, in any parenting situation with any age child."
LOVE this book! Very cute and good story. My little one loves the book.
This book was a shower gift for a women who lost her first child I hope she finds comfort in it. And that it brings her and her child's thoughts close to our beloved savior may she find his peace that goes beyond all understanding...........
"This book was relatively larger than I thought, its a bigger sized board book. The content is very cute, and a great baby shower gift. There are short little prayers on every page that rhyme."
"I bought this for my best friend for her gender reveal. She loves it and I know her baby girl will too, when she‚Äôs born."
I purchased this book for my infant grandson's growing library. The illustrations keep him interested even at 6 months old. The storyline is so sweet and as he grows he will understand the concept of a mother's love through the pages of this book.
This is a lovely book to give a new mom who has been waiting a long time to be a mother. Even if she is not a religious person this book will hit home for her.
"For my friend who is expecting her first baby after 3 miscarriages.  Beautiful, sweet book."
Bought to read to my first grand son
Perfect gift!
Beautiful book
"I bought this book for a baby shower gift for my nephew. My sister in law did the ""bring a book instead of a card "" thing. They tried really hard to conceive and were told that they weren't able to. After many prayers here we are now! She's 32weeks along. This book is so perfect and very meaningful!"
Love this book
I‚Äôm 9months pregnant and I‚Äôve been reading this to my baby through my pregnancy. It‚Äôs such a sweet book. I love it.
Everyone loved it. It satisfied many requests to combine a storybook with a diary.
Loved the book. Great price for quality product.
Easy to record and listen to over and over.
"Bought this as a gift, it is a beautiful story. Love the hard pages."
Perfect book to read with my six month old. He loves reaching for the packages and likes all the colors. Cute story without being to lengthy.
"What a gift these words are. To live in a society that encourages us to leave our bodies, this book is an invitation in coming back home. I love that this book offers embodiement practices and reflections."
This book is for everyone - and I mean everyone. We all have something to learn from Hillary‚Äôs work in embodiment.
"Everything Dr. Hillary McBride touches turns to gold. This book is no exception. It‚Äôs a beautiful fusion of theory, application, and personal story. Every chapter ends with reflection prompts and practices to help the reader take the theory into practice. Brilliant and a must-read for anyone seeking to live a more wholistic human existence."
"This groundbreaking book sheds light on the ways in which we disassociate from our bodies, whether through pain, trauma, wounding messages, cultural ideals, oppression, mixed views on sexuality, and more. It is a profound but gentle invitation to reconnect with our bodies in a way that brings life, presence, and connection. I can't remember a book impacting me more and causing me to think so differently about how I interact with the world, and with myself. I‚Äôve been a therapist for 2 decades and a human over twice that, and I have already quoted this book more than any other resource I have. It‚Äôs that important. Buy this book for yourself, your daughter, your friend, your sister, your book club, your faith community, your partner!!"
"This book is something everyone can and should read, but especially anyone who has struggled in their relationship with their body. McBride does an amazing job of sharing complex ideas in a way any reader can understand and invites readers into a whole new way of thinking about our bodies. As a therapist I believe this book can be healing for many people, myself included."
"Dr. Hillary McBride has given us such a beautiful, well-researched, and practical book about how we can live as embodied people. Instead of being at war with our bodies, we can listen to, learn from, and embrace all our bodies have to teach us. Written with a deep awareness of trauma, social justice and cultural issues, this is a must-read for anyone who has ever felt ashamed of their body or pushed away a difficult feeling and wants to experience life more fully. Plus, this is giving me so much insight about how to pass on more healthy ideas about bodies and what it means to be human to my kids!"
"If this is your first entry to Dr. Hillary McBride, we are thrilled for you, and you will be so glad for her gentle, intelligent and kind education on  moving toward a new way of being in our bodies. Think you don‚Äôt have body issues? I‚Äôm sure you love someone who does; and I‚Äôm certain you will learn valuable self kindness techniques from this treasure of a book. Far from self help, this is full of evidence based education, but written with a narrative engaging style. I look forward to reading it multiple times to learn all I can!"
"This book is so important, I wish the whole world would read it. When we remember and understand ourselves and each other as bodies, it becomes harder to dehumanize ourselves and one another. Dr. McBride brings a tenderness into the conversation around embodiment and that feels like such a gift. I will return to this book over and over as it feels like a gentle and kind invitation to remember the truth of who I am, of who we all are."
This book invites you back to your Self in the kindest if ways. The language is evidenced based but accessible and inclusive to gender and ability. Dr McBride is open about sharing her story and this book is beautifully written.
"THE WISDOM OF YOUR BODY by Hillary McBride is that rarest of books -- accessible, wise, and so powerfully expressed it stays with you. Versus powerful, lifelong messages and rules that keep us small and isolated, McBride reminds us that we hold the power in our own hands for who we are, how we express ourselves, and how we live well.  Gently, compassionately, and lyrically,  she reveals the false narratives that are so ubiquitous, unexamined, and seductive that we fail to see them as the limiting, self-serving stories that drive so many to despise themselves and their bodies, to do themselves harm in large and small ways, and to fail to hear that small, still voice within that never ceases imploring us to listen to our own wisdom and act in alignment with our overall, long-term wellbeing. I felt like I'd shared tea and conversation with a wise, witty, funny, and well-spoken friend.  I received an advance reader copy of this book in exchange for my unbiased review."
"I‚Äôve been reading Kate Bowler‚Äôs new book, Everything Happens for a Reason: and Other Lies I've Loved. Her book made me both laugh and cry within the span of two pages, and has been a tremendously helpful read as the sufferers are all of us. What stuck with me was the reminder that my grasping for a reason in the midst of what utterly stinks is yet again, my idol and need for control running my life instead of holding the future loosely in the tension of what is truly here and now. Our inability to live in the paradoxes that we most often find ourselves in eats us from the inside out.""I think I believed that I was living in the center, but I rarely let me feet rest on solid ground, rooting me in the present. My eyes shifted to look for that thing just beyond, the next deadline, the next hurdle, the next plan‚Ä¶ On long walks I forever roped Toban into my favorite topic: the next thing. How could we improve our lives? What should we do next? As we walked through the tall Carolina oaks on a fall trail dusted with Technicolor leaves, my mind hummed with possible futures. Always. If I were to invent a sin to describe what that was - for how I lived - I would not say it was simply that I didn‚Äôt stop to smell the roses. It was the sin of arrogance, of becoming impervious to life itself. I failed to love what was present and decided to love what was possible instead.I must learn to live in ordinary time, but I don‚Äôt know how."""
"This is a deeply moving, challenging, and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny book. Kate Bowler‚Äòs scholarly work on the prosperity gospel is brilliant, but here we have a personal reflection on the hopes and failures of the various gospel(s) regarding mortality and health that Americans imbibe and express constantly, beliefs about life and death that are as tempting as they are frustrating. This is a book for people who are confident that they will say the right thing when confronted with a suffering loved one; it‚Äôs a book that forces us to pause before we spit out whatever cliche (or lie!) that is on the tip of our tongue in these moments. This is more than just practical instruction (though it is immensely practical). It is an invitation to think about how our cliched instincts might be reformed through more honest, truthful, and faithful responses to suffering."
"Kate Bowler was beginning to think she had it all: great husband, great job, new baby. After having studied prosperity gospel churches, she could almost start believing what they were selling. Then she was diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer.This autobiographical peak into Kate Bowler‚Äôs life shows her struggling with which lies are even Christians telling themselves to help get through the valleys. Should we keep fighting or just surrender? Should we make plans or just live in the present? Is there a formula or is everything just random? And are these lies even helpful?I think this is a great book to be reading in uncertain times like a pandemic. I found Bowler‚Äôs writing style to be L.M.Montgomery‚Äôs Anne-of-Green-Gables-like which I really enjoyed. The appendices at the end--things to never say to someone going through a terrible time, what to say instead--I think are so helpful I have bookmarked them for future use.I bought this book and this is my honest and unbiased review."
"A young wife, mother, and university professor who understands her life may be numbered by days, or months unless God chooses to intervene with a miracle. For all the blessings God has given His children by showing us who He is, at some point we may be forced to stand alone and acknowledge there is so much more of God that we don't know, perhaps because we are incapable of that understanding at this time as mere created children. Why this one gets a miracle and this one doesn't. So many think they understand this mystery, and maybe we as needy people force those in leadership positions in many churches to give us answers; and their self interpreted answers often bring pain and oppression to our lives. The supposed answer to ""why"" depends on something we must do rather than the mystery of what God will do. Kate has confronted this oppression and has boldly and courageously taken a stand that says there is a huge flaw in what is called ""Prosperity Gospel""."
"When Kate Bowler was diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer, she was 35 and happily married with a newborn son. She was a professor at Duke Divinity School and had specialized in the study of the prosperity gospel.She chronicles her journey with honesty, warmth, humor, and a clear-eyed admission of what's at stake. Most important for a prospective reader is to know this was not in the least a maudlin, depressing book. For me, it was a wonderful tutorial on how to act, what to say, and what not to say around someone with cancer. Most of the traditional platitudes we're tempted to use are like salt in a wound.Miraculously, her brutal treatment was effective and as I write this in mid-2021, she is apparently doing well and is generously sharing the lessons she has learned."
"The author is skeptical of the Prosperity Gospel (of which she has written the definitive scholarly history), but many of the book's best moments involve her Christian faith:  her colleagues at Duke Divinity School organizing a prayer service during her surgery (leaving her pleased that the serious scholars who are her colleagues ""cried snotty tears as they pleaded with God to extend my life,""); her sense that the friends who prayed and helped her ""mirrored back to me the face of Jesus;"" the connection that she felt between her suffering and the suffering of others; the scholars who told her that her feeling of God's presence would recede, but would ""leave an imprint.  I would somehow be marked by the presence of an unbidden God.""Two great moments at the book's very end -- she buys her husband a sign that says, ""YOU ARE MY BUCKET LIST.""  And as she revels in the start of another day with her son, renewing their daily morning rituals, she concludes, ""I will die, yes, but not today.""I'm praying for you, Professor Bowler.  Thanks for the meditation on life and death."
"Whew! A young wife and mother, Bowler dissected the prosperity gospel in her first book, but after being diagnosed with stage 4 cancer she quickly discovered that a form of that belief -- that all good things come to those who believe (and, by extension, that anyone who is stricken must have failed in some way) -- also exists in herself and American culture in general, sometimes in the form of the platitude in the title. (Her passage on doors and windows opening and closing is hysterical.) This memoir is by turns harrowing, very funny, moving, spiritual, and hopeful, despite the genuine pain of having a terminal diagnosis but not quite dying yet, if only thanks to difficult treatments endured month by month. It should be read by anybody faced with a life-threatening illness in themselves or a loved one, which probably means it should be read by all mortal beings, or at least those who believe themselves to be Christian. If nothing else, the do's and don't's at the end are invaluable."
"I expected this book to be similar to ""The Last Lecture"" by Randy Pausch, full of insight and somewhat inspiring. It's more of a rant. The end of the book where the author details all the insensitive things people say to those facing a tragedy will make me avoid these situations going forward unless the person is a very close friend or family member. You are more likely to say the wrong thing than the right thing."
"I recently was diagnosed with Stage 3 Colon Cancer and was looking for something to read that didn't make me feel like I was a serious underachiever. You know the type? Where they are running a marathon 8 months later or something??Since I'm not that person, I was looking for something gentler and kinder. A story about another woman's journey that was real and relatable. Well, I found it with this book. I wanted to underline every other paragraph!This book really helped me to clarify my feelings about cancer and to be more accepting of the path I'm now on. I recommend it if you are looking for this same approach."
I didn't feel the book addressed the title well.  It was a continued depressing complaint about her ongoing illness and its affects.
Interesting perspective from someone who has survived stage 4 cancer. Not sure I agree with some of her religious views however.
The book was in really good used shape.
"This book is honest, funny and sad all at the same time. Thank you Kate for writing such beautiful words that empower others to rethink their wiring and give us the freedom to shed the weighty-ness of the ‚Äúlies‚Äù we‚Äôve carried with us. Grateful!"
"As a hospice/palliative care doctor, this is one of the most insightful revelations of what patients are going through and I heartily recommend it to patients,nurses and physicians alike."
"As a cancer research scientists who devises new ways to develop treatments for cancer patients, I found the book to be an enlightening glimpse into the experiences of a cancer patient. Kate describes her experiences using a combination of wit, humor and unadulterated truth. An excellent read and one that will help me and other scientists who have dedicated their lives to improving the lives of cancer patients and their families."
An inside view of a very successful young adult who confronts mortality and how it makes the world so much more wonderful (as well as painful). I recognized my own moments of loss and pain and the peace I felt as God-moments because of her.
"Kate's book is the story of us all.  We see ourselves,  our hopes and dreams, our quest for life in the face of our own mortality. Reading this book will move you to tears as well as fill your heart with joy. Thank you Kate for sharing your story."
Thought pondering as well moving. Time well spent reading & discussing with loved ones. True wisdom from life on the edge to help all of us live in ordinary time.
An easy read book on trying to make sense when bad things happen to good people and how to keep moving forward...no matter what
Honest and difficult. Humorous and real. Living in the present and sharing moments is sometimes  all we can do. Great advice in the appendix.
"This book was a great read.  I was a little hesitant when I read some reviews about it being religious.  I am not at all religious but wanted to read the book and subject matter.  Yes, the author is religious but the book does not preach or promote religion at all.  Religion is part of her life, so it only makes sense that she talks about it.This book is what I thought ‚ÄúWhen Breath becomes air‚Äù would be.  That book does not even come close to what this author discusses.  Her book is the reality of so many people lives.  It is not a sad book either.  The book helped me understand what family and friends may be going through and some ways to be helpful."
"I hope everyone had a great weekend and is ready to kick off the first full week of the year! I did quite a bit of reading this weekend but still have not finished an actual book per my goalü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, I have completed digital and audio versions! .Everything Happen for a Reason was good but tough. Kate Bowler is a professor at Duke Divinity School with a Christian background. She is married with a young son and life seems good until, at 35, she is diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer. In this memoir, Bowler shares what it is like to face your own mortality and how her faith changes. Her story is sad but also funny and direct. There were times that I was laughing out loud but also wanted to reach out and hug her. üíõ .One of my best friends was diagnosed with ovarian cancer last year and after two major surgeries is cancer free right now. I choose this book because cancer affects us all when someone is diagnosed but often times we move on with our lives and forget what that person went through. I wanted to read this and share this with her. Telling her how proud I am of her for fighting, staying strong and positive and allowing me to cry with her. This book was a true account of how we are all in this together and I love that.ü•∞ ."
"To me this book was a reassurance of all that crashed in me when the doctor said, ""It's cancer."" The thoughts she shares were expression of all my fears, all my questions, all my faith and all my willpower just to survive the cancer.  And I was introduced to surgery and the loss of two feet of colon.  Then there was the surgery to place a port in my chest so that my hand could be rescued from constant needle stabs.  So yes I relate strongly to this authors journey.  Her questions spoken solid resonate deep in my spirit.Thanks for your transparency.  I am a survivor. Fourteen years cancer free.  But then began another chapter in my life with chemicals in my brain being destroyed by chemo.  More medications for mental illness. A steady downward slid into a world of fear and anxiety.Please read the book.  Pass it on to others."
"Everything Happens for a Reason¬†by Kate Bowler is a startling memoir about courage, hope, and one woman's reaction to receiving the news that she has stage IV colon cancer.First off, this book was emotionally hard to read! Kate is in her 30s and has a husband and child. I'm also in my 30s and am happily married with two kids. It's hard to imagine being told your life could be over because of a cancer diagnosis. Honestly, I can't even imagine it--it's the thing of nightmares. I can't fathom not being there to watch my kids grow up--I don't want to miss all of their firsts and big moments. Guess what? Neither does Kate.¬†This memoir was well-written and hard to put down. Kate leads an interesting life. She grew up in the Prosperity gospel and teaches as a divinity professor. Yet when her body is wracked with cancer and well-wishers make comments like ""everything happens for a reason"" and ""God has a plan,"" she struggles. For what reason does she has cancer, and what exactly is God's plan? She has a hard time coming to terms with what her faith says about death and dying versus her new reality.I appreciated the book's raw sincerity. Kate is honest, transparent, and even a bit snarky and sarcastic at times. She's very real, and reading this almost felt as though you were having a chat with her over a cup of coffee.¬†Overall, I really enjoyed reading this book. It was poignant, insightful, and also inspirational. Kate is a fighter, and she's not willing to back down from the fight until all options have been explored. If I were to face similar news, I can only hope I would be just as commanding in my decision to battle onward.¬†Should you read this book? If you appreciate memoirs, this was a great book to read. If reading about cancer makes you anxious, it's best to steer clear.¬†Thank you to NetGalley for providing the Kindle version of this book in exchange for an honest review."
"I first became aware of Kate Bowler when she was a guest on The Faith Angle podcast, hosted by Kirsten Powers and Jonathan Merritt. I loved the title of this book and guessed it was about the language of faith encounters and how believers mostly botch those encounters.This book isn't that. It's better. It's her memoir of being diagnosed and treated with Stage IV cancer.What a beautifully written book. Bowler filters her experience through her understanding of the prosperity gospel, which is the worst extension possible of the faith tradition where I currently live and work. This book works as an indictment of the excesses of the prosperity gospel and a lens into the life of a young wife, mother and professional who wants nothing more than to have a future, any future, that includes being with the people she loves the most.I could not recommend this book more highly."
"My husband, who held a lifelong belief that everything happens for a reason, died in an accident three years ago at age 52. I have been on a quest, ever since, to reconcile his death with his belief. Kate Bowler's ""Everything Happens"" is one of the many books I have read in my quest -- and it is one of the best.Kate Bowler's particular tragedy of stage IV cancer diagnosis in her mid-30s is very different from my experience of my spouse's sudden death. Her active study and practice of Christianity also contrasts with my own agnosticism. And yet--when she writes of her own reactions to her illness, and the responses of others, I find myself nodding over and over, ""yes, yes, this is exactly what I experienced!"" ""This is exactly how I feel!"" And she writes with such self-deprecating humor, and such obvious love for others, that it is hard not to love her back!Kate writes of going through a phase where she swears all the time, and notes ‚ÄúI read an article about how people in grief swear because they feel the English language has reached its limit in a time of inarticulate sorrow.‚Äù This was definitely my experience with my own tragedy too, but most materials written for grievers do not touch this topic. I imagine it must be especially taboo for Kate as a professor of divinity--so her candor here is particularly appreciated.Kate describes the prosperity gospel view--good-things-happen-to-good-people, bad-things-happen-to-bad-people--as essentially an extreme version of broadly held contemporary American cultural attitudes. She groups the responses of others into three categories -- the Minimizers, the Teachers (""your illness is a test of your faith""), and the Solutions People (""your attitude determines your fate""). These observations ring very true from my own experience of tragedy.As for the title of Kate's book, and my own quest to make sense of ""everything happens for a reason"" in the face of actual life experience, she addressed the question this way in a February 2019 book talk: ‚ÄúI do believe that there can be beauty in the darkness, that we can find incredible riches in the midst of the unthinkable. What I worry about is that kind of equivalency in which people need everyone‚Äôs pain to neatly add up to somebody‚Äôs lesson or triumph. And that places a great burden of gratitude and meaning-making on you to then not be able to say sometimes I feel like I‚Äôve lost more than I‚Äôve gained. And that‚Äôs a hard thing for us to carry when we miss things we had before and loved them so very much."""
"This is a very revealing book.  The author is very sincere and my heart goes out to her.  I do feel that her story points out the failure of ""the prosperity gospel"".  In my mind, this branch of Christianity misses the pointUnfortunately, I do feel that she's searching for truth in the wrong places.  Still, this is a book to read."
"Kate Bowler‚Äôs memoir Everything Happens For A Reason is quite simply the most powerful book that I have read in the past year‚Äîand I read hundreds of books.  I would even go so far as to say it has transformed my life, and the way that I think about the kingdom of God.Bowler is a thirty something professor at Duke Divinity School, graduate of Yale and Duke, published author, and a loving wife and. mother of a two-year-old son when she finds out that she has incurable cancer.  How Bowler deals with her situation is recounted in this memoir.  The memoir is filled with clarity, humor, pain, hope, wisdom, and so many other things.  It is truly a gift.Bowler began writing it while undergoing chemotherapy:  ‚ÄúI start to write. In bed, in chemo chairs, in waiting rooms, I try to say something about dying in a world where everything happens for a reason.‚ÄùThe resulting memoir contains so many profoundly expressed descriptions of life, faith and the people around her:‚ÄúAt a time when I should have felt abandoned by God, I was not reduced to ashes. I felt like I was floating, floating on the love and prayers of all those who hummed around me like worker bees, bringing notes and flowers and warm socks and quilts embroidered with words of encouragement. They came in like priests and mirrored back to me the face of Jesus. When they sat beside me, my hand in their hands, my own suffering began to feel like it had revealed to me the suffering of others, a world of those who, like me, are stumbling in the debris of dreams they thought they were entitled to and plans they didn‚Äôt realize they had made‚Äú‚ÄúEverything feels strange and slow. On pain medication and without clocks, I can‚Äôt say for sure if it is still the same day as my diagnosis, the day of my surgery, or if they are one and the same. The first indication I have that it has been two days since my diagnosis is that the church is keeping vigil. This will turn out to be one of the great advantages of working at Duke Divinity School‚Äîall my friends are pastors. My colleagues teach pastors, my friends are pastors, and my students are going to be pastors. There is a flood of pastors not only in my room but in the nearby waiting room and in the divinity school‚Äôs own chapel, where the community had decided to come together and pray me through my surgery. They gathered in the warm wood sanctuary and sang hymns and read Scripture and prayed thick, layered prayers in a way that only desperate people can. When the main service ended, they came to the hospital and traded off like relay runners, each praying for me until relieved. Some are close friends and some are acquaintances, and most are much, much smarter than I am. So it pleases me to no end to find out later that the most serious scholars I have ever known‚Äîauthors of weighty books and owners of many velvet smoking jackets‚Äîhave cried snotty tears as they pleaded with God to extend my life. They are teaching me the first lesson of my new cancer life‚Äîthe first thing to go is pride.‚ÄùHer words about her son are moving:‚ÄúEvery morning I live the same moment. I can hear Zach over the baby monitor, squawking and mewing, and murmuring the first words, ‚ÄúMama! Papa! Da-doo!‚Äù which, roughly translated, mean, ‚ÄúMother, father, tractor, save me from this prison.‚ÄùIt used to be the beginning of my favorite part of the day. I wake to the sounds of my son, and as I lift him out of his crib, warm milk waiting beside the change table, I have reinvented the world. I have rescued twenty pounds of chubby arms, legs, and cheeks and set him free to move about the house to identify toy tractors and bring fleece onesies back into fashion.Ever since the diagnosis there has been a moment, in the minute between sleeping and waking, when I forget, when I have only a lingering sense that there is something I am supposed to remember. In the warmth of my bed, I am caught in webs of dreams. And then there is the flood. I am dying. I am dying. I am my son‚Äôs first goodbye. I am not the start of a great new day. I am a bright sunset.‚ÄùWhat is truly amazing is that Bowler intersperses a healthy dose of humor in with the sadness‚Äî like the section where she describes the movie version of a phase of her treatment:‚ÄúHe is standing beside me now, and I grab his arm, pull him toward me, and say in a low, serious voice: ‚ÄúI had better not die looking into your eyes.‚Äù The nurses roar. I have mentally decided that when the Lifetime movie version of my life is made, the doctor will be played by Matthew McConaughey with firm instructions to always chew gum and be looking into the middle distance just past me. And I am Winona Ryder, and a thousand emotions will always flit over my perfect face.‚ÄùWhat a gift Bowler has given to the world in the form of this memoir.  I highly recommend it.  It was an honor to read and review it.  Thank you Random House and NetGalley for the Advanced Reader‚Äôs Copy of this book."
I couldn‚Äôt put this book down. I read it in two sittings and then started back at the beginning to read it again. Borrowed from the library but I‚Äôll be buying it to add to my personal collection. Many people struggle with some aspects of Christianity around blessings and abundance. Some of us left the church for these reasons and find ourselves still wrestling with painful past experiences. This book helped me name and sit with uncomfortable experiences and recognize that I wasn‚Äôt alone. This book was both wonderful and hard. It poked at experiences I‚Äôve walled off so I didn‚Äôt have to emotionally unpack them. My sincere thanks to Kate for sharing her experiences.
"Of course, all good wishes to her in her journey...that being said,  I got through it but I struggled to finish it. Her field of study is something I really don't respect, so that was a turn off. Her list of ""things not to do"" was well, just rude. People are doing the best they can and the efforts they put forth are coming from a place of friendship or love. Like Sheryl Sandberg's book, I find it presumptuous when authors tell us how to grieve or accept sympathies and condolences. And yes, I've seen this in my own life."
"This was a very thoughtful, well-written book.  I am so sorry for the tragedy in Kate's life, and I hope she is able to live for many more years and beat her cancer.  However, I am in the same camp as those who believe Christianity is hocus pocus magic tricks, but I don't see this book as supporting the Prosperity Gospel etc.  I see the opposite.  It shows it for what it is.  A bunch of low-functioning deluded, superficial, self-congratulatory, naive souls who hide their secret greediness and competitiveness in love of the ""Lord.""  The Lord?  Now who might that be?  I live in Dallas and run like a bunny from the flimsy showy wannabees.  This helped me understand how pathetic they are.  My four-year old grandchild uses more logic."
"Faith, career, family then stage 4 cancer‚Äîthat‚Äôs what was and is Kate Bowler‚Äôs life. A beautifully written story about her journey into the chaos of illness. I heard the author speak at the Festival of Faith and Writing, April 2018, laughing and weeping at the same time. And so was I then and while reading her book."
"Kate Bowler is a good writer with a gut wrenching story to tell. This was hard to read at times, but necessary. I appreciate her honesty and her candor about a topic none of us hopes to ever know."
"Since this book is a few years old now, seems like it was a prescient reminder for us all that we are NOT in control. All the more poignant a message for the pandemic. I enjoyed that it is funny and sad, irreverent, touching and practical.So happy you are still around these days, Kate Bowler!  Love this book and your podcast too."
"The audio version, read by the author, is textured and paced to reveal every emotion from heartbreak to sarcasm. You will finish this book a better person than when you started it."
Kate‚Äôs honesty is much needed. I learned so much. Humbled to read her story and determined to love those suffering around me better.
"Everyone needs to read this.  At some point we all will be in situations she describes.  I laughed, I cried, I learned."
"Is there a right way or wrong way to react to a death sentence caused by terminal cancer? This story lets you sense the emotions in a sarcastic, startlingly serious yet lightly humorous way. All I could say at the end was WOW as I took notes on what to do or not to do as a third party support."
"When faced with disaster we most likely hide our feelings from others. In her heartfelt book Kate Bowler lays her anguish about her illness and possible death before the reader. You want to put your arms about her and tell her you care. Above all, you see a picture of your hidden self."
Not for meA lot of anecdotes with a few helpful nuggets here and thereIt's a little too much work to derive true insight from this bookPass

Loved it
"good book, a little hard to read and concentrate because of the format but it can in great condition and actually have had friends borrow it that have enjoyed it"
I love this book. Second time buying it.  I bought it before and gave it as a gift and just bought it again to read it again. It's that GOOD!!
"For such a small book, it will challenge on what it means to be a man. Our world defines being a man as money, sex, fame, success but God has a different definition and it was all laid out in the beginning of Genesis. Eldridge does a great job at inspiring men to be men."
"Every man should read this.  It gets down to the core of who we forget God made us to be.  Every man needs Adventure, Danger, and a Beauty.  God gives us the identity to do that.  God gives what we are missing.  The book is a lot more and a lot better than what I just wrote."
"Warning! depending on your walk, this can have an incredible impact on your life."
"Excellent book. I reread it and the sequel, Wild at Heart, every 2-3 years!"
"I read this book based off a reccomendation of a friend who buys it for all her guy friends.  I'll tell you, as a female, it is great to hear the views Eldredge has.  Men are not created by God to be weak kneed individuals, who exchange passion for femininity.  However, I do think he draws too many results that are geared towards men who are more outdoorsy or sports like.  I'm not sure the introverted bookworm may find this book that life altering.  I did give the book to my boyfriend after reading it because I could see it applying perfectly to his life.  For the man that longs to be courageous and on adventure and feels 'stuck' being the nice guy, Eldredge encourages him that the former is what God is searching for.  As Lewis put, and Eldredge perfectly quoted, God...and thus by example men shouldn't be safe, but GOOD.  A great read to motivate a man to be the man he really is or wants to be.  Let's go on adventure together!"
"I read this book three years ago and still recommend it often. It inspired me to improve my relationship with my dad and helped me find identity I was previously unaware of. Great for guys in college, or any age!"
This book should be made mandatory for every household!
college class book
"Bought several to share with friends - a must-read for any man struggling with being a ""good christian"" and also a ""man's man.""  It can be done!"
Nothing of value to be had here.
"The author does a nice job of portraying God and Christ in a fresh manner.  It's a worthwhile read and will deepen your faith and walk with the Lord, if you allow it to do so."
Great read!!
For a man who is looking for himself.
A must read for every man.
"This book guides you through things you never realized were happening as you grew, what you needed, and what you can become. Every man on this planet should read this."
Wonderful book for anyone!
Great Book. Explains alot and gives one hope
Good Book
"If you have boys, read this book."
I ordered this book for my husband he's in a men's group.Thanks
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this book ... and so glad it has been updated!  Love the movie and Love how you share with your sons and they share also!  It had a major impact on my husband's walk with the Lord 10 years ago, when he first fell into a men's Bible study and they were using this book! We have since shared it with MANY other men!  I appreciate how REAL you are!"
Good book. A must read for anyone lost in life.
"I found that I couldn't put the book down and had to read it in two days.  Then I read it again.  There are some risks that men might use this book for an excuse to leave home and family for the adventure, but if thats the case they took John's message too far. If balanced out with scripture it can actually put men back on the right track to being ""real men."""
A must read
this is a great book
"Excellent book, concerning the way to a man's heart.  It made me understand so much more about men.  Every man, and the woman who loves them should read this book.  It's a great book for healing of a man's heart."
"I bought this book for my husband and he has not finished reading it yet................he was surprised that he just be the man God made him..wild at heart just like God.My husband also has the ""Wild at Heart"" field manual"
Excellent!
Horrible printing. I guess that‚Äôs what $20 will get you. Cover is nice and as expected so it does get 1 star.
"Wife likes the large print.  A little show-through the page (thin paper) can be helped with a white page slipped in behind the page being read.  Note that there are a whole bunch of offerings here that actually show the same sample printing.  IOW, the book is printed at the same place, only the covers are different.  So, cover gets 4 stars!  Content?  Ah, I'm not into fantasy."
"Beautiful KJV Bible, I Love The Large Print. The Cover Is Quite Nice Too; soft faux leather feels really good to the touch, Well Made. I'm very pleased and I would also like to say it would make a very nice gift for a female/young lady; Again, I'm very pleased with my purchase. Thank you."
"Font is tall, and compressed to fit- not satisfactory at all- returned."
"I ordered the pink bible and received a teal bible. I really wanted the pink one and I was going to send it back but a ups store is 16 miles from me so I decided to just keep the teal. The Bible teaches us to turn the other cheek so that is what I‚Äôm going to do, but they could of at least said they were sorry for the mistake which they did not."
"I like the Bible. Although the pages are EXTREMELY thin. I do not like that. I also have an issue with the fact that the Bible cover that so beautifully matches it, is WAY over-sized. Even the medium sized one has the Bible wiggling back and forth. I had to put an inch wide piece of styrofoam in the back to keep it from flopping all over the place. Weird; I thought that the matching protective cover would at least sort of match the size of the Bible it was a match for and clearly made for."
"Very easy to read, I was surprised at the overall quality of this bible at 20 dollars , the cover is beautiful,well with having around to put in the car or take along on trips,  plan on buying a couple more to gift. I've had it close to a year and is holding up very well."
"I like to have my Bible bedside for reading at bedtime or sunrise.  The large print makes it easy on the eyes, even though i also use readers.  It just helps to not strain to read.  The purple color makes it attractive on my bedside nightstand.  And I like the ribbon page keeper as well!"
Purchased this for my 7 year old who is learning to read. The print is large enough for her to see clear and the verses are separated which was important to us . The cover has a very cute design. We received this in time undamaged. Overall satisfied with this purchase.
"The product is as described and is just a wonderful work done. I really like the smooth texture of the covers and the red highlights on certain passages. Also, there are related scriptures at the bottom of the page which helps when studying and cross referencing. Lastly, there are maps in the back with the names of the places as the scripture calls them and not with today's names which helps make sense of the Holy words."
Love this Bible! Gave one to each of my sons. Got the large print so they keep and use this Bible their whole lives.
"The description said red print which is the words of God and only one section has red print, not what i wanted false advertisement"
Stunning!I can't thank you enough!I can begin reading a Bible again ....God Bless!
"Large print perfect for a beginning reader at church that wanted a ""real Bible"". The cover feels very good. I'm pleased with the quality."
This Bible is wonderful for those who are hard of seeing. The words are printed just perfectly. The pages are outlined in beautiful silver and the outside of the Bible feels durable. Gorgeous purple floral print on the outside and inside. Would definitely recommend!
Its the Bible what else can you say?
So beautiful.  But be careful the paper is thin.
"Beautifully embossed bible with gold index and large print. Very pleased. Really, the quality for the price is amazing."
In my opinion the print is not big enough
"Well made , big print bought for my mom and she loves it and can now see to read it"
"Incredible quality, beautiful bible. Lots of extras like color maps, references, study plan, and guide verses. KJV is a tough read, but is an excellent classic that is tried and true. Highest quality bible I have owned and makes an excellent addition to my library of quality books since the cover is so elegant, and for an unbeatable price. Get this one!"
Absolutely beautiful Bible!
I ordered it for my mother she loved everything about it the size the letters and it was delivered right before she walked out the door to church
I love my bible.
"Beautiful and easy to read, very nice book for the money."
Every thing went well with this order.
We bought this Bible for our eight-year-old son and it is perfect. Nice large print and very well-made.
This bible was a gift but I did like the feel and look of.
"Very Nice Bible. Good Quality,  but ordered for a older lady, and the writing was a lil yo small for her. Had to send back. But would have kept if writing was lil bigger."
"I love, love, just love my bible, planning to get 2 for my sisters in Christ."
"I bought this as a gift.  I am extremely happy with this bible, as the font is quite large. I would definitely recommend and would buy again."
"Received fast, Very large print and well made. Very happy with it, it looks and feels very nice. Thank you!"
This Bible is amazing. The wording is just the right size and and I can understand what I am reading. I have to order one for my mom.
Exactly what I expected.  Love it
"I Don't care for religion.  I purchase this book for my mother. She said she like it, and it's just what she wanted."
"Great quality, It came nicely packaged and sealed! God's words are in red. Super happy with this Holy Bible!"
100% Perfect - Works Great!  REAL NICE - You wont be disappointed !!!
"Great, exactly what I was looking for. So far the cross reference with the 1611 is accurate. The quality is excellent. The letters are large as advertised, very easy to read."
"Beautiful cover, nice paper, good size for easy carrying, and wonderful larger print for my failing eyesight.  I bought two."
I don't get sleepy from reading the large Print as I do with the smaller print Bibles.Awesome. No headaches either from trying to read. üíØüëäüèøüòé
"I received this as a gift, and overall I like it. However, the pages are extremely thin and the words on the next page bleed through so it can be annoying to read for a prolonged time."
"The pages are so thin that the writing on the other side bleeds through. I know that the pages on most all bibles are thin but not as bad as this one. The cover and the size was very nice. Unfortunately I had to send it back, and was not refunded the entire amount, little more than  $4 less."
Was very pleased with this Bible...everything I wanted!
Font is not huge but much bigger than regular 'large print'.  I miss tabs but it is perfect for daily reading through the Bible.
"This bible has become my study companion to the point that it has doubled its original size as I add my study notes and comments to the scripture verses.  I really like it and if there is a downside, it need more margin for more notes."
It is clear and good sized  print. The thumb tabs are very handy and the cover is very sturdy ! Love it !
The print was easy to read
Husband only reads the king james Bible
Bought for my 80 year old Mother and she has no problem reading it!! Great job!!

This is a great Bible.
My daughter gave this Bible as a graduation gift. She chose it because of the design and has more to offer for a beginner with study helps.
Good as a back upor a cheap priced Bible that gets the job done.
Did not like the fact bible is advertised as being jumbo print when it is not.
This is a really nice Bibe for the price. My husband actually took it because he decided that he wanted it for himself because the print is easy to read.
This bible has already started to split in the seams and can't return it now
"This is really cool , and the leather texture is üíØ üíØ üíØBig Words, Nice/Sweet Bible, now I'm definitely ready for Sunday School/Church"

"It says ""Giant Print"" but I still have to use my reading glasses."
This bible is beautifully and thoughtfully published. I know I will enjoy studying it for a very long time.
I liked this bible.  I bought it for my 9 year old son's birthday.  He was very happy with it.  Easy to read without a lot of extra.  Soft cover
"I bought this for my sister and I have to say, I was quite pleased with the quality and finish of this Bible! My sister loves it! The larger font is wonderful and makes it easy to read too! Definitely 5 stars!"
"In itself it is a very beautiful work of art. The leather feels good and has a nice texture. Everything is labeled clearly with ease to access with many convenient tools.  Many people have complaints about the text coming in backwards. Not the case with mine, mine came in 100% perfect and I would most definitely recommend. GOD BLESS AMERICA!"
Perfect  for dad
Great Holy Bible KJV. Very well made and exceeded my expectations
Basic interpretation

My item was fine but I was just surprised that my item was not even wrapped in bubble wrap or any type of covering inside the envelope. It could have got damaged luckily it didn't.
"The most beautiful Bible I have ever seen. I love that the words are big enough for me to read without glasses , I love the pink and brown Cover. I am also impressed that the letters are so big yet the Bible is still slim line."

Beautiful bible.  My husband was pleased with the look as well as the large size type.
"It‚Äôs the Bible so I‚Äôm obligated to give 5 stars, and it also took me over a year of reading it to find a singular typo (in Job 41:2). Buy it!"
This is a gorgeous bible! My son was delighted!
"This bible is so beautiful, from the color to the pages, and the design. So happy I got this"
A sturdy and study bible.  Quality material although not leather.  Worth the price. Highly recommend it.
The Bible is beautifully published
Yes and no.It was purchased to replaced a children‚Äôs bible giving as a gift.
This is the Old Testament not new. But a great read for ppl that Need god
"Maybe it's my fault but this isn't the kind of bible I thought it was going to be. I wanted a bible that was in plain English. Not thee, and thou, phrases. I'll keep it, but I have to be sure of what I'm getting before ordering another"
The pages are very thin and I'm afraid will be easily ripped. This bible was purchased for my grandson to take to school with him. I'm just praying it doesn't RIP easily. As far as the outside it is a beautiful Bible.
My girl friend loves her new Bible thank you for the early delivery.
I really like this Bible. Especially when your looking for.a.scripture that has to do with life. If I ever buy a Bible.as.a.gift this will be the one
"Great product. The size of the book and the words are perfect. The structure seems durable. I bought it for my daughter to use at home and school. I'm planning to purchase one for myself. Great seller, no problems."
Really amazing big letterAnd beautifull Bible Waow
"I see that the pages are a bit thin, but I didn't have any problem with seeing the print on the opposite side of the paper bleed through.  It is easy to read and a good quality book."
I bought this for a gift for an elderly friend.  She loves the large print.
I‚Äôm so happy with this!  The cover is stunning and the quality through out is amazing.  What a great price for such good quality!
"love the color  and the big print cause I can't see the smaller print well.. I like how God's words are highlighted. Just need a case to protect it. I got the purple tabs that match. Those are pretty also, makes it easier to find book names.  looks Just like the picture."
"This book is life changing!!! If there‚Äôs ANYTHING in your life that you haven‚Äôt forgiven, this will give you the perspective you need to move on with your life. I cannot recommend this book/workbook/DVD enough. I‚Äôm gifting it to everyone I know!"
"love this book - Lisa is a great writer and has been through so much,  Some parts of it are hard to get through though because if you have been hurt before it is just hard to Bring it up.  But by bringing it up, you give it a place and can put it in it's rightful place, the past."
I was expecting a book to read rather than a workbook of activities
Did not want this.  Please send me a CREDIT
"Unless I overlooked all 3 in 1 deal. Kinda disappointed I had to buy individually, costing me about $50.00. I also didn't realize that it's better to have all three items for complete understanding of the book as well. I ordered just the book and my friend accidentally ordered the study guide. When I looked at what she bought, it was clear you need the DVD. Already having the book, I ordered the guide a few days later. While I was waiting for the study guide, I then had to get the DVD. Took at least 2 or 3 weeks to get all three. Can't really read the book without the other 2 items."
Lysa has done it again. A book that will touch the heart and soul of all who read it. The beauty of Lysa‚Äôs books is ‚Äúwe are all Lysa ‚Äú as we read them.
Book is amazing study guide is not fluid it‚Äôs consistently hard for participants to follow most stopped using it by week 3 and did independent studies
Can‚Äôt wait to get into this book and hopefully good results come from this read.
"This item description needs to make it clearer that this is a Study Guide only, and to utilize it you must buy the DVD to watch the video. This is not a reading book. The description also needs to emphasize that this is fully Christian & religious based and not simply spiritual."
The main book was good but this one really brings the reader into a deeper jaunt into forgiveness. No surface stuff - the nitty gritty devil in the details (literally bc to not forgive and choose bitterness is to do the devil‚Äôs work for him)!Will revisit.
As expected
This book makes watching and then understanding the video easier. It helps me to stay on track and to think about forgiveness as it pertains to my life. The questions and the verses reinforce what I read in the book.
I thought I was ordering the book not the study book.  So...it might be great as a study guide.  I can't judge that since I ordered incorrectly.  double check before you order.
I didn't like this book because you have to buy the dvd that goes with this book and is used in a class
"Loved, Loved, Loved this Bible study.  Not only did it help me see those areas that I struggle with forgiveness but God revealed other areas that I need to address forgiveness as well."
This is supposed to have a video CD and it does not
Truth and grace pour from these pages.
Study guide is wonderful it helps out with the book and the journal combination
I just received this book today.  I wish that I had known there was video that went with the study guide to get through it.  I just wanted a book to read but I‚Äôll get through what I can.
The lady‚Äôs at our church all did a Bible study over this book. It was a great study guide but really makes you dig deep inside which can be painful but so rewarding!
What a book. She is a great teachers. Hits home...
Great study and great book. The study guide helped to solidify all that I learned in the book.
It‚Äôs nice to use and heal!
This is the best teaching on forgiveness I‚Äôve ever experienced. Highly recommended for your next women‚Äôs study or individual study.
Really helped me forgive someone who hurt me repeatedly.
Great read!!
Loved this book. Did a Bible study through Proverbs 31 Ministries.
didn't realize I needed the book for this. The book is great!!!
Would not recommend. Love her. But this was nothing like the description.
Excellent Biblr study
Very insightful and helpful in the healing process of learning how to forgive fully.
Didn‚Äôt realize this book is full of GOD and wasted my money on
So excited about this study. Excellent.
"If anyone truly wants to heal 100% no matter the season of life they‚Äôre in, no matter the horrible ‚Äúthing, act, word‚Äù done against one beit one time or over decades, this book is a must-have for a weapon of arsenal against anguish, shame, guilt or abuse and actually going thru the emotional door with hands and heart and faith in God to help walk thru the door of actual healing on the Highway of Forgiving.

He is the only way to totally heal, no reiki, new age, yoga, crystal worldly weirdness of any kind. 100% Jesus in tangible reality. Lysa shared the Real Deal about what she‚Äôs gone thru herself. Christmas gift for every girl iMeet!!!"
Great book
My grandaughtder bedroom
"From reading the first few sentences I knew it would be a good book. I saw that someone said the author should‚Äôve put in the book for all religions instead of from a Christian point of you. However if you‚Äôre a Christian person your belief is in Christianity so it‚Äôs impossible for you to write a book from other religious views . Even if you not a Christian  this is still a good book. Now while this book may not be for everyone, especially if you are not at the beginning stage of trying to forgive. There are lessons in this book that most can use every day. Great book!"
"Love the book, but I folks my paperbacks when I read. It's a habit. This tear at the spine is really inconvenient. Other than that, I highly recommend this study guide."
This book is sold as a study guide. Having purchased the book of the same name & cover I assumed it was to coordinate with the book chapters however it is actually for a group discussion about a video which is only available in the group.
This is a great study if you are having a hard time forgetting when you have forgiven.
This book was so amazing
"Like the charts and the fact the book is spiral but on the subject of Catholics it says they venerate Mary but in parentheses says ( a show of honor that stops short of worship of Mary. )The dictionary meaning of venerate is:verb regard with great respect; revere.We do not worship Mary!!!! We honor her as we do our own mothers. Mary is our Mother.It also says that :Many priest and members tend to accept liberal, pluralist beliefs contrary to church teachings which is totally false. I just wonder how many other religions that don't agree with KJV are getting the short end of the stick. I cannot recommend the book."
"Excellent charts and fascinating information on the Bible.  I will spend hours with this book looking at the fold out charts and side by side comparisons of versions of the Bible, as well as short summaries of each Book of the Bible. So much in this book is top notch and extremely well done with lots of great pictures.However, I have one suggestion and one complaint. My suggestion is on the list of what each Christian denomination believes it would be good to include the hot topics like what they believe on homosexuality and immigration.  My complaint is the information on Islam is extremely inaccurate. Having studied Islam full time professionally for over a decade, I can attest that the information here is horribly inaccurate.  Learn about Islam on your own.  And the only true way to learn about Islam is to read the books yourself and study the writings of exMuslims.  The leaders of Islam engage in massive propaganda, and they appear to have been where Rose Publishing got their information.  There is a whole short chapter on Islam, but it is worthless propaganda with very little that is factual.Other than the Islamic propaganda, this is a 10 star book! But the propaganda does seriously damage the credibility of the book."
"I found this book somewhat disturbing. It seems to spend lots of pages on non-Christian religions, emphasizing enter-faith issues. I felt a subtly crafted anti-Christian propaganda message as I read this book. Not so much anti-Christian directly, but a message designed to weaken Christian faith. I would not give this book to children, especially given its shiny, color illustrations. I returned it."
"I ordered this book for use in my atrium (children‚Äôs retreat center). As a Catholic, I found some parts to be too didactic and representative of a different faith tradition, for example it says the Bible is to be read literally.  I decided not to use it with my children. I really wanted more maps. Maps of the possible routes of Abraham and the Exodus, for example. I‚Äôm also cautious of comparisons between denominations, it‚Äôs so easy to get things wrong. Beautiful pages."
"What an absolutely wonderful book. It's not just maps and timelines. It is very well illustrated and simplifies all the right things, along with all the right comparisons of other religions and cults and such a way that it answers questions you didn't even know to ask. They also did a wonderful job in citing scripture throughout.This a fantastic book for any level of Christian."
"I was expecting something pretty decent, and when I got it I was not disappointed.  When I unpacked it, I started leafing through it and I just stopped everything I was doing, and sat down for almost an hour.  I really wish it were available in electronic form!  It would be so useful on my phone and tablet.  Anyway, the quality of the book is outstanding.  Very thick high quality paper, in a spiral binding.  The content just goes on and on exploring the Bible in ways no other book that I know of does.  Highly recommended, planning to buy more for Christmas presents."
"LOVE THIS BOOK!  Some review I read said not to think about it, just buy it....and stated it so emphatically that I did.I was looking for a tool to help me study the Bible and this was just the type of thing that I was looking for.  It is a book that you will pick up and not be able to put down.  Everyone that I have shown it to has asked where I got it while they look through the ENTIRE book.  You can turn to any page and their is something there to get you thinking about the Bible, its history, and the worshipers that have preceded us. Every chart, graph, map, etc. is cross-referenced with Biblical references that make you WANT to get your Bible and start reading.  It really brings the Bible to life.  So I will reiterate what previous reviewers have said, ""I cannot appropriately describe how cool this book is, just buy it!"""
"It is great in the information about Time Lines, analysis of Christian and Cult information, etc.But the maps (for which I was mainly buying it) were sadly lacking in information.  Likethe original place and boundaries of the 12 tribes were nothing more than a blotch ofcolor and the colors were too close in shade.  The other maps could have been better also.It would have also been nice to see the area of the Tribes that is promised eventually.  Just a thought.The information I did get is interesting but I'll have to get another source for more informative maps."
"I'm always fascinated with history whether it has to do with religion or in general. I have to say im very disappointing on how this book doesnt mention anything about Armenians. How can you write a book about religion and not mention the first people to adopt christianity at 301AD and how Armenians played a  Crucial role in the crusades. Along with his fellow apostle Jude ""Thaddeus"", Bartholomew is reputed to have brought Christianity to Armenia in the 1st century. Thus, both saints are considered the patron saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church. One tradition has it that Apostle Bartholomew was executed in Albanopolis in Armenia. A ancient country that's was recognized by many ancient countries and to exist till day doesnt even get one sentence in this book or any mention . I'm not super religious but this book is another falsifiable informations made by people that either dont know history or are doing it on purpose. Shame on those people"
"I thought this book was non-denominational and relative the stand alone Holy Bible. I expected the facts stated to be well researched. I quickly realized that the only sources sited are biblical scripture, who knows which Bible version, leaving a wide gap for interpretive error. First blatant lie I noticed was the claim about Joseph Smith and Mormonism, claiming that he and his religion ‚Äúdenies the trinity.‚Äù That statement has never been true. Non-members of that church have easy access to their beliefs. Heck, all you have to do is google it or check out Wikipedia. It doesn‚Äôt take in depth research to do the fact checking. Now I‚Äôm wondering what else in this book is either completely false, or written based on ignorance or miss interpretation. The idea of this book is great. Now get someone to do the real work of siting sources and fact checking."
"The book is very well done.  Beautiful timelines, illustrations, graphics, maps, etc.  It helps put the story and characters into an easily understandable order.  It's a weird set up due to fold outs and multi page pieces, all in a spiral binding, but it is very well done.  The problem comes with the historical details which are often completely wrong.  It relies on what may still be considered common knowledge, but not archeological evidence.  It presents information that has been proven to be false, forged by early apologists.  It would have been well received in the early 1700's, but a lot has come to light disputing much of it's info since then.  Still has value, just don't rely on it as history."
"Largely inaccurate... thevmaps and much reference in it is good... but beware of biases in any book like this or even commentators.  Read the Word and let it determine your paths.  Even the chapter intros attempt to define the why based on some christianese such as ""legalism"" and other religion info way off... if you take everything with a grain of salt the references to scripture by topic can be used to further study but be like the Bereans who tested everything against the only scripture they had at that time... the old testament.  The entire scripture old and new does not contradict so where a conflict arises... be diligent to understand which part is being misunderstood.  Avoid the traditions and doctrines of man and stick to His Word.  üòâ"
I had this book recommended to me as an excellent Bible study aid but I was skeptical so didn't want to spent top dollar for one. I was pleased with how quickly the book arrived and the more I look through it the more impressed I become. To discover the historical happenings at the time 1 Peter was written gave me a greater appreciation for that book of the Bible.  I WILL be buying another to give as a gift to my daughter-in-law.
"The timeline is helpful in keeping up with the chronology of the Bible which is the main  reason I bought it. But there is so much more such as  brief overviews of the various books and very helpful pictures that help you to visualize things like the Tabernacle. There is a list of archeological finds that support the truths of the Old Testament. I haven't yet got into the section on the New Testament but it seems to be just as helpful. There is a section that compares the various religions, denominations and cults that I have found interesting. The map section is great because it compares the area then with the way it is now. If you want a good companion to your Bible study, this is it."
"The quality of the book I received today is disappointing. I purchased this book 3 times. The first 2 times great quality, today a matted gritty slightly damaged cover. The two other purchases had a smoother outside cover. I purchased this as a gift for one of the VP's I work with who is going on a trip and wanted her to have it. Now I have to give her a bad quality book. Not sure you can tell in the picture but one matted and dull and one shinny and beautiful. I'm so annoyed right now. Inside same good quality as the other 2 purchased previously.  It feels yucky. Ugh..."
"I almost did not buy this book based on a few reviews but am so glad I did! It is funny how different people interpret things differently. I have always read my bible but started a intense study at the beginning of the COVID lockdowns and this is absolutely amazing for anyone who is studying God's word. It does show different religions but that it is a comparison of beliefs in different religions which makes a interesting read, it in no way tries to convert to one religion or another nor make any one religion seem bad, it is for reference only. This book is very well made for the price, I am actually surprised the price is so low for the amount of content in this book! The pages are nice thick pages and the detail is amazing! I also got one for my cousin and she is ordering three more to give as gifts! No wonder this is always out of stock! If you do bible study just buy it! I promise you will not regret it! Adding a few pics of the religion reference since that is almost what stopped me from buying it plus a few others. If I could rate this a 10 I would!"
"I have been a fan of Rose products for years, utilizing their pamphlets in Sunday school and Bible studies for years.  Several of my more used ones were torn and coffee stained (the contrast of denominations, the basic Revelation break down, proofs for the Bible) so I was very happy to see this book gathered those and dozens of others into a ""Greatest Hits"" if you will.  I was blown away when I got this book delivered.  The amount of great information packed into this is beyond words.  It tackles so much in brightly colored, well thought out write ups that I can find no real fault.  It has a very strong binder holding it together and is from great quality paper.  While it does not go into detail in any one area, it touches on nearly everything you could want.  How we got the Bible, the proof of both Testaments, the teachings, parables, and fulfilled prophecies of Jesus, the disciples, the different views on Revelation and the millennium, and so much more.  There may be a few subjects that are missing, but how can you criticize this much good?  I do not give 5 star ratings often.  This deserves it.  Worth every penny."
"I knew the minute I saw my friend‚Äôs copy of the ‚ÄúRose Guide to the Tabernacle with Clear Plastic Overlays and Reproducible Charts‚Äù I had to have my copy.Just a few of the unique features I found helpful include:‚Ä¢ A Complete Table of Contents with detailed descriptions of the material covered topic by topic within each unit.‚Ä¢ An extensive Bible Overview‚Ä¢ Amazing page foldouts including:1. Bible Time Line2. A Detailed Genealogy of Jesus‚Ä¢ Detailed Map and Subjects Indices‚Ä¢ A Wonder Visual Study Tool‚Ä¢ Spiral Binding that allows the book to lie flat on the desk for extensive studyI recently completed a Perspectives Study on Worldwide Missions and found the two page spread detailing the 10-40 window of the Middle East and Central Asia especially helpful ‚Äì an excellent source for establishing a meaningful prayer plan for these countries.‚ÄúRose Guide to the Tabernacle with Clear Plastic Overlays and Reproducible Charts‚Äù is a must resource for serious Bible Students, Pastors, Lay leaders, and professional Christian Educators."
"I thought there might be more maps of ancient civilizations in the Levant, but it's certainly good enough for my purposes.  I was pleasantly surprised that this was more of an apologetics book for the Christian faith, although some of the graphics/drawings seem to be geared toward the less professional, but still well done.  This book should be in every Christian home.  What am I saying?  It should be in EVERY home!  Read the Table of Contents, and you will get a sense of what I mean."
"I can probably write a book about all the things I love about this book. The breakdown and pictures are so helpful and easy to understand. This book has great quality of pictures and the pages are not cheaply made. When you recieve this product you just get excited about digging in and learning. This is a great book for teachers, ministers and even pastors. I like that it gives you an open view on other things out side of Christianity so you can know the history behind other religions and non believers. This book is definitely worth every penny."
"This is a very good book. Has a lot of good information and details. However, as I was looking through it, I discovered some inaccuracies. There are definitely some things in there that actually do not reflect what the bible says or teaches, and some of the interpretation is off. But overall, a good book to have for a beginner as a starting point. And just a good source to add to your Bible library, just make sure to study the Bible in detail and not rely on this book completely."
"I recommend this to everyone. It is clear, concise, engaging and well organized. I have used for my own study and recommended it to participants in a ""How to Study the Bible"" course that I taught. I used it extensively during the course. I also bought a copy for my 24 year old nephew. The list of the Names of God on pages 36 and 37 is wonderful and has been a true blessing during a difficult time. It is divided into Bible Overview, Old Testament, New Testament, Maps, a section on other religions, and indexes.The book itself is a sturdy, spiral bound hardcover. It is easy to make copies of pages as needed for teaching and Rose Publishing encourages it.This is a terrific investment. There's so much good stuff in this book that it's hard to list it all. I have had this book a couple of years and still find myself marveling at everything that is packed in it. Give it a try. It will really enrich your love and awe of GOD, your prayer life, study, sharing the gospel, and discussions about the Word of GOD."
I‚Äôm geeking out over here!! This book is amazing!!!!! In the description with it being spiral bound I wasn‚Äôt thrilled (the quality seems lesser) but now that I have it in hand I‚Äôm super glad it‚Äôs like this. It stays over without having to prop it down and it makes it way easier to flip around to find your page. I‚Äôm just a SAHM who loves the Bible but I want to have historical and factual knowledge aside from wisdom and revelation. This makes it easy for me to memorize things without access to real classes.
This will be a great reference book to be kept in my study where I do my daily Bible Study reading.  The pictures are glossy high quality images; the text is easy to read [and easy to see in the dim light of my Study]; the maps are big and detailed with both modern day cities and ancient times cities clearly identified; and the bonus I didn't expect to see... detailed explanations about other religions and their points/time periods of origination!
"I love this book. I've been using it for reference for about two months or so, and have yet to find any information to be lacking. It seems to have EVERY relevant topic in both the New and Old Testaments covered and covered well. Along with the exceptional notes provided in my KJV cross reference bible, this is an extremely useful for my study. I'm very happy with his book."
"How could a Bible student or teacher NOT love this brand new updated book of this timeless classic ?!  I happen to own the first edition, which is awesome in itself, but the 2nd edition looks fresher and has so much more valuable content.  I was especially pleased to see that Rose included their new Genealogy of Jesus Christ fold out, as I love this !  Two of my other favorites: Psalm 23 and The Lord‚Äôs Prayer pamphlets are also included in the new version, as well as 4 other of their newer pamphlets.  The ‚ÄòThen and Now Bible Maps‚Äô have been updated, which is well worth the money for the book all by itself.If you are a small group leader or a Sunday school teacher, you will never again have to scour for charts or visuals for your class.  I love the fact that you can print up to 300 copies of any page - and they print beautifully, by the way. What an incredible money saver for ‚Äòalready money strapped‚Äô teachers.  That fact illustrates one of the things I particularly value about Rose Publishing:  they LOVE teachers.  The company was founded by  a public school teacher and a Sunday School teacher, and they understand what teacher‚Äôs value.I know that I won‚Äôt find charts like these available anywhere else, as Rose is the leader in graphically rich, doctrinally sound Bible teaching visuals.  If you already own the original version of the book (like me) you will still want this newest version as well.  The price makes it so easy to afford."
"I love this book!! Saw it in the airport, but had no room to carry, so bought after landing from Amazon.  This is such a helpful book to understand the timeline of occurrences, there are descriptions of various people from the bible and so much information! Easy to read- and will also be helpful to teach the children! beautiful drawings, maps and more!  I just can't say enough about how wonderful this book is and how helpful !"
"Quality binding and printing, yet hard for my old eyes, needing a magnifying  glass at times, this book is a wonderful graphic source of information, though there may be some sources of contention among the many denominations and cults, the meat is there to be consumed. Do not throw the meat out with the bone.  Do not throw the baby out with the bath water. Read it and be informed. I recommend this source for all seeking the truth."
"Gorgeous book with amazing illustrations.  Package came on time and information appears to be excellently presented.  This is probably NOT for younger children to read by themselves but is an excellent resource.  Pictures are amazing, timeliness are detailed and easy to follow, plus the amount of information contained is so comprehensive it was simply suprising. The authors have done a wonderful job of breaking information into relevant sections with such thorough explanations as to be more than just a simple once over. This is a comprehensive, thought provoking, colorful resource the entire family can use!"
"If you want to learn almost everything about the Word of God this is for you.  Fantastic read and have it on my table in the family room where I can learn where Jesus traveled, history of the 12 men who became His friends, books of the bible, and also learned just about everything I wanted to know.  Thank you so much not only of all the information but the illustrations were awesome.  dot"
"Bought this for more insight to look into a second trip to Israel after Covid. Since this book spans different religions, there will always be those who see certain parts as biased. Mine is spiral-bound. I think there have been many different revisions and types of this book over the years, so check with your reseller or expect that you may not get exactly whats in the photos."
"This book is even better than I expected. It contains so much information in a very visual and organized manner. It‚Äôs great for studying the Bible in depth, for understanding complicated topics and for teaching others as well. I bought this for my husband and he loved it. I‚Äôm very visual and loved all the images. There‚Äôs lots of text as well but easy to follow. Great quality. Absolutely worth it!"
"Amazing as a supplement for bible study! I was really impressed with the accuracy of the facts and all the things this book touches on. I reference it often, as it contains strongly supported facts and evidence as well as accurate maps. Would definitely recommend this book!"
This is amazing and a wealthy of information! I went through and ended up purchasing one for my parents too! My mom especially loves it and has mentioned it several times now in conversation! Very worth the money!
Book had something spilled on the back cover. Tried using water but it's still there. I had planned on buying the other 2 books in this set but after the condition of this book I no longer will be doing that. Also on the front cover. But it didn't get inside the book so far. Just disgusted.
"I teach a women's bible study group and I hoped this book would work for a resource.  I have not been disappointed.  We copied and are using markers to trace the journey of Christ.  The information on the disciples is not as detailed as I would like, but prints off well and is a great starting point.  It's a bit of a challenge to print from a home printer, but you can do it with a little attention to the detail."
This book is a great companion to your Bible. It allows you to see what you‚Äôre reading in live color and with much explanation. It brings out so much more in illustrations and explanations that you could spend hours ‚Äúawing‚Äù as you get a clearer understanding of Biblical times and today‚Äôs lifestyle.
"This is a WONDERFUL resource! Great illustrations, lots of elements that will bring the Bible and other religions. Plus, the book is reproducible, so it‚Äôs great for classes. I‚Äôm very pleased."
"Wow!  A lot of information in a very condensed easy to digest format, with amazing charts, timelines, figures, and color-codes summaries.  Very well thought-out and great for anyone interested understanding the context of the information in Bible and how it all fits together. I can not imagine how much work went into this."
"I absolutely LOVE this book. I use it along with my Bible of course but this book makes the KJV of the Bible so much easier to understand. I'm going to treat myself once a month until I have them all. I simply cannot say enough about how wonderful and enlightening this book makes the Bible, any version of the Bible. It's a must-have, especially people new to exploring the Bible."
"I bought this book over 3 years ago, and it has been an excellent study guide. I refer to it often for the Bible timeline, charts and useful information. I find it to be truthful, accurate and fair toward religion and Bible doctrine. I would recommend it to anyone interested in gaining a deeper understanding of God's Word."
"Purchased two these books for two of my family members that study Bible frequently. The information is well organized and accurate referencing the Bible. The look of the book, and the charts are visually stunning. This book makes a great teaching tool for people that prefer a more visual teaching method. You will enjoy this book from cover to cover."
This is a hard cover spiral book that is very well made and chocked full of wonderful information.  It's the perfect outline for studying the Bible.
"Rose has always produced quality products , and this book is no exception .. it puts so much information at your fingertips and in a simple format ...also  very good to show kids fun things about the bible !"
I wanted something that would give me maps of the area and a good timeline.  This book did and so much more.  If you are wanting and interested in learning about the areas and timeline of the Bible this is the book for you.  It has so much more to offer that I don't want to spoil it by saying much more.  Just know if you are a bible scholar or just your average Joe or Jane you will like this book.
"Very interesting and its a great visual to add to bible study. Shows a Bible history, world history, and middle east history. Even tells you about the prophets who wrote the books,genealogy of Jesus, events in Jesus life and so much more. Definitely buy this if you want to expand your bible studies."
"Absolutely stunningContains a Bible overview, information on the OT (12 tribes of Judah, pictures and facts on the tabernacle, the judges, kings and prophets, holy days, etc), and information on the NT (genealogy of Jesus, miracles of Jesus, His hours on the cross, seven churches of Revelations), and various maps.Definitely a great asset to have while studying the Bible.And there and wonderful illustrations."
"Fantastically presented info. Dogma made it difficult to use as a Catholic, really sold Catholic doctrine short and got unnecessarily polemic."
"I received this book less then an hour ago.  I took it out to take a quick look and couldn't put it down.  It is absolutely packed with charts, maps, brief histories & biographies - all easy to read with wonderful visuals.  Don't hesitate to purchase.  I believe it would be impossible to be disappointed."
The round one that kept showing up on my social thread feed intrigued me but lack of good reviews got me looking around for a better option. I bought this based on other people's reviews and I'm not disappointed. I've read through it once and now my husband and I use it alongside our Dr. Charles Stanley study bible as a help. I love the information in it and the layout. Very easy to use and carry around since it's book-sized.
"This is the best companion book to the Bible. I‚Äôm on a plan to read the Bible in three years. This book to helps me gain a deeper understanding of what I‚Äôm studying.  As a visual learner, looking at the maps and lineages helps me retain and connect to the chapters I‚Äôm studying. It‚Äôs very detailed and an invaluable resource."
"Whether you are studying the bible on your own or with a group, or are teaching the bible - this is a resource that you will love to have.This book is amazing!  It has so much information in it and it is all layed out beautifully.  Each page is in color and on thicker than normal paper.  Whether you enjoy studying the bible or teaching it, this book is a resource you will be thrilled to have.At the bottom of each page, in very small print, you are given copyright permission for use in teaching (just not for sale), so you can copy and distribute to students any page that helps in teaching/sharing, or color copy and laminate a page to put up in the classroom/study area.  Each page looks like a chart that you could see hanging on the wall.  Actually, some of these pages I have seen exactly the same but sold in large poster size.I just bought this book a few days ago and I know when I show it around everyone will want to buy a copy for themselves.I am even considering buying a second copy just to have one book that I can take apart so I can hang up individual pages during bible studies.If you decide to buy it you will not be disapointed.Happy Reading!"
"Every Bible student NEEDS this book. It's a storehouse of good information, documentation and history regarding the Bible. Don't know how I did without it for so many years. Now, I have given 3 books as gifts and getting ready to place my order for the 4th gift purchase. A wealth of knowledge/information."
"This book is a treasure trove of information. The timelines and maps are great to gain a full picture when reading about places and genealogies in the Bible.  The pictures are in full vivid color and there is so much other information, I cannot list it all in this review."
"This book comes in handy when I am doing my Bible study and wondering where the events of what I am reading fits into the overall World History. Book lays flat and is easy to use.  I also got the small, leaflet of the basic timeline shown in the book for a more portable source."
"Nice maps and great organization.  I read a lot of books on my Kindle, but the quality of the graphics is lacking.  This gives a nice reference to look at for clarity, when my Kindle falls short.  It also contains a lot of details about the different Christian churches and how they split from Roman Catholic.  Well worth the money."
"I have the whole collection of Rose books, and will highly recommend each of them. If you're only going to get one of them though, this is the one to get. It's got a little bit of everything in it, from 100 of the prophesies Jesus fulfilled, to where and when the twelve Disciples laid the foundation for the Christian church, to how King Solomon's Temple was laid out, to what the middle east looked like then versus now. It's really an excellent book."
"This was a Christmas gift for my oldest sister. She was not only surprised, she was like a kid in a candy store!!! She has plans to exile herself from others just to indulge in this intensely historical book!!! This sister is pretty difficult to please, so when she called me with the joy of excitement in her voice I knew it was the perfect gift!!!!"
Love it. It is packed full of historical Biblical info. I bought the book for my dad at Christmas and ended up buying myself the book after Christmas. A great addition to your Bible study or history of creation up through 200 AD (if I remember correctly).
"This is exactly what I was looking for . I enjoy every detail in this book because while I am reading my Bible I can also go and see in parallel the history of the world also. Maps then and now and so much more. If you are a Bible reader, this is very helpful."
"I first saw this book on sale at a conference I was attending. I got it $5 cheaper through Amazon Prime.Amazing work, it gives didactical overviews, useful charts, maps, and time frame references on Bible general contents. A real quick tool for Christian ministers, pastors, church planters, lay leaders, etc. Go for it, you will not regret buying a copy of this book! However, I don't give it five stars because it doesn't have a comprehensive map of the Roman Empire. Even though this book is not an Atlas, I think it should provide at least one decent map of the Roman Empire in the first century."
"excellent for cross referencing! I got way more out of this book than I intended to! I love love love this book! I like that I can copy the maps and fill in any thing that I am currently studying to get a better picture of ancient times! I cant say enough good about how well this book is put together! I think all people that are interested in the Holy Bible or History itself, should own this!"
Fantastic book for actually seeing the generations of Jesus and other biblical figures. There is also good maps of the holy land then and now and scriptures about Jesus journey as he taught! Very helpful book
"This informative book provides an in-depth guide to many aspects of the Bible. The text is written in a clear, concise way to add toanyone's understanding of the story of the Bible. It also contains valuable information about the cultural, geographical, and politicalcurrents of the time.  A valuable comparison (synopsis) of different religions helps the reader to clarify why Christianity is the truefaith of those who believe in the greatest story ever told."
"You‚Äôre really looking hard to see anything negative about this resource. If you want to learn facts not presented in the Bible, historical elements, timelines, maps....if you want a library of info at your fingertips, this is well worth your investment."
I am writing only one review that covers all three of the Rose Books of Bible Charts and Maps.  I am a minister and a member of the congregation had a copy of the first of these books and brought it for me to review.  I loved it and ordered not only that one but the two that followed it.  They will prove an invaluable resource for my study in sermon and Bible class preparation.  The quality is very good and the work the presentation good. I would recommend these to any serious Bible student.
Bought one of these at a retail store for my sister's birt hday.  After looking through it I was so impressed that I ordered one for my home.  Even if you are nor religious this book is a great history book.  Sure wish I had one in my growing up years as I have never enjoyed reading the Bible---it always left me overwhelmed and confused.  This book changed all of that.
"Love, love, love! Great addition to my kids ministry! Very informative, beautifully laid out, colorful, and spiral bound for easy sharing. Great overview and additional insight to the bible and history."
Great tool for researching scripture.  Brings the Bible to a visual understanding. The pages are colorful -attracting for more knowledge of who God of Heaven and earth  really is. Building a bond seeing and experiencing His glorious beauty in all things in heaven and  earth.May God bless your journey for wisdom and love.
"As soon as I saw the title and description of this book, I ordered it. I'm a religious studies student, and thought it would really help me retain information by putting images to what I'm reading. But I got much more than expected. I was blown away! Honestly, aside from the bible, this is the best book I've ever acquired. It's well organized, provides every easy-to-read chart and map you could ever want. But it doesn't stop there. The archeological information and photos of artifacts also helps bring the stories and time lines to life. And I can't even adequately express how stunning the graphics are in this book. I spent several minutes looking at the depiction of the tabernacle, alone. My kids flip through it every chance they get, just to look at depictions of things they've heard and read about. This is definitely a resource I'll be going to time and time again through my studies and for years to come. GET THIS BOOK!Lemelia Bonner"
"The content is excellent, and the presentations are clear. Many photos, mini biographies, and lots of clarifying information. Perfect for individuals, families, and church libraries. This 10th anniversary edition is worth every penny."
"This is by far the best reference book of Bible Timelines, it is complete with so much information that I have enjoyed studying.  It is very eye opening.  The charts and maps are eye opening.  The depictions of the Tabernacle and Temple are stunning.  I would recommend this book for anyone who is interested in studying the Bible"
I like the thorough but also useful charts. The comparisons of religions and Christian denominations was eye-opening and clear. Some of the graphics look pretty outdated but that doesn't interfere with the function.
This is a wonderful book for individuals or groups to learn about what's in the bible.  I will use this for our bible study group.  The maps are great because they show maps in the days of Christ compared to today.
"What a handy book!  I have many Rose Publishing books and this one seems to have everything!  The slick pages have excellent photos, drawings, etc.  Having a spiral binding helps to allow the book to lie flat.I do wish that there were tabs for the main subjects, otherwise this is perfect! You will not be sorry if you buy this!  I also sent a copy to a friend of mine."
"I love this wonderful book about the Bible. There is so much information about the books of the Bible, the prophets, the important people of the Bible. Pretty much every question you have about the Bible is in this book.  Bible charts, maps, time lines. Everyone should have this book."
"Wow, if you are a student of the Bible, this book will amaze you.  They have collected so much information and produced it in various formats that are informative, beautiful, helpful and easy to find.  As I show this to friends, they usually ask where to get a copy.  It is seems sturdy and well made.  I hope it will last for many years of use."
Sooo much easier to reference and get big picture and faster learning
"This Book of Bible Charts, Maps and Timelines is a great compilation of teaching materials, reproducible for classroom instruction, with a wealth of Biblical & historical facts, archaeological and geographical location photos and drawings. I highly recommend it!"
I absolutely LOVE this book.  We are working on apologetics at church and several of the ladies had bought this book already.  The illustrations are BEAUTIFUL! It is a hardback spiral bound book.  I look forward to using this for years to come as a reference.  It is very detailed.  Not heavy or too thick to carry around with you either.
I can't recall the numerous times that I have used this book for clarity. The very first chart should be a must for all students of the old testament. This is one book that I am so glad that I purchased.
"I am really impressed with the amount, presentation, and biblical soundness of the information in this book. My boys and I have spent some time flipping though the various pages and discussing the information. Having this helps lend context to our discussions."
I just got back from Israel and this book has helped me understand some of what I saw even more.
"Over the years I have benefited from many single charts which I have purchased from Rose Publishing each individually.I love this book because it provides me with the above charts along with a large number of others all in one place.Rose charts are helpful to me, specifically, because I am a visual kind of learner."
"Very excellent book highly useful for Bible study at any level. A complete resource including detailed maps, charts and timelines. Any student of the Holy Scriptures would benefit from having a copy."
"The book is great!! I the spiral is bent which caused a tear in the back of the book. Because of this, the pages are a little hard to turn and lay flat. Im sure this happened during shipping. I've been excited to receive it so probably won't return it because I want to read it!!!"
Very nice colorful presentations of things that I had a hard time visualizing when reading about them in the Bible.  Makes a very nice teaching aid for Bible study or Sunday School teachers!
"This is one of my favorite books. I can't seem to put it down! It is absolutely packed with information about the Bible.  Anything you want to know is in this book, from the beginning of man, to modern day religions. You will get so much information, and absolutely feel blessed by it."
"I love this book. Sometimes when I am reading my Bible, I go to this book to get a better idea of where a town is or what the temple layout looked like, or the timeframe of a certain event. This book covers so much. AND AND AND, the publisher permits owners to make copies of things in the book for the purposes of teaching a class or a Bible study. It can't be used for commercial purposes though. This information is written in the book. I purchased this for myself, then I purchased one for a friend of mine who teaches Sunday School, and recently I purchased one for a pastor who teaches in various settings."
This book is enlightening and helped me put things in a better perspective. It encourages me to read deeper so I can correlate locations better in the Bible. I liked this book so much I gave my Mother one and she loves it!
"I was looking for something to give me more of an idea of what was happening at the same time during the Bible stories. This book is very helpful for that, but doesn't have a chart like I was expecting.It is chalk full of great information that I never considered and gives me a reference for times. Definitely a great book."
"Full of information in an easy to read, abridged format.  Fabulous illustrations. Lay flat,  hard cover spiral binding makes it so easy to use alone, or in a classroom setting"
"This informs my study, teaching and preaching.  I carry it with me to Bible studies in small groups and am able to both cite as well as use for visual aids to provide context and perspective."
"I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Biblical History. Very detailed and useful. Covers the Bible and many other religions and compares them in many ways, and ties it all into the historical timeframe."
"Rose Book of Bible Charts, Maps, and Timeline is an excellent visual presentation of bible events and historical context of coincidental events in world history.Each area of presentation is laid out chronologically. Also there are many explanations for subjects that cover several biblical books, such as the Arc of the Covenant and the Tabernacle.Highly recommend this resource."
Bought as a gift and he loved it!
My Bible study leader uses this book for reference along with the Bible. I liked it so much I need my own copy for my personal study and a more in-depth study.
Great reference book for Bible study. Also interesting to just flip through and read. Accurate information.Good color photos and layout is easy to read.
"If you are looking for concise, detailed information on the Tabernacle, feasts etc, this is the book you want. Colorful pictures, detailed temple prints and more."
"Outstanding overview of Christian doctrine. Has thorough discussion of just about every Christian topic that you can think of.  Many maps, historical timelines and pertinent illustrations throughout the book. A must-have coffee table book for any Christian home."
There isn't anything I dislike about this product. It is amazing and puts the Bible into a new perspective with visual help. I got it as a reference book to refer to when I want to know more about what I read in my Bible and it does not disappoint!
I was not expecting so much. this book is jam packed full of information. so interesting. You get a lot more than your money's worth with this. I can't say enough good about it. awesome buy.
"Using this in s Bible study with beginners.  Very helpful.  Best of kind on among new visual aids for beginning Bible students.  Incidentally, using it with Catholics--even though it's a general reference.  2 reasons:  1. Catholics have nothing as good as this on the market.  2. Differences can be used as conversation starters if you don't let them go knee-jerk on you.  Get them to talk."
"I wish I had this book a long time ago when I was still in college.It was a private Catholic university and we have 2 years religion subject.It is a wonderful resource in understanding some Biblical events/info.I bought this mainly for my own study guide when reading the Bible and have no regrets.For those who teaches at a Bible study,I highly recom.it."
The maps and lists are terrific.  Allows for perspective with respect to other bible events.Laid out great.  A terrific reference document.
It is a very useful book for bible studying person. It helps with timeline and a lot of plot to understand the story in it. Feel like a bible dictionary some kinds
I love this book! It was a good quality especially for the price and easy to use. Very informative and great pictures and diagrams.
I found this so helpful to turn to while reading my Bible. I love a visual to help me learn! Bought one as a gift for a friend also reading the Word.
"This is really great book! If you are building a bible library, I would recommend this be the third book you get.  #1 the Bible, #2 Strong Exhaustive Concordance and this would be the third book.  This book sums up key events with few comprehensible words and picture."
"I almost passed this book up. I am so thankful that I did not. This book is amazing. It is full of easy to read and understand charts, maps and timelines but, it is way more than that. The book and illustrations are stunning. The quality of the book and paper that it is printed on far exceeds what you would expect for this book. I would pay double the price. I will be giving these for Mother's Day this year and maybe ordering a few more to give away. If you have stumbled upon this book please purchase it, you will not regret it! This book is also great no matter where you are in your biblical learning. The fact that it is spiral bound and lays flat is a huge bonus."
This book is loaded with information for as few pages as it has! The pages are colorful and interesting. The spiral binding makes the pages easier to turn.Cons:I would have liked to have more maps even though the ones in the book are fantastic.
Very good book
"Amazing book for all ages, all stages, great information for learning about many  types of religion and the differences between Christianity.  It is not boring, and  doesn‚Äôt make you feel like a bad human. It is so easy to just keep reading and is an excellent reference for questions.  The spiral binding is fantastic as well!  We have bought 4, with plans to buy more. Many people have looked at it and also wanted one!  Highly recommended!"
This thing is like goldI was pleasantly surprised with this book. It is so informative and good for teaching. I would recommend this to others.
I love this book and all the rose books. These educators really knew how to get the true and correct information within these books. Love love love them!
"NICE book laden with helpful and very interesting charts, maps and more.  I love the quality within and that it is a spiral!  Get it for enrichment in discovering your bible!  Highly Recommend!"
This is an Amazing book! Just beautiful! Excellent price & very well made. Totally worth it! I purchased this based on all the great reviews and am SO glad I did.
I love this book.  I had one and bought this as a gift.  Packed full of great information and comparisons.  It is not just a book of maps.
"Oh my gosh!  This book is amazing and a treasure for anyone who loves the Bible as much as I do.  There is a ton of valuable information in there, and it is organized wonderfully.  This is a must have for anyone who reads the Bible."
Outstanding book quality and value.  This book has become a cornerstone in my research of the rise and times of Christianity.  This book is worth double to the price.  I could not be more pleased.
"Overall good, some illustrations are a different DPI than the rest of the book which reduces the quality of the book. Good for my family‚Äôs study and curiosity."
"I purchased this book for my personal Bible study and I am not disappointed with it. Even though I havent had the time to truly begin to study it, I have caught myself being drawn into it and the more I read the more I want to read. Then as I study the Bible things will come to mind that I read in this book. In my opinion if you're wanting to learn more about the different types of religions that are in the world not just while Jesus walked the earth but even religions that pertain to today, then this book is for you. The only drawback I see is I wish I had this book 40+years ago after I was saved because I'm sure I would know more about the Bible than I do now."
This book will give you a new perspective on how and when things happened. It gives full explanations of who people are that are mentioned in the Bible that aren't so well known and especially the real timing of events throughout the Bible.
"I absolutely love this book!! The maps, charts, and timelines, are accurate, informative, easy to read, and helpful in my commentary writing and Sunday school lessons. This is an absolute must have! I will start reading through it in the next few days. Thank you Rose Publishing for a great book to add to my collection."
"This book of charts and maps is very good. Sometimes a good graphic or ""info-graphic"" can communicate what words cannot. This book is full of great ones to enhance your understanding of Biblical concepts. I love it."
Great resource and format.  Larger size for my 65yr. old eyes.  Loads of information that will keep me busy for some time to come.
"This was a Christmas gift for a family member, and he has used the book every day since receiving it and can't say enough good things about it! So pleased it has been such a great resource for someone who loves to study the Bible."
"I bring this to Sunday bible study. The depth if this material is such that we always find at least one thing to look up. From genealogies, to... Oh just buy it, you won't be disappointed."
Every lay person should have a copy of this in their house to accompany their Bible. This information is concise and to the point and not bogged down my theological excess infromation so that it's accessible to anyone. The layout and design in outstanding. I am disappointed I have not had this as part of library for years. I will be buying these as gifts this Christmas. If you are looking to a deeper book to do deep research then this is not for you.
This book has wonderful thick color pages. It lays out flat. The best part is that you don‚Äôt need any other timeline or map resource book. Well worth the money. Everyone that I gave this book to for Christmas was thrilled.
There is so much great information in this. I was just looking for some quality maps and timelines to help with my Bible study but I stumbled on a gem. This is a must for any Bible study group or anyone who is a visual learner like me who wants to better understand our Christian Faith.
"My wife and I are doing the ""Read the Bible in One Year"" and these references make great supplements to our readings!"
"I use a chronological Bible and these maps and charts help clarify and deepen my understanding of the related Bible passages.  In summary, the charts and maps are outstanding study aids and they are a blessing to me."
My friend bought one and showed me hers -- I got book-envy and had to get my own.  It really is a beautiful book with really good info in it.
"This book is awesome. The color illustrations are terrific. The book I received is an updated version, that says 10th anniversary. This book is a great tool for people who want to know the bible better and need some assistance. The pull out charts and the spiral bound style make using it fun. I have learned so much. Would suggest to buy no complaints."
"Unfortunately the book arrived damaged.  Seems to be a trend with items I order from this website.  Should have bought in store so that I could get an undamaged copy,  Really over receiving damaged items."
Bought as gift for someone in family struggling with which spiritual path to take. My husbandand I also use this book often for reference.
Buy a copy. Buy one for your family. Your friends. Your parents. This book is incredible and I learn something new each time I open it! The charts and pictures are great for learning!
What a great resource! I am so glad that I purchased this excellent book and would recommend it to all Christians!
"A nice rewrite of their first Bible Charts, Maps & Time Lines!  All the old reference and study info is there, with plenty of additional info.  I use this (these... I have all 3 volumes) as a table book for casual browsing, as well as for reference and information about various bible related topics.  I highly recommend most of Rose' publications and this one follows their fine traditions."
This is a great resource to become more knowledgeable about the scriptures. I recommend this book to any disciple of Christ who is hungry and thirsty for the truth. The illustrations are great and the timelines are super helpful. I love how this book serves for multipurposes and how it goes in depth about important key events in the bible (both in the Old and New Testament). This book is a great reference to personally study the bible.
"Wow, I didn't know there were that many charts or maps available for the bible times to actually follow.  This book is a definite must-have if you want to know anything at all about bible times.  It covers how we got the bible, origin of the English bible, weights and measures, Christian time lines, Old Testament charts, kings and prophets, events in life of Jesus, archaeology of the New Testament, maps of bible times compared to present countries.  It has several charts about the various religions and denominations.  Very well put together and fascinating to read.  Highly recommend to anyone who wants to know what it was like to live in the bible time."
"This was so very helpfull in being able to view the Maps and Time Lines of the Area of Iseral and surounding countries that I purchased t2o of them, one for me and one for a brother in Christ who is a new beliver."
"Awesome, awesome, awesome resource...tons of useful information displayed in a digestable format.  I highly recommend one for your personal reference, one for the coffee table and a third to give away!"
"Wow!  This book has so many neat graphics and charts of many of the pieces of information that I wanted organized and in one place.  So helpful as a learning tool for my youth kids and in general.  Highly recommend for anyone wanting to know timeline, Jesus's genealogy, what the first and second temple looked like, archaeological findings for the Bible, how the Christian faith branched off and formed different dominations, and what other religious faiths believe.  A must have!!!"
"wonderful maps, and history of the bible and bible lands,  we watch Amir Tsfarti and JD Farag for prophecy and this comes in so handy when they are describing what is happening over seas."
This is a great book for anyone who wants more research material for bible study.
"Hice la compra de este libro el 14 de mayo de 2019 y a√∫n no lo he recibido...  realmente decepcionante.Finalmente, recib√≠ el libro y estoy feliz con el. Es una excelente ayuda gr√°fica que ayuda a comprender mejor las Sagradas Escrituras."
I originally purchased this book to help me delve deeper to get a better understanding. I found it to be awesome so I purchased 2 additional copies for friends who are in ministry classes to help them. They are finding it so useful in their studies.
"Nice book with charts, pictures and timelines- adds interest and understanding to Bible study, or classes."
I bought this as a gift for a leader at my church. All I can say is that she thanks me all the time and said that she cannot seem to put it down. It has enriched her bible reading.
"I brought these as gifts for my church Pastor's they loved them. So much good information, BUY IT!!!!!"
"This book allows one to quickly visualize time lines in the bible, among other useful representations."
Loved this book. Lots of clear information.  Lots of charts and a great timeline. Great for Bible study.
I DON'T FEEL LIKE RETURNING ANYTHING BUT THE BOOK ARRIVED ALL STICKY AND SMEARED.  I HAD TO WASH WITH SOAP AND SANITIZE AND WILL SET IT ASIDE FOR A WEEK BECAUSE IT MIGHT HAVE CARRIED GERMS.  I FEEL LIKE IT IS NEW OR HANDLED WITH CARE FOR A NEW BOOK!  I HATE I HAD TO GO THROUGH ALL THIS!  I SPEND SO MUCH MONEY ON AMAZON!!!  I SHOULD BE REFUNDED!!!!
"We bought one a gift for my father in law.  But my husband liked it so much, I bought one for him at Christmas as well.  It's full of so much interesting information."
"A must have for any Bible study library.  Gorgeous pictures..Maps and timelines are fabulous.  So glad I found this reference!  Bought one, gave it to friends, then bought another for myself.  Thanks Rose Publishing!"
I like the detail and how things are displayed.  I even browse it because of the amount of info.
"Great resource! Bought all three volumes. As I read my Bible I use the charts each time to clarify or learn more. The smooth paper is fabulous. Best, easily accessible and understand study resources in my shelf. Highly recommend for all: new believer, seasoned believer, discipleship, evangelism. Even my daughter, who‚Äôs not a reader is being drawn to the books and is finding answers to many of her questions."
There is so much information in this book! Plus it's got beautiful illustrations. This will be a book that I will keep looking through for a long time.
"Amazing book. Very well written, spiral binding is fantastic.  This is a reference book not a story book. Tons of well organized facts. Hard to put down."
I paid for the 10 anniversary and I got something differentAwful waist of time and money
"Love this book. It has added a great amount of understanding to our bible study and morning devotional. To put a visual to the locations, timelines, and the biblical people has been well worth the purchase. Also to learn about the different Christian denominations and cults has been a real eye opener."
"I have owned this book myself for a couple years and refer to it often in study. I just bought another to give my sister for Christmas. We literally looked something up later that night when someone was discussing Judah's kings, great book. Also I have 2 other Rose books and they are all great products."
Without a doubt the best deep outline of God's Word ever!!! This would make a terrific evangelistic tool for use by any Christian.  The interesting thing to me about the Rose Book is that at one time many years ago I tried to assemble the very time lines and charts that the Rose Book has so perfectly depicted.  Every person interested in God's Word should have a copy of this book.
"This is a fantastic book! Its thorough and explains things well. It‚Äôs great for beginners, because it explains things pretty well. It‚Äôs also interesting for the person with lots of Bible experience. This is a great birthday or Christmas present for the person in your life that is interested in the Bible!"
"Strong materials, great color pictures, full of detailed information, a great study tool."
This book is interesting and it tell and shows where everything was before and after Christ
It would have been a nice book if it didn‚Äôt reek of cigarette smoke. This was an issue with the seller of course and not the publisher. So unprofessional!!
"I first saw this book at my daughters' home-she uses it for homechool. After I got it I was even more impressed. I have recommended it to numerous friends and even my church has ordered a copy. It is useful for any Christian who is interested in putting the Christian faith together in their mind ie Church History timelines and summaries, various religions-how they compare, basic doctines of the Christian church explained, the Temples, disciples etc etc. and especially useful for teachers.The pictures maps and charts are beautiful- very well done and easy enough for young people to understand. This is an essential for any Christians' library"
Take a good look at the description in the listing. Everything is beautifully laid out in this comprehensive book.
"This is a fantastic reference book.  The charts are very detailed.

Wonderful book!  Makes the Bible come alive!  I had considered buying this for a very long time and I'm so glad I finally did.  Would recommend it for adults and families.
I got this for my mom for Christmas and she loves it. It‚Äôs exactly what she wanted.
I gave a couple of these out as Christmas gifts last year. Everyone said they loved them. I wish I had bought myself one!
We‚Äôve been going through ‚ÄúThe Epic Of Eden‚Äù series and this has really brought it to life for me!
This is a helpful bible supplement.  The maps are especially helpful when reading the Old Testament and comparing with today.  So many helpful pieces of information.  I'm very satisfies and the spiral pages are especially helpful.
"If you study the bible, this is well worth you investment.  Clear and easy to understand."
"This book is what I expected and more.  It is a beautiful book and packed with information.  Great addition to a bible study.  I would recomend to anyone,"
"This book has a lot of general information.  It is a great source of Bible information on history, timeline, and the organization of the books in the Bible."
"This is a must-have for anyone who preaches from the Bible. Many charts, maps, listing and scripture explanation. My mom gave me this and she said she wished she had bought one for herself. So I bought her one!"
Best Bible Reference book ever.  It sits on our coffee table and is constantly looked at and used.
"This is an irreplaceable reference book for anyone who loves the Bible.  The charts are colorful, interesting and easy to understand -- even for the layman.  Good variety of subjects too.  The perfect reference tool."
"Wonderful book chock full of informative charts, maps, comparisons.  Excellent companion to Bible study!  Bought one as a gift for my son and loved it so much I bought one for myself."
"This is an amazing book!  So much research have been done to produce this book.  I have been a Christian for many decades.  I ordered this book to further enhance my bible study.  I can‚Äôt stop reading!  I also love the pictures, how the contents translates into today‚Äôs world, and the quality of this book is wonderful!  A must to have."
"W O W!! The best that I‚Äôve ever read, I‚Äôm  extremely impressed , has everything."
"I love this book. Now when I read my Bible at night, I can look up the places mentioned. Seeing the actual paths that Jesus walked makes me feel like I am walking with him.  I will order another for my sister."
It's a great book. Information is layed out great. I don't fully agree with an interpretation given in the book about Neduchadnezzers image but nevertheless everyone has their own interpretations.I would recommend.
"Wonderful book, have already used in my Bible instruction class in several different ways."
"This is an awesome book packed with Bible knowledge. It includes fold out pages, maps, and pictures. A must for Christians interested in increasing their knowledge of Biblical history."
"Take what you need, leave what you don‚Äôt. There are actual descriptions of the people of the Bible. Why are all the images pale skinned? Let‚Äôs be accurate if we‚Äôre going to be giving information."
"Wow, this book is very well done and has tons of great information."
"Type to small for me, I'm old."
"months and months worth of reading here. makes things soo much clearer when reading the Bible. must have for any Bible cover to cover reader!It was bent a little bit, probably from the one other product i bought with it. not that happy about that. but this book still is awesome!"
This is the one you want to have handy to draw the interest of young Bible scholars.
"This book is great. I can't tell how many times I've opened this book to find exactly what I was looking for. I am in a Masters in Christian Leadership program, and this book serves as a great starting reference into a lot of subjects. This would be a fantastic gift for any theology students and or any one in ministry. Love it."
I teach Bible at church and have many of Rose Book's posters. this book is great for smaller groups and personal study. I would highly recommend.
"This is an amazing book. There are overviews of all the books of the Bible, timelines of when certain events happened, and Maps of Biblical times versus today. There is also a chronology of the Bible and the various versions. I highly recommend it if you want to know more about religious demoninations and what each is about. There are also the names of God (Jehovah) and Jesus and the accompaning scriptures, which should help in seeking Him for various needs. I gave this book as a Christmas gift to several friends and they all loved it."
"I am still reading this book after buying it months ago. It is of course one of the greatest reference books ever written concerning Christianity. Makes a great book to leave on the coffee table and is a great conversation starter. Don't forget the value of getting all these charts in one book as opposed to buying the charts separately. Hey, it's just fun to pick it up once and while and looking at any given page at any given time. Always a learning experience!"
Great reference guide. Great to have along side a Bible study.
Very informative and easy to use. Nice size and put together well
"I  haven't taken the time to really go through the whole thing.  But, I feel it is just what I was looking for and will be very useful"
Very good for deeper studies of the word. Was surprised of how much information was in it because of the title. A definite get!
"There is much more information in this book than charts, maps and time lines.  Archaeology and the Bible in the Old Testament is covered.  The prophecies fulfilled by Jesus are covered.  Information on the twelve desciples, their personality and character, the tabernacle, the ark of the covenant, christianity, cults and religions and much more is covered as well.  Member of my bible study group were like children in a candy store when they saw it and were wanting to get the book for themselves.  Worth the money."
"This book is a must buy!  I bought it for the maps and timelibes, but there is so much information in it. I have suggested this to everyone I talk to."
"I love this book. It gives me clear picture of what I read in the Holy Bible.I feel blessed being able to buy it.I wish I could give to all in my family and friends, to enrich their spiritual journey.I highly recommend this book for all practicing Christians who try to understandand follow the spiritual teaching of God in the life of Jesus and His prophets.Thank you."
"This is the BESTEST book of information about the Bible I've ever seen, I can't get enough of the source of sites along with the inhabitants of the time of Christ and all of the writers of each book. thank you"
"I LOVE this book!  It‚Äôs well laid out, has beautiful illustrations and maps, and is full of way more information than I expected!  I recommend it to anyone."
"I love this book, I use it all the time whenever I have a biblical question I look here first. This has great pictures and lots of great references. I would recommend this book. Great for a Sunday school teacher."
This has been one of my best book purchases.  This is filled with information.  Every time I pick it up and read it I find out something new.  There is an insane amount of information in this book.  I couldn't be more pleased.
"I have now given so many of this book for gifts.  What an incredible teaching tool.  Well referenced, visually stunning and even reproducible.  Doesn't get better than this.  I have also loved the one on the Temple."
Fantastic resource of reference material with beautiful illustrations.
I was so excited to find this book.  So much information packed into these beautifully colored pages.  A definite must-have for anyone who is delving further into their Christian studies!  It looks great displayed on my coffee table so that I can reference it any time I need.  Also makes for a great conversation starter!
Great book. Very detailed. Must have for Christians
Great book! Lots of great information!
"My kids and I love these books, I got one for each of us and we use them doing Sunday school at home. The information is really well laid out, and provides a depth of knowledge that brings the Bible to life. The timelines help make sense of the order of each history told in the scriptures."
"Wonderful timelines, help bring the bible to life!"
"Not exactly what my hubby wanted, but, he was amazed at how much information that he got out of this book. He loves it."
"WOW! Beautiful and well layed out. I bring it to bible studies and RCIA. I also show it to friends and family when ever I can. Its rich, beautiful and full...to feast your mind and eyes onto the pages."
"I love all the information in this book.  Everything is in one place.  I have spent many years studying the bible, and finding all the information that is in this book, was time consuming.  So having everything all together in this one book is so helpful.  Love the color pages, the maps, and all the charts.  Super informative.  I highly recommend"
I got this for my Dad even though I figured he already had all of this in his head‚Äîhe‚Äôs amazingly knowledgeable about all dealing with history and the Bible. He LOVES this book though! He says that there was still so much he did not know that he found in here!
It‚Äôs exactly what I wanted I would buy it again
What a lovely book. Beautiful photos and maps. This was a gift for my mother and she loves it. She keeps this book with her Bible and reads it every day
This has so many great resources to augment your bible study or teaching.  It‚Äôs easy to reference stuff quickly. It provides a general overview of so many different subjects in the Bible and Christianity. Happy I purchased it.  Will be buying more for those who could use them.
"I purchased this for my daughter (who attends bible college) and I'm purchasing another for my dad as a Christmas gift. This is a ""must have"" book- every household should own one. It's full of great photos & visuals (I'm a visual learner and wish I had discovered this book a long time ago.)"
This was exactly what I was looking for and I find myself using it very often.  In fact one of the men in my bible study commented that he needed me there one day when I couldn't go simply because this book was so useful.
"I teach a Bible Study class and this book has a lot of great teaching possibilities.  Actually, I like the way the charts summarize everything from the Kings to prophets as well as the day of Crucifixion.  The maps are a bit simple but still, when teaching, they are helpful in a general way of locating cities and areas in The Holy Land.  Thanks to those who put this book together."
Perfect for enhancing one's knowledge of the word of God
Nice book with a lot of information on the Bible and the church. Great for studying God's Word!
A must buy book for those that love the Bible. Worth every penny.
Wow!!! Outstanding book on the Bible!!! Great book for new students of the Bible as well as those who have been studying it for awhile. Well worth twice what Amazon charges. I'm now looking at other Rose Publishing products to see what else they have!!!
I bought as a gift and he loves it!  It arrived in perfect condition. The content is comprehensive and engaging.
"For literally everyone, great 1st gift along with a good study bible for anyone just saved and amazing gift for anyone that just wants to dig more into the word.  The charts, timelines, and explanations are outstanding!! Highly recommend!"
"Very informative, see things in a new light and just leaves you in awe."
"Haven't got into it well, studying others. Appears to be a wealth of information."
I got more than I expected. Lot information
Awesome booklet! Has a TON of great information I've learned alot so far!
I have had this book for a while and use it for reference often. I love the binding which allows it to lay flat. The pages are sturdy and colorful. Very easy to read. Just enough information for a layperson. I use it for my personal Bible study.
WOW ... special book with Bible ez to read chards and maps.  We are planning a tour to Israel this year ...  really enjoyed having access to this related historical book.  Comfortable to highly recommend!
So much information. Highly recommend. Would also be a great gift.
"Good...needs more maps. Kind of basic, somewhat better than a hard copy of Bible."
"Love this book but it arrived damaged, the spirals where squished but we still use it. It‚Äôs a wonderful addition to any bi me study."
Nicely put together but not quite what I was looking for. More geared toward beginners or children
great read and very informative
Great details for study guide.
So many things included. Great resource.
Highly recommed for everyone.
Good for Bible trivia quizzes in Sunday School
"Excellent Product! Much more than I expected or hoped for.  This is the most pleasant, useful, and meaningful book I have ever bought.  It is so well organized, graphically appealing and abounds with useful and interesting information.  This book can easily enrich your knowledge and your relationship, it is much much more than charts and maps.  I am very glad I bought this book and I highly recommend it to everyone.  Its absolutely wonderful."
Great quality. Easy to use.
This book has so much knowledge. That every home should have one. Whether you are a Christian or not. I love it. A friend told me about it. And I ordered it. Tell all your friends.
Very helpful to learn the Bible story
Absolutely love this book
"I love, love, love this book!  It is high quality w beautiful pictures, maps and charts. The spiral ring makes it so easy to flip through and lies nice and flat. It has WAY MORE info than I expected but such a valuable reference guide for my studies!"
Quality and informative
was a great resource for some training we did at church......
Great Great Great. Love knowing the time line and history of The Bible and Christ journey.
"This book has such interesting charts and facts on the bible and timelines. It also has illustrations, charts, timelines, explanations and pictures. It's very helpful."
Very pleased with purchase.
Very well outlined
Great book with insightful imagery and charts.  This s good for whetting the appetite and getting a good foundational understanding of places and times in the bible.
A wealth of information needed for class. An envaluable resource.
Very detailed.  Rose Book always makes great maps and charts.
"Bought this for my mom but after seeing it, will purchase another for myself. Nice quality, spiral bound with heavy, glossy pages. Information is interesting, clear and concise. Maps and charts are clear, easy to read and understand."
Excellent! Full of valuable info In Picture and chart form.
Personal use. Gave a copy to special people in my life for their use. Very nicely done- love the info and way its presented!
Great quality resource for supplementing teaching curriculum. All reproducible for classroom use!
"This is an amazing reference book. Even if you follow the Hebrew Roots I highly recommend it. Beautiful pictures, laid out very well. Easy to understand."
Lots of info and graphics.
Awesome Product!!
Liked the way this book is organized and finding items of interest to me was easy.
This is very well made and put together
Checking a lot of facts and very concise. But wrong on the Catholic Crusades and equating them with being Christian as well as the origin of the Anti Baptists who later became known as Baptists. They were never descended from Catholosism at all. Otherwise it's very well put together.
"I purchased this book as a supplement for reading the bible. There is obviously a wealth of activity and names in the bible and in and of itself, it is not easy to follow the timeline. This book really addresses that and the content is clear, concise, and easily formatted and really helps put the events in the bible into context. The spiral binding makes it really nice to lie flat and read the charts. The price is great too."
It is so great
This book will be enjoyed for years to come
Amazing reference. Exactly what I needed to complete my references for my Bible study
I love it. A lot of information. In fact I bought one for a friend and they love it too. Great reference book. it will get a lot of use.
This was a gift for my son. He enjoys Bible subjects and this book covers so many topics. I got one as a gift and loved it so I shared with my son.
Needed questions answered and explained during Bible studies. Great resource.
"This is a truly comprehensive, interesting and well put together reference book.  Thank you for an excellent and extremely helpful book! The quality of the book (materials) is also excellent."
Great
"Phenominal book of more than just bible charts, maps and time lines.  It is an experience and a joy to stay in the Word daily."
This book gives clear charts and time lines that are easy to understand.
Love it
Love it!!!  I have bought quite a few of these books to give as gifts.  They are great quick resource and teaching tool.  I have given several to people who learn better through visual aids.  The charts and pictures help them remember.  The last 10-year edition was even better.  Everyone that loves God's Word should have this in their library.
Informative.
THIS is an amazing book filled with so much information I can't begin to explain.  Already it has been used many times and shared at Bible Study when studying the Torah.  Great book for our Library.
"I received this as a gift one year from a friend of mine. Really didn't get time to dive into it until recently.  Though some of its views are somewhat biased and lacking in details (in some cases intentionally to remain more 'friendly' to certain denominations), it is a very thorough and useful reference to use along with a bible for context, imagery, geology, geography, and archeological evidences found."
Bought for my son for Christmas..probably the best gift besides his beautiful new bible..this book is such quality and loaded with so much Bible history I recommend to everyone  who loves to see the actual  places etc of the Bible times BEAUTIFUL IMAGES
Great for teaching!
We gave this to a high school graduate who is going into ministry- he told us it was his favorite gift and his mom told us the whole family spent the evening looking at it.  I plan to get one for myself!
I really enjoy this book. I find it helpful if I am just looking up a story in the old testament that I might want to read again. or if I am researching how we got the Bible in the first place. It also show's the difference in various Bibles.
Amazing book of facts.
"Rose Book of Bible Charts, Maps, and Time Lines

Very pleased with this book.
This is full of really nice visuals. This was a Christmas gift to a friend going to Israel.
"I love this book! I use it every day when I am reading my NLT Daily Walk Bible to look up facts and maps.  It is so useful, and I would highly recommend it for anyone reading/studying the Bible from cover to cover.  It shows exactly what is being talked about in the Old and the New Testaments. I find the time lines, maps, charts, layouts, and bible history facts so interesting. It is a beautiful book, and I can't wait to buy ALL of the Rose Books listed in the back of this book."
"Love this reference book, wonderful addition to my library."
"Great book for personal growth. Also great for teaching Bible study and or Sunday school classes. Excellent illustration, clear and easy to understand text.  Great value for your money!"

Wonderful and interesting.  Full of information!
"What I wanted.No complaints, everything went great."
"Great product, received quickly."
Mesmorizing! Such a beautiful book with high resolution images and the text is set out in such an easy to read way. This is such an enjoyable and informative and enriching read.
"Purchased as a Christmas gift, so can't attest to the validity of the material in detail, but the quality of the book is great & the pictures & charts are very interesting!"
"This item was said to be in good condition, but it is in terrible conditions.Something was spilled on it.The front and back cover are both cracked.The spine is cracked in the middle.And some of the pages are partially torn out."
Ordered for my wife. Lots of information with single overlays. Large bound book. Rose Deluxe editions ordered by family for my wife thinner spiral bound books which lie flat.. This book is quite the book probably more info than deluxe but hard bound.
Bought for my husband for his birthday. This is an amazing book so filled with new and old facts and the maps are just wonderful and full of knowledgeable!! He loved this book and wants the others to the set!!
Great book!
Perfect for Bottomline studying and questions.
Love that this book has so many graphics to illustrate bible concepts.
"I absolutely LUV this book!  It has So much information in it about the Bible, church history, maps, charts, Noah's Ark, the tabernacle, weights and measures, beliefs of major religions, old & new testament people, end times views, meanings of the names of God the Father and Jesus etc.  It's all in full color, easy to understand and read.  I whole-heartedly recommend this for anyone who wants a good reference for the bible."
"There were fewer maps than I was expecting & they weren't as detailed as I was hoping for.  It seemed to be for a bit younger reader.  Lots of good diagrams & timelines though & extra info, just not enough maps."
This is so simple to understand and such a great book to use in seeking the truth of Scripture
"Beautiful book, however bindery gets 1 star. Disappointed I'm going to have to return and don't know the process or how long it will take."
The info in this book is un matchable..
High quality and packed with great information
I am using this as a reference. I have gone through enough to know it is well made and interesting. It has small type but I can read it without a magnifying glass. This is typical of Rose Publishing.
this was a gift
"Wanted a book of ancient Old and New Testament maps.  This, however, for me, was more charts and time lines than maps.  I wanted to follow various journeys and especially those of Jesus in detail which this book did not give. It perhaps may be good for others who want an overview of a lot of information."
Great book! Reasonably priced.
I am enjoying reading threw this book. I am a visual learner so it is awesome.
easy to follow
"Nice one stop supplement for bible study. Pull out genealogy most useful , particularly when reading the Old Testament. Great for visual learners!"
Incredible book to use when studying the Bible. Very useful content and detailed maps. Highly recommend!
love this book  excellent reference guide for Bible
"An absolutely necessary book to better understand the geography  circumstances of the peoples of the early Bible Times, as well as today.  Clearly written, east to comprehend, charts are excellent.  Highly recommend this book for anyone with an interest in Biblical studies.  You don't need to be a great scholar to get a lot out of this book."
This book üìñ help me in my personal study of the bible; I did not expect this extraordinary wealth of Information.
"This is just what I was looking for‚Äîthank you!  I can‚Äôt wait to read, study, and refer to this treasure as often as possible!"
may i please download a pdf of this book seeing as i paid for the hard copy already
"Was not tore. All pages intact.But there was a certain smell to it and it was dusty.It was used, so I suppose that‚Äôs to be expected"
Thank you for it!
"Great maps, time lines and history info. So worth the price. I have purchased three for gifts too"
Wonderful book
"I have bought several copies. Several elements from the timelines, the bookcase (excludes 7 Catholic books tho), but the ideas to help simplify the Bible REALLY helps understanding in small bits. It would be sweet if they could ramp this concept up and do a sequel with even more detail. I believe this is FAMILY necessity/essential. It really help grasp and focus on topics."
"Good book for history, maps, etc.  Arrived in very good condition!"
informative - wish it had more maps.  the maps it does have a good.
"This product delivers all it promise to and more , I continue to enjoy and look forward to many years of enjoyment. Shipment was fast and the merchant was true to their word the quality is on the high end-Definitely would do business with them again!"
this is helpfull thanks
I really enjoyed this book.  I couldn't wait to dig in. Right now I'm studying Daniel and this came in very handy.  Great illustrations and biblical accuracy. A must tool for those who are studying the bible on all levels.
purchased a second one for my son
As with many books on the Biblical timelines and maps we aren't certain on the exact location of many places. But it can challenge us to search a little longer and deeper to see something we didn't see while reading our Bible.  Maybe even see a little gem of history that was previously overlooked.
This is a great book. I've been going through it with my kids. Lots of great and interesting info for bible studies.
"I borrowed this book at my Bible study and brought it home and my 92 year old guy looked at it every day for the week that i had it and said that every Christian should have it and that he wished he had had this book 80 years ago when he was in school because it brings the Bible into perspective and makes it come alive by explaining about the lives of the appostles, places, and the artifacts that were dug up substanciating the truth of the scriptures.  They Bible makes more sense to my 92 year old.  He had more understanding of other religions and beliefe systems because of the good explanations.  Walter was an engineer and has a good inquisitive mind so I bought 2 copies of this book one for him for his birthday and one for myself."
"I have been looking for a book like this for years, it is very informative and a great companion to the Bible I have told family and friends about it and looking forward to purchasing other books from this line"
"Love the chart, really opens up the Bible."
"I am thrilled with this book. It is absolutely full of very helpful charts of all sorts. Even better, it's reproducible. I have used several pages this year in teaching a Bible study for teenagers, and it has been a great resource for expanding our knowledge of the context of what we're studying."
This edition is packed with information to help get a better understanding of Scripture and the big picture while giving significant detail.  I wish that I had this about 5 decades ago when I was 20 (or earlier!).
"I ordered this for my grandson as he is taking Catechism And it simplifies many things.Example: The ancestry of Jesus, many of the prophets etc."
excellent
Excellent resource for in-depth study and reference.
Wonderful Guide for the serious Bible Student. Highly Recommended.  Have read that Billy Graham used early issues of this map guide frequently during his life long Bible studies.
Very interesting and informative book. Will be a good reference for many studies.
I love this book. Very informative. Would highly recommend  it. Excellent.
This book is more than I first thought it would be.  I would recommend it to students and people who are looking for a deeper understanding of world religions the bible and its history.  The illustrations are great and the maps help link where people traveled as well as when.  Biblical timeline very helpful.
"This book has easy-to-read charts and diagrams and is great for studying the Bible, particularly the Old Testament. It has a binding that makes it easy to fold back but yet it is contained in a hard cover. Easy to read and much needed to study topics like kings, prophets, etc. Highly recommend this for beginners and advanced alike."
"Great tool for studying the Bible, this is put together well."
I bought two of these.....one to share with our minister. He was so delighted as it helps him greatly in preparing for his lessons. It is such a well thought out book with every picture in full color. It makes things so much easier to understand. The charts are awesome. It is a perfect study guide.
"Book damagedGreat book, overwhelming with wonderful information and every time I open it I find clarity.  I believe this book is good for all ages no matter religion background"
Take my bible study to a whole new level
A lot of useful information for the Bible student or teacher
concise
"I really like these books. They provide a very thorough context of the Bible and events recorded there. They also give an outline of the books of the Bible and some explanation for why they are there. Highly recommended for new Christians, old Christians and anyone wanting to better understand the historical significance of the Bible."
people are whitewashed
"Just great, a perfect Bible study book."
"As a fact-finding resource for nearly all biblical-historical important facts, this handbook has actually served valuable and reliable source to use for all Bible-believing Christians, those who are just starting to be interested in studying the Bible deeper, or even for those experienced Bible students. This is a highly recommended resource to go."
Opens your eyes to a lot and is best used when reading the bible.
I find the book very informative and the maps are clear to read.
Very helpful understanding scripture.
A beautiful and very educational Bible Chart
"Excellent study guide.It's easy to read, great chapter breakdown and helpful with church lessons and/or bible studies. I'm learning a lot from it."
"Phenomenal book!!! Lots of details, great pictures, highly recommend."
"As a sunday school teacher for teenagers (12-15 year olds) this book has so much great information. To the best of my knowledge, this book has accurate information that is backed up by the KJV bible."
"has many interesting facts and of course the timeline is epic, my son got into it as well because it is so attractive"
Beautiful book with lots of information.  Very helpful with Bible Study.  Am very happy I bought this book.
"This book is amazing!  The timelines, maps and insight to ancient times is educational and interesting! Great book!"
A great reference resource for Bible study - to deepen one‚Äôs own knowledge as well as to teach others. Also a great gift.
super good book and lots of knowledge
Well done!
This is an amazing book. The visuals are fantastic!!
Bought this book for my Husband for Father‚Äôs Day he loves it
"This book is beautiful.  An incredibly helpful tool for bible study.  But, it also contains synopses of world religions (Muslim, Jewish, Catholic and Christian) and timelines of their development.  The quality is far better than the price would indicate -- a ""coffee table"" display book.  Well-written, well-researched, a delight to peruse."
It has been great for my adult and youth classes.
This book is full of so much information - everyone in my family loves it and and my extended family members already want to borrow it.
"I love that this book has so much information in it.  It has timelines, charts, lists, brief explanations of some Bible- time traditions.  The publishers even give you permission to make a limited number of copies for your church or Bible study group.  It is larger than I thought so it is awkward to carry.  Also, some of the information about certain ""denominations"" is not accurate, but that is common when written by people who are not members of those groups.  Overall, it is a great resource to have."
Beautiful and useful.
"Beautiful book, so easy to read and discovering facts"
Very interesting and a great addition when studying the Bible and its history.
Love it!
Nice maps & disk.
Helpful visuals
I have enjoyed this book. I liked the pictures since i am a visual learner so that helps out a lot. Also i use it as an aid for my Sunday School class.  It breaks down the twelve tribes it has some really good information. So if your looking for some supplemental resources it would help.
I am loving this book so much that I bought one for my Sunday school teacher!
Like
Gave as a Christmas gift. he really likes it
"Excellent source of info, beautiful artwork that aids understanding of God's work."
"This book was SO much more than I expected to get when I ordered it.  It has the timelines and maps as the title and description says but it also lays out the prophesies in a table to show the links between the Old and New Testaments.  It has all the names of God and where you can find it in the Scriptures, a summary of each book in the Bible, the descriptions of each group of religious/Christianity/Cults, the branches of the religious denominations, AND SO MUCH MORE!  This is a must buy for any Christian or anyone curious.  I showed this book to my Bible Study friends and they all want one so I am putting in a group order for 20 books!"
Good book. Very informative and I love it.
It helps with Bible studies and teaching. My son is a Sunday School teacher and is big into History. This was a perfect Christmas gift for him. It has overlays to see modern sites as well as Biblical sites.
This book of charts is a good reference source
Seriously amazing. I loved it so much I bought 1 for my dad for Father's Day!! So much information and beautiful!!
Like
For any bible student this book is smuts have. I bought it for myself and then bought one for my daughter and recommended to friends who also bought it after seeing mine

"I like that it tells you when the books of the Bible were written, where and by whom. The maps help understand the bible in greater detail."
"My mother and I both really enjoy learning about the Bible, This book was the perfect addition to our collection!"
"This is a must have tool for anyone interested in History and the Bible.  Excellent graphics and in depth, yet easy to understand charts and timelines.  It' really puts the whole thing in perspective on almost every level.  I'll be using it for many years to come."
This is a must for anyone doing Bible study.
Incredible books. Has so much more then the title implies.
Great book. World's of information.
"This is such a good book. I gave 3 as Christmas presents and all 3 loved it. A lot of different information, timelines, and it is a beautiful book!"
This is an excellent quick reference resource!
Great product! AAA+++
Exactly as described and arrived on time. I will order from this company again.  Thank you.  Price was very good.
"A rich source of fascinating information. I like the comparisons to present day status of Middle East territories and issues. Illustrations are beautiful, nicely bound."
"Purchased as an accompaniment to the NIV Chronological Bible... prefer to do my own (more thorough) research with more complete resources rather than having it all (incompletely) PACKED into my Bible (as the NLT & NKJV Chronos).Also, agree with Rose's creation account as opposed to the NKJV 'take'."
"Excellent resource for biblical scholars and novices alike.  Lots of pertinent, detailed info on key people and places in the Bible.  The overlay maps are great for quickly and easily viewing the ancient and modern names of places.  A great resource!"
Very nice teaching or learning book
Maps are great and what I actually bought this for. But there are all sorts of surprises like the biographical information about the Apostles.Well worth the investment.
Mom loves it.
It was a gift for my sister.I did look at the book and I did seen well organized.I did not like the loose leaf design.Other than that it seemed like a good book.
"One timeline or chart after another, this book is packed cover to cover with references about Biblical history, plot, characters and more. Even if you're not particularly interested, there's probably a chart here anyway!"
I really liked how it was presented
"Purchased volumes 1, 2, & 3 for our Pastor's birthday. Just a fabulous set of books. Beautifully printed, sturdy, colorful, wonderful charts. Every time I look at one of the volumes I learn something."
Informative and helpful!
Great graphics
excellent information and details
"This is a really good book of Bible Charts, Maps, and Time Lines."
This book was damaged. It was to be a gift. I need to return for refund.June Boer or give me a discount.
"For anyone interested in visual aids for teaching or for clarifying the Word of God for your own edification,this book is a real gem and very much worth the price.All the pages are clear, concise, very colorful, well-produced, and there is a notation on each that you can photocopy any page for classroom use.This book is used in my Bible Study class where everyone has chosen to purchase this book to aid our studies in preparation for the class. I highly recommend the Rose Book, but remind that it should only be used in conjunction with The Bible, not instead of it."
Bible Study and have given some as gifts.  Very nice!
Excellent book for people who want to understand the Bible and its history and contains an excellent timeline. There is also a section that compares world cults & religions ‚Äúside by side‚Äù. Well done!
Love this book.  Hits many highlights in the bible in an easy format.
Filled with wonderful information and easy to read!
Great product
"Full of valuable maps, charts and information for Bible study."

This book is phenomenal. Great info at a glance.
Excellent resource packed full of useful information on the scriptures and so much more!

Full of interesting information and beautifully illustrated.  Going to buy several as gifts.
"Fantastic book full of information.  It is a great book to have while reading the Bible.  I can look at some of the illustrations and feel much more like I understand what I'm reading.  All the charts are a fantastice help in knowing who is who and the maps are wonderful for understanding where an event took place in relationship to other events, wars, famines, etc."
Everybody should buy that book for opening knowledge and  indeed thrill to read very clear history as it showthose education religions as whole one time as no need to buy many books for looking more histories. SMILE
This is great reference material and easy to read.

Lovee this!!!! Lots of great information in one handy book.
"I bought this for the maps that are used during my bible study class, and I was amazed at how much extra information and details it contains. I can‚Äôt wait to explore."
"Anyone wishing to follow Old Testament geography along with daily reading will find this book a welcome enhancement. The graphics, the narrative, the timelines, etc. add to the joy and satisfaction imparted by the Bible."
Its a great resource.
"This wonderful book supplements the information in Bibles and helps you find out what happened when. For example, who was the leader of each city state when Jesus was alive.  It covers the entire bible old and new testaments."
love love love
"What a terrific book. I have already loaned it out by request 3 times. This is a wonderful tool to assist in teaching my Bible study for children and for adults to enjoy on their own. Very glad I made the purchase, I will enjoy it for many years to come."
Great pictures!
"Excellent material, but book was damaged when received."
Love it!
"With over 50 years teaching Christian practices and principles, this is the finest study resource I've ever encountered.  I ordered this book for an adult Sunday School class and it has been overwhelming popular. Almost all the 25 class members have chosen to order a book for themselves.  It's clean, filled with easy-to-read charts, references in abundance, very user friendly.  Class members have ordered theses books for others!  And for the quality and usefulness, the price can't be beat!"
So many wonderful and colorful pages of information.  Love the spiral binding.  I have been able to copy some pages to share with my Bible study group.
Great source of Biblical knowledge that helps Christians understand God and His Grace.
"Great book filled with wonderful maps, timelines and pics!"
Good quality. Maps and timelines concerning many topics were very good. Larger print on some maps was needed and prophecy view points were  unnecessary since the emphasis is not bible doctrine debate in this type of book.
Exactly what I was looking for.  Great time lines and charts!  Our son loves looking over all the information.
"This is an okay resource to use when studying the Bible.  There are definitely some great charts but a lot of them are widely available in a normal study Bible (and are not very helpful).  However, there are a few that make the whole book worth owning."
This book is packed full of knowledge.  It will help you decipher the Word of God easily.
Wonderful resource for anyone. Some colleges use for classes.
Brilliantly  written packed with great information
"It had everything you can ask for and more, including the geneology from Adam to Jesus."
"I always wanted a book to give me a breakdown of the Bible and this one has maps, names, and everything in between."
"This is a great tool to have on hand when you are doing Bible studies.  It has a lot of maps, charts and timelines.  Very easy to read, I like that you can make copies as well.  The spiral binding is great so it lies flat for your study, too."
"Great all the way around.  My son, a minister, purchased one for me and liked it so well, he purchased on for his family.  I have since given it to two people as gifts.  It has a lot of biblical historical information along with pictures that can help children understand their Sunday school lesson better."
"I returned.  I don't want to pay for a list of the 12 apostles, for instance, or a list of the fruits of the HS."
Just what I was looking for.
Awesome!
"This has been a life changer!Some liturgies are for mundane activities, like the liturgy for morning coffee, or for washing clothes.But some liturgies carry us through the monumental moments, like the liturgy for the morning of a medical procedure, or for feasting with friends.There are some free downloads from the website so you can print out enough copies for a group of friends to share.I guarantee you that starting a feast by declaring war against the powers of darkness brings a welcome energy to any party.Even the liturgy for planting your petunia will imbue you with hope.I can't recommend Every Moment Holy any more highly!"
"This book is wonderful.  Each liturgy is short and to the point and so incredibly well-written.  My favorite quote from this book is the liturgy for those experiencing Road Rage.  ""...Take from me my self-righteousness, and my ego-driven demands for respect.  Over-throw the tyranny of my anger...""  Eureka!  This author has captured the small and the mighty of day to day.  Each liturgy touches in us the things that happen to us or because of us.  I love that it keeps me thinking about God... I plan on getting this book (whenever it's available again for Christmas gifts.  It's great!"
Such a beautiful book! I enjoy it like I enjoy poetry.
"I‚Äôm cringing a little when I say this..because usually I do not like spending $40...but this was worth $40. Gave as a gift for Christmas. I already have my own copy and I LOVE to share this prayer book. Most importantly, from what I have read it is true to scriptures and legit. I‚Äôm super picky about that. This makes praying so fun!!! It has been life changing I‚Äôd almost say. I‚Äôm not someone who typically is familiar with written prayers, I usually just pray extemporaneously, but this book has shown me how cool it can be to pray written prayers and even memorize them. Just loving this book. And hey hey, there is even a prayer in here for changing diapers...also, for being patient when your kids are naughty, and for grieving the loss of loved ones, and so so many other things."
"My husband has been given many books by me over the year & this is the one I see him grab everyday! Every Moment Holy is a rich read for when you don't have the words to speak over the happenings in your daily life. We are grateful for every single liturgy within it's covers. An intentional gift for anyone who needs to slow down and remember who holds us, no matter the circumstance... and maybe that is you! 5 stars is not enough!"
"This was a recommendation by my pastor and it has been well worth the purchase. It is a compilation of liturgies for each day of the week and various occasions. I work in the counseling field, and after using it at home I decided to purchase one for my office. It has already been extremely useful with clients that needed encouraging or an inspiring work of exhortation."
Love this books and leather feels like a bible ..exactly what I was looking for. I bought a small orthodox prayer book but i wanted something to help me find the words for prayer of course through cooperation with the holy spirit.I really hope they make a compact version of it. Would love an easy smaller version to carry with me
"An amazing book of liturgies for every moment, from morning coffee and changing diapers to the heavy moments of loss and grief. You will grow closer to God and be more aware of His presence the more you use this book. This is a great resource for families to grow closer together and for the individual as well. You will not be disappointed. The moments that you have with these words are precious."
"This prayer book showed me that I can glorify God anywhere at anytime; He is everywhere in all creation. He is there in at the beginning of the day in your morning cup of coffee; He is there when you need him most like the morning of a medical procedure. Even moments we dread like paying bills and when we fear failure, He is there. This book is designed to be passed down through the generations as the cover is made of faux-leather and the pages are sown together. This is essential for new believers who are learning to pray and those who feel stagnant in their spiritual life."
"I received this book for a Christmas present and instantly fell in love with the beautiful liturgies. It‚Äôs so relevant to our modern culture and yet the words feel so timeless. Every time I read one my heart feel lifted up and I feel like I can see the world differently.I‚Äôve already read a few of these out loud with family and friends and everyone has really enjoyed them. It gives deeper meaning to everyday affairs. In a time of quick information and disconnect from other people, this is a refreshing way to help bring us back to what‚Äôs important.I already bought this book for a friend and it will definitely become my favorite gift to give people this year!"
"Anyone who is inspired to pray over diaper changes or a cup of coffee might not need a book that has pre-written the prayers for them. Yet, I have found these prayers very well constructed, anticipating the need of the moment, coaxing requests and praises I might not have come up with on the spot myself. I have thoroughly enjoyed this book, its prayers, and the personal prayers they've elicited in my every moment."
"I purchased this after previewing several snippets from it.  It does not disappoint.  The writing is great and the inspiration even better.  The hard cover was on my list of ""wants"" but the price was steep.  When I saw the paperback I decided to go for it hoping I would not be disappointed.  I am not in the least.  This is not a typical paperback version but an almost thin faux leather look to it.  I have it on a side table in the living room and besides being at the ready to read, it looks great too."
"I heard an interview with author Douglas McKelvey on my Christian radio station, Bott radio network. I became very curious after hearing about this book of liturgies. I ordered two, one for myself and one for my mother. I personally have so enjoyed the prayers. They are written so beautifully and stir the heart. I particularly loved the liturgy of sorrow and lament titled, ‚ÄúFor those who weep without knowing why‚Äù on page 241.Thank you, Douglas, for writing from the heart. Your words and sentiments are beautiful and pleasing to the Lord, I am sure. Thank you for sharing your gift with us."
"We have used these writings to bless or commemorate occasions from gravesidememorials to Thanksgiving meals to surgeries. I have now gifted this book seven times, joyfully received, and plan to reorder and spread them to fertilize faith. Artistically and sensitively written, these are not the usual liturgies which can already be found in the church on any given Sunday; these walk alongside the every day, deepening presence, and offering a frame of meaning for marking with tender, thoughtful beauty the ordinary, easily overlooked moments that make up a life. I'm grateful to see that it is marked ""Volume 1."""
"I purchased a copy of this for my office at work after using it for guided prayer in our small group. Lots of prompts and occasions to choose from for daily reflections. Has been very formational and ""re-orienting"" throughout my week. Looking forward to more like this from Rabbit Room. Could use more for parent to child relationships..."
"I love this book!  They include liturgies for so many occasions.  From mundane daily activities to important life moments, these lovely liturgical prayers draw us back to God.  It's the perfect book to keep out on your coffee table to thumb through when you have a few spare minutes and to make note of for regular prayer life. It also makes a great gift!"
"We received one as a gift for my husband, and he loves it.  I also, enjoy reading from it and it is very up lifting in the mixed up times we live in.  A very comforting book.  Lolomerryheart"
"I very much like this book. The prayers as liturgy add a dimension of reverence. It is, for me, a little difficult at times to find what I‚Äôm looking for so I‚Äôve begun to write a One word description and page number of favorites on a page near the front of the book."
As a Pastor I use this in almost all of my visitations and counseling. I use this in seminars and sometimes in sermons. I pray these prayers with my family and by myself. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It has been a phenomenal resource to be able to pray the words of my heart when I can‚Äôt find the words or to retune my heart‚Äôs prayers to the glory of the gospel.
"Wow. Just wow. This book is life-changing in its ability to take the mundane, and breathe new life into it. It reminds us of the beauty sacredness of doing dishes or drinking coffee or staring at the stars. I plan on buying this book for literally any gift I am able to buy someone."
I had bought a copy last year and have bought 2 others for friends. I just ordered a new one for myself because my dog got to my old one. They must have changed their paper because my original copy had thicker paper and the new one has thin paper and the pages are all warped and wavy. :( Beautiful prayers but the paper is not good quality anymore:(
"I love this book of prayers.  It has prayers for every day things like working, cleaning, eating and for special events, too.  This morning I woke from a nightmare.  This book has a very comforting prayer for that, too!"
I bought this book after hearing Andrew Peterson and Annie F. Downs gush about it on her podcast. I‚Äôm so glad that I did. Words fail to express how beautiful the liturgies are and how deeply they resonate in my soul. The Liturgy for Changing Diapers brings tears to my eyes every time I read it. Every moment holy indeed.
This little book is so large with meaning. Several times this book gave me the words I so desperately needed when my own words failed me! The content is rich and the words are soul satisfying! Do not hesitate to purchase it!
"I highly recommend this. A book of prayers and liturgies for many things in life, from simple mundane tasks to large single momentous occasions. The words are gospel centered and have a Scripture with each liturgy. I bought one for our house and gave two as gifts recently. Nice leather cover too."
"The Book itself is wonderful, but why in the world would you put a sticker in the middle of this beautiful book??.  On all four books there was a sticky barcode sticker smack dab in the middle of the book.I‚Äôll definitely buy more of these books but please put the sticker on the back!!"
Bought this as gift for son entering a new phase of His ministry. He has enjoyed reading thru the blessings for every little thing with his young children.
"I just received my copy, and have not had time to thoroughly go through this book.  It was not intended to be read hurriedly, but contains liturgies and prayers, the sample of which I had seen previously were outstanding.  I plan for this book to become a staple of my prayer and intercession life."
Beautifully written but arrived damaged. I will update review once/if seller responds. UPDATE - seller was very responsive and sent me a replacement book right away. Excellent customer service!
"This book was inspirational and blew the lid off my prayer routine! Thoughtful, well written, well thought out, and inspiring. Only wish I had known about this 20 years ago."
"I am enjoying this book. There is a richness and depth to it. Not every prayer applies to my life perfectly, but in each prayer's wording I find rich content that I can apply to my own life."
"Love this book, makes me stop and appreciate all the wonderful things God has given to us! I enjoy it every time I pick it up and read it‚ù§Ô∏è"
So good! Love these scripted prayers for lots of areas of life that you may be going through! Highly recommend. Love the size of this one too
"This book is filled with beautiful liturgies that make one pause and see the joy and beauty God surrounds us with in our work, our world, and our relationships."
"The content on this is five stars, the book itself is great. Taking off one star due to what seems to be shoddy construction of the book itself. In less than a month, the front and back covers both separated from the main body of pages."
"I didn't know I wanted this, but after hearing my wife talk about it, I picked it up. It's encouraging, convicting, and at the same time, comforting. It's a humble reminder of how we should walk through life."
This was a gift (after I had already ordered one for myself and loved it ). I was disappointed that I could not include a message to the receiver
Beautiful prayers for all types of occasions! I've been sharing this with all my family members and it has brought such a richness to my prayer life.
This book is salve to a soul. I don't know how to put into words how grateful I am for the quality and beauty of liturgies within it's pages. A staple for every home.
"Love this book, both the content and the design. Though it is technically a paperback, it's more like a flexible faux leather feel...much better than a regular paperback cover. Not ""pocket-sized"" but not too big either."
This book has continued to bless me and my finances life. The way that they author creates images in your head and crafts words so perfectly together has helped me to verbalize emotions that I have had for years but have struggled to put into words to God. If I was financially able I would be buying one of these for every single person I know. This has changed my prayer life.
"Really love the liturgical dynamic of this book, and how there‚Äôs a prayer for literally anything and everything. Very impressed!"
"I wish I had bought this somewhere else.  Amazon put a gummy, sticky barcode sticker ON THE COVER.  Had to spend some time with goo gone to remove all the nasty glue.  Why couldn't you put this book in a plastic bag?  Amazon what were you thinking?"
Beautifully written - the words speak to me
Beautiful book and rich in prayers and liturgies to honor ‚Äúevery moment.‚Äù
I purchased this as a housewarming gift for a friend. I think it'd also make a great wedding gift. A beautiful book that would be great on a coffee table full of wonderful prayers and blessings.
"An amazing guide that has strengthened my prayer life. Small, seemingly insignificant things like lawn maintenance and hosting events now have a greater God-centered meaning!"
"Just what she wanted, she picked it out"
"Absolutely stunning. This book guides its reader into worship even in the seemingly mundane acts of life, and graciously helps us pray for others in a deeper and loving way."
This is a wonderful book. The liturgies are thoughtful and deep. I purchased this as a wedding gift. Beautifully bound. Quality in materials and content.
"My wife uses this more than I do. It is such a beautiful book. The liturgies are so good and well written, my wife shares them with me and it is so good to talk through. Great perspectives on how to glorify God throughout every moment. We have bought this book 3 times now as presents because of how great this book is."
So thankful for these inspired prayers at a time when I cannot voice my own
"This lovely collection affirms that daily life contains  blessings we often overlook.  In a busy, chaotic and argumentative world, I find that each page contains an elementary nugget of Truth: walking in the Holy Spirit is lifegiving."
"I prefer praying without a prayer book, but this one gives me words when I have none. There are several I go to repeatedly, and they comfort me deeply."
"Prayers to encourage mindfulness in all activities, in every moment of every day."
I really enjoy this book and recommend it highly. The liturgies are deep and refreshing!
Precious book... wonderful adjunct to personal devotion.
Present for myself
I love this collection. It helps to provide a higher perspective on daily routine. It teaches a way to exalt and worship God through tough times and times of joy. It changes the mundane into the miraculous.
Liturgies for everyday moments. A wonderful way to see God in all aspects of life.
"Stunning. From the pages to the words, this book is infused with beauty.It also makes for a great gift!"
I heard a portion of this book read on a womens retreat and was touched by the words that I had to get it for myself.  Love the simplicity that the author bring s to approaching God in prayer.
So treasure this book of prayers for every and all situations. This makes a great gift!
I read & pray from this book everyday! Incredible how much truth is spoken from this book!
A beautiful treasure of a gift!
This was a Mother‚Äôs Day gift. It is now a treasured book.
"We moved, and I gave a copy to our pastor and a copy to the couple who let us live with them until the actual move occurred. The book is finding refreshment in the everyday-ness of life!"
"Beautifully bound! So excited, I bought a copy for my mom!"
"This book is like rich, spiritual chocolate. These prayers are sometimes the words my heart wants to say but doesn‚Äôt know how.I intend to give this beautiful book as a gift to friends who are celebrating and also friends who are mourning. Such a helpful resource for prayer and worship."
This has been so helpful in our family‚Äôs daily devotions. Beautiful and thought provoking and theological sound liturgy.
"It reads so similar to the Psalms. Loved the practical 'prayers' for daily living from the task of laundry, times of struggle  to wedding prayers.  Makes an excellent gift too."
This book has a liturgy for anyone and anything. Great book.
One of my most treasured books. A must have
Wonderful way to orient my thinking!
Such wonderful Godward prayers. Beautiful wording and beautiful illustrations.
"Love, love, love this book. I bought one for every member of our Community Group. The author puts a new light on realizing that all of life can be seen through spiritual eyes."
Beautiful honest writing! Purchased one for myself and will keep buying for friends
Truth
What a beautiful book! Love the artwork and the crafted words.
"Amazing!!! I truly read this book every day. The words in my opinion are inspired by God! Beautiful, wonderful prayers that I plan to incorporate in my spiritual life for the rest of my life!"
"Beautiful leather bound book. The liturgy within this book is perfect for ""every moment."" We both two and gave one as a gift."
I love this prayer book. Prayers for so many occasions.
Great work for everyday use.
"These are some.of the most beautiful and relevant liturgies I have ever read!! Buy this book, and actually read it!"
Great addition to your daily Bible reading. Great stuff to mediate on :)
"Cute smaller size, great read"
Very beautiful book!
"Beautiful, precious book."
Wonderful book! Beautiful
Beautiful and so relatable and encouraging.
Love having this book on hand for a prayer or thought in addition to my Bible.
This is a prayer book everyone should have
Excellent quality!
Great book.
Wonderful liturgies for everyday living. A fantastic resource for our family.
Beautiful liturgies!
Exactly what I wanted. And it‚Äôs beautiful.
"No matter what task you are tackling on a given day, this book of liturgies has you covered in the most powerful and prayerful way."
This is ‚Äúvolume 1‚Äù and not the exact thing that‚Äôs been shown in pictures.
Beautifully done inside and out.
Such a beautiful book.
Love this book! Going to buy several to give as gifts!
"Loved it, ordered extra to give as gifts"
Excellent Book
"The first time i sat down to read through this book i had already experienced a few of the liturgies online or in gatherings, so i thought i knew what i was getting myself into: A useful book of prayers written by a poet who loves community. And that expectation held, but it turns out that it did not fully prepare me for what i'd find when i read the book cover to cover. The liturgies are profoundly Trinitarian and Gospel-oriented; they're poetic and human, and they cover EVERYTHING. We now have a saying in our community: ""There's a liturgy for that."" (Because chances are, there is.) Every so often one of us wishes for a liturgy not in this book, and when that happens often someone will take a stab at writing it themselves. This is a book that not only gives us words when we have none of our own, but teaches us how to see and feel the need for such words, and calls words out of us for one another. It's been forming us as a community. Both in what it includes and what it leaves for us to fill in, it really is the work of the people."
"I‚Äôm a reader. And a writer. There is much to glean from both perspectives in Every Moment Holy. The title alone is a reminder to live fully, joyfully exploring every mood, occasion, and circumstance of your own very precious life. I take the book with me often - whether down by the lake, or when we travel - in case it contains a liturgy for my own experiences. By the beach, when I start a new book, or pour that first cup of coffee. It‚Äôs the priciest book I‚Äôve ever purchased, but one I‚Äôll still have by my side when they close my eyelids for the last time."
"Wonderful! From the design and quality to the content inside. Wonderful is how I would describe it. If your prayer life stagnant (or non existent) then get this book. This will help teach you how you can take life‚Äôs moments (from major to mundane) and lift them up in prayer.I‚Äôm reminded of this story: John Newton (writer of the song Amazing Grace) would meet monthly with other pastors and theologians to discuss a theological issue in depth. One of their meetings they were discussing the question what does it mean to pray without ceasing. After some time they hadn‚Äôt come to a satisfactory answer, so one of the pastors casually asked the maid who came in to serve them food if she knew what Paul meant. And her response was:""Of course, it's quite simple sir. When I get dressed in the morning, I ask God to clothe me with righteousness. And when I serve you bread, I ask that Jesus might be my Bread of Life. When I dust the furniture I ask that the filth might be taken out of my heart, and when I set your drink before you, I ask that Jesus might be the Water of Life. I just kind of pray my way through the day like that.""This book, Every Moment Holy, helps teach you how to do exactly that. From praying for those who are sick, to a prayer for when you move into a new home, to a prayer for when you go on vacation, to a prayer for enjoying a meal with friends, to a prayer for when you experience road rage."
"The best way I could describe Every Moment Holy is an inspiring and quirky little prayer guide. It‚Äôs a collection of liturgies for the random, for the mundane, for the special, and for the sacred events in life. There‚Äôs a prayer for doing laundry, for starting the first fire of the season, or for the keeping of bees (yes, that‚Äôs right‚Äîa prayer for bee keepers!). There are really beautiful prayers for seeking forgiveness or petitions for healing and comfort. There‚Äôs one to pray before taking the stage at the theater or after finishing a good book. There are appeals for each day of the week and ones specifically for morning, noon and night. One of my favorites, ‚ÄúFor Those Flooded By Too Much Information,‚Äù is obviously relevant. There‚Äôs even one titled ‚ÄúFor the Morning of a Yard Sale‚Äù‚Äîthis one also came in handy recently.Some Christians cast a wary eye on the ‚Äúhigh church‚Äù practice of the liturgy. I can understand that. I grew up this way. It‚Äôs often associated with something rigid and dead‚Äîsomething that lacks vibrancy and becomes that hated word of Protestants, ‚Äúreligious.‚Äù Yet anything can become ritualistic. Anything mechanical. And anything, when approached with a soft heart and pure motives, can be a pleasing supplication to God. The thing I really like about Every Moment Holy is that, like the title notes, it illustrates every act we commit‚Äînot just the ones we designate as having special meaning and significance‚Äîcan be a holy act to God. I highly recommend this unique and creative little book."
"A great book of liturgies for everyday events that shows out how purposeful our lives are by these lovely prayers. McKelvey's prayers are thoughtful, biblical, challenging, and encouraging.  His prose is poetic enough to quicken the heart but plain enough to be everyday.  Ned Bustard's art is playful at times all while keeping the serious tone of making the common holy.  You should purchase it.The topics are varied and wonderfulFrom the more formal ""For feasting with friends""To the short ""Moment when feeling frustration toward child""There are even two for changing diapers.  Good stuff.Design wise, the book is a hardback with a smooth tru-tone binding.  It has one big red ribbon to mark your place.  The page-setting is gorgeous.  Plenty of space to let the text breathe.  It's meant to be used for a long time."
"The depth and breadth of the prayers in this gorgeously written, beautifully illustrated, and elegantly bound book are applicable to the entire spectrum of life experiences. My favorites are Feasting with Friends, Moment of Frustration with a Child, The Husband & Wife liturgies for morning and evening, and the prayer for battling a destructive desire (my dieting prayer). This book makes a fabulous gift, since it has an inspiring liturgy for almost any celebration or need: the friend who is moving, hospitalized, struggling with depression, the avid gardener or beekeeper, new parent, person who has suffered loss, struggles with nightmares, the list goes on. I have given 8 copies away since its release last fall, with the ribbon bookmark marking the prayer that applies to the reason for the gifting. Everyone loves this book. Can‚Äôt recommend it highly enough."
